<abstract>
<p>The ventral striatum (VS) is a central node within a distributed network that controls appetitive behavior, and neuromodulation of the VS has demonstrated therapeutic potential for appetitive disorders. Local field potential (LFP) oscillations recorded from deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes within the VS are a pragmatic source of neural systems-level information about appetitive behavior that could be used in responsive neuromodulation systems. Here, we recorded LFPs from the bilateral nucleus accumbens core and shell (subregions of the VS) during limited access to palatable food across varying conditions of hunger and food palatability in male rats. We used standard statistical methods (logistic regression) as well as the machine learning algorithm lasso to predict aspects of feeding behavior using VS LFPs. We were able to predict the amount of food eaten, the increase in consumption following food deprivation, and the type of food eaten. Further, we were able to predict whether the initiation of feeding was imminent up to 42.5 seconds before feeding began and classify current behavior as either feeding or not-feeding. In classifying feeding behavior, we found an optimal balance between model complexity and performance with models using 3 LFP features primarily from the alpha and high gamma frequencies. As shown here, unbiased methods can identify systems-level neural activity linked to domains of mental illness with potential application to the development and personalization of novel treatments.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>As neuropsychiatry begins to leverage the power of computational methods to understand disease states and to develop better therapies, it is vital that we acknowledge the trade-offs between model complexity and performance. We show that computational methods can elucidate a neural signature of feeding behavior and we show how these methods could be used to discover neural patterns related to other behaviors and reveal new potential therapeutic targets. Further, our results help to contextualize both the limitations and potential of applying computational methods to neuropsychiatry by showing how changing the data being used to train predictive models (e.g., population vs. individual data) can have a large impact on how model performance generalizes across time, internal states, and individuals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The VS is a central node in the brain circuits influencing goal-directed and habitual behaviors with subregions like the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core and shell that mediate information between cognitive control regions of the prefrontal cortex and regions of learning and memory in the amygdala, hippocampus, and the ventral tegmental area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref003">3</xref>]. As regions of convergence within the mesolimbic pathway, the NAc core and shell have been targeted by neuromodulation-based treatments for appetitive disorders including substance use disorders, eating disorders, and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref006">6</xref>]. Targeting the VS for eating disorders and obesity is supported by the known connectivity of the NAc with energy homeostasis circuits within the hypothalamus and brain stem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref008">8</xref>] and the role of an-/orexigenic states modulating VS activity through central and peripheral ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref012">12</xref>]. In both preclinical and clinical investigations DBS targeting these subregions has altered appetitive behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref016">16</xref>], but variable treatment outcomes combined with the known risks of DBS have limited more widespread use. In other neuropsychiatric conditions, DBS outcomes have been improved and side-effects limited by using relevant neural activity to trigger stimulation, closed-loop DBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref019">19</xref>], or modify stimulation parameters, adaptive DBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref020">20</xref>]. However, a source of neural activity that contains information relevant to appetitive behaviors is needed to apply these advanced DBS approaches to appetitive disorders.</p>
<p>Local field potential (LFP) oscillations recorded from DBS electrodes are a promising source of neural systems-level information and VS oscillations could contain information about appetitive behavior. Although there has been evidence that high frequency components of NAc LFPs could be generated within the piriform cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref021">21</xref>] the entrainment of single-unit firing to LFPs in the NAc suggests that VS LFPs are, at a minimum, a reflection of local striatal processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref024">24</xref>]. Therefore, it is likely that LFPs recorded from the NAc contain information pertaining to motivated behaviors.</p>
<p>Although a wealth of information likely exists within VS LFPs about appetitive behaviors like binge eating, it is important to determine how much information is needed to decode these behaviors and to determine what the trade-offs are between model performance and model simplicity. The model used by Wu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref019">19</xref>] took advantage of changes in delta power during the beginning of feeding in mice to trigger closed-loop DBS and reduced binge size. This is a good example of a low complexity population-based model (1 LFP feature trained from 6 animals) maximizing simplicity at the expense of performance (69% sensitivity and 64% specificity). Our work examined how altering model complexity changes performance in classifying feeding behavior in a rat model of binge eating. Here, we used unbiased statistical and machine learning approaches to predict imminent binge eating epochs and classify concurrent behavior using LFP recordings from bilateral NAc core and shell. Further, we used a machine learning approach to determine if VS oscillations recorded during binge eating sessions contained information that could predict the quantity of food consumed, the increase in binge size following food deprivation, and the type of food consumed (low vs. high palatability). Primarily, this work characterizes how different sets of training data (complex vs. simple; individualized vs. population-based) can affect the performance of models across individuals, time, and internal conditions. Although shown here in a rat model of binge eating, we expect these relationships to generalize to other appetitive behaviors and neuropsychiatric disorders, thus providing a framework for the development of more effective closed-loop algorithms and adaptive neuromodulation-based treatments.</p>

<p>All experiments were carried out in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publications no. 80–23) revised in 1996 and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Dartmouth College. CO<sub>2</sub> gas was used for euthanasia followed by a secondary thoracic puncture.

<title>Experimental design</title>
<p>Male Sprague-Dawley rats (<italic>n</italic> = 12) were purchased from Charles River (Shrewsbury, MA) at 60 days of age were individually housed using a reverse 12-hour light/dark schedule with house chow and water available <italic>ad libitum</italic>.</p>
<p>All animals were implanted with electrode arrays and were conditioned to binge eat using limited access to palatable food (1 month). Following completion of a DBS intervention published separately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref025">25</xref>] and a 2 week washout period, rats re-established a baseline of binge-like feeding. Once a stable baseline was established, baseline binge sessions (Base) were recorded (LFP and video). Binge sessions were also recorded following 24- and 48-hour food deprivation (Dep24 and Dep48) with intervening periods (at least 24 hours) of <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to house chow. Animals were also deprived of food for 24 hours before recording a 2-hour house chow session (Chow) to ensure that the animals consumed enough food to provide a comparable amount of LFP data during feeding to the three sessions with access to the high-fat/high-sugar diet (See General methods: Surgery and binge eating).</p>
<p>These paired LFP and video recordings were used to address two types of questions: 1) <bold>Whole session</bold> questions—can VS activity averaged over an entire session be used to predict behavioral outcomes from that session (e.g., predict calories consumed)?; and 2) <bold>Within session</bold> questions—can VS activity be used to classify behavior as it occurs or to predict if it is about to occur? These two types of questions were assessed using tailored analysis approaches that have different sample size considerations and will be described in the corresponding subsections of Statistical analysis.</p>

<p>Following habituation to the animal facility, rats were anesthetized with isoflourane/oxygen (5% isoflourane for induction and 2% for maintenance) and underwent stereotaxic implantation with a custom electrode array with single wires targeting both the NAc core and shell bilaterally: 1.6 mm anterior; ±1 and 2.5 mm lateral; and 7.6 mm ventral to bregma. Following recovery from surgery (~1 week), rats began a well described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref028">28</xref>] schedule of limited access to a palatable high-fat/high-sugar diet (sweet-fat food), which contained 4.6 kcal/g and 19% protein, 36.2% carbohydrates, and 44.8% fat by calories (Teklad Diets 06415, South Easton, MA). The sweet-fat food was provided to the rats in addition to house chow and water within stimulation chambers for 2-hour sessions with 4–5 sessions irregularly spaced per week.</p>

<title>Behavioral measures</title>
<p>The food was weighed before and after all recording sessions to calculate the amount of food consumed during the session; weight was converted to kilocalories to allow direct comparison between food types (sweet-fat food vs. house chow). Session videos were manually scored for feeding, approach (movement towards food), and rest intervals. Timestamps were normalized by session length in order to compare feeding dynamics across sessions of unequal length (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006838.s001">S1 Text</xref>: Supplemental Methods: Behavioral measures).</p>

<title>Statistical analysis—Whole session</title>
<p>To determine how much of the individual heterogeneity in feeding behavior could be predicted from VS activity, the values of each LFP feature were averaged across all bins according to behavioral scoring (i.e., feeding vs. resting) from a given session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006838.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). To compare across animals and to account for day-to-day variation in signal, the LFP features were normalized by subtracting the average feeding value from the average rest value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006838.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). These rest-normalized LFP features were then used to predict behavioral variables (baseline food intake and food type). To predict the change in consumption with food deprivation—from Base to Dep24 or Dep48 session—the difference between the rest-normalized values of the two sessions were used as predictor variables (e.g., Base [feeding-rest]—Dep24 [feeding-rest]). Although there were only 12 animals, by using up to two recordings per animal sample sizes were able to be increased (<italic>n</italic> = 24 for both baseline food intake and change in consumption with food deprivation; <italic>n</italic> = 21 for food type, one animal didn’t have any house chow sessions and another only had one); however, lasso is specifically for regressions in which p &gt;&gt; n and thus these samples sizes only limited the number of folds used in cross-validation.</p>

<title>Relating model complexity to performance</title>
<p>The complexity of models used to differentiate brain activity during feeding from brain activity during not-feeding was adjusted across three domains: 1. the number of individual animals included; 2. the number of LFP features included; and 3. the number of conditions represented (Base, Dep24, Dep48, and Chow). Two-sample t-tests were used to compare the performance between models with different manipulations of the following domains followed by the Bonferroni correction.</p>
<p><underline>1. Individuals</underline>: To determine how many individual animals were required to create a population-based model that could generalize across animals, all permutations from 1/12 to 11/12 animals were used to train models. Population models (&gt;1 animal used to train the model) were tested on the data of left-out animal(s) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006838.s001">S1 Text</xref>: Supplemental Methods: Complexity vs. performance).</p>
<p><underline>2. LFP Features</underline>: The performance of the logistic model built from all LFP features was considered the “gold standard” for determining how many features were required to create a model that was stable across individuals and conditions. The lasso algorithm reduced the number of features used to ~40. To test the lower bounds of simplicity, the performance of logistic models built from all possible permutations of up to three features: 58 monads, 1,653 dyads, and 30,856 triads. “Top-tier” models were those with performances not significantly different from the best performing model within each group as assessed using two-sample t-tests followed by the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (i.e., top-tier monad models were monad models that did not perform significantly worse than the best monad model).</p>
<p><underline>3. Conditions</underline>: Models were trained using data from either just baseline or all four conditions, but in both cases more bins were used than needed to achieve stable model performance as determined by learning curves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006838.s003">S2 Fig</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006838.s001">S1 Text</xref>: Supplemental Methods: Complexity vs. performance).</p>

These models were not merely detecting approach behavior since only one third of the pre-feeding bins had any overlap with approach behavior and none of the bins more than 12.5 seconds before feeding overlapped with approach while the model was still able to differentiate beyond 12.5 seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006838.g002">Fig 2D</xref>).</p>

<title>Manipulation of the number of animals in population-based models</title>
<p>Population-based models built from and tested on data from all animals was able distinguish brain activity during feeding from not-feeding better than would be expected by chance alone (AUC = 0.87±0.01; <italic>d</italic> = 3.27; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006838.g003">Fig 3Bi</xref>).

However, it is conceivable that because the left-out 20% came from the same recordings as the 80% used for training, these models could be slightly overfit. To account for this, a leave-one-out (LOO) approach was used by leaving an entire animal out of the model building to be used as the test-set. As expected, the performance of LOO models decreased significantly (t(258) = 2.96 p = .003, two-sample t-test), but they still outperformed the by-chance permuted models (AUC = 0.78±0.06; <italic>d</italic> = 3.13; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006838.g003">Fig 3Bi</xref>).

To test this, individualized models were built using 80% of a single animal’s data and then tested on that animal’s left-out 20%.

When classifying baseline feeding vs. not-feeding, the best models built from a single feature performed better than chance and although increasing the number of features used to two or three increased performance, these simple models never achieved the performance of either the lasso (~40 features) or full logistic (58 features) model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006838.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).

<title>Manipulation of the number of LFP features used to build models across conditions</title>
<p>Finally, the above findings were integrated by determining the minimal number of LFP features required in an individualized model built from all conditions to match the performance of the corresponding, “gold standard”, logistic model using all 58 LFP features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006838.g006">Fig 6</xref> Inset).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we show that VS oscillations can be decoded and used to predict aspects of feeding behavior such as the amount and type of food consumed. Further, these oscillations can be used in real-time to predict imminent or current feeding in a rat model of binge eating, regardless of varying hunger levels and food palatability. By manipulating the complexity of the training data used and then assessing how these manipulations affect model performance, this work creates a theoretical framework to guide the implementation of predictive algorithms used in closed-loop and adaptive neuromodulation systems. Specifically, this work suggests that devices could be pre-loaded with a model built from a group of individuals using a handful of oscillatory features and have fair performance when applied to individuals outside of the training group. However, to achieve optimal performance in a specific individual, personalized models using neural data from that individual acquired over time would be needed.</p>
<sec id="sec030">
<title>Predicting amount of food consumed and food type from VS oscillations</title>
<p>The binge eating model used in this study resulted in variation in food intake between individuals (as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref030">30</xref>]) and also in the increased intake following food deprivation. That this variation could be partially predicted using LFP features from the VS is not surprising given the connectivity of these VS regions (e.g., nucleus accumbens) to the distributed feeding network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref032">32</xref>]. Further, it is feasible that information about the type of food consumed (low vs. high palatability) could also be extracted from VS oscillations given that the NAc is implicated in the hedonic reactivity towards food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref034">34</xref>] and in processing nutritive/caloric value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref035">35</xref>].</p>

<sec id="sec031">
<title>Population-based vs. individualized models</title>
<p>The presented data suggest that models classifying feeding behavior perform best when they are built and tested within a given individual and condition, otherwise performance drops when these individualized models are tested in other conditions—even if within the same animal. However, this drop can be mitigated in two ways: 1. use data from multiple conditions within an individual; or 2. use data from multiple individuals within a condition (or from multiple conditions). Following either of these strategies will increase the probability of selecting and properly weighting LFP features that generalize across animals and conditions. Clinically, it is important that models are able to perform well across a heterogeneous population as well as across the variable conditions through which individuals will transition over time. Therefore, when building models for use in algorithms that control closed-loop or adaptive neuromodulation systems it will be vital to consider these strategies.</p>

<title>Machine learning and DBS</title>
<p>Recently, there has been increasing interest in applying machine learning and other computational methods to guide the selection and implementation of psychiatric treatments. This work can be categorized into three domains: 1. predicting treatment outcomes; 2. defining treatment parameters; and 3. actively optimizing treatment through time. Treatment outcomes have been successfully predicted using both structural and functional connectivity measures in Parkinsonian patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref036">36</xref>] as well as using LFPs in a rodent model of binge eating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref025">25</xref>]. In a high throughput manner, machine learning has also been used to optimize combinations of DBS parameters and medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref037">37</xref>] and to determine which DBS parameters lead to desired changes in brain activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref038">38</xref>]. Last, there is a push towards the development of neuromodulation systems that use machine learning to monitor stimulation evoked dopamine signaling and adjusting stimulation parameters to optimize treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref039">39</xref>] or to determine the time and brain state during which stimulation has the largest effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref040">40</xref>]. With the exception of Kumar et al.’s work, all of these implementations of machine learning used population-based datasets (i.e. data pooled across subjects). For some predictions—e.g., optimizing stimulation target—using individual datasets is impractical; however, when tuning stimulation parameters or trying to determine effective stimulation timing our work suggests individualized data will produce the best models if that data is sampled from across time and, ideally, across varying conditions (e.g., stress/anxiety, mood, hunger, etc.).</p>

<title>Number of predictors required for stable performance</title>
<p>This work highlights an important trade-off between the number of features used to build a model and that model’s performance across individuals and conditions. Our results suggest that single feature models are unlikely to perform with enough accuracy to be clinically useful. However, a relatively simple model (~3 features) can approach the performance and stability of complex models (58 features); although these exact numbers may vary when predicting different behaviors/symptoms, this work suggests that simpler models can contain enough information pertaining to a given behavior/symptom with the benefit of limiting the computational and power requirements.</p>

<sec id="sec034">
<title>A predictable pattern of brain activity precedes feeding initiation</title>
<p>As shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006838.g002">Fig 2</xref>), VS oscillations can differentiate times when an animal is about to feed (≤45 seconds before feeding begins) from not-feeding. Interestingly, models built to classify feeding were also able to classify pre-feeding—even slightly outperforming pre-feeding models. This was because although many of the same LFP features were used in both models, the features are more clearly delineated (i.e., higher signal to noise ratio) between feeding and not-feeding, likely representing a “ramping” of LFP features as feeding begins.</p>
<p>When this hypothesis was examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006838.g002">Fig 2E and 2F</xref>), a ramping phenomenon was observed in features that more successfully classified pre-feeding bins when trained on feeding vs. not-feeding data. For example, NAc shell left high gamma power begins to increase to its feeding level before feeding begins, stabilizes during feeding, then drops back to not-feeding levels as feeding ends. In other features there is decreased variance during feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006838.g002">Fig 2–2</xref>), mirroring a widespread pattern seen cortically in response to obtaining rewards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref041">41</xref>], as a marker of stimulus perception/detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref043">43</xref>], and has been correlated with performance on visual discrimination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref045">45</xref>] and motor preparation/initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref047">47</xref>]. Visualizing several of these LFP features over time makes it clear that they develop over different timescales, likely underpinning the accuracy of predicting imminent feeding increasing closer to the start of feeding as more features have diverged from their not-feeding levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006838.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec035">
<title>Confounds and noise</title>
<p>Given that motor preparation and initiation manifest as decreased neural variability it is possible that the models predicting imminent feeding were merely detecting the motor activity of approaching the food. However, by 12.5 seconds before feeding none of the data used for model building contained approach behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006838.g002">Fig 2D</xref>) and the models were able to classify pre-feeding brain activity out to 42 seconds before feeding without a corresponding drop in performance at 12.5 seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006838.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). When models were built using feeding data—with no approach behavior—performance was actually slightly better at classifying pre-feeding. Together these results suggest that although approach behavior may also exhibit a detectable change in LFPs, this change is not a primary source of information for our models.</p>
<p>An additional concern is that without electromyography of the masseters we are unable to completely remove the possibility of chewing noise influencing models built from feeding data. However, if the feeding vs. not-feeding models were chewing detectors, then the models should only be able to detect behaviors with chewing noise. Instead the feeding models were also able to classify pre-feeding activity which is devoid of chewing noise.</p>
<p>Finally, we know from histology that all of our electrodes were in the structures targeted, but it is likely that variations in the neuronal architecture of these structures across animals and variations in the exact stereotactic localization of electrodes within these structures exists. For generalized models we are able to mitigate the potential effects due to electrode localization by randomly determining which animals were used to train the models. Yet, it is possible that the reason why individualized models tend to do best is because of differences in electrode position and it is also possible that the variance in a given animal’s model being successful in predicting the other animals’ behavior is explained by the variance in electrode localization. In terms of clinical application, it is not practical to expect electrodes to share exact stereotactic coordinates and even if they did, the neuronal architecture the electrode is within will likely vary between patients. Therefore, it is important that we consider the implications of datasets that include the variations likely to be seen in clinical datasets when trying to determine the balance between model complexity and performance.</p>

<title>VS oscillations as a source of information for closed-loop and adaptive neuromodulation</title>
<p>Appetitive disorders like binge eating disorder have been associated with dysregulation of the mesolimbic pathway which includes the VS. Understanding the nature of network pathology is critical to the development of treatments that can therapeutically alter network activity, ameliorating the problematic behavior/symptom. Neuromodulation-based interventions that use network activity to trigger stimulation and modify parameters have proven effective in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref020">20</xref>]. DBS for epilepsy has incorporated electrodes in order to detect pre-seizure electrophysiologic activity and use stimulation to prevent seizure generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref017">17</xref>]. Future treatments of appetitive disorders could similarly utilize meaningful electrophysiology features in order to provide feedback to optimize treatment efficacy and limit the side effect profile. A recent study demonstrated the theoretical feasibility of using a closed-loop system to trigger stimulation and decrease binge size in a mouse model of binge eating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006838.ref019">19</xref>]. As noted in the introduction, the model used had limited performance, likely due to only using a single LFP feature, but the success of the intervention highlights another point to consider when determining model complexity vs. model performance tradeoffs: what model performance is required to meaningfully impact the outcome of interest?</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Ventral striatal oscillations can predict feeding behavior during sessions of limited access to palatable food in rats. Similar unbiased computational methods will continue to identify new systems-level neural markers and produce models capable of predicting behaviors that are relevant to an array of neuropsychiatric conditions.</p>
