<abstract>
<p>Microglia are central nervous system (CNS)-resident cells. Their ability to migrate outside of the CNS, however, is not understood. Using time-lapse imaging in an obstetrical brachial plexus injury (OBPI) model, we show that microglia squeeze through the spinal boundary and emigrate to peripheral spinal roots. Although both macrophages and microglia respond, microglia are the debris-clearing cell. Once outside the CNS, microglia re-enter the spinal cord in an altered state. These peripheral nervous system (PNS)-experienced microglia can travel to distal CNS areas from the injury site, including the brain, with debris. This emigration is balanced by two mechanisms—induced emigration via <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) dependence and restriction via contact-dependent cellular repulsion with macrophages. These discoveries open the possibility that microglia can migrate outside of their textbook-defined regions in disease states.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Cells are precisely organized in specific anatomical domains to ensure normal functioning of the nervous system. One such cell type, microglia, is usually considered to be confined to the central nervous system (CNS). Using time-lapse imaging to capture microglia as they migrate, we show that their characteristic CNS-residency can be altered after spinal root injury. After such injury, the microglia exit the spinal root to the periphery, where they clear debris at the injury site and then carry that debris back into the CNS. In addition, microglia that leave the CNS after spinal root injury become distinct from those that remain within the CNS. This emigration event of microglia after injury is driven by two mechanisms—dependence on glutamatergic signaling that induces their emigration to the injury and interactions with macrophages that prevent their ectopic exit from the spinal cord. Together, these discoveries raise the possibility that microglia could override their CNS-residency in certain disease contexts.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Microglia are the surveying phagocytic cells of the central nervous system (CNS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref003">3</xref>]. They enter the CNS during embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref005">5</xref>]. Once in the CNS, their roles include a growing list of functions, including synaptic pruning and clearance of debris from both developmental and injured cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref009">9</xref>]. During these processes, microglia transition from a surveying to activated state, leading to increased cellular migration and phagocytic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref012">12</xref>]. This microglia activation can have lasting impacts on the nervous system. For example, pollutants in pregnant mice can lead to altered microglia in their progeny; such embryonic changes are implicated to autism-like phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref013">13</xref>]. Meanwhile, activation after spinal cord injury is linked to neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref014">14</xref>]. Despite these growing contributions of microglia to the CNS, little is known about their role outside of the CNS domain.</p>
<p>There is growing evidence that cells can override their domain-specific nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref018">18</xref>]. CNS-resident cells like oligodendrocytes can reside in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) in peripheral neuropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref015">15</xref>]. Similarly, both oligodendrocytes and astrocytes can populate the PNS when boundary cells are disrupted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref018">18</xref>]. These ectopically localized CNS cells migrate to the PNS from the CNS instead of differentiating from resident PNS cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref017">17</xref>]. Despite these examples of CNS cell intrusion, microglial emigration to the PNS is not understood. In each example of ectopic CNS cell residence, the ability of the emigrated cells to return to their respective domains is not known. Given the highly migratory nature of microglia, their emerging roles in circuit formation and maintenance in both healthy and disease states and their inclusions in disorders such as autism, spinal cord injury, neuropathic pain, and multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref013">13</xref>], it is imperative to investigate not only the full capacity of microglia to migrate to specific domains but the consequence of such movements. Complicating this issue, microglia and macrophages are labeled with similar molecular markers and when located outside of their resident domain, can express the limited number of specific markers that label either microglia or macrophages.</p>
<p>Here, we exploit time-lapse imaging of zebrafish in a laser-induced model of obstetrical brachial plexus injury (OBPI) to dissect the capacity of microglia in the PNS. Spinal root avulsion can occur developmentally during the birth process; OBPI is a complication in an estimated 3 out of every 1,000 births [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref019">19</xref>]. We first demonstrate that <italic>pu1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cells display stable residency in distinct CNS and PNS domains at 4 days post fertilization (dpf) in zebrafish, a time comparable to when OBPI occurs. We then show that CNS-resident microglia exit their domain to clear PNS debris in these injuries. Despite that both macrophages and microglia respond to these injuries, microglia function as the debris-clearing cell in both the PNS and CNS. This emigration to the PNS alters the microglia as they re-enter the CNS and migrate to distal areas from the injury site, including the brain. We show that the exit of microglia to the PNS is mediated by opposing mechanisms; <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and glutamate induce emigration, whereas contact-dependent repulsion prevents intrusion. The observation that contact-dependent interactions of microglia with macrophages impact the cells’ anatomical position could provide insight into pathologies of diseases that contain both macrophages and microglia in the same domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref020">20</xref>]. Together, these data provide evidence that microglia function expands beyond their textbook-defined CNS-resident domain.</p>

<title>Laser-induced injury model mimics OBPI</title>
<p>To model obstetrical root avulsion, we created injuries in 4 dpf zebrafish. At 4 dpf, zebrafish have an established anatomical organization of neurons in the brain and spinal cord but myelination is ongoing, similar to newborn children (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Cells that compose the spinal sensory root are organized by 2–3 dpf, before our avulsion model at 4 dpf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref022">22</xref>]. These injuries were created by exposing a 4 μm region of the spinal cord sensory root nerve to pulses of a laser in <italic>Tg(ngn1</italic>:<italic>gfp)</italic> zebrafish, which use regulatory sequences of <italic>ngn1</italic> to express green fluorescent protein (GFP) in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref023">23</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s024">S1 Movie</xref>). To confirm that the laser induced root avulsion, we first created intensity surface plots along DRG projections and measured an absence of intensity in the afferent projection specifically where the laser was exposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s003">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>). The absence of signal was initially restricted to a small region until the axonal region degraded, leaving a DRG cell soma without a central projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). This decrease was specific to the lesion site, persisted for hours, and was not created when the peripheral projection was injured (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s003">S1C and S1D Fig</xref>). In this avulsion model, as with obstetrical avulsions, we created injuries of varying severity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s004">S2A–S2D Fig</xref>). We also fixed and stained <italic>Tg(ngn1</italic>:<italic>gfp)</italic> animals at 4 dpf with anti-Sox10 and anti-GFAP post-avulsion to assess the integrity of the GFAP<sup>+</sup> glial limitans and Sox10<sup>+</sup> Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes in each injury category immediately following injury (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s005">S3A Fig</xref>). Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) fluorescently labels the glial limitans, or the radial glial boundary. DRG cell bodies and supporting <italic>Sox10</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cell nuclei were present and intact in uninjured animals and category I and II injuries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s005">S3A Fig</xref>). The <italic>GFAP</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> boundary was disrupted in category III injuries with little damage in category I–II (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s005">S3B–S3E Fig</xref>). These data recapitulate characteristics of spinal avulsion with varying degrees of severity but demonstrate that category I and II injuries lack massive damage of the spinal interface.</p>

<title>Microglia in the spinal cord respond to OBPI</title>
<p>In movies of these injuries, we noted that neural debris of both glial and neuronal identity was present in both CNS and PNS regions. To investigate debris clearance, we visualized phagocytic cells in response to injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref024">24</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s025">S2 Movie</xref>). To do this, we imaged <italic>Tg(pu1</italic>:<italic>gfp); Tg(sox10</italic>:<italic>mrfp)</italic> animals, which use regulatory sequences of <italic>pu1</italic> to express GFP in microglial and macrophages and <italic>sox10</italic> to label glial and neuronal cells of sensory and spinal nerves with mRFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref026">26</xref>]. With this imaging, we first distinguished between <italic>pu1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cells like PNS macrophages and CNS microglia based on their stable starting location without injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s006">S4A and S4B Fig</xref>). By definition, microglia are stable CNS-resident cells that are labeled with <italic>pu1</italic> and anti-4C4 and are sensitive to <italic>csf1r</italic> inhibitors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s006">S4C Fig</xref>). To confirm their identity, before injuries, we stained for 4C4, which labels microglia but not macrophages in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref027">27</xref>], and detected 4C4 overlap only with CNS-located <italic>pu1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells and not peripheral cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). These spinal cord-located 4C4<sup>+</sup>;<italic>pu1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells resembled well-defined microglia in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref027">27</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Additionally, we assayed for the microglia-specific transcript <italic>tmem119</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref028">28</xref>] with a smFISH probes and detected colocalization with <italic>pu1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> <italic>microglia</italic> in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s006">S4F Fig</xref>). To confirm microglia in the spinal cord at 4 dpf, we then tested that in noninjured animals, <italic>pu1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cells in the CNS and PNS maintain their domain-specific residency. In confocal images of the spinal cord, <italic>pu1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cells in the spinal cord could first be detected at 3.5 dpf. The number of <italic>pu1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cells in the spinal cord then increased during development. To determine their stable residency, time-lapse imaging from 4–5 dpf was used in noninjured animals. Consistent with their identity as microglia, <italic>pu1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cells in the spinal cord at 4 dpf remained resident in the CNS (100% of microglia remained in the spinal cord, <italic>n</italic> = 5 animals). These movies revealed that the majority of <italic>pu1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cells that colonize the spinal cord at 4 dpf originate from the anterior, potentionally the brain region, which colonizes microglia by 2.5 dpf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref026">26</xref>]. Not only were CNS cells marked by <italic>pu1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>, 4C4, and <italic>tmem119</italic>, they were also located in the spinal cord proper, distal from the spinal meninges space and the spinal vascular network, and were sensitive to <italic>csf1r</italic> inhibitors, consistent with their classification as microglia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s006">S4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s006">S4E and S4G Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref002">2</xref>]. PNS-located <italic>pu1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cells were similarly stable in their PNS anatomical domain in 24-hour movies. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the domain residency of <italic>pu1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cells like CNS-resident microglia and PNS-resident macrophages are established by 4 dpf in zebrafish, a comparable developmental time to when OPBIs occur.</p>

<title>Microglia are the primary debris clearing cell at injury sites</title>
<p>To dissect phagocytic cellular response in OBPI, we then created injuries in <italic>Tg(pu1</italic>:<italic>gfp); Tg(sox10</italic>:<italic>mrfp)</italic> animals. After injury, we imaged z-stacks that spanned the root and spinal cord every 2.5 minutes for 24 hours. Following spinal avulsion and consistent with a microglial injury response, we visualized microglia migrated to the injury site within the first hour following injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g001">Fig 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s007">S5A Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref030">30</xref>]. In these movies, we also visualized macrophages responding immediately to the injury, traveling at an average velocity of 151.34 μm/h compared to microglia, which respond at a velocity of 203.58 μm/h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s007">S5B Fig</xref>). To ask whether these responses were correlated with the size of the injury, we categorized injuries based on the lesion size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s007">S5C and S5D Fig</xref>). However, all size injuries provoked microglial response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s007">S5C and S5D Fig</xref>). To determine the migration path of these cells, we tracked individual cells and found that the migration path of microglia and macrophages was direct (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s007">S5E Fig</xref>). Microglia traveled 72.72 μm to injury compared to macrophages traveling 58.60 μm on average, with different velocities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s007">S5B and S5F Fig</xref>). Given that both CNS and PNS cells responded, we next asked which cells responded first by quantifying the percentage of injuries for which each cell was a first responder. Despite the difference in distance traveled, microglia and macrophages each were first responders 50% of the time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s007">S5G Fig</xref>). Although macrophages outnumbered microglia at the injury site nearly 3-fold. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that both microglia and macrophages respond to spinal root avulsion.</p>
<p>Because both cells responded to the injury, we next tested whether, while at the injury site, microglia and macrophages each clear debris. To do this, we injured <italic>Tg(pu1</italic>:<italic>gfp); Tg(sox10</italic>:<italic>mrfp)</italic> animals, created 24-hour movies, identified CNS and PNS GFP<sup>+</sup> cells based on their pre-injury location, and then scored mRFP debris within GFP<sup>+</sup> cells, a result consistent with clearance of debris from GFP<sup>+</sup> cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref032">32</xref>]. Although both macrophages and microglia responded to injury, mRFP<sup>+</sup> debris was present in 92% of microglia, whereas mRFP<sup>+</sup> debris was present in 8% of macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g001">Fig 1F and 1G</xref>), consistent with the hypothesis that microglia primarily clear debris. We confirmed that the phagocytosis of mRFP<sup>+</sup> debris from microglia was specific to the injury site by scoring an average of 1.2 mRFP<sup>+</sup> debris puncta before microglia arrived to the injury site, which increased to 4.3 mRFP<sup>+</sup> debris after arrival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g001">Fig 1H</xref>). Although mRFP<sup>+</sup> debris was primarily in microglia, phagocytic vacuoles could be seen in both macrophages and microglia, consistent with the previous hypotheses that both cells are capable of phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s008">S6A and S6B Fig</xref>). These vacuoles were specific to the injury site, because after arrival to injury, on average 2.18 vacuoles were present compared to the 0 vacuoles before arrival (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s008">S6A and S6B Fig</xref>). Although the vacuoles lacked mRFP<sup>+</sup> debris in macrophages, every microglial cell with vacuoles contained mRFP<sup>+</sup> debris. If microglia are the primary debris-clearing cells in OBPI, we hypothesized that they would clear debris longer at the injury side than macrophages. To test this, we tracked the distinct <italic>pu1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cell populations in time-lapse movies and scored microglia spend on average 9.14 hours at the injury site compared to macrophages, which spend 5.97 hours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s008">S6C and S6D Fig</xref>), a result that is consistent with the hypothesis that microglia could function as the primary debris-clearing cells following obstetrical avulsion.</p>

<title>Microglia exit the CNS during spinal root avulsion</title>
<p>To determine the role of phagocytic cells in clearance of these domains, we tracked both cells in uninjured cases and following injury in lateral views in which we could distinguish the location of the spinal cord and the PNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s009">S7A and S7B Fig</xref>). In these movies, we visualized GFP<sup>+</sup> cells that originated in the CNS, migrate to the injury site, squeeze at the spinal cord boundary, and potentially migrate outside of its CNS domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s009">S7C and S7D Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s026">S3 Movie</xref>). This hourglass-like morphology is typical of cells that must squeeze through a space-restricted area to leave the spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref033">33</xref>]. We confirmed the ectopic migration of these cells by rotating our z-stack 90° in the movies; the distance of this migration also extended laterally beyond the normal range of the <italic>gfap</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> spinal cord glial limitans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s009">S7E Fig</xref>). We measured these cells extended on average 14.7 μm beyond the glial limitans boundary; in comparision, the DRG was measured on average 4.8 μm outside the glial limitans (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s009">S7F Fig</xref>). We also visualized microglia in contact with the PNS-located DRG resident cells, supporting the hypothesis that microglia clearly exited the CNS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s009">S7G–S7H Fig</xref>). We quantified this behavior in our 24-hour movies after injury and microglia were detected laterally outside of the mRFP region in 40% of the movies, they displayed an hourglass-like morphology, and in 3D reconstructions were located outside the normal region of the curvature of the glial limitans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s009">S7E Fig</xref>). In these emigration events, typically one to two microglia exited (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s009">S7I Fig</xref>). This is in contrast to noninjured spinal cords in which microglia never were present in these regions. On average, microglia emigrated 12.87 μm outside of the <italic>sox10</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> CNS region following spinal root avulsion, remained there on average 4.13 hours, and displayed microglia-like morphology while positioned there (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s009">S7J and S7K Fig</xref>). In these emigration events, a continuous GFP<sup>+</sup> process that remained in the CNS could not be detected, suggesting that the entirety of the microglia cell left the CNS. After emigration, individual microglia did return to the CNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g002">Fig 2B and 2E</xref>).</p>

<p>It is possible that this microglia emigration occurs from a massive disruption of the spinal cord boundary. However, despite disruption of the glial limitans in category III injury cases, microglia emigration was still observed in category I and II injury types with limited glial limitans disruption (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s009">S7L Fig</xref>). Also inconsistent with this idea, microglia emigration was preceeded by a squeezing of the microglia, suggesting it migrates through a space-restricted area (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s009">S7C and S7D Fig</xref>). If a general boundary disruption was present, oligodendrocytes and neurons would potentially ectopically exit as they do when boundary cap cells and/or Schwann cells are disrupted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref018">18</xref>]. However, we also did not detect emigration of oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s009">S7L Fig</xref>). We next asked whether emigration was specific to root injuries by injuring the mixed PNS nerve (analogous to the sciatic nerve) and did not detect emigration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s010">S8A–S8C Fig</xref>). Instead, and as previously reported, macrophages were the responding cell at mixed nerves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref034">34</xref>](<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s010">S8D and S8E Fig</xref>). Microglia also did not emigrate when we created a CNS-specific injury (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s010">S8C and S8E Fig</xref>). To rule out the possibility that this was specific to developmental properties at 4 dpf, we also observed microglia emigration to avulsions at 7 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Based on these data, we propose that microglia can exit the spinal cord, at least to the PNS-located spinal root and DRG, following OBPI-like injuries. Such an observation is in contrast to current textbook definitions of microglia.</p>

<sec id="sec007">
<title>Emigrated microglia phagocytize PNS debris and re-enter the CNS</title>
<p>To gain further insight into this emigration, we tracked the trajectory of individual microglia after injury. Not only did microglia exit following injury, but this tracing analysis showed that individual microglia traverse the spinal cord boundary an average 6.25 times throughout their response to injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g002">Fig 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s011">S9A–S9I Fig</xref>). We next considered the hypothesis that, although microglia ectopically migrated, their phagocytic properties could be different between their resident domain and the ectopically located PNS domain. To test this, we took advantage of our imaging approach and tracked individual microglia after injury, then scored and tracked the individual debris concentrates within those microglia. In these movies, we could identify <italic>pu1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cells that originated in the CNS contain mRFP<sup>+</sup> debris (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g002">Fig 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s011">S9J–S9M Fig</xref>). To test whether debris could be carried across the CNS boundary, we scored the appearance of individual mRFP<sup>+</sup> clusters in the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in the CNS. During their emigration to the spinal root, on average two mRFP<sup>+</sup> particles from the CNS were carried within the microglia to the PNS. And while in the PNS, an additional one mRFP<sup>+</sup> debris appeared in the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g002">Fig 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s011">S9N Fig</xref>). This appearance of mRFP<sup>+</sup> debris particles while in the PNS is unlikely from already present CNS debris particle fission because the area of individual particles increases from 2.05 μm<sup>2</sup> to 2.83 μm<sup>2</sup> while the microglia cell is migrating (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s011">S9O Fig</xref>). As the cells entered back into the CNS, mRFP<sup>+</sup> debris particles that appeared while the cell was in the PNS continued to be present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). These data are consistent with the possibility that <italic>pu1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> microglia not only migrate to the PNS-located roots but also clear debris while there. Additionally, their entry back into the CNS with PNS debris introduces the CNS to PNS debris.</p>
<p>Given this movement of microglia, we next sought to determine where microglia and macrophages eventually reside following their injury response. To do this, we identified CNS versus PNS <italic>pu1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cells before injury, created injuries, imaged those injury sites for 24 hours, and tracked the individual cells with tracking software. In this analysis of the microglia that exited to the PNS, 44.44% of them migrated back to the CNS, where they continued to reside until the end of the 24-hour imaging window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g002">Fig 2G</xref>). This phenomonon is distinct from other CNS cells that have been shown to emigrate because microglia also re-enter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref017">17</xref>]. In the other 55.56%, microglia continued to be present in the PNS at the injury site at the end of the 24-hour imaging window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g002">Fig 2G</xref>). These PNS-located microglia did not leave the injury site during this time. Macrophages migrated into and out of the injury site, sometimes entering the CNS. However, at the end of the imaging window, macrophages were rarely seen in the CNS. The simplest explanation for this data is that microglia can leave the CNS to respond to avulsions and can return to CNS residency after clearing debris.</p>
<p>To dissect the consequence of this emigration, we tracked individual microglia that emigrated and then returned to the CNS. During this process, we measured numerous cellular properties that were previously described across species to indicate altered microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref009">9</xref>]. We first tested whether the morphology of single microglia changed as they progressed through their emigration and re-entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g002">Fig 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s012">S10A–S10D Fig</xref>). To determine morphological changes, we measured four shape descriptors. Microglia showed a signficant shift in aspect ratio (an average measure of 8.57) and cell roundness (an average measure of 0.21) as cells were leaving the CNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g002">Fig 2I and 2J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s012">S10B and S10C Fig</xref>). These differences remained while the cell returned to the CNS. To address whether this was a result of their location at the injury as apposed to emigration, we compared emigrating microglia to microglia that responded to and actively cleared debris at the injury site but never exited the CNS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s012">S10E–S10H Fig</xref>). Again, this analysis showed that aspect ratio and roundness were different from cells that emigrated compared to nonexiting microglia. We could not detect any differences in the cells before emigration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g002">Fig 2H–2J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s012">S10I and S10J Fig</xref>), inconsistent with the hypothesis that emigrating microglia are distinct, at least morphologically, before emigration.</p>

<title>PNS-experienced microglia return in an altered state</title>
<p>To further dissect whether microglia are altered, we tested whether emigrated microglia were physiologically changed by scoring their phagocytic activity.

We scored that individual microglia before their emigration increase the number of new mRFP<sup>+</sup> particles once they return to the CNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g002">Fig 2K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s012">S10K Fig</xref>). As a third indicator of altered microglia, we also scored the number of secondary projections that are used in the phagocytic process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref023">23</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s012">S10L Fig</xref>). Consistent with the conclusion that emigrated microglia return in an altered state, they increase their secondary projections while in the PNS and remain elevated as they re-enter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s012">S10L Fig</xref>). Emigrated microglia also were distinct from microglia that responded to injuries of CNS tissue only (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s012">S10M Fig</xref>). Together, these data are consistent with the idea that emigration itself could induce a unique microglial state.</p>
<p>Because CNS-resident <italic>pu1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cells migrated out of the spinal cord but then returned to the CNS, we next asked whether those ectopically migrated and altered cells moved to distal areas of the CNS following their emigration. To do this, we created injuries in animals, tiled the animal from the brain to tail with confocal positions, and time-lapse imaged each of these positions for 24 hours. With this whole spinal cord analysis, we could visualize CNS-derived <italic>pu1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cells migrate to the injury, squeeze into the PNS, relocate to the CNS through the spinal cord, and then migrate anteriorly toward the brain and then caudally to the tail, surveying 743.56 μm (56.61%) of the spinal cord on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g002">Fig 2L</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s013">S11A–S11E Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s027">S4 Movie</xref>). These movies demonstrated PNS-primed microglia that carried debris from the injuries to the brain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s013">S11A Fig</xref>). This tiling analysis also allowed us to see interactions between individual cells along the length of the animal. We commonly visualized emigrated microglia interacting with other CNS-resident microglia in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s013">S11F–S11H Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s027">S4 Movie</xref>). Based on these data, we conclude that not only can microglia migrate out of the CNS but they can re-enter the CNS as PNS-primed cells and migrate, in an altered state, to distal areas from the injury site. These migration sites include the brain.</p>

<title>PNS-primed microglia display altered responses to secondary injuries</title>
<p>To begin to understand the potential functional consequence of microglia emigration, we created a primary avulsion injury in <italic>Tg(pu1</italic>:<italic>gfp);Tg(sox10</italic>:<italic>mrfp)</italic> animals at 4 dpf and observed emigration of microglia to the PNS.

We quantified the amount of new debris PNS-primed microglia collected at the secondary injury site, which was greater than the amount of new debris naïve CNS microglia collected at the secondary injury site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g003">Fig 3A</xref>).

<title>Inhibition of NMDA receptors prevents microglia emigration</title>
<p>To dissect the molecular mechanism of this emigration, we screened through small molecules that could disrupt emigration. In this, we identified that NMDA inhibitors, MK-801 and D-AP5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref030">30</xref>], disrupted the emigration of the microglia to the PNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s015">S13A Fig</xref>). To dissect this mechanism further, we tracked individual microglia following injury in DMSO and NMDA inhibitor exposure. We first hypothesized that lack of NMDA signaling disrupted the response of the microglia to spinal sensory roots. However, by tracking individual <italic>pu1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cells after NMDA inhibition, microglia and macrophages still responded to the injury, ruling out the possibility that blocking NMDA receptors prevented an initial injury response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s015">S13B and S13C Fig</xref>). Instead, microglia responded to injury but did not emigrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). This lack of emigration when NMDA signaling is disrupted perturbed the alteration of microglia at the injury that occurs as they emigrate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s016">S14 Fig</xref>). Together, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that microglia exit of the CNS following injury is dependent on NMDA.</p>

<title>Glutamate activation induces microglia emigration</title>
<p>To test this mechanism further, we asked whether glutamate, an activator of NMDA, could induce microglia emigration. We did this by soaking animals in caged glutamate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref035">35</xref>], created brachial plexus injury (BPI)-like injuries, waited for a <italic>pu1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cellular response to the injury, uncaged a 4 μm region in the PNS by exposing it to 405 nm laser, and then imaged for 2 hours after uncaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s028">S5 Movie</xref>). As a control, soaking of caged glutamate did not alter the initial response time to the injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). However, on average, the uncaging of glutamate induced exit of microglia to the PNS in 30 minutes. This was significnalty faster than controls: untreated injuries showed average exit in 7.29 hours and caged-glutamate soaked animals that were exposed to a 4 μm region in the PNS of 641 nm light did not exit before 2 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g003">Fig 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s017">S15A Fig</xref>).

Microglia in both cases traveled the same distance, ruling out the possibility that these significant response times were caused from varying travel distances (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s017">S15B and S15C Fig</xref>). Consistent with their emigration, uncaging glutamate also caused morphological changes that occur in emigration states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s016">S14 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s017">S15D–S15F Fig</xref>).

Consistent with NMDA signaling inhibitors not reducing the initial injury response but specifically emigration, glutamate was not sufficient to induce emigration without injury. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the mechanism of microglia emigration is NMDA- and glutamate-dependent.</p>

<title>Interactions between microglia and macrophages control microglial emigration</title>
<p>We hypothesized that a balance between NMDA induction and an emigration restriction mechanism determined emigration efficiency. Domain-specific cells can be restrictive to cells outside and inside of their domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref038">38</xref>]. Given that both macrophages and microglia responded to injury, we hypothesized that the presence of specific cells at the injury site, like macrophages, could prevent microglia from performing their full debris-clearing potential. We tested this mechanism in our imaging set-up by initially scoring interactions between the distinct <italic>pu1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s029">S6 Movie</xref>). We first quantified the number of times each cell type displayed homotypic versus heterotypic contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s018">S16A–S16C Fig</xref>). Then, we asked whether those interactions induced directional changes. In this analysis, we identified that homotypic interactions between microglia induced migration of microglia 83.33% of the time and heterotypic interactions between microglia and macrophages induced migration of microglia away from the contacting cell 88.88% of the time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s029">S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s030">S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s031">S8</xref> Movies).

<p>To first test this possibility, we visualized microglial migration in the absence of macrophages. To do this, we tailored the laser parameters to produce spinal root avulsions with limited peripheral injury. In these injuries, microglia responded, but macrophages did not (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s019">S17A Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s033">S10</xref> Movie). We then traced the behavior of individual microglia. In contrast to injuries with macrophage responses, microglia migrated to the PNS quicker to these injuries, remained in the PNS, and extended long cellular processes into the PNS that were not visualized when macrophages were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g004">Fig 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s019">S17 Fig</xref>). These data are consistent with the cellular mechanism that macrophages inhibit microglia emigration. We tested this potential mechanism with a second approach by reducing macrophages with focal laser ablations. In these experiments, we created avulsions, then after <italic>pu1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cells migrated to the injury, we laser ablated single macrophages in close proximity to microglia at the injury site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g004">Fig 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s020">S18A and S18B Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s034">S11 Movie</xref>). Following these single macrophage ablations, microglia migrated into the empty space that was created from macrophage ablations within seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g004">Fig 4F and 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s020">S18C–S18E Fig</xref>). Although we cannot completely rule out that macrophage debris attracts microglia, as a control identical laser ablation exposure to adjacent nonmacrophage space did not provoke migration into that area. This is consistent with the idea that ablation does not itself—or debris it creates—induce this microglial response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g004">Fig 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s021">S19 Fig</xref>). The simplest explanation for this is that dynamic interactions between microglia and macrophages deter microglia from occupying the PNS-located injury site.</p>
<p>To test whether this cell–cell contact mechanism has functional implications on debris clearance, we again took advantage of the simplicity of the zebrafish system; during early developmental stages, macrophages are abundant, but microglia are limited in number in the spinal cord and approximately 5% of animals display no CNS <italic>pu1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cells in the spinal cord at 4 dpf. In these rare microglia-less spinal cords, we injured the spinal root and scored the percentage of injuries containing the mRFP<sup>+</sup> debris that concentrated into puncta by phagocytic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g004">Fig 4H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s022">S20 Fig</xref>). As mentioned above, mRFP<sup>+</sup> particles appear as the microglia migrate to the injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g001">Fig 1F–1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s008">S6 Fig</xref>). In contrast to injuries in animals with microglia, mRFP<sup>+</sup> debris puncta was not detected in injuries without microglia, suggesting that microglia are required for debris clearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g004">Fig 4I</xref>). In contrast, for injuries with no macrophages, debris clustered quicker at the injury site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000159.g004">Fig 4F–4G</xref>). And consistent with the role of microglia, this debris was present only within microglia. These results are consistent with the cellular mechanism that microglia are responsible for debris clearance following injury but their access is inhibited to the injury site by macrophages. This stymies their ability to arrive and efficiently clear debris in both the CNS and PNS following spinal root avulsion.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we demonstrate that microglia, despite their textbook definition, can alter their domain-specific residency. In this model of OBPI, the emigrating microglia serve as the debris-clearing cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s023">S21 Fig</xref>). Their potential, however, is stymied by macrophages. Macrophages restrict access to the area via a contact-dependent mechanism; a principle that appears to be consistently utilized across neural cell type, yet still remains largely molecularly elusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref043">43</xref>]. Emigration is balanced by two distinct mechanisms—positive migration via NMDA dependence and negative via contact-dependent cellular restriction. Together, our results introduce the concept that microglia migration out of the CNS is not only possible in OBPI, but while there, they can clear PNS debris and return it to the CNS in an altered state—a consequence that could have longer-term implications in the health of the nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Microglia activation during embryonic development has been implicated in autism-like phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref044">44</xref>]. This activation can be induced by pollutants that the pregnant mother is exposed to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref013">13</xref>]. These results suggest that improper activation of microglia during early embryonic stages could have long-term consequences on neural circuits. Our results indicate that emigration of microglia to the PNS roots can induce similar morphological and phagocytic activity changes that occur in activated microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref009">9</xref>]. In our injury paradigm, these microglia then re-enter the CNS and can migrate over 60% of the spinal cord; their migration capacity even extends into the brain despite the severity of the injury and the integrity of the glial limitans. PNS-primed microglia that re-enter the CNS can migrate to distal sites of CNS-specific secondary injury and are more phagocytically active in response to secondary injuries. Microglia have been implicated in neuropathic pain following PNS injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref045">45</xref>]. This neuropathic pain can be halted if microglia are depleted within the first days after the injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref014">14</xref>], indicating that the initial response and changes of microglia is imperative. In light of these studies, emigration could be essential in numerous postinjury pathologies.</p>
<p>In specific disease states, subsets of microglia are activated. These microglia are referred to as disease-associated microglia (DAMs). DAMs transition through a series of stages that include regulation of specific transcription components, changes in physical appearance, and alterations in phagocytic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref046">46</xref>]. The emigrated microglia return to the CNS with altered morphology and increased phagocytosis. These results indicate that emigrated microglia may resemble DAMs. Although ideal, monitoring transcriptional changes that would confirm these similarities is difficult to perform in emigrated microglia, because first the cells must be identified in movies as emigrated and then single-cell transcriptional analysis would need to be performed. With the number of microglia that emigrate at 4 dpf per injury, such analysis is technically infeasable. Future studies that resolve these technical hurdles will be important. Such analysis will also reveal the distinct differences between microglia and macrophages at the injury site, such as, e.g., their Tyro3, Axl, and Mer (TAMs), which are a family of receptor tyrosine kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref047">47</xref>].</p>
<p>Microglia and macrophages largely occupy distinct domains. However, during disease states like spinal cord injury, multiple scleroris, and metastatic cancer, these distinct cells can reside in the same domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref048">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref050">50</xref>]. Our time-lapse imaging data indicate that microglia are restricted to regions that macrophages occupy. The consequence of this in BPI-like injuries is that microglia cannot clear debris as quickly. It also may ensure abundant microglia are not free to migrate to the PNS where they can become altered to an emigration state. If microglia are resctricted by macrophages in other diseases states like those in this BPI model, it may perturb the normal survelliance functions of microglia. Recent reports demonstrate that macrophages can inhibit microglia in spinal injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000159.ref020">20</xref>], providing complimentary data that the interaction of macrophages and microglia, which we visualize in our movies occur after contact, could have profound effects on pathological states. This could also have downstream consequences to nervous system circuits.</p>
<p>Together, our results indicate that microglia function could extend beyond their textbook-defined region. This adds to their already impressive and essential roles in nervous system homeostasis and disease pathogenesis.</p>

<title>Laser-induced spinal avulsion</title>
<p><italic>Tg(sox10</italic>:<italic>mrfp);Tg(pu1</italic>:<italic>gfp)</italic> 4-dpf animals were anesthetized using 0.02% 3-aminobenzoic acid ester (Tricaine) in egg water. Fish were then mounted in 0.8% low-melting point agarose solution, arranged laterally on a 10 mm glass coverslip-bottom Petri dish, and placed on the microscope anterior to posterior. Avulsion region of interest was mid-animal and selected upon location of DRG outside the spinal cord. Specific site of laser-induced injury was determined by tracing afferent projections from the DRG into the spinal cord using the z-plane. Projections with greater fluorescence and successful tracing were selected as the site of injury. This area was marked and brought into a focused ablation window. Upon focusing the targeted afferent projection, we moved 1 μm laterally out of the z-plane and double-clicked on the projection using a 4 μm cursor tool. All laser parameters used are specific to our confocal microscope. Specific parameters include Laser Power (2), Raster Block Size (1), Double-Click Rectangle Size (8), and Double-Click Repetitions (4).</p>

<title>Avulsion injury categorization</title>
<p>A catalog of all injuries performed was created and analyzed to create three separate categories of injury. Category I injuries are less severe, involving cutting the central projection and little to no surrounding damage. Category II injuries are more severe than involved severance of the central projection and some surrounding damage. Category III injuries are the most severe, involving severance of the central projection, visible damage to the spinal cord, and free-roaming debris. ImageJ was used to measure the length and width of the injury site created. ImageJ was also used to measure the average fluorescence of the injury site before and after the avulsion. These measurements were used to create a range of length, width, and fluorescence to place each avulsion case into a category. These ranges are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000159.s002">S2 Table</xref>. An avulsion case must meet at least two of the three catalog factors to qualify for a specific injury category.</p>

Fish were then mounted in 0.8% low-melting point agarose solution, arranged laterally on a 10 mm glass-coverslip–bottom Petri dish, and placed on the microscope anterior to posterior. First, a primary region of interest was selected, and an initial primary avulsion was created following the procedure as previously described in the laser-induced spinal avulsion section, using all the same laser parameters. We observed microglia responding to injury by checking the time lapse of the injury site every 15 minutes. After a microglia emigration event occurred, we immediately moved to a new posterior imaging region that did not overlap with the primary injury site. Then, we created a secondary injury in the CNS caudal to the primary injury site following the laser-avulsion procedure previously described in the CNS-specific injury section using the same laser parameters. We observed PNS-primed microglia response to secondary injury by imaging both the primary and secondary injury sites every 5 minutes for 24 hours.</p>

<title>Glutamate uncaging</title>
<p><italic>Tg(sox10</italic>:<italic>mrfp);Tg(pu1</italic>:<italic>gfp)</italic> 4 dpf glutamate-treated animals were anesthetized using 0.02% 3-aminobenzoic acid ester (Tricaine) in egg water.

Microglia were identified in the spinal cord by taking confocal z-stack images and rotating each image 90 degrees to verify the cell was inside the CNS. An avulsion of the region of interest was performed following the spinal root avulsion protocol above to elicit microglial response to the injury site. Migration of microglia to the injury post-avulsion was imaged and directly monitored every 5 minutes by placing markers on the screen during the imaging cycle to track movement. Upon arrival to the injury site, the imaging cycle was stopped to begin the uncaging process. Glutamate uncaging was carried out using UV light on the fluorescent region of the confocal. The specific site of UV exposure was in the same area as the intial avulsion. The region of interest was exposed to the laser line 405 nm for 5 ms to uncage glutamate. Immediately following UV exposure, a time lapse was initiatied to take an image every 2 minutes for the desired imaging window. UV exposure used a 4 μm cursor tool.

<title>Quantification of emigration</title>
<p>To track the ectopic migration of microglia, single cells were tracked using the MTrackJ plugin of ImageJ. <italic>pu1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cells were imaged for 2 hours premigration to ensure the normal domain residency. After injury, cells were tracked from inside the spinal cord to the injury site. Three specific criteria were used to score the ectopic migration: (1) Cells migrated dorsolateral outside of the <italic>sox10</italic>:<italic>mrfp</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> range in the spinal cord specifically at the injury site. (2) Cells displayed an hourglass-like morphology that is typical of cells that ectopically migrate from the spinal cord. (3) In visualization of 3D reconstruction of the injury site, the <italic>pu1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cells appeared outside of the <italic>sox10</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> boundary and curvature of the glial limitans. All migrations that did not definetly meet these criteria were conservatively scored as nonectopic migration. To confirm the ectopic exit, we combined transgenes to label the edge of the spinal cord. As a limit of transgenes and the transient nature of this exiting phenomenon, we combined analysis of <italic>Tg(sox10</italic>:<italic>mrfp); Tg(gfap</italic>:<italic>gfp)</italic> and <italic>Tg(sox10</italic>:<italic>mrfp); Tg(pu1</italic>:<italic>gfp)</italic>.

<title>Quantification of <italic>sox10</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> debris puncta</title>
<p>To track the presence of debris within microglia, single cells were tracked using the MTrackJ plugin of ImageJ. <italic>pu1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cells imaged throughout the duration of time lapse imaging were analyzed before and after their arrival to laser-induced avulstion sites. The criteria for debris include that <italic>sox10</italic>:<italic>mrfp</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> puncta were free roaming and were picked up by a <italic>pu1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cell in the spinal cord or that <italic>sox10</italic>:<italic>mrfp</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> puncta were already present inside a <italic>pu1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cell and migrated with the direction of the <italic>pu1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cell. Colocalization was confirmed by rotating the confocal images at varying time points 90 degrees. If the puncta were inside the <italic>pu1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cells, they were considered debris. The area of the puncta were measured using ImageJ.</p>

<title>Quantification of migration</title>
<p>To track the individual paths of macrophage and microglia migration, the MTrackJ plugin on ImageJ was used. The center of each cell body was traced over time, and quantitative data were collected by ImageJ. Resulting x and y coordinates of each cell were overlayed to create migration plots. All distance and time points were calculated by the MTrackJ software and further quantified using Microsoft Excel (Redmond, WA).</p>

<sec id="sec038">
<title>Quantification of directional changes</title>
<p>The MTrackJ plugin on ImageJ was used for tracing. Initial direction change paths were traced by tracking the location of the center of the cell body. Contact-related directional changes were traced by tracking each cell projection that came into contact with another cell projection. All numerical data were collected by the MTrackJ plugin, and the resulting x and y coordinates of each cell track were used to perform all quantitative analyses.</p>
