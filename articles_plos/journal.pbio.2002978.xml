<article-title>Arabidopsis CTL1 Regulates Secretory Trafficking of Auxin Transporters to Control Seedling Growth</article-title>
</related-article>
<abstract>
<p>Ion homeostasis is essential for plant growth and environmental adaptation, and maintaining ion homeostasis requires the precise regulation of various ion transporters, as well as correct root patterning. However, the mechanisms underlying these processes remain largely elusive. Here, we reported that a choline transporter gene, <italic>CTL1</italic>, controls ionome homeostasis by regulating the secretory trafficking of proteins required for plasmodesmata (PD) development, as well as the transport of some ion transporters. Map-based cloning studies revealed that <italic>CTL1</italic> mutations alter the ion profile of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. We found that the phenotypes associated with these mutations are caused by a combination of PD defects and ion transporter misregulation. We also established that <italic>CTL1</italic> is involved in regulating vesicle trafficking and is thus required for the trafficking of proteins essential for ion transport and PD development. Characterizing choline transporter-like 1 (CTL1) as a new regulator of protein sorting may enable researchers to understand not only ion homeostasis in plants but also vesicle trafficking in general.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Ion transporters play a key role in mineral nutrients uptake and transport of plants. Their cellular and subcellular localization is essential for fulfilling their functions and are therefore generally fine-tuned. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain largely unclear. In this study, we analyze the role of the choline transporter CTL1 in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> and find that it controls dynamic cell trafficking, a fundamental process that plays vital roles in cell signaling, development, and protein sorting. We also show that CTL1 regulates the expression pattern of different ion transporters through the modulation of vesicle trafficking. These results suggest that CTL1 is a new component of the vesicle trafficking machinery that is also required for ion homeostasis, which link these processes and shed light on the underlying molecular mechanisms.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The root is highly specified and well organized for the uptake and transport of water and mineral nutrients from the highly heterogeneous soil environment. Plants have evolved complex gene networks to fine tune the activities of different transporters, as well as the functions of different cell wall structures and processes associated with cell-to-cell communication, to match the nutrients supplied by the soil with the normal growth- and development-related needs of their cells. These processes are regulated at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. At the transcriptional level, the expression of transporters and genes that function in root patterning and development is orchestrated by a series of transcription factors. Ectopic expression of a transporter may result in disorders of ion homeostasis. For example, enhanced expression of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> high affinity K+ transporter 1 (<italic>AtHKT1</italic>), specifically in the stele leads to reductions in shoot sodium ion (Na<sup>+</sup>) concentrations; however, constitutive overexpression of <italic>AtHKT1</italic> throughout the plant leads to significant increases in shoot Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref001">1</xref>].</p>
<p>At the posttranscriptional level, transporters can be regulated by processes such as protein modification, degradation, and trafficking. For example, the subcellular localization of iron regulated transporter 1 (IRT1), which transports bivalent cations including iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>), zinc (Zn<sup>2+</sup>), manganese (Mn<sup>2+</sup>), cobalt (Co<sup>2+</sup>), and cadmium (Cd<sup>2+</sup>) ions, is mediated by monoubiquitin- and clathrin-dependent endocytosis involving the IRT1 degradation factor1 RING-type (IDF1 RING) E3 ligases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref003">3</xref>]. FYVE domain protein required for endosomal sorting 1 (FYVE1), a phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P)-binding protein, interacts with IRT1 and mediates the recycling of IRT1 from the endosome back to the plasma membrane (PM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref004">4</xref>], suggesting that membrane lipids and lipid-binding proteins play important roles in protein trafficking and ion homeostasis.</p>
<p>Phosphatidylinositol (PI) sphingolipids and phosphatidic acids (PAs) have all been found to participate in the regulation of vesicle trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref006">6</xref>]. However, as the most abundant phospholipids in the PM of eukaryotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref008">8</xref>], phosphatidylcholines (PCs) have not been shown to be involved in either cargo trafficking or protein subcellular localization, although they have been found to play a crucial role in signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref009">9</xref>]. These important phospholipids incorporate choline as a head group and can be used as a substrate to produce choline in reactions catalyzed by phospholipase D (PLD). In animals, choline is an essential nutrient, because it serves not only as a component of membrane lipids and lipoprotein but also serves as a precursor of many essential molecules such as the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and the osmoregulator betaine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref010">10</xref>]. The choline transporter is required for choline homeostasis, as well as secretion of acetylcholine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref013">13</xref>]. Choline is also produced in plants, but its biological function was rarely studied. A recent study showed that the trans-Golgi network (TGN)-localized choline transporter choline transporter-like 1 (CTL1) is involved in the formation of the phloem sieve plate and sieve pore; however, the mechanism underlying its role in these processes remains unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we identified a new <italic>CTL1</italic> allele by screening ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized plants to identify those with an altered leaf ionome. Our results showed that CTL1 is required for vesicle trafficking and that <italic>CTL1</italic> mutations result in the disruption of plasmodesmata (PD) and the normal localization of PM proteins, including ion transporters and PD callose-binding (PDCB) proteins.</p>

<title>Identification of a novel ionomic mutant</title>
<p>A previous study screened fast neutron mutagenized <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> plants for mutants with an altered leaf ionome to help unravel the gene networks regulating plant ion homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref015">15</xref>], several of which have since been well characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref017">17</xref>]. Using the same strategy, we isolated a new mutant that displays significantly increased leaf concentrations of Na and decreased leaf concentrations of Mn, Fe, Zn, and molybdenum (Mo) when grown in artificial soil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002978.s012">S1 Table</xref>). We named this mutant <italic>significant ionome changes 1</italic> (<italic>sic1</italic>). The leaf ionomic phenotypes of <italic>sic1</italic> observed in plants grown in hydroponics were similar to those observed in plants grown in soil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g001">Fig 1B</xref>); however, the mutant displayed significant alterations in the concentrations of more elements—as it displayed increases in lithium (Li), boron (B), and sulfur (S) concentrations and decreases in phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), Co, nickel (Ni), and copper (Cu) concentrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002978.s013">S2 Table</xref>)—compared with the wild-type plant.

<p>In addition to exhibiting ionomics phenotypic abnormalities, <italic>sic1</italic> also exhibited clear developmental defects. Specifically, <italic>sic1</italic> displayed defects in leaf and root elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002978.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) and had fewer leaves than its wild-type counterpart (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002978.s001">S1 Fig</xref>); however, there was no significant difference in flowering time between the two plants. To test the hypothesis that the ionomic phenotypes of <italic>sic1</italic> resulted from defects in ion uptake or short-distance transport by the roots, we performed reciprocal grafting experiments involving wild-type and <italic>sic1</italic> plants. Principle component analysis (PCA) showed that the leaf ionomic phenotypes of grafted plants with a <italic>sic1</italic> scion and wild-type root were similar to those of nongrafted and self-grafted wild-type plants. However, grafted plants with a wild-type scion and <italic>sic1</italic> root had a leaf ionome that was indistinguishable from that of <italic>sic1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g001">Fig 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002978.s015">S4 Table</xref>). Such evidence indicates that the leaf ionomic phenotype is driven by the root. Interestingly, the shoot developmental phenotypes of <italic>sic1</italic> were also partially driven by the root (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002978.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). These data suggested that <italic>sic1</italic> root function is defective. Consistent with this finding, we also found that the cells in the root of <italic>sic1</italic> were organized in an irregular manner, probably as a result of irregular cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g001">Fig 1F</xref>).</p>

<title>Map-based cloning of <italic>sic1</italic></title>
<p>To identify the causal gene of <italic>sic1</italic>, we constructed an F2 mapping population derived from a cross between <italic>sic1</italic> and Landsberg erecta-0 (Ler-0). The ionomic and developmental phenotypes of the F2 individuals co-segregated with wild-type and mutant individuals at a segregation ratio of 3:1 (X<sup>2</sup> = 0.56 &lt; X<sup>2</sup><sub>0.05,1</sub> = 3.84), demonstrating that the ionomic and developmental phenotypes of <italic>sic1</italic> were controlled by the same single recessive locus. Based on the analysis of 2,030 F2 individuals, we mapped the casual locus to a 100-kb region on chromosome 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). We sequenced the entire candidate region and identified a single G-to-A mutation on the fourth exon of gene At3g15380. This mutation causes a predicted <sup>247</sup>Glycine-to-<sup>247</sup>Glutamate substitution in a conserved domain of this protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g002">Fig 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002978.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), which suggests that At3g15380 is a good candidate for <italic>SIC1</italic>.

<title><italic>SIC1</italic> encodes a choline transporter and is required for PD development</title>
<p>Sequence analysis showed that <italic>sic1</italic> is a new allele of the recently identified <italic>CTL1</italic> gene, which encodes a choline transporter localized at the TGN and nascent cell plates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref014">14</xref>], and the mutation occurs at the second transmembrane domain of the protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002978.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). The <italic>SIC1</italic> gene was therefore renamed <italic>CTL1</italic>. <italic>CTL1</italic> is expressed in both root and shoot, as revealed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) signals in <italic>pCTL1</italic>::<italic>CTL1-GFP</italic> transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002978.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). In root, CTL1-GFP was observed in all cell types of the root tip, whereas it is mainly distributed in the stele of the maturation zone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002978.s006">S6C Fig</xref>). It has been reported that <italic>CTL1</italic> is required for sieve plate and sieve pore formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref014">14</xref>]. As the sieve pore is a special type of PD that plays important roles in ion transportation, we hypothesized that the disorder of ion homeostasis characteristic of <italic>sic1</italic> may be caused by defects in PD. We examined the PD morphology of root cortex cells, wherein PD plays an important role in ion transportation. Using a transmission electron microscope, we observed that most PDs in <italic>sic1</italic> are blocked or shrunken, whereas those in Columbia-0 (Col-0) exhibit typical morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). A similar result was also observed in a recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref018">18</xref>]. To examine PD function in <italic>sic1</italic> further, we examined the localization of two PD markers that play an important role in PD development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref019">19</xref>], namely, PDCB1 and PDCB2, by introducing two constructs, <italic>pPDCB1</italic>::<italic>PDCB1-GFP</italic> and <italic>pPDCB2</italic>::<italic>PDCB2-GFP</italic>, into Col-0 and <italic>sic1</italic>. We analyzed five independent transgenic lines for each genotype and construct, and observed well consistent results. Both PDCB1-GFP and PDCB2-GFP were found to be localized predominantly on the cell wall in a spotty manner in wild-type roots, and only a small amount of intracellular fluorescence was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>), findings consistent with those of previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref019">19</xref>]. In contrast, in the mutant root, either PDCB1-GFP or PDCB2-GFP was localized mostly, if not entirely, in some intracellular compartments, as only a weak PDCB1-GFP signal was observed on the cell wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>). The intracellular aggregation of PDCB proteins not only confirmed that PDs are defective in <italic>sic1</italic> but also indicated that PDCB could not localize properly in the mutant.</p>

<p>Given that PDs are essential for mineral element transportation and that Casparian strips block the apoplast pathway, it is plausible that PD defects may result in disorders of ion homeostasis. However, we noticed that the levels of some elements were decreased, whereas those of other elements were increased in <italic>sic1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g001">Fig 1A and 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002978.s012">S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002978.s014">S3</xref> Tables), indicating that impaired PD-mediated symplastic transportation is not the only cause of the defects in ion homeostasis in <italic>sic1</italic>.</p>
<p>A previous study reported that shrunken PD apertures reduce cell-to-cell communication and disrupt processes such as protein and microRNA (miRNA) intercellular translocation and that such changes systematically disturb organism patterning and cell identities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref021">21</xref>]. Given that <italic>sic1</italic> mutants display a root cell-patterning disorder phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g001">Fig 1F</xref>), we wondered whether the intercellular movement of shoot root (SHR), a key transcription factor that moves from the stele to the endodermis to regulate root development, was affected by the shrunken PDs. To validate this hypothesis, we introduced a <italic>pSHR</italic>::<italic>SHR-GFP</italic> construct into Col-0 and <italic>sic1</italic>, and obtained six to ten independent transgenic lines for each genotype for analysis. Confocal microscopic analysis showed that SHR-GFP can move from the stele to the endodermis correctly in all Col-0 transgenic lines, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref022">22</xref>]. However, PD-mediated intercellular movement was defective in all <italic>sic1</italic> lines, as SHR-GFP was expressed normally in all stele cells but was hardly visible or even vanished in most endodermal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). As SHR plays a central role in the initialization and architecture of the cortex, endodermis, and stele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref024">24</xref>], the reduced movement of SHR noted above may be an important cause of the disordered root patterning characteristic of <italic>sic1</italic> and may result in the abnormal expression of transporters in the wrong cell types.</p>

<p>Given that cell-type–specific transporter expression is important for ion homeostasis, we investigated whether the ionomic phenotype of <italic>sic1</italic> was also a result of the ectopic expression of a series of transporters. HMA4 is a Zn<sup>2+</sup> transporter expressed in the pericycle and xylem parenchyma of roots and is responsible for transporting Zn<sup>2+</sup> from the symplast to the xylem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref025">25</xref>]. As <italic>sic1</italic> exhibits defective Zn<sup>2+</sup> transport, we assessed the expression patterns of <italic>HMA4</italic> in <italic>sic1</italic> and Col-0. We expressed <italic>pHMA4</italic>::<italic>HMA4-GFP</italic> in <italic>sic1</italic> and introduced the construct into Col-0 by crossing. As previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref026">26</xref>], HMA4-GFP was clearly present in the pericycle and xylem parenchyma of Col-0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). However, HMA4-GFP was also found to be ectopically expressed in the <italic>sic1</italic> epidermis, as well as the root hairs of the mature region of the root (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). This result was further confirmed by the observation of β-glucuronidase (GUS) signals in 5–8 independent transgenic lines of Col-0 and <italic>sic1</italic>-expressing <italic>pHMA4</italic>::<italic>GUS</italic>. The GUS signal was only present in root steles of Col-0 lines, in which it was also observable in epidermis and root hair cells in addition to the steles of <italic>sic1</italic> lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002978.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). Because HMA4 mediates Zn efflux, we surmised that ectopically expressing <italic>HMA4</italic> in the epidermis of <italic>sic1</italic> would reduce Zn uptake in the root. Interestingly, we found that the total expression level of <italic>HMA4</italic>, as determined by qRT-PCR, was downregulated in <italic>sic1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g004">Fig 4C</xref>), suggesting that Zn loading into the xylem may also be affected in this mutant. To confirm this hypothesis, we stained the roots of Col-0 and <italic>sic1</italic> plants with the membrane-permeant Zn<sup>2+</sup> fluorescent sensor Zinpyr-1, and found that the distribution of Zn was significantly altered in <italic>sic1</italic> roots compared with Col-0 roots. In contrast to Col-0 roots, which exhibited Zn accumulation mainly in the stele, <italic>sic1</italic> roots exhibited Zn accumulation mainly in the cortex and endodermal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g004">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>), findings fully consistent with those of the experiments in which disturbances in the expression patterns and reductions in the expression levels of <italic>HMA4</italic> in <italic>sic1</italic> mutants were noted.</p>

Alternatively, we introduced a <italic>pHKT1</italic>::<italic>GUS</italic> construct into Col-0 and <italic>sic1</italic> mutants.

<p>A previous study reported that CTL1 localizes to the TGN, the hub of vesicle trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref014">14</xref>]. Consistent with this finding, we found that CTL1 co-localized with N-(3-Triethylammoniumpropyl)-4-(6-(4-(diethylamino)phenyl)hexatrienyl)pyridinium dibromide (FM4-64), an endocytosis tracer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002978.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). This evidence, as well as the observations that PDCB proteins and NRAMP1 are intracellularly aggregated in <italic>sic1</italic>, suggests that CTL1 is probably involved in vesicle trafficking. We stained 6-day-old Col-0 and <italic>sic1</italic> seedlings with FM4-64 to observe endocytosis. Our results showed that FM4-64 internalization was clearly observed after 30 minutes of staining in Col-0 but after 60 minutes of staining in <italic>sic1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>), indicating that endocytosis was strongly repressed in <italic>sic1</italic>.</p>

<p>Recently, it was reported that the localization of NRAMP1 to the PM was mediated by vesicle trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref032">32</xref>]. Considering the intracellular aggregation of NRAMP1 and the suppression of endocytosis in <italic>sic1</italic>, we wondered if CTL1 is involved in regulating the recycling of NRAMP1. To examine this, we treated the transgenic lines expressing <italic>pNRAMP1</italic>::<italic>NRAMP1-GFP</italic> in both Col-0 and <italic>sic1</italic> background with a vesicle trafficking inhibitor brefeldin A (BFA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref033">33</xref>]. BFA inhibits the function of ADP-ribosylation factor GTPases (ARF GTPases) by interacting with their associated guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and thereby results in membranous aggregates known as BFA compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref033">33</xref>]. With BFA treatment for 1.5 hours, the NRAMP1-GFP aggregation in BFA compartments was observed in the epidermal cells of both Col-0 and <italic>sic1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g006">Fig 6C</xref>), supporting that subcellular localization of NRAPM1 is mediated by vesicle trafficking. However, after 2 hours BFA washing out, NRAMP1-GFP aggregation in the BFA compartments only remained in 3.0% of Col-0 epidermal cells but that number in <italic>sic1</italic> is 58.3% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>), suggesting that the recycling of NRAMP1-GFP from endosomes back to PM is altered in <italic>sic1</italic>.</p>
<p>In root, BFA primarily inhibits post-Golgi traffic rather than endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi traffic due to that this process heavily relies on GNOM-like 1(GNL1), which is BFA resistant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref034">34</xref>]. It thus might be contentious that the aggregation of NRAMP1-GFP caused by BFA treatment is from recycling or neosynthesis. To address this question, we first treated the roots of Col-0 and <italic>sic1</italic> expressing <italic>pNRAMP1</italic>::<italic>NRAMP1</italic> with a protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX; 50 μM) for 30 minutes followed by co-treatment with BFA (50 μM) and CHX (50 μM) for 90 minutes. We found that the intracellular BFA bodies in <italic>sic1</italic> were significantly reduced either in amount or in size compared with that in Col-0 after such treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g006">Fig 6E and 6F</xref>). This observation established that the NRAMP1 recycling is impaired in <italic>sic1</italic> and further confirmed that CTL1 is required for endocytosis. In addition, when the plants were pretreated with CHX (50 μM) for 30 minutes and co-treated with BFA (50 μM) and CHX (50 μM) for 90 minutes followed by 2-hour washing out with water, only 13.9% of BFA bodies remain in Col-0 cells, whereas 35.5% of BFA bodies still remain in <italic>sic1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g006">Fig 6E and 6F</xref>). This data further revealed that recycling of NRAMP1 between endosomes and PM requires CTL1, independently of the de novo delivery.</p>
<p>To further examine the role of CTL1 in vesicle trafficking, we examined recycling of PIN-formed 1(PIN1), an auxin efflux carrier of which polar PM localization is mediated by vesicle trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref035">35</xref>]. We pretreated Col-0 and <italic>sic1</italic> plants expressing <italic>pPIN1</italic>:<italic>PIN1-GFP</italic> with CHX for 30 minutes and then co-treated them with CHX and BFA for 90 minutes, and observed BFA bodies in both genotypes—which is consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref036">36</xref>]. Then we washed out the BFA with water to see the protein trafficking of PIN1. After this process, only 14.7% of the BFA bodies still existed in Col-0 cells, whereas 34.8% of the BFA bodies were presented in <italic>sic1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002978.s011">S11 Fig</xref>). This result further demonstrated that CTL1 is required for vesicle trafficking and recycling of PM proteins.</p>
<p>As CTL1 localizes on TGN and is involved in vesicle trafficking, we wondered if the intracellularly aggregated NRAMP1 and PDCB proteins in <italic>sic1</italic> are in TGN/early endosomes (EEs). To figure this out, we stained the transgenic line of <italic>sic1</italic> expressing <italic>pNRAMP1</italic>::<italic>NRAMP1-GFP</italic> with FM4-64 for 1 hour, which stains the TGN/EE given 1 hour staining for <italic>sic1</italic> is equivalent to 30 minutes staining for wild type. As expected, we found that the NRAMP1-GFP compartments were indeed co-localized with FM4-64 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002978.s008">S8A Fig</xref>), suggesting the aggregation of NRAMP1 is in TGN/EE. To further confirm this, we co-expressed NRAMP1-GFP and the TGN marker VHA-a1-mCherry in <italic>sic1</italic> driven by promoters of <italic>NRAMP1</italic> and <italic>35S</italic>, respectively. Consistently, we observed that the intracellular NRAMP1 compartments were co-localized with the VHA-a1-mCherry, further confirming that NRAMP1 is retained in TGN of <italic>sic1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002978.s008">S8D Fig</xref>). These data suggest that CTL1 is involved in recycling of some cargos from endosomes back to PM. Consistently, when we examined the Golgi apparatus in <italic>sic1</italic> by using a transmission electron microscope, we observed that the numbers of secretory vesicles, a major component of TGN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref037">37</xref>], are significantly reduced in <italic>sic1</italic> compared to that in Col-0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g006">Fig 6G and 6H</xref>), suggesting that the TGN structure or its volume might be altered in <italic>sic</italic>. However, when we studied the nature of the intracellular aggregation of PDCBs, we found that they are not the same case as NRAMP1. After staining the transgenic lines of <italic>sic1</italic> expressing PDCB1 with FM4-64, we found the compartments are not co-localized with FM4-64 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002978.s008">S8B and S8C Fig</xref>), suggesting that CTL1 might be involved in not only vesicle trafficking-mediated PM protein secretion pathway but also some other unknown secretion pathways.</p>

<title>Choline homeostasis is crucial for vesicle trafficking</title>
<p>CTL1 is a known choline transporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref014">14</xref>]. Therefore, we investigated whether choline or the transporter itself participates in vesicle trafficking by treating 6-day-old Col-0 seedlings with 1 mM choline for 2 hours and then staining the seedlings with FM4-64 dye to observe endocytosis. Interestingly, we found that endocytosis was significantly suppressed under choline treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>), suggesting that choline homeostasis is crucial for endocytosis. To investigate the role of choline in protein recycling further, we treated Col-0 seedlings expressing NRAMP1-GFP with 50 μM BFA. After 1.5 hours, we washed the seedlings with either water (control) or 1 mM choline. After 2 hours, 50% of the BFA bodies were still visible in the seedlings washed with choline, whereas 96% of the BFA bodies had vanished in the seedlings washed with water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g007">Fig 7C and 7D</xref>). This result suggested that choline homeostasis is important not only for endocytosis but also for membrane protein recycling. In plant cells, choline serves mainly as a precursor of PC, the most abundant phospholipid component of the PM. We thus measured the absolute contents and relative proportions of eight major membrane lipids, including monogalactosyldiacylglycerols (MGDGs), digalactosyldiacylglycerols (DGDGs), PA, PC, phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), phosphatidylglycerols (PGs), PI, and phosphatidylserines (PS). We found that the absolute contents of all these lipids in <italic>sic1</italic> plants decreased at different levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g007">Fig 7E and 7F</xref>), indicating that the generation or steady status of endomembrane system is impaired in <italic>sic1</italic>. This result is consistent with the role of CTL1 in vesicle trafficking, as vesicle trafficking is required for membrane generation and communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref038">38</xref>].</p>

<p>Interestingly, though the absolute PC and PE contents in <italic>sic1</italic> were decreased, the proportions of PC and PE relative to the total membrane lipids were significantly increased in the mutant, with PC levels increasing by 47% and PE levels increasing by 71% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g007">Fig 7G</xref>). This is to say, the compositions of PC and PE in the membrane system of <italic>sic1</italic> increase though they decrease relative to the whole plant. As both PC and PE are substrates of PLDs that cleave PC to form choline, this result may indicate that <italic>CTL1</italic> mutations inhibit PLD activation. To confirm this, we examined the responses of the <italic>sic1</italic> mutant and Col-0 to PLD-specific inhibitor 1-butanol. As expected, <italic>sic1</italic> is more resistant to 1-butanol than Col-0, as the <italic>sic1</italic> root is significantly shorter than Col-0 root when grown on 1/2 Murashige and Skoog (MS) plate, meanwhile there is no significant difference between the roots of the 2 genotypes when treated with 1-butanol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g008">Fig 8A–8C</xref>). This result suggested that the PLD activity is inhibited by the mutation of <italic>CTL1</italic>, or in other words, PLD is a downstream component of CTL1. PLDs have been reported to positively regulate vesicle trafficking. We therefore proposed that CTL1 regulates vesicle trafficking through the effects of choline on PLD activity or membrane PC and PE content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g008">Fig 8D</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we employed a forward genetic-based ionomics approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref016">16</xref>] to determine that the choline transporter CTL1 is a new component of the vesicle trafficking machinery. Interestingly, we found that CTL1 is highly conserved among different species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002978.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), indicating that CTL1 plays a crucial and fundamental role in all organisms. Transmembrane domain analysis showed that CTL1 has ten transmembrane helices (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002978.s003">S3 Fig</xref>, TMHMM Server v. 2.0). And the mutation site lies in the second transmembrane helix, where the mutated glycine is conserved in plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002978.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Coincidently, a recent study identified the same mutation in CTL1. According to that report, such a mutation results in abnormal subcellular localization of CTL1, which probably explains why this mutation leads to loss of function of <italic>CTL1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref018">18</xref>]. Loss of function of <italic>CTL1</italic> in the root significantly disrupted the leaf homeostasis of a series of mineral nutrients, including Na, Mn, Fe, Zn, and Mo, suggesting that <italic>CTL1</italic> has a systemic impact on ion transportation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g001">Fig 1A–1C</xref>). CTL1 was previously shown to be involved in the development of sieve pores, which are a special type of PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref014">14</xref>]. As PDs play an important role in ion transport in the root, it is plausible that the disruption of ion homeostasis characteristic of <italic>sic1</italic> may result from defects in PD. We found that PD development in <italic>sic1</italic> is severely impaired, probably due to PDCB protein mislocalization or some other reasons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>). However, we realized that the direct effects of PDs on ion transport are not specific, as different elements of <italic>sic1</italic> were differentially affected by PD defects. For example, Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations were increased 3-fold, while Mn<sup>2+</sup> concentrations were decreased by 77% in <italic>sic1</italic> compared with Col-0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g001">Fig 1A, 1B and 1C</xref>), suggesting that the ionome disorders characteristic of <italic>sic1</italic> may be the ultimate result of several phenomena that exerted direct and indirect effects on ion transport.</p>
<p>Abnormal PDs not only affect ion transport but also block the cell-to-cell communication required for root cell identity, patterning, and development (23). <italic>SHR</italic> is a key transcription factor that initiates root patterning, and its movement from the stele to the endodermis via PDs is essential for its function. We established that SHR cell-to-cell communication is severely blocked in most <italic>sic1</italic> endodermal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g003">Fig 3D</xref>), leading to abnormal root patterning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). The cell-type specific expression of transporters is generally orchestrated by cell identity and organization, which are driven by certain common transcription factors. Thus, it is reasonable to predict that the expression of some transporters may be altered in <italic>sic1</italic> because of defects in SHR or other mobile transcription factors. We found that both <italic>HMA4</italic> and <italic>HKT1</italic> were ectopically expressed in the epidermis of <italic>sic1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g004">Fig 4A, 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002978.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). As a consequence, Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> transport was also disordered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g004">Fig 4E–4G</xref>) and may have been an indirect cause of the ionomic phenotype of <italic>sic1</italic>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, not all the transporter genes were misexpressed in the <italic>sic1</italic> mutant, suggesting that the impact of CTL1 on transcription is gene-specific. We noticed that both <italic>HKT1</italic> and <italic>HMA4</italic> are stele-specific genes in Col-0, and their ectopic expression is in epidermal cells of <italic>sic1</italic>, whereas <italic>NRAMP1</italic> is originally expressed in the epidermis. One possibility could be that the expression of the transporter genes like <italic>HKT1</italic> and <italic>HMA4</italic> are inhibited in epidermal cells because of some factors requiring CTL1. In such a case, loss of function of <italic>CTL1</italic> thus could result in disinhibition of <italic>HKT1</italic> and <italic>HMA4</italic> in the epidermis, meanwhile <italic>NRAMP1</italic> is not affected. Consistent with this hypothesis, the establishment of the cell identity of the epidermis also requires factors that move through PDs, such as CAPRICE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref039">39</xref>]. In the future, it would be interesting to address whether expression of <italic>HKT1</italic> and <italic>HMA4</italic> are related to these factors and if these transcription factors require CTL1. However, we also noticed that the expression patterns of <italic>HKT1</italic> and <italic>HMA4</italic> are somewhat overlapped with <italic>CTL1</italic> in the mature zone of Col-0, but it is hard to judge if the expression pattern of <italic>CTL1</italic> is related to its gene-specific effect on transcriptional regulation or if that’s just a coincidence.</p>
<p>Although the expression pattern of <italic>NRAMP1</italic> was not changed, we observed that its trafficking to the PM was severely affected in <italic>sic1</italic>. As <italic>NRAMP1</italic> is responsible for Mn and Fe uptake and long-distance transportation, defective NRAMP1 trafficking is certainly at least partially responsible for the low Mn and Fe phenotypes characteristic of <italic>sic1</italic> shoots.</p>
<p>CTL1 localizes to the TGN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002978.s007">S7 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref014">14</xref>], and <italic>CTL1</italic> mutations affect the subcellular localization of various PM proteins, including NRAMP1 and PDCB proteins. These data inspired us to assess whether <italic>CTL1</italic> is involved in regulating vesicle trafficking. Our studies of the endocytosis tracer FM4-64 and NRAMP1 and PIN1 trafficking confirmed our hypothesis. Supporting this conclusion, the numbers of secretory vesicles are much less in <italic>sic1</italic> than in Col-0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002978.g006">Fig 6G and 6H</xref>), which indicates that the TGN structure or volume is changed by the mutation of <italic>CTL1</italic>. The localization of NRAMP1 to the PM was recently reported to be mediated by vesicle trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref032">32</xref>]. Our results confirmed this finding and established that this process involves CTL1. In contrast, little is known regarding how PDCB proteins are specifically directed to PDs, which are special PM sites. PDCBs were previously found to be localized to PD domains, where callose deposit and play important roles in PD formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref019">19</xref>]. In this study, we found for the first time that the localization of PDCBs on PDs requires CTL1, which was initially identified as a regulator of the sieve plate and sieve pore and xylem development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref014">14</xref>]. As a sieve pore is a special PD in the phloem, the sieve pore phenotype of <italic>ctl1</italic> may also be a result of defects in the subcellular localization of PDCBs or their partner(s).</p>
<p>The <italic>sic1</italic> mutant exhibits a comprehensive ionomic defect, which may indicate that CTL1-mediated vesicle trafficking affects the recycling of large numbers of PM proteins, including various ion transporters. For example, the subcellular localization of the iron transporter IRT1, which is essential for iron uptake of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic>, was previously found to be regulated by endosomal cycling. Although we did not get direct evidence about the IRT1 localization, we found that the expression of <italic>IRT1</italic>, as well as <italic>AHA2</italic>, was dramatically up-regulated in <italic>sic1</italic> even at Fe sufficient condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002978.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). This elevated IRT1and <italic>AHA2</italic> might reflect that their subcellular localization is also regulated by <italic>CTL1</italic>.</p>
<p>In animals, choline is essential for neuron signaling and choline transporter plays important roles in choline homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref040">40</xref>]. The vesicle-localized choline transporter was believed to function in secretion of acetylcholine, but it remains unknown if it plays some other roles. It was well-documented that phospholipid compositions of the membrane system play important roles in vesicle trafficking. For example, PA, one of the products in the hydrolysis of PC catalyzed by PLD, is enriched at the budding position of PM to form vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref041">41</xref>]. The involvement of PLD in vesicle trafficking was therefore believed to be associated with its role in phospholipid homeostasis on membrane system. Interestingly, as the most abundant phospholipid and the substrate of PLD, PC has never been found to play a role in vesicle trafficking. PC is synthesized on ER or Golgi apparatus and delivered to PM through membrane trafficking. Along this membrane trafficking process, PC contents gradually decreased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref042">42</xref>]. In addition, the distribution of PC is asymmetric on PM and endosomes, which predominantly lies on the exoplasmic leaflet of PM and the luminal side of the endosomes. Meanwhile, PC is symmetrically distributed on both sides of the ER membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref042">42</xref>]. It is unclear what is the significance of these phenomena, but it would be attractive if they represent a mechanism for vesicle trafficking. At least, we might hypothesize that the gradual reduction of PC content during vesicle trafficking is mediated by PC hydrolysis on the cytoplasmic side of the vesicle membrane catalyzed by cytoplasmic PLD. The hydrolysis of PC releases hydrosoluble choline into cytoplasm and leaves PA on the cytoplasmic side of the vesicle membrane. The vesicle-localized choline transporter could be important in this process, given that free choline produced by PC hydrolysis in the cytoplasmic side would inhibit PLD activity. Sequestration of choline into vesicles could help to shape asymmetric distribution of PC on vesicle membrane and PM, and thus to improve vesicle trafficking.</p>
<p>CTL1 was characterized as a TGN-localized choline transporter that regulates choline homeostasis in plant cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref014">14</xref>]. Our findings that CTL1 is involved in vesicle trafficking provide a substantial evidence to support above hypothesis. Interestingly, we observed that the proportions of PE and PC were increased in the cellular membrane system of <italic>sic1</italic>. As PE and PC are both substrates of PLDs, the high proportions of PE and PC in <italic>sic1</italic> may suggest that PLD activity was inhibited in <italic>sic1</italic> mutants, which was then supported by our PLD inhibitor experiment. Thus, it is plausible that CTL1 functions in sequestration of choline into TGN/endosomes to maintain high PA/low PC proportion on the cytoplasmic leaflet and high PC proportion on the luminal side of the vesicles, which might be required for vesicle trafficking. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that high concentrations of choline inhibit vesicle trafficking. Based on these results, we surmised that the involvement of CTL in vesicle trafficking may be explained by the fact that CTL1 functions in compartmentalizing choline in vesicles to create a low-choline cytosol environment for high PLD activity to promote vesicle trafficking.</p>
<p>Though the relative proportions of PC and PE in the membrane system were increased in <italic>sic1</italic> mutants, the absolute contents of them in the whole plant were both reduced. This result is consistent with previous observation that the absolute content of choline and PC were reduced in <italic>cher1-4</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref014">14</xref>]. However, we also found that not only PC, but all other major membrane lipids are decreased in <italic>sic1</italic>. This uniform reduction of all membrane lipids suggests that the mutation of <italic>CTL1</italic> leads to a shrink in producing cellular membrane system. Different membrane organelles are connected through vesicle trafficking. The reduced membrane lipids thus might be a result of vesicle trafficking defects of <italic>sic1</italic>. Of course, we could not exclude the possibility that the reduction of total membrane lipids in <italic>sic1</italic> is caused by lipid synthesis problems, if choline homeostasis could affect synthesis of all membrane lipids.</p>
<p>Except for vesicle trafficking process, the PD development also has a close connection with the lipid composition of the PM-lining PD (PD-PM) domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref043">43</xref>]. In a previous study, it was found that the major phospholipids in PD-PM were PE (approximately 45%) and PC (approximately 20%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref043">43</xref>]. As CTL1 regulates PC and PE homeostasis and their delivering to PM, the mislocalization of PDCBs in <italic>sic1</italic> could also be a result of composition changes of phospholipids on PM. Based on this hypothesis, the intracellular retention of PDCBs in <italic>sic1</italic> might not be a result of vesicle trafficking defect. Otherwise, the subcellular localization of PDCBs in PD should be mediated by some unknown secretory pathway, for example, directly via Golgi apparatus, which has been shown to play an essential role in formation of cell plate and PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref044">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002978.ref046">46</xref>].</p>
<p>Overall, both vesicle trafficking and ion homeostasis are fundamental biological processes. Here, we identified a new participant in both vesicle trafficking and ion homeostasis that links these two critical processes. Furthermore, we provided credible evidence of the existence of a direct chain of molecular events linking vesicle trafficking, ion transporter sorting, PD development, cell-to-cell communication, root patterning, and ion homeostasis. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of CTL1 in these processes need to be investigated further.</p>
