<abstract>
<p>The primate connectome, possessing a characteristic global topology and specific regional connectivity profiles, is well organized to support both segregated and integrated brain function. However, the organization mechanisms shaping the characteristic connectivity and its relationship to functional requirements remain unclear. The primate brain connectome is shaped by metabolic economy as well as functional values. Here, we explored the influence of two competing factors and additional advanced functional requirements on the primate connectome employing an optimal trade-off model between neural wiring cost and the representative functional requirement of processing efficiency. Moreover, we compared this model with a generative model combining spatial distance and topological similarity, with the objective of statistically reproducing multiple topological features of the network. The primate connectome indeed displays a cost-efficiency trade-off and that up to 67% of the connections were recovered by optimal combination of the two basic factors of wiring economy and processing efficiency, clearly higher than the proportion of connections (56%) explained by the generative model. While not explicitly aimed for, the trade-off model captured several key topological features of the real connectome as the generative model, yet better explained the connectivity of most regions. The majority of the remaining 33% of connections unexplained by the best trade-off model were long-distance links, which are concentrated on few cortical areas, termed long-distance connectors (LDCs). The LDCs are mainly non-hubs, but form a densely connected group overlapping on spatially segregated functional modalities. LDCs are crucial for both functional segregation and integration across different scales. These organization features revealed by the optimization analysis provide evidence that the demands of advanced functional segregation and integration among spatially distributed regions may play a significant role in shaping the cortical connectome, in addition to the basic cost-efficiency trade-off. These findings also shed light on inherent vulnerabilities of brain networks in diseases.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The intricate primate structural connectome, as the network substrate for distributed and integrated brain function, is shaped by fundamental physical factors and functional requirements. We addressed a trade-off between two competing basic factors of wiring cost and processing efficiency as well as additional requirements of functional segregation and integration on regional structural connectivity profiles by applying cost–efficiency trade-off model to reconstruct the <italic>macaque</italic> cortical network. We also compared this model with a generative model combining spatial distance and topological similarity. The trade-off model balancing the two basic factors recovered the main topological features that were explicitly specified as the objective functions in the generative model. Moreover, 67% of all connections and most regional connectivity profiles were recovered by the cost-efficiency trade-off, substantially outperforming the generative model. Most long-distance links, unexplained by the cost-efficiency trade-off, are concentrated on a few special regions constituting long-distance connectors (LDCs). Departing from previous findings, LDCs are mostly non-hubs, but are crucial for supporting functional integration and, counter-intuitively also for proper segregation across different hierarchical scales of the cortical network. The perspective of a trade-off between basic factors on brain structural organization sheds light on the organization principles and potential vulnerabilities of the cortical connectome.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The large-scale network of cortical areas in the brain supports and integrates brain functions that are distributed across spatially segregated regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref001">1</xref>]. It has been known for a long time that different regions have specialized roles in brain function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref003">3</xref>] and such segregated functions also need to be integrated, a finding supported by neuroimaging studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>The primate brain connectome is a physical network with nodes (cortical regions) and connections (fiber projections) embedded in Euclidean space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref014">14</xref>]. Exploring the factors that shape the spatial layout and the topological organization of the connectome is important for understanding the organization principles and structure-function relationships in the brain that support both segregated and integrated functioning at the systems level. It has been generally believed that the brain connectome reflects a trade-off between physical cost and functional requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref013">13</xref>]. Early work mainly focused on testing the hypothesis of wiring cost minimization using component placement optimization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref017">17</xref>], by fixing the topological connectivity of the network. While the placement of regions in some sub-systems (e.g., <italic>macaque</italic> monkey frontal cortex and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> ganglia) appeared to be optimal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref018">18</xref>], the global network appears not to minimize wiring cost, and comprises a substantial admixture of long-distance connections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref013">13</xref>]. A scheme of wiring cost minimization with fixed network topology does not permit to explicitly study the competition between physical cost and network functionality. However, it is also an unresolved question of how to quantify the functional requirements of the brain. In such a spatially embedded signal communication brain network, the interregional connection patterns may need to achieve a balance between reducing cost by sending most projections to spatially close nodes while still maintaining efficient communication among spatially distant components, which may be a possible function of some of the long-distance connections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref018">18</xref>]. The processing efficiency of a network, as measured by the inverse of shortest graph path-length, thus, may be employed to partially capture the network functionality for a quantitative study of the trade-off with the wiring cost minimization. This approach is indeed reasonable, since it has been found that the processing efficiency of the neural network is related to cognitive performance and dysfunction for brain disorders and diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>Recently, a great amount of attention has been given to characterizing important features of the organization of neural networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref027">27</xref>] and to exploring possible basic factors or simple rules which may play a role in generating such features. Graph theoretical approaches have revealed characteristic topological features of the cortical connectome, such as densely connected modules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref029">29</xref>], hubs with a large number of connections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref031">31</xref>], and rich-clubs with dense connections among hubs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref032">32</xref>]. Our recent work considered a trade-off between wiring cost and processing efficiency by fixing the spatial layout of the cortical areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref027">27</xref>] and showed that prominent network properties, such as module divisions and spatial positions of the hubs may be determined by such a trade-off [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref027">27</xref>]. Generative models combining observed spatial features (e.g., connectivity decaying with distance) and topological features (e.g., matching index measuring similar input and output patterns of nodes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref026">26</xref>] can reproduce some other statistical properties of the real connectivity, such as the distribution of degree, clustering, betweenness centrality and edge length. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005776.s004">S1 Fig</xref>, it is still challenging to reproduce the degree sequence of individual cortical nodes by the generative model. The heterogeneous degrees may be also affected by the cost-efficiency trade-off, as the degrees from the cost-efficiency optimized model are significantly correlated with the real degrees in different nervous systems (<italic>macaque</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref027">27</xref>]. More importantly, the different spatial and topological features of brain networks may not be independent, but rather be essentially related to basic physical constraints (e.g., wiring cost minimization) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref022">22</xref>]. For instance, the topological similarity (in terms of common neighbors) of different regions is also affected by the wiring cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref025">25</xref>]. Although the important statistical features in the neural networks may be captured by the combination of a few observed factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref034">34</xref>], a fundamental but still not well understood question is how the regional connectivity profiles as well as individual connections are shaped by some basic principles, for instance, wiring economy in trade-off with efficient processing. Which model can better capture the rules that shape the regional connectivity and its relationship to functions, a generative model combining different observed features or a trade-off model with basic factors of the wiring cost and processing efficiency? Is the arrangement of wiring-costly long-distance connections among different regions related to the segregation and integration of diverse brain functions? Exploring how such basic rules shape the cortical connectivity and its relationship to advanced functional requirements deepens the understanding of the relationships among the underlying design principles, wiring diagrams, functional performance, and potential vulnerability in the primate brain connectome.</p>
<p>Here we studied how the trade-off between two basic factors, the wiring cost and the topological processing efficiency, affects other topological features and regional connectivity profiles of the primate cortex structural connectome, and explored the relationship between the long-distance connections and functional requirements of segregation and integration. Previously, it was found that the degree distribution may be related to different factors, such as the cost-efficiency trade-off [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref027">27</xref>], or the combination of wiring distance and matching index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref014">14</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005776.s004">S1 Fig</xref>). Though it is significant, the relatively low correlation between the degrees in the real network and that from the cost-efficiency trade-off model (without fixing degrees) implies that the degree sequence of individual nodes is also shaped by other factors. Indeed, even though the generative model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref014">14</xref>] can closely recover the degree distribution, it cannot reliably reproduce the degree sequence of the nodes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005776.s004">S1 Fig</xref>). Therefore, in this study, the input and output degrees of the nodes are fixed as a constraint together with the spatial layout in the cost-efficiency trade-off model to obtain reconstructed networks from the combined optimization of wiring cost and processing efficiency. For comparison, we also consider the objective function of a generative model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref024">24</xref>] explicitly aimed at reproducing multiple statistical features of the connectome. We extended the generative model to consider the constraint of fixed degree as in the real network for a fair comparison with the trade-off model. We searched the best generative model with the most similar distribution of several features compared to the real <italic>macaque</italic> cortical network, and compared the performance of the optimized networks from the models in the recovery of topological features, regional connectivity profiles and individual connections. Our analyses showed that the trade-off outperforms the generative model in these aspects. The detailed comparison of real connectivity with the trade-off model for each region allowed us to determine (1) how much connectivity of the whole network and each region can be explained by the cost-efficiency trade-off, (2) how the unexplained connections are distributed among different functional regions and domains, and (3) what relationships exist between regions possessing many long-distance connections and the overarching functional features of segregation and integration. Our analyses provide evidence that the wiring cost-efficiency trade-off plays an essential role in determining regional cortical connectivity. However, additional requirements for proper segregation and integration of functions can strongly violate the cost minimization for some cortical regions and induce many long-range connections. In contrast to typical hubs identified by previous studies, these regions are typically non-hubs, but concentrate the long-distance projections in the network, acting as long-distance connectors (LDCs). While the organization of LDCs could reduce the metabolic and functional burden of outstanding hubs, such regions may also become spots of vulnerability in the primate brain network. Overall, the results provide support for, and insights into, the trade-off between physical cost and functional values of the primate brain connectome organization.</p>

<title>The primate cortical network displays a cost-efficiency trade-off</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g001">Fig 1A</xref> shows that the real network indeed displays a trade-off between wiring cost and processing efficiency. In this work, the cost-efficiency model refers to the case with fixed degrees as in the real network. Optimizing wiring cost on its own leads to a physically cheaper network, which is, however, less efficient; with the wiring cost <italic>l</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> reduced to 77.1% and the efficiency <italic>l</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub> increased to 105% of the real network. By contrast, optimizing the processing efficiency on its own increases efficiency (<italic>l</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub> reduced to 94.7%), but at the expense of wiring cost (<italic>l</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> increased to 113.7%).

<p>The rates of link recovery with respect to α in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g001">Fig 1B–1D</xref> clearly show that a trade-off between wiring cost and processing efficiency can give a better account of the real connectivity than the individual factors. We computed the recovery rate <italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub> for the connected pairs (A<sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> = 1) and <italic>r</italic><sub>0</sub> for the unconnected pairs of regions (A<sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> = 0), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec019">Material and methods</xref>). The maximal recovery occurs at α = 0.006 (<italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub> = 0.67, <italic>r</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.91), which is better than the recovery only for efficiency optimization at α = 0 (<italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub> = 0.45, <italic>r</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.84) or only for wiring cost optimization at α = 1.0 (<italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub> = 0.61, <italic>r</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.89). Both recovery rates are clearly higher than that (<italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub> = 0.52, <italic>r</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.80) for the synthetic network produced by the original generative model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref014">14</xref>] with the optimized parameters but without fixing degrees, and are also higher than that (<italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub> = 0.56, <italic>r</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.82) for extended generative model with fixed degrees. Since the extended generative model and the cost-efficiency model both have the same degree sequence as the real network, further comparison will be performed between these two models. Optimizing the wiring cost by itself at α = 1 can recover most of the short-distance connections (<italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub>≈ 1 for small distance, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) while suppressing the long-distance connections (<italic>r</italic><sub>0</sub>≈ 1 for large distance, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). However, by combination with the processing efficiency constraint at α = 0.006 (see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec012">Discussion</xref> for why such a small value is needed), the model network can clearly better recover the long-distance links (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, larger <italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub> at long distances, e.g., x &gt; 30 mm, especially as in the two longest bins in dashed circle) and also avoid false-positive links of pairs in the spatial neighborhood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, larger <italic>r</italic><sub>0</sub> at shorter distance, e.g., x &lt; 10 mm). Changes of the recovery rates <italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub> for long distance connections (&gt; 30 mm) and <italic>r</italic><sub>0</sub> for short-distance pairs (&lt;30 mm) with respect to α in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005776.s005">S2 Fig</xref> showed that the improvement of the recovery of long distance links is quite significant, although the absolute increase of the recovery rate <italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub> from 0.61 to 0.67 appears not as a big change. In comparison, the cost-efficiency trade-off model has a clearly higher recovery rate (larger <italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub>) and fewer false-positive links (larger <italic>r</italic><sub>0</sub>) than the generative model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). The cost-efficiency trade-off model better recovers the middle-range connections and performs especially well in avoiding the false-positive links at short distance, which clearly reflects the competition of wiring cost and processing efficiency, respectively, that is associated with short and long-distance connections.</p>
<p>These results show that efficient processing requires long-distance connections, but the real network possesses even more long-distance connections than the best trade-off model provides, suggesting that further functional factors are at work in the real network.</p>

<title>Good recovery of multiple statistical features of the connectome by the cost-efficiency model as well as by the generative model</title>

<p>For the <italic>macaque</italic> cortical network, the synthetic network of the original generative model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref014">14</xref>] with optimal parameter values was obtained by combining the spatial distance and the matching index, achieving the minimal energy E = 0.14, which was quite similar to the previous result for the human connectome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref014">14</xref>]. As for the extended model with fixed degrees, the minimal energy E = 0.2. This is plausible since under the additional constraint of fixed degrees the generative rules may have reduced freedom to recover the other statistical features. As for the cost-efficiency trade-off model, the energy E clearly decreased with α, reaching a minimum at α = 0.006 and the E value was very close to that of the optimal generative model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The result of the similarity of each statistical measure of clustering, betweenness centrality and edge length shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g002">Fig 2B–2D</xref> provides further support that the best trade-off model performs as least as well as, generally slightly better than the optimal generative model (fixed degrees). The cumulative distributions of the three measures were similar for the real cortical network, the optimal generative model and the best cost-efficiency trade-off model (insets of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g002">Fig 2B, 2C and 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, the results showed that a proper trade-off between cost and efficiency not only better recovers the individual links, but also simultaneously reproduces multiple statistical features of the real network as done by the generative model which explicitly targets such measures as its objective function.</p>

<p>Overall, there are 33% links in the real network that cannot be reliably recovered with the best cost-efficiency trade-off model (blue links in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The unrecovered links are mainly found within the visual system (38.6%) and between the somatosensory and frontal systems (25.6%); see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g003">Fig 3B</xref> for schematics of the distribution of unrecovered (blue) links in the real network. The unrecovered links are typically long-distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, blue bars). In the reconstructed network, these unrecovered links are redistributed (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005776.s006">S3 Fig</xref> for the adjacency matrix <inline-formula id="pcbi.1005776.e001"><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi.1005776.e001g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005776.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><mml:math display="inline" id="M1"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> of the reconstructed network and the schematics of redistribution of unrecovered links on the cortex), typically becoming short-distance links (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, green bars). Visual inspection of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g003">Fig 3A</xref> suggests that these unrecovered links (blue) are not uniformly distributed in the connectivity matrix, but are mainly concentrated on a few regions in the visual and somatosensory systems.</p>

Apart from the insignificant recovery rate of regions with degree &lt;20 as in the cost-efficiency trade-off model, there are 33 regions with Z<sub><italic>R</italic></sub>(<italic>i</italic>) &lt;1.65 (p&gt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005776.s007">S4B Fig</xref>), whose connectivity cannot be recovered by the generative model better than coincidence in random benchmarks (all with the same fixed degrees). This number is almost three times as the number 12 of the cost-efficiency trade-off model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Specifically, the recovery rate for the hub regions is high with a large Z-score in the cost-efficiency trade-off model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g004">Fig 4D</xref>), but is quite low for the generative model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005776.s007">S4C Fig</xref>). Since the cost-efficiency trade-off model not only better recovered the individual links (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g001">Fig 1</xref>), but also the regional connectivity profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g004">Fig 4</xref>), the analysis in the following sections focuses on the cost-efficiency trade-off model.</p>

<title>Special regions with a connectivity profile unexplained by cost-efficiency trade-off</title>
<p>Interestingly, there are six regions with Z<sub><italic>R</italic></sub>(<italic>i</italic>) &lt; − 1.65 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g004">Fig 4B</xref> (denoted by red stars), indicating that the connectivity of these regions in the real network is quite special: the best cost-efficiency trade-off model performs significantly worse than random coincidence for recovering the actual links of these regions. We systematically identified such regions with Z<sub><italic>R</italic></sub>(<italic>i</italic>) &lt; − 1.65 in the real network when compared to model networks at different α. It was found that the number of such regions is minimal at α = 0.006 where the overall recovery rates <italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>r</italic><sub>0</sub> are maximal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), while it is maximal at α = 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005776.s008">S5A Fig</xref>). The total number of regions with insignificant recovery rate (Z<sub><italic>R</italic></sub>(<italic>i</italic>) &lt; 1.65) also shows a minimum at α = 0.006 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005776.s008">S5B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The six core regions in the real network whose connectivity profile is unexplained by cost-efficiency trade-off, identified by comparison with the best trade-off model at α = 0.006, are visual (46, FEF) and somatosensory (23, 29, 3b, 5) regions. They are also among the regions with Z<sub><italic>R</italic></sub>(<italic>i</italic>) &lt; − 1.65 at different α. Except for region 46, five regions have intermediate degree ranks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g004">Fig 4D</xref>, red stars, 41 &lt; degree &lt; 70). In total, there are 381 links from these six core regions, but they contribute 266 (31.4%) of unrecovered connections. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g004">Fig 4D</xref>, we also marked out six more regions (2, AITD, STPa, 3a, SII and 7b), having intermediate or large degrees, but with a recovery rate not significantly lower than for random benchmarks (− 1.65 &lt; Z<sub><italic>R</italic></sub>(<italic>i</italic>) &lt; 1.65), by blue stars. Together with the former core six regions, these 12 regions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g004">Fig 4E</xref> for the positions) with intermediate or large degrees but poor recovery contribute about 60% of the unrecovered links.</p>
<p>The connectivity of the six core regions and the other six regions in the real network and in the best cost-efficiency trade-off model at α = 0.006 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g005">Fig 5</xref>. In the real network, these regions tend to connect with remote targets, but in the reconstructed network they mainly connect to spatially neighboring regions. Therefore, for all the 12 regions, the wiring length <italic>l</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> in the real network is large, very close to, or even larger than <italic>l</italic><sub><italic>pran</italic></sub> in the random networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, <italic>l</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>/<italic>l</italic><sub><italic>pran</italic></sub> ≳ 1 for the stars). Strikingly, the six core regions involve almost all of the most distant connections in the real network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g004">Fig 4F</xref>, red bars) and the other six regions occupy a significant portion of intermediate-to-distant links (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g004">Fig 4F</xref>, blue bars). Overall, the six core regions and the 12 regions contribute 38.1% and 64.6% of the long-distance links (x &gt; 30 mm), respectively. The above analysis clearly shows that the real network possesses more long-distance links and that they are distributed highly non-uniformly, concentrated on few regions, forming long-distance connectors (LDCs).</p>

<p>Previous studies have focused on hubs with a large number of connections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref036">36</xref>]. Interestingly, however, the ratio of the wiring length <italic>l</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> of the hubs in the real network to <italic>l</italic><sub><italic>pran</italic></sub> in the random network, which is just around 1, is not as high as for the LDCs (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g004">4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g006">6A</xref>).

Thus, the total wiring distance for the hub regions is more or less the same as for the LDCs, some of which is even less than LDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g006">Fig 6C</xref>).</p>

<title>LDCs underlie hierarchical modules and a dense network group for functional segregation and integration</title>
<p>What could be the functional impact of the LDC regions which strongly violate the wiring cost economy of the network? In neural systems it is desirable to achieve a balance of functional segregation and integration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref038">38</xref>]. Network substrates providing such a balance may be densely connected modules which are not too strongly affected by other systems but are still properly interlinked by sparser connections among the modules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref040">40</xref>]. More generally, a hierarchy of modules can provide segregation and integration across scales of organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref041">41</xref>]. Here, in order to explore the functional influence of the LDCs, we compared the functional segregation and integration of three types of networks. They were the real biological network, the reconstructed network (at α = 0.006) with only about 30% of total links different from the real network, and the R-network (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec019">Methods</xref>) in which the concentration of long-distance links on LDCs was destroyed, but the wiring cost was the same as in the real network.</p>
<sec id="sec008">
<title>A. The rich hierarchical network structure does not exist when the concentration of long-distance connections to LDCs is destroyed</title>
<p>We obtained hierarchical trees (dendrograms, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec019">Methods</xref>) for the three networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g007">Fig 7A–7C</xref>). Applying a threshold value to the hierarchy tree (e.g., indicated by the horizontal dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g007">Fig 7A</xref>), we obtained module partitions, and computed the modularity Q [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref041">41</xref>] for the partition at different threshold values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). Interestingly, the real network allows for a very complex hierarchical modular structure across many scales (levels of resolution), corresponding to several flat steps and jumps of Q in a broad range of thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g007">Fig 7D</xref>, red line). The best trade-off model (without many long-distance connections) still showed some large modules at large thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g007">Fig 7B</xref>), but submodules were destroyed (the trees inside some large modules are very similar to the random network in the inset), and Q changed continuously without clear steps and jumps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g007">Fig 7D</xref>, blue line). Basically, the reconstructed network has a prominent modular organization only at one level (one relatively flat regime of Q around threshold ∼ 0.5). In the R-network, which preserves most links and total cost as in real network but randomizes unrecovered connections of LDCs (mostly long-range connections), there appear to be two large modules at a narrow range of thresholds (∼0.6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g007">Fig 7C and 7D</xref>, green line), but the trees within the modules are very similar to random networks. The maximal modularity Q in the real network is larger than that for the other two networks. Thus, the real network allows for a complex hierarchical modular structure across a large range of scales when compared to the reconstructed and R-networks.</p>

<title>B. LDCs allow proper functional segregation</title>
<p>We performed a detailed analysis of the matching between the connectivity modules represented by the subtrees and the actual functional cortical divisions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec019">Methods</xref>). We first considered the hierarchical tree of the real network in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g007">Fig 7A</xref>. At least five functional systems of the <italic>macaque</italic> cortex can be recognized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref003">3</xref>], which are visual, somatosensory, motor, temporal and frontal divisions (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g003">Fig 3</xref>). In the real network, the regions within each subtree are spatially clustered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g008">Fig 8B</xref>), thus, they have a smaller spatial distance and denser connectivity than those between sub-trees (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005776.s009">S6 Fig</xref>). If one sub-tree has a strong overlap with specific functional subdivisions, without being mixed with many other functional systems, then this dense module is able to strongly support the specialized functional modality of the local regions. The matching between network modules and functional subdivisions is graphically presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g008">Fig 8A–8C</xref> for the real network. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g008">Fig 8A</xref> shows that the connectivity in the real network provides network substrates for functional segregation. Except for the temporal cortex with only 4 regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref042">42</xref>], each functional system (visual, somatosensory, motor and frontal) has at least one supporting modules (subtree), and the visual and somatosensory systems are maintained by two subtrees (the fraction of functional regions taken by the trees is listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005776.s002">S2 Table</xref>). Five sub-trees have a 100% match with a particular function, and only one sub-tree (Tree 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g008">Fig 8A–8C</xref>) has one mismatched region. Together, the six trees having a high match with one of the functional subsystems represent about three quarters (72.7%) of the total cortical regions. The remaining regions are not clustered into a tree with a dominant function, and were accordingly assigned to the “non-cluster” pie in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g008">Fig 8C</xref>.</p>

<p>The same procedure was applied to the reconstructed network (at α = 0.006), in which one third of the intermediate and long-distance connections are rewired into short-distance connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g003">Fig 3</xref>), and R-networks, in which the links of LDCs are randomized while keeping the same distribution of physical distance, so that the concentration of long-distance links on the original regions of LDCs is destroyed. In the reconstructed network, there are only two trees showing dominance by the regions in the original visual and frontal systems, but each connectivity module is mixed with many regions from other functional systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). This is due to the fact that the somatosensory and motor regions are either densely connected with the visual or frontal systems after reconstruction. In the rewired R-network, 3 trees are obtained with dominance by the visual and frontal systems, but two trees are strongly mixed with many other functional regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g008">Fig 8E</xref>). In both reconstructed and R-networks, the approximate separation of the original visual and frontal systems into different modules is due to the spatial separation of these two divisions and based on short-range connections within each division (2/3 of the links, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, red, are recovered in the reconstructed network and are common in the three types of networks analyzed here). Thus, the segregation into 5 functional subdivision cannot be properly realized by the network connectivity in the reconstructed and R-networks. This is surprising, because R-networks and the real cortical network share at least 80% of common, short-range links.</p>

<title>C. LDCs have high functional diversity coefficient and form a dense group for functional integration</title>
<p>We examined how the 12 LDC regions are distributed among the different hierarchical sub-trees. In the real network, the 12 LDC regions are placed in different sub-trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g008">Fig 8A and 8C</xref>), seven in two somatosensory trees, three in one of the visual sub-trees and the other two in the non-cluster pie. Notably, most of the LDC regions either appear near the boundary of a hierarchical sub-tree, or between different sub-trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g008">Fig 8A</xref>), implying that they have a large proportion of connections with other trees and play a role in the communication among different functional modalities. The role of different cortical regions in inter-modal interactions was quantified by the distribution of the links of a region among different functional regions in the real network, using the functional diversity coefficient <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> of a region (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec019">Methods</xref>).<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> of the real network is shown with respect to the Z-score of the recovery of the real links by the best trade-off model at α = 0.006 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). The 12 LDC regions typically show high functional diversity coefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g009">Fig 9A</xref>, red and blue stars), except for frontal and temporal regions FEF, AITd and STPa. These three visual regions have <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> = 0 since they only form connections within the visual system. However, these regions mainly have long-distance connections to spatially distant visual regions, and such distant connections cannot be well recovered by the trade-off model. It is important to stress that although many LDC regions (3a, STPa, FEF, 3b, 2, 29, 5, AITd and 23) just possess average degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g004">Fig 4D</xref>), the links of these regions are distributed uniformly across different functional modalities, and their diversity coefficient is comparable to the real hub regions 7b and 46. Apart from the 12 LDC regions, frontal regions (mostly staying in the dashed circle at the top right part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g009">Fig 9A</xref>) have high <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, since they connect within frontal, and with motor, somatosensory and temporal systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), and these systems are spatially close to the frontal system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Such economic links can also be well recovered (large Z-score). As for some motor regions, the high <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> could be attributed to the fluctuation from the small degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g004">Fig 4D</xref>).</p>

<p>From these observations one can conclude that the LDC regions act as links among spatially segregated and specialized functional regions. LDCs also form densely connected groups (red line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g009">Fig 9B</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec019">Method</xref> for the dense group measure θ), a structural substrate for integrating information collected by these regions from segregated functional sub-systems. The dense group connections among LDCs are shown in Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g008">8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g009">9B</xref>. We examined how the whole dense group of 12 LDCs distributes links to different functional subtrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). Most (84%) of the external connections of the dense group are distributed across the six functional trees (e.g., 33.4% of connections with two subtrees of visual regions, 31.4% with the subtrees of frontal, 11.4% with two subtrees of somatosensory, and 3.4% with motor). Thus, the dense group of LDC regions overlaps on the subtrees, to integrate information of the functional modules. Previous study revealed that the visual system possesses a hierarchical structure with multiple (10) levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref002">2</xref>], starting from cortical areas V1 and V2 staying at the bottom levels as input regions. As a direct evidence of the role of functional integration of LDCs, five of them (FEF, STPa, AITd, 7b and 46), which are involved in visual processing, are regions all staying at high levels (at the top three levels which are composed of a total of 13 regions) of visual information processing flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref002">2</xref>]. This finding of a dense group of LDCs with intermediate node degree is quite different from previous analyses of rich-clubs formed by degree-rich nodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref032">32</xref>]. The conventional rich-club only includes the seven biggest hubs (MT/V5, 46, 7a, 7b, LIPv, LIPd, VIPl) with the connection density among them just slightly beyond one standard deviation of the random benchmarks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g009">Fig 9C</xref>), not as significant as the dense group among LDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). When the concentration of the long-distance links on LDCs is destroyed in the R-network, these regions no longer form a dense group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g009">Fig 9B</xref>, green line). In summary, the topological features of LDCs suggest that they are essential for both functional segregation and integration in the cortical network.</p>

<title>Reliability of the findings of LDCs</title>
<p>The primate cortical network analyzed in the present study was based on a previous dataset collated from the anatomical literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref043">43</xref>], and there could be concern that the connections of some cortical regions may be incompletely characterized. Recently, a more systematic tract-tracing compilation of cortical connectivity of the non-human primate brain, including the relative weights of fiber projections was published, but only a partial square matrix dataset for 29 out of 91 targeted regions was presented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref045">45</xref>]. While this relatively small dataset is not quite suitable for the trade-off modeling approach, it still allowed us to assess the reliability of our main findings (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec019">Material and methods</xref>).</p>
<p>First, the primary dataset and the Markov et al. dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref045">45</xref>] are consistent in different aspects when considering the overlapping subsets of nodes. <italic>(i)</italic> Most links within functional systems largely overlap in two datasets. However, the new dataset revealed more intermediate and long distance connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g010">Fig 10A</xref>), which mostly consist of links among different sub-functions, e.g., between visual and frontal systems; <italic>(ii)</italic> the average weight for the links of a given physical distance decays with the distance for the links found in both datasets and the links overlapping with the present dataset appear much stronger in weight than those newly found links revealed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref046">46</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g010">Fig 10B</xref>). This comparison confirmed that our dataset collated from the literature is reliable when compared to the more systematic new dataset, since it captured the significant and strong projections. The weaker links revealed in the new dataset would not make much contribution to the overall wiring cost in terms of neuron-to-neuron projection.</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we examined whether the observed concentration of the long-distance links on a few LDC regions from the global network of our dataset, i.e., the formation of LDCs, is also apparent in the new dataset. In particular, 4 of the 12 LDCs were examined in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref045">45</xref>], including 2 core LDC regions (5 and 46) and non-core LDC regions (2 and 7b). Similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g004">Fig 4F</xref>, we checked how much fraction of the projection weights in the distance bin was concentrated on these 4 regions in the new dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g010">Fig 10C</xref>). It is very interesting to see that, although the new dataset contains only partial connections (i.e., only the input projections), the distribution pattern in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g010">Fig 10C</xref> is very similar to that of the global network in our data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g004">Fig 4F</xref>: the two core LDC regions 5 and 46 (1/12 of the 24 target regions), occupy 21.5% of the weight of long-distance projections (&gt; 30mm) in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref045">45</xref>]. The other two regions, 2 and 7b, occupy a significant portion of intermediate-distance projections (20 ∼ 35 mm). In all, the 4 regions (1/6 of 24 regions) contribute 54.8% of the weight of long-distance projections (&gt; 30 mm).</p>
<p>It is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g004">Fig 4C</xref> in our global dataset that for the LDC regions, the total connection cost <italic>l</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> of the region in the real network with respect to that in the corresponding randomized networks, l<sub><italic>p</italic></sub>/<italic>l</italic><sub><italic>pran</italic></sub>, is close to, or larger than, 1. In the Markov et al. data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref045">45</xref>], we first calculated the wiring cost, then calculated a similar weighted ratio l<sub><italic>p</italic></sub>/<italic>l</italic><sub><italic>pran</italic></sub> after incorporating the projection weights (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec019">Methods</xref>). In this case, the weight value of links to the same targeted region is comparable and reflects the projection density from different sources. The wiring cost in the new dataset was calculated by the weighted distance. Since weight information reflects the number of fiber projections, the weighted distance more accurately describes the corresponding wiring cost. However, the weighted network has incomplete cortical coverage (only about 1/3 of the cortex); thus, we can only check the consistency by comparing the weighted ratio for the 24 targeted regions to the ratio in our dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) which was obtained from binary global networks, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g010">Fig 10D</xref>. Interestingly, the ratio l<sub><italic>p</italic></sub>/<italic>l</italic><sub><italic>pran</italic></sub> of most regions in our data is proportional to that in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref045">45</xref>]. Except for region 46, the remaining 3 LDC regions 5, 2 and 7b appearing in the 24 targeted regions in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref045">45</xref>] all have the largest l<sub><italic>p</italic></sub>/<italic>l</italic><sub><italic>pran</italic></sub> values, which is also clearly illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g010">Fig 10E</xref>. As stated in Material and Methods, three regions (9/46d, 9/46v, 46d) in the [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref045">45</xref>] data correspond to region 46 in our data. Thus, the calculation of the fraction of region 46 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref045">45</xref>] actually involves three targeted regions, thus may have some ambiguity. Besides the three LDC regions 5, 2 and 7b, there are several regions with a large ratio of the wiring cost in the actual network relative to random benchmarks, such as the motor regions 6vb and 4, and the visual regions TPOc and TPOr. In our global network data, these regions have small degrees, and the link recovery by the trade-off model is not strongly significant (Z-score in [− 1.65, 1.65]).</p>
<p>To summarize, the comparison of our global dataset with the more recent, partial dataset of Markov et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref045">45</xref>] showed that our main results are reliable and robust. Particularly, the connections in our data correspond to strong projections in the new data. The new study revealed that (1) there are even more long-distance connections, which are typically much weaker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g010">Fig 10A and 10B</xref>); (2) a few LDCs identified in our dataset of the global network are included in the new dataset (regions 2, 5, 7b, 46), and reassuringly, these four regions also contain most of the long-distance connections in the new dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g010">Fig 10C</xref>), up to 54.8% of the total weights of long-distance links (x &gt; 30 mm); (3) the total projection cost of these regions (except for region 46 that is represented with some ambiguity) is quite large with respect to random benchmarks in the data of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref045">45</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g010">Fig 10D and 10E</xref>). These observations give us confidence that our main finding, of LDC regions violating the cost-efficiency trade-off, likely still holds when the dataset of Markov et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref045">45</xref>] is expanded to an even more complete connectivity matrix in the future.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study investigated the intricate connectivity diagram of the primate cortex, particularly basic factors such as wiring cost and processing efficiency that are underlying regional connectivity profiles and the brain’s relationship with advanced functional requirements of segregation and integration. Most (67%) of the connections in the <italic>macaque</italic> monkey cortex can be explained by a trade-off between these two basic but competing factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g001">Fig 1</xref>), higher than the proportion of connections (56%) explained by the rewired network with fixed degrees following the same wiring rules as in the generative model in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref014">14</xref>]. The trade-off model also explained the regional connectivity profiles better than the generative model under the same constraint of fixed degrees. Thus, the connectivity of most regions follows the cost-efficiency trade-off. However, a few long-distance connector regions (LDCs) that concentrate a large portion of the long-distance projections are particularly costly in terms of wiring and are poorly explained by the cost-efficiency trade-off (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g005">5</xref>). Our analysis further provided evidence that the formation of LDCs could be attributed to support advanced functional requirements of the cortical network. First, LDCs (which mainly have intermediate degrees) allow the formation of a hierarchical modular network organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Second, LDCs are crucial for proper functional segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g008">Fig 8A and 8C–8E</xref>). Third, LDCs project their connections rather uniformly across different functional modalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). Fourth, LDCs, forming a dense group overlapping with all functional modalities, allow for efficient communication and integration of the spatially segregated and functionally specialized subsystems (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g009">9B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g008">8B</xref>). Thus LDCs play an important role in the balance of functional segregation and integration, at the expense of larger wiring cost. These observations reflect more deeply a trade-off between physical cost and functional values in the organization of the primate connectome.</p>

<title>Cost-efficiency trade-off model versus generative models</title>
<p>Recently, research using generative models has made progress in understanding complex brain network features, by employing a few simple spatial embedding and topological connections rules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref026">26</xref>]. These generative models produce synthetic networks by systematically searching for parameters that explicitly attempt to reproduce multiple statistical features of the real connectome, namely the distribution of clustering, betweenness centrality, edge length, and so on. Generative models showed that projecting connections following a decay of the connectivity probability with distance as observed in the data can recover some statistical properties of real brain networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref026">26</xref>]. Some studies also found that the combination of various topological or spatial features well recovers the macroscopic topological properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref047">47</xref>]. Notably, these observed features may be results of basic constraints and organization principles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref022">22</xref>]. For example, the topological feature of common neighbors may be rooted in the wiring cost dependence of connections in spatially embedded networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref025">25</xref>]. The connection probability following a distance decay could be the consequence of wiring cost economy, together with the functional requirement of maintaining efficient propagation of signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref014">14</xref>]. Different from approaches using some observed features to recover the other statistical properties of primate brain connectomes, the aim of the present study was to explore the role played by the two fundamental factors of wiring cost and global processing efficiency on the statistical features, the regional connectivity profiles as well as individual links of the <italic>macaque</italic> cortical network. Remarkably, we showed that the cost-efficiency trade-off model that has only one parameter and that does not integrate multiple topological and statistical features into the objective function can also recover these multiple features as well as the optimal generative model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g002">Fig 2</xref>), and in addition can much better recover the connectivity matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g001">Fig 1</xref>). In the cost-efficiency trade-off model, short and long-distance links can be more clearly related to the trade-off between cost and processing efficiency, and the connectivity profiles of most of the regions can be well recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g004">Fig 4</xref>), except for a few special LDC areas with a particularly large number of long-distance links. The finding of the LDCs revealed new organization features of the cortical connectome and pointed at additional functional requirements of segregation and integration. The generative model, by contrast, did not well recover both short and long-distance links of many areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>), and it is not as intuitive as for the trade-off model how to associate those uncovered links to functional values. A good recovery across multiple statistical features, regional connectivity profiles and individual connections in the trade-off model provides strong evidence to support the hypothesis of a trade-off of physical cost and functional values in the brain connectome.</p>
<p>Our findings went beyond previous observations on structural and functional constraints on cortical networks. We found that some subsystems, such as the frontal subsystem, are almost fully recovered by the wiring cost minimization only (α = 1), with a recovery rate of 0.98 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g003">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g004">4A</xref>), consistent with previous reports based on component placement optimization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref048">48</xref>]). However, several other studies showed that connections in most subsystems are clearly not optimized for wiring cost, and the whole network is not minimally wired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref018">18</xref>] when the network topology is fixed in component placement optimization.</p>
<p>Many essential topological properties of brain networks, such as the coexistence of modules and hubs, may be shaped by a trade-off between the wiring cost and processing efficiency when the reconstructed network is only required to have the same total number of links as the real network, as shown in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref027">27</xref>]. Notably, the original generative model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref014">14</xref>] with the combination of spatial distance and topological factors was not able to reliably recover the individual degrees (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005776.s004">S1A Fig</xref>), although it could better recover the degree distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005776.s004">S1C Fig</xref>) than the cost-efficiency trade-off model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref027">27</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005776.s004">S1D Fig</xref>). The trade-off model without fixing the degree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref027">27</xref>] can also generate heterogeneous degrees due to the inhomogeneous spatial layout of the areas, and the degrees in the model network are significantly correlated with the degrees in the real network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref027">27</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005776.s004">S1B Fig</xref>). However, the correlation value (0.28) was not very high. Thus, these results suggested that the degrees are partially affected by the cost-efficiency trade-off, but it is still likely that the degrees are also affected by other functional requirements. In the present work, we thus fixed the input and output degrees of each node as in the real network, both for the cost-efficiency trade-off model and for the generative model. Preserving the degrees of each region thus already put some effects of the cost-efficiency trade-off on the benchmarks for reconstructing networks. Similar schemes of generating random benchmarks while preserving the node degrees have been widely used in network analysis. When fixing the degrees, some areas with a large degree are forced to have some long-distance connections, which increases the global efficiency and limits the freedom of variation of the network organization. Indeed, the graph distance <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub> (the reverse of efficiency) varies much less (1.58~1.74) between efficiency optimal (α = 0) and cost optimal (α = 1) networks for fixed degrees, just half the range (1.62~1.91) compared to the model without fixing degrees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref027">27</xref>]. Thus, the cost minimization (α = 1) under fixed degrees already effectively reflects some trade-off between cost and efficiency, and the overall recovery rate of connections is already larger than 60% in the <italic>macaque</italic> cortical network. In the present work, a further trade-off with efficiency refined the cost-efficiency trade-off and further increased the recovery rates. In this case, rewiring a link from short to long distance more strongly affected the wiring cost <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>, but only slightly decreased the graph distance <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub> (or increase the processing efficiency). Thus, more weight was put on the efficiency to achieve a trade-off, corresponding to an α value close to zero (0.006). However, it is important to stress that cost minimization is still effective here. The efficiency optimal network without the cost constraint (α = 0) had a much larger wiring cost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) and much lower recovery rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, inset). The further trade-off with the processing efficiency clearly improved the recovery of some long-distance connections in the network, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005776.s005">S2 Fig</xref>, and simultaneously abolished many false-positive links at short distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g001">Fig 1D</xref>).</p>

<title>The functional role of LDCs is unexplained by the cost-efficiency trade-off model</title>
<p>We further studied the distribution of the long-distance connections on different regions beyond the basic cost-efficiency trade-off and its relationship with functional segregation and integration. Except for regions with low degrees and unreliable statistics, there are only a few regions with intermediate and large degrees, whose connectivity profiles are not well explained by the basic cost-efficiency trade-off model. Our findings elucidated that these regions (LDCs) appear to be crucial for maintaining advanced functional requirements of segregation and integration.</p>
<p>As for functional integration, previous studies have predominantly focused on hubs with the largest number of connections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref049">49</xref>]. Recently, the grouping of such high-degree regions as a densely connected core or “rich-club” in the human and non-human primate brains has attracted great attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref050">50</xref>]. Consistent with the previous work, the hubs for the <italic>macaque</italic> cortical network, especially most frontal regions, such as 11, 12o, 12l, 13a, 24, and LIP, form a rich-club and have high diversity coefficient among different functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). Interestingly, these regions project most connections at short distance, and can be recovered well by the trade-off model (black triangles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Together with our previous findings that hubs are located close to the regional geographical centers, such an organization is wiring economical for the high-degree hubs. Previous study has also revealed that the regions with long-distance connections have a high diversity coefficient among different modules in the mouse brain connectome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref026">26</xref>]. Here we showed consistent results in the <italic>macaque</italic> connectome that there are also LDC areas possessing a high diversity coefficient, but these areas mainly have intermediate degrees and are non-hubs structurally, while also forming a strong dense group. These regions appear to be crucial for integration among functional clusters of the <italic>macaque</italic> brain connectome. Indeed, most LDCs correspond to functional hubs, some of which belong to the default mode network. In fMRI studies, functional hubs are detected as regions of a high density of functional connectivity with other regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref036">36</xref>]. Previous studies on the intrinsic activity of the brain identified functional hubs such as the precuneus, posterior and anterior cingulate gyrus, dorsomedial frontal cortex, as well as inferior parietal regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref051">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref052">52</xref>]. Among the LDCs that we identified for the Macaque structural network, there are several regions overlapping with the functional hubs in human or <italic>macaque</italic> brain, such as areas 7b (inferior parietal cortex) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref004">4</xref>], 23 (posterior cingulate cortex) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref053">53</xref>], 46 (DLPFC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref006">6</xref>], and AITd (anterior inferior temporal cortex). Notably, area 23 and 46 are also hubs in the human structure network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref054">54</xref>]. Some of the LDC regions, for instance, areas 23, SII and 46, also overlap with the default mode network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref055">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref056">56</xref>]. The overlapping of some LDCs, consisting mainly of non-hubs and a few hubs in structural connectivity, with functional hubs and the default mode network, suggests that concentration of long-distance connections on LDCs may constitute an anatomical substrate for functional integration, in addition to possessing an intermediate or large number of connections. It would be interesting to extend a similar analysis to human brain to investigate whether there exist long-distance connections concentrated on LDCs that also play important roles in functional performance.</p>
<p>However, counter-intuitively, the formation of LDCs also appears important for proper functional segregation. Recent fMRI studies showed that cognitive functional domains are segregated into different clusters of functional connectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref057">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref058">58</xref>]. Different from these studies, the current work did not involve functional imaging data for <italic>macaque</italic>. The clustering analysis here is applied to the structural cortical network and compared with the anatomical functional domains distinguished by cytoarchitectonic and myeloarchitectonic features in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref003">3</xref>]. In the future, it will be interesting to compare the structural clusters with functional modules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref008">8</xref>]. Our results demonstrated that, under the basic cost-efficiency trade-off, the modeled connectome has a much smaller number of long-distance connections, and only possesses two large functional domains, namely, visual and frontal systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g007">Fig 7D</xref>), mixed with areas from other systems. It appears somewhat counter-intuitive that the real network with many more long-distance connections possesses an intricate segregation of the system into visual, frontal, somatosensory and motor functional subsystems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Here the important point is that the long-distance connections are largely concentrated to LDCs, so that modules can be better preserved by the intra-modular, short-distance connections, and are not strongly mixed by the inter-module long-distance connections. Indeed, if we preserve a similar number of long-distance connections in the real network, but rewire them to avoid high concentration on particular nodes (i.e., abolishing LDCs), the partition of modules (clusters) and the matching with functional divisions is destroyed (R-network, Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g007">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g008">8</xref>).</p>

<title>Insights into organization principles and vulnerability of the connectome from cost-efficiency trade-off</title>
<p>Importantly, our findings provide new insights on the organizing principles of primate cortical connectivity. (1) A large number of white matter projections follow the trade-off between the parsimonious requirements of economical wiring and efficient processing, to group the cortical areas into spatially segregated functional domains. (2) To support integrated functional performance, the hubs (e.g., mostly in the frontal system and visual systems) with short-distance connections link the segregated functions of neighboring regions. (3) Furthermore, to integrate the multimodal functions of remote regions, it appears to be necessary to sacrifice the wiring economy of a few regions (i.e., LDCs). Indeed, LDCs concentrate nearly 2/3 of long-distance connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g004">Fig 4F</xref>) and form a dense group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g009">Fig 9C</xref>), although most LDCs have average degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). In this way, the organization of intermediate-degree LDCs not only shares the load of integrating spatially segregated functions, but also reduces the wiring cost burden of the outstanding hub nodes by absorbing most of the long-distance connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g006">Fig 6</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, concentrating the long-distance connections on LDCs also allows to maintain a proper segregation of the system into intricate subsystems for specialized processing. These new findings provide further support for the hypothesis of a trade-off between physical cost and functional values in the brain network organization.</p>
<p>Importantly, LDCs might be spots of vulnerability in the brain network. Recent studies suggested that functional hubs partially overlap with regions of high metabolic rate and deposition of disease-related agents (such as Amyloid plaque) observed from PET data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref059">59</xref>], and are also vulnerable in various neurodegenerative diseases and mental disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref060">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref062">62</xref>]. Several studies have started to reveal the importance of long-distance connections for the energy consumption in human functional networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref063">63</xref>]. Other work also indicated relationships between structural hubs and brain disorders or diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref019">19</xref>]. Intuitively, structural hub regions with a large number of fiber connections may have high metabolic demands, and therefore become vulnerable in disorders and diseases. On the one hand, attaching a large portion of the long-distance links to intermediate-degree LDCs may reduce the risk of energy deficits in hubs. On the other hand, non-hub LDCs, carrying a strong inter-functional communication and integration load based on long-distance connections, might also become metabolically highly demanding, and may also be vulnerable to disruptions in energy supply and other attacks. Indeed, some LDCs correspond to vulnerable regions, such as areas 23 and 46, in chronic progressive neurodegenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref064">64</xref>]. Our work, thus, provides a fresh perspective for investigating the relationship between multiple constraints and disease vulnerability in the structural and functional networks of the human brain.</p>

<title>Reliability and robustness of the findings</title>
<p>In the current work, our results are subject to some inherent limitations imposed by the experimental data. For example, recent data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref045">45</xref>] provided weighted <italic>macaque</italic> cortical connectivity, which we used to test the reliability of our findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g010">Fig 10</xref>). However, the weighted dataset, while more detailed than previous data collations, is far from complete. Thus, it will be promising to re-explore basic factors on structural connectivity once a more complete weighted connectome is available.</p>
<p>Presently, there may be concern that incompleteness of the CoCoMac database may contribute to our finding that most of the LDCs are not high-degree hubs of the network. The Markov et al. data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref037">37</xref>] showed that many brain regions are connected by very weak fiber projections, leading to high density of binary connectivity at the area level, which might imply that there are not really any outstanding hubs. Measuring degrees by binary connectivity, that is, regarding many very weak links as equally important as the strong ones appears not very appropriate, given that the weight values span orders of magnitude. Consequently, the total weight of a node may be a more reasonable measure of degree (appropriately reflecting connectivity at the level of the relative fiber density), and the total weights are mainly contributed by the strong links. Indeed, the total input weight of the areas covered so far is quite heterogeneous. Thus, it is likely that the network still has hubs in terms of total node weight, if the Markov et al. data are extended to provide complete cortical coverage.</p>
<p>Our detailed comparison between the two data sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g010">Fig 10</xref>) showed that our primary dataset, which was collated and further developed from CoCoMac, is reliable and captures the majority of the significant and strong projections for the corresponding areas covered in the Markov et al. data. Therefore, measuring the binary degree in our un-weighted global network appears as a reasonable estimation of the total weights of a node. Our observation, that four of the LDCs identified in our dataset also concentrate the majority of the long-distance projection weights in the Markov et al. data, suggested that the LDCs would remain as LDCs if the new data set would be completed. It is also not very likely that these areas will be drastically changed to hubs in terms of total weights, which could happen only if many and a large portion of strong links were missed for these areas in the CoCoMac data. Therefore, it will be interesting to test if LDCs can indeed be identified as non-hubs of the structural connectivity once a more complete weighted connectome becomes available.</p>

<title>Limitations and outlook</title>
<p>The cost-efficiency trade-off model with fixed degrees can recover most of the connections of the whole <italic>macaque</italic> cortical network, which allows to reveal new organization features by further analysis of a few regions with low recovery rates by the model. However, fixing degrees limits the capacity of the model to explore the mechanisms underlying important features in the degree sequences, such as degree distribution, hubs and degree correlations. Further studies of the cost-function trade-off may need to develop more sophisticated quantification of the functional values related to degrees in order to better elucidate the underlying mechanisms.</p>
<p>While the global efficiency of the interregional cortical network may partially capture the basic functionality of the brain at the systems level by using the strongly simplified assumption of identical network nodes, it should be stressed that actual brain functions are implemented by highly specialized cortical areas, comprising heterogeneous local circuits and displaying complex dynamical activity. Interestingly, these two levels of organization are also interrelated. For example, similarity in regional neuronal density is closely related to the probability of interregional connection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref065">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref068">68</xref>], and the regional synaptic spine density (and consequently the response time of the local circuit) is related to a gradient of cortical areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref069">69</xref>] (which is also roughly related to the total degrees of areas). Therefore, most likely the basic principle of a trade-off between physical cost and functional values could be operating to shape the network structure and dynamics across different levels. Our own recent work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref070">70</xref>] showed that the co-organization of salient multi-scale dynamical features as typically observed in electrophysiological experiments, including irregular firing of individual neurons, clustered firing of neuron groups in the form of critical avalanches and the emergence of stochastic oscillations of the population, indeed reflects a cost-efficient neuronal information capacity with economical firing rates. In the future, it will be important to study cost-efficiency trade-offs in an integrated manner in terms of both neuronal connectivity and activity and in specific neuronal information processing tasks across multiple levels of brain organization.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our study suggests that primate anatomical connectivity, comprising characteristic topological features as well as specific regional connectivity profiles and individual connections, is shaped by a basic cost-efficiency trade-off as well as advanced functional requirements, reflected by a special group of long-distance connector regions that are crucial for functional segregation and integration. Together, these findings support the hypothesis of a trade-off between physical cost and functional values in brain network organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref013">13</xref>]. Our work, moreover, illuminates the potential inherent vulnerability of the cortical connectome as a result of the competition between energy cost and functional values, which were not identified by previous topological analyses of cortical connectivity.</p>

<title><italic>Macaque</italic> cortico-cortical network</title>
<p>We analyzed the connectivity of the <italic>macaque</italic> cortical network and its relationship with the three-dimensional spatial layout of the network components and compared the original network to various reconstructed networks in order to understand the impact of multiple structuring factors. The analyzed <italic>macaque</italic> connectivity data was based on anatomical tract-tracing and adapted from a dataset of 94 cortical regions and 2,390 directed projections among them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref018">18</xref>]. The connectivity data and three-dimensional spatial positions (the average surface coordinate) of each cortical region were obtained from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biological-networks.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.biological-networks.org</ext-link>. However, the dataset did not provide complete coverage of cortical regions. Especially the divisions of motor regions were quite coarse, with incomplete connection data of several regions (e.g., motor regions 4 and 6 which cover a large territory, 6.5% of neocortex). In a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref027">27</xref>], we improved and expanded the dataset to 103 regions using a more detailed parcellation of the motor regions based on the CoCoMac database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref043">43</xref>]. The spatial positions of the newly added regions were taken as the average surface 3-D coordinate estimated from surface parcellation using the CARET software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sumsdb.wustl.edu/sums/index.jsp" xlink:type="simple">http://sumsdb.wustl.edu/sums/index.jsp</ext-link>). Consequently, the improved dataset was also used in the present study. The cortical network of the nonhuman primate (<italic>macaque</italic> monkey) studied here has N = 103 regions and K = 2518 connections in total [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref027">27</xref>].

<title>Generative model</title>
<p>In this part of the study, we compared the performance of recovering different statistical features, regional connectivity profiles as well as individual connections of the real <italic>macaque</italic> connectome by the cost-efficiency trade-off model and a recently proposed generative model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref014">14</xref>]. This generative model aims to generate model networks by combing spatial and topological rules, and searches for parameters that can best reproduce multiple statistical features of the real network. Starting with a sparse seed network (464 edges among 16 regions, both randomly selected, about 15% of the nodes and links of the real network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref014">14</xref>]), edges were added one at each time over a series of steps until the remaining M = 2518–464 = 2054 total connections were added. At each step, the unconnected nodes, u and v, were connected with a probability P(u, v), which is given by:

The optimal generative model can closely recover the degree distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005776.s004">S1C Fig</xref>), but it cannot reliably reproduce the degree sequence, since the (total) degree of each node from the model is not significantly correlated with that of the real network (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005776.s004">S1A Fig</xref>). On the other hand, although the cost-efficiency model without fixing the degrees does not recover the degree distribution as well as the generative model, it could slightly better recover the degrees of nodes, and the correlation between the degree of model and the real network becomes significant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005776.s004">S1B and S1D Fig</xref>).</p>

where KS is the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics quantifying the discrepancy between the synthetic and the real <italic>macaque</italic> cortical network in terms of their statistical distribution of degree, clustering, betweenness centrality, and edge length. For the extended generative model with fixed degrees as in the real network, <italic>KS</italic><sub><italic>degree</italic></sub> = 0, which does not affect the definition of energy as the upper bound of the measures. Clustering measures the fraction of a node’s neighbors that are connected to each other. Betweenness centrality of a node is the number of the shortest paths in the network that pass through the given node. Edge length refers to the Euclidean distance between two regions of the connection. Thus, the optimization process searches for the network configuration under the generative rules that maximizes the similarity to multiple statistical features of the real network. When applied to the <italic>macaque</italic> connectome, the generative model with the lowest energy is obtained when the spatial distance is combined with the matching index (i.e., K(u, v), which is the ratio of common neighbors to total neighbors of two nodes u and v), as is consistent with a previous study of the human connectome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref014">14</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).

<title>Rewiring long-distance links to obtain the R-network</title>
<p>As detailed in the Results, there are about 33% of connections in the real networks which cannot be recovered by the best reconstructed network from the cost-efficiency trade-off model. The unrecovered connections are mainly long-distant links and are concentrated on a few special areas termed long distance connectors (LDCs). To study the impact of the concentration of links on LDCs, we randomly rewired the unrecovered links of LDCs to obtain an ‘R-network’ while preserving the distribution of physical distances as in the real network. In this way, only the concentration of long-distance links on LDCs was destroyed while the wiring cost remained the same. Thus, comparing the real network with R-networks, we could explore the functional influence of LDCs while excluding the contribution of the wiring cost. The R-network had similar efficiency (<italic>l</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub> = 1.81) as the real network (<italic>l</italic><sub><italic>greal</italic></sub> = 1.85), but its long-distance connections were not concentrated on the LDCs.</p>

<title>Hierarchical tree of network from connectivity matrix</title>
<p>Applying established modular division methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref078">78</xref>], we found that there are only two modules in the real <italic>macaque</italic> cortical network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref027">27</xref>], roughly separating the visual and frontal cortex, both mixed with areas from other functional systems. The reason, why the traditional modular division does not well capture the functional segregation, may be because both the size and the intra-connection density for different functional subsystems are quite heterogeneous. To better illustrate and detect the relationship between the clustering of anatomical connectivity and functional segregation, we studied the clustering of the brain cortical areas by analyzing the hierarchical tree of the connectivity matrix. The hierarchical tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g007">Fig 7</xref>) was obtained using the similarity measure {<italic>S</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>} computed from the connectivity matrix <italic>A</italic>, <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> = <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>/(<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> <italic>+ K</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> − <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>), namely, the ratio of common neighbors <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> over the total distinct neighbors of two nodes <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic>. The MATLAB function pdist was used to obtain the hierarchical tree (dendrogram) using the dissimilarity 1 − <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>. The connectivity modules from the sub-trees cut out at different thresholds (see below) were compared to functional subdivisions of the network as described in the next section. The limitation of the traditional modular division not well capturing the functional segregation is due to the fact that a uniform threshold is chosen to maximize the modularity, which however mixes different trees.</p>

<title>Functional segregation in three types of networks</title>
<p>To calculate the degree of matching between the hierarchical trees and brain functions, we first identified sub-trees dominated by a certain function. We cut the hierarchical tree from the top, with the threshold varying from 1 to 0, to obtain different sub-trees dominated by the corresponding functions. At each threshold, we calculated for each sub-tree the fraction of regions from different functional subsystem with respect to the total number of regions in the tree. Once the fraction for some functional subsystem in specific sub-tree was larger than 0.5, this sub-tree was retained and not divided further. We cut the hierarchical trees until we found all sub-trees with the fraction of regions from some functional subsystem to all regions in the sub-tree larger than 0.5 and the number of regions from a dominating function larger than 3, since further partition would make too many fragmental and small trees.</p>
<p>We illustrate the method by detecting the subtrees of the hierarchical tree in the real network in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g008">Fig 8A</xref>. At threshold value 0.67, the first sub-tree (Tree 1) was obtained containing only motor areas (matching rate 100%). The other large branch at this threshold at the right part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g008">Fig 8A</xref> contains cortical regions from different functional systems and is not dominated by one of the functions. Then we proceeded to cut this branch further into two major branches at a lower threshold of 0.65 and obtained the second sub-tree (Tree 2) containing only visual regions (matching rate 100%). Now the remaining middle branch still contains regions from different functions, and the process continued until we obtained all sub-trees where the number of regions from a dominating function was larger than 3. The remaining regions that were not included in the trees identified above were put into a group called”non-clusters”. In this way, a total of 6 sub-trees were obtained for the real network, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g008">Fig 8A</xref>, and they are graphically presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g008">Fig 8B</xref> of the main text.</p>

<title>Dense groups in the network</title>
<p>A set of nodes in the network is said to form a dense group when the connection density θ among the nodes is significantly larger (by above one standard deviation) than the expected connection density due to the nodes′ degrees in randomized networks. The calculation of the density is exactly the same as done for rich-clubs of the degree-rich subsets. Such dense groups formed by degree-rich hubs are called rich-clubs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref032">32</xref>]. In this study, we assessed the properties for the groups formed by LDCs, which mainly are non-hubs. The connection density θ among LDCs is significantly higher than for random benchmarks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g009">Fig 9B</xref>), thus they form a “dense group”.</p>

<title>Testing the reliability of findings in an additional dataset</title>
<p>The primate cortical network used in this study has 103 regions and 2518 connections in total. However, such a dataset established from the collation of several individual studies available in the literature may have some limitations; for example, the connections of some cortical regions may not be as well characterized as others. Thus, it is important to verify the reliability of the data with reference to other datasets and test the robustness of our findings.</p>
<p>Specifically, the group of Kennedy has recently undertaken a systematic effort to gather cortical connectivity data for the <italic>macaque</italic> monkey using retrograde tracer injections, resulting in a series of papers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref071">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref072">72</xref>] about the partial network of 1615 connections formed by afferent (input) links to a subset of 29 targeted regions from a total of 91 cortical regions. These targeted regions are sampled from different functional systems. This dataset provides the weight index (FLNe index) for region-to-region connections, which represents the fraction of labeled neurons in a source region relative to the total number of labeled neurons from all possible source regions extrinsic to a targeted region.</p>
<p>However, there are two major limitations and challenges in directly employing this dataset in the present cost-efficiency trade-off study. Firstly and most importantly, the dataset is still far from being complete (providing only about 1/3 of coverage of the whole cortex, and only the input connections are complete for the covered areas); thus, is not representative for applying the cost-effciency trade-off model which considers the wiring cost and processing efficiency of the global network. Secondly, the weight index provides the relative strength of the input of a targeted region from different sources, and the efficiency measure and the rewiring procedure would need to consider the projections weights. Note that the projection weights in <italic>macaque</italic> have a very broad range, spanning 5-order of magnitudes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref037">37</xref>]. While very weak links between areas could still be functionally useful, at least at the neuronal level, a simple linear measure of the contribution of the connection weights to the efficiency would not be able to capture its subtle functionality. This issue needs further exploration in the future.</p>
<p>Our detailed comparison between the two data sets (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Results</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005776.g010">Fig 10</xref>) showed that our dataset collated and developed from CoCoMac is reliable when compared to the Markov et al. dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref080">80</xref>], since it captures the significant and strong projections of the corresponding areas covered in the Markov et al. dataset. Therefore, the CoCoMac data, providing relatively complete cortical coverage, but incomplete characterization of some of the moderately or very weak links, are more suitable at this stage for applying the cost-efficiency trade-off model.</p>
<p>While the dataset is expected to become more complete in the future and an improved cost-efficiency trade-off analysis including the weighted information could then be developed, the current partial information may still be useful for some comparison with our dataset to provide an indication of the reliability and robustness of our findings.</p>
<p>The parcellation of the data by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref045">45</xref>] was based on the Felleman and van Essen (1991) atlas. The present data is also based on the Felleman and van Essen (1991) atlas, combined with the Lewis and van Essen (2000) atlas for a more detailed parcellation of the motor system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref042">42</xref>]. By comparing the different atlases in CARET, we found that the 91 regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref045">45</xref>] correspond to 74 regions in our data. The 29 targeted regions correspond to 24 regions in our dataset, while the regions STPr, ProM, 10 have no correspondence in our data, and regions 9/46d, 9/46v, 46d all correspond to region 46 in our dataset. We carried out more detailed analyses of the common sub-matrices of 74 × 24 nodes in both datasets. The links of our data in the 74 × 24 sub-matrix highly overlap (78.6%) with those by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref045">45</xref>]. For this sub-matrix, only few links in our data do not appear in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref045">45</xref>].</p>

<title>Calculating the fraction of wiring cost of regions in the real cortical network with respect to that in random weighted networks</title>
<p>In this study, we evaluated the wiring cost in the real network by comparing it to that of the random network with the same input and output degrees as in the real network. The fraction of wiring cost with respect to random benchmarks was calculated by l<sub><italic>p</italic></sub>/<italic>l</italic><sub><italic>pran</italic></sub> both in 24 regions of data by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005776.ref045">45</xref>] (afferents from 74 regions) and our global network data (afferents from 103 regions) for comparison.
