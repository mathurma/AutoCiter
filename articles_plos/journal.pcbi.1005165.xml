<abstract>
<p>Mounting evidence shows mammalian brains are probabilistic computers, but the specific cells involved remain elusive. Parallel research suggests that grid cells of the mammalian hippocampal formation are fundamental to spatial cognition but their diverse response properties still defy explanation. No plausible model exists which explains stable grids in darkness for twenty minutes or longer, despite being one of the first results ever published on grid cells. Similarly, no current explanation can tie together grid fragmentation and grid rescaling, which show very different forms of flexibility in grid responses when the environment is varied. Other properties such as attractor dynamics and grid anisotropy seem to be at odds with one another unless additional properties are assumed such as a varying velocity gain. Modelling efforts have largely ignored the breadth of response patterns, while also failing to account for the disastrous effects of sensory noise during spatial learning and recall, especially in darkness. Here, published electrophysiological evidence from a range of experiments are reinterpreted using a novel probabilistic learning model, which shows that grid cell responses are accurately predicted by a probabilistic learning process. Diverse response properties of probabilistic grid cells are statistically indistinguishable from rat grid cells across key manipulations. A simple coherent set of probabilistic computations explains stable grid fields in darkness, partial grid rescaling in resized arenas, low-dimensional attractor grid cell dynamics, and grid fragmentation in hairpin mazes. The same computations also reconcile oscillatory dynamics at the single cell level with attractor dynamics at the cell ensemble level. Additionally, a clear functional role for boundary cells is proposed for spatial learning. These findings provide a parsimonious and unified explanation of grid cell function, and implicate grid cells as an accessible neuronal population readout of a set of probabilistic spatial computations.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Cells in the mammalian hippocampal formation are thought to be central for spatial learning and stable spatial representations. Of the known spatial cells, grid cells form strikingly regular and stable patterns of activity, even in darkness. Hence, grid cells may provide the universal metric upon which spatial cognition is based. However, a more fundamental problem is how grids themselves may form and stabilise, since sensory information is noisy and can vary tremendously with environmental conditions. Furthermore, the same grid cell can display substantially different yet stable patterns of activity in different environments. Currently, no model explains how vastly different sensory cues can give rise to the diverse but stable grid patterns. Here, a new probabilistic model is proposed which combines information encoded by grid cells and boundary cells. This noise-tolerant model performs robust spatial learning, under a variety of conditions, and produces varied yet stable grid cell response patterns like rodent grid cells. Across numerous experimental manipulations, rodent and probabilistic grid cell responses are similar or even statistically indistinguishable. These results complement a growing body of evidence suggesting that mammalian brains are inherently probabilistic, and suggest for the first time that grid cells may be involved.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mammals use probabilistic computations to perceive noisy and ambiguous sensory inputs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref005">5</xref>]. It seems likely that learning an internal model of a noisy sensory environment should follow similar statistical inference principles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref004">4</xref>]. While solid behavioural evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref005">5</xref>] and mounting <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref004">4</xref>] support probabilistic sensory perception, <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence is lacking for probabilistic learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref005">5</xref>]. It is virtually unknown how any probabilistically learned neural model of the world may look through neurophysiological recordings.</p>
<p>The mammalian hippocampal formation is heavily implicated in spatial learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref009">9</xref>]. Grid cells within the hippocampal formation tile Euclidean space in a repeating firing pattern, thought to provide a spatial metric [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref011">11</xref>]. Both theoretical and experimental evidence suggest that grid cells may be used for path integration (PI) via integration of self-motion estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref014">14</xref>]. However, all PI systems suffer from cumulative error [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref016">16</xref>] necessitating frequent corrections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref022">22</xref>]. In darkness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref024">24</xref>], fusion of sensory and learned information is necessary to maintain spatially-stable grid cell responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref025">25</xref>]. Theoretically, learned boundary information is sufficient to correct cumulative PI errors in darkness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref018">18</xref>]. Consistent with theory, boundary cells have been found to fire along arena boundaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref029">29</xref>], coexist with grid cells in the hippocampal formation, and provide a plausible neuronal substrate to encode boundary information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref020">20</xref>]. However, it is unclear how grid and boundary information contribute to spatial learning, or how their responses may be altered by learning.</p>
<p>Currently, no realistic learning model can unify grid and boundary cell activity for learning or localization in light and dark conditions. Darkness poses a formidable challenge by limiting inputs to noisy self-motion and intermittent boundary contacts, neither being location-specific. The approach of approximating spatial learning by assuming error-free PI by grid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref022">22</xref>] bypasses the fundamental problem of SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref032">32</xref>], overlooking how cumulative errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref016">16</xref>] impair spatial learning and undoubtedly shaped the evolution of spatial cognition. Spatial learning models which rely on vision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref033">33</xref>] do not generalize to explain stable grid fields in darkness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref013">13</xref>]. Additionally, the nature of learned spatial information must affect the diverse grid cell responses caused by arena manipulations, including grid rescaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref035">35</xref>] and grid fragmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref037">37</xref>], but whose relationship to learned spatial representations remain unclear. Here, a new learning model adapted from probabilistic SLAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref032">32</xref>] is proposed which explains how information encoded by grid and boundary cell populations may be simultaneously learned, recalled and stabilized. This model takes realistic noisy inputs, represented by plausible neuronal codes using rate-coded (non-spiking) grid and boundary cell models, and carries out probabilistic information fusion algorithmically. Grid and boundary cell responses are modulated recursively through information fusion, during both learning and recall. Expected neuronal responses are characterized and compared to rodent electrophysiological recordings across diverse conditions.</p>

<title>Probabilistic learning using grid and boundary cells</title>
<p>A probabilistic grid and boundary cell spatial information fusion model (SIFM) was developed (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g001">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s001">S1</xref>, Methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s013">S1.1 Text</xref>) based on a Rao-Blackwellized particle-filter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref032">32</xref>]. This algorithmic implementation of information fusion continually updates a sample of possible positions, orientations, and environmental layouts (maps), primarily using self-motion and boundary information. During a learning session, boundary information is associated with position information incrementally to build a distribution of possible maps corresponding to the possible paths defined by the dynamic distribution of positions and orientations. At each step boundary prediction error feeds back to modulate the distribution of positions, orientations and maps.</p>

<p>SIFM is the first demonstration that information contained in grid and boundary codes of the rodent hippocampal formation may be sufficient to implement recursive probabilistic information fusion. In SIFM, noisy self-motion cues update grid cell responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s013">S1.1.2 Text</xref>), encoding a distribution of position and orientation (pose), spanning eight modular grid scales estimated from rodent data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref035">35</xref>]. Noisy boundary cues are encoded by boundary cells covering twelve tuning directions and nineteen tuning distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>). Eleven long-range boundary cell tuning distances were inferred previously from hippocampal place cell data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref038">38</xref>], while eight additional short-range tuning distances enable boundary detection in darkness, consistent with medial entorhinal boundary cell properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref026">26</xref>]. From self-motion and boundary cues experienced along random trajectories, each multi-modular grid code learns an association map (weights to boundary cells, Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g001">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s001">S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s013">S1.1.6 Text</xref>), which together determines predictive boundary cell responses. Each multi-modular grid code is assumed to maintain the same relative phase across grid scales (modules) despite continual changes in position. Note that although a self-corrective mechanism could potentially maintain relative grid phase across modules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref039">39</xref>], partial decoupling and hence independent operation of some grid modules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref035">35</xref>] does not prohibit SIFM function (described later under ‘Three novel tests of probabilistic learning’). During learning and recall, boundary prediction error recursively modulates the grid code distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s001">S1 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s013">S1.1.7 Text</xref>).

Like pure rodent grid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref042">42</xref>], probabilistic grid cells were directionally-insensitive (directional information content &lt; 0.1 bits/spike). Two distinct types of grid phase noise exist in SIFM, one arising from self-motion cues which corrupts the estimate of pose and is correlated between all grid cells, the second arising intrinsically in grid codes and is independent between grid codes but correlated across modules within each grid code. This second type of phase noise is used opportunistically to compensate for the information loss due to self-motion errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref032">32</xref>] (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g001">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s001">S1</xref>). By virtue of its independence between grid codes, compensatory phase noise serves to sample the phase space to keep track of pose uncertainty, which is critical for successful information fusion. Without compensatory phase noise, grid cell responses were perfectly coupled, carrying redundant information, resulting in pure PI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g002">Fig 2</xref> rows 2 and 4) and unstable grid fields (gridness index mean ± SD = -0.05 ± 0.27 and -0.10 ± 0.29 for the square and circular arena, respectively).

However, absence of compensatory grid phase noise led to spatially-dispersed associations learned between grid and boundary cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g002">Fig 2A</xref> rows 2 and 4), because grid responses themselves were spatially-dispersed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Hence stability of predictive boundary fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g002">Fig 2C</xref>) depends on grid stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), so that inhibiting probabilistic learning by removing compensatory grid cell phase noise also prevents stable predictive boundary fields being established.

<title>Stable grid fields in darkness</title>
<p>Rodent grid cell rate maps are immediately stable in darkness in a novel room (Fig S7b of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref010">10</xref>]), showing that grid stability and alignment do not require visual cues or familiar room landmarks. Potentially, PI is used to track location, but cumulative sensory errors cause failure within 1 to 2 minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref018">18</xref>], an order of magnitude less than rodent grid cell results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref010">10</xref>]. Similarly, learning the new environment using PI would also fail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g002">Fig 2</xref>) because PI errors accumulate if left uncorrected leading to increasing uncertainty and unstable grids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref046">46</xref>]. However, prior exposure to an identical arena in a different room [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref010">10</xref>] could plausibly have established an equivalent map in memory, which is additional information required for information fusion and grid stabilization. With prior exposure to a geometrically-equivalent arena, probabilistic grid fields are also immediately stable in darkness, despite initial disorientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g003">Fig 3A</xref> Novel / total darkness). Also consistent with rodent results, probabilistic grid fields remained stable in light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g003">Fig 3A</xref> Light), and in a second darkness session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g003">Fig 3A</xref> Dark). Re-orientation was possible due to the arena’s local rotational asymmetry, allowing the fusion of self-motion and boundary information to converge on one of four possible solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref018">18</xref>]. Local arena asymmetry was shown previously to improve localization due to the limited number of rotationally equivalent poses which are consistent with sensory information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref018">18</xref>]. Hence the coupling between probabilistic grid cells and predictive boundary cells accounts for the persistence of rodent boundary fields in darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g003">Fig 3A</xref> rows 4 and 5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref027">27</xref>].</p>

<p>Since circular arenas possess no local or global rotational asymmetry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref018">18</xref>], perhaps stable grid fields in darkness (Fig S7a of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref010">10</xref>]) cannot be explained by probabilistic models. However, SIFM slowed spatial destabilization sufficiently to allow grid fields to persist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Bin-wise correlations between probabilistic grid maps in light and darkness were almost identical to rats (mean ± SEM, <italic>n</italic> = 33: for Light-to-Dark, <italic>r</italic><sub>SIFM</sub> = 0.50 ± 0.03, <italic>r</italic><sub>rat</sub> = 0.50 ± 0.03, <italic>P</italic> = 0.97, <italic>t</italic><sub>32.3</sub> = -0.04; for Dark-to-Light, <italic>r</italic><sub>SIFM</sub> = 0.53 ± 0.03, <italic>r</italic><sub>rat</sub> = 0.53 ± 0.03, <italic>P</italic> = 0.87, <italic>t</italic><sub>32.3</sub> = -0.17; Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test), showing that persistence of grids in darkness may be largely explained by the fusion of self-motion and learned boundary information.

<title>Rescaling of grids in resized arenas</title>
<p>Grid patterns compress or stretch along the resized dimension of a test arena [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref035">35</xref>], but the mechanism is poorly understood. One model assumed ideal associations between visual features and grid cells to reset grid activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref022">22</xref>], deforming grid patterns in resized arenas. However, grids rescaled heterogeneously over the arena (Figs 7A, B of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref022">22</xref>]) in contrast to rodent grids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref035">35</xref>], because dominant visual features locally anchored the model grid cell’s activity. A more recent model assumed place cells, driven by boundary vector cells, reset grid cell activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref019">19</xref>]. Both models were heavily biased towards boundary information, thus preserving the same grid peaks despite arena resizing, differing from rodent grid cell rate maps showing partial loss or gain of grid peaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref034">34</xref>]. Conversely, a particle filter model underestimated grid rescaling when boundary information was used infrequently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref018">18</xref>], due to the dominance of PI. In contrast, probabilistic grids rescaled partially, nearly identical to rodent data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Like rodent grid cells, probabilistic grids rescaled isotropically, leading to partial loss or gain of grid peaks at boundary edges (e.g., circled grid peaks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Across twelve rescaling dimensions, rescaling magnitude was almost identical between probabilistic and rodent grid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). Notably, probabilistic grid rescaling in resized arenas was not based on a resizing-dependent change in the velocity signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref012">12</xref>], or altered oscillatory properties of grid cells. Instead, altered oscillation frequency caused omnidirectional probabilistic grid rescaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s006">S6 Fig</xref>) in an unchanged arena, and compatible with rodent grid expansion in novel environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref047">47</xref>]. In the latter, omnidirectional rescaling of probabilistic grids was caused by a change in the overall speed signal gain in the novel but geometrically equivalent arena. In contrast, the speed signal in rescaled arenas was unchanged, and grid rescaling was SIFM’s probabilistic solution to the conflict between learned and current environmental boundary information.</p>

<p>Although probabilistic grid patterns varied substantially with either arena geometry or oscillatory dynamics, grid stabilization depended critically on boundary information, contrary to previous argument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref043">43</xref>]. Instead, probabilistic grid rescaling resulted from the competition between boundary and self-motion information. In resized arenas, some grid codes closely matched PI position but not boundary code, and some vice versa. High boundary prediction error suppressed the PI-matching grid codes, biasing towards grid codes which better matched the boundary input (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s001">S1 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s013">S1.1 Text</xref>), thereby gradually pulling the grid code distribution away from the PI estimate. Simultaneously, coupling of predictive boundary cells to grid cells caused predictive boundary fields to shift along the rescaling dimension (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s007">S7 Fig</xref>), distinct from sensory boundary cells whose response distance to the boundary is fixed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref045">45</xref>].

<title>Probabilistic learning and recall exhibits attractor-like grid cell dynamics</title>

Local grid cell pairs showed highly correlated activity, adjusting for 2D translation, even when grid parameters were experimentally altered, suggesting strong intrinsic coupling of grid cell activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref043">43</xref>]. For example, observed high inter-grid correlation cannot be explained simply by the stability of individual grid properties, since those properties change significantly with experimental manipulations such as arena resizing. Since information fusion in SIFM specifically requires partially uncoupled grid cells to track uncertainty in grid phase (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g002">Fig 2</xref>), perhaps probabilistic learning and recall (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s013">S1.1.8 Text</xref>) cannot explain attractor-like properties of rodent grid cells. To clearly test the strength of functional coupling between probabilistic grid cells, two recall tests were used with identical initial conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Learning was ceased during recall tests to prevent the possibility that a dynamically changing spatial memory may contribute to session-specific correlations in grid response. Hence, if there is stronger correlation within a grid cell between trials than between grid cells in the same trial, then correlation of between-cell activity may simply reflect between-trial stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref043">43</xref>]. Like rodent grid cells, the opposite is true for probabilistic grid cells whose properties were more stable between cells within a trial, than in the same cell between trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). The same analysis was repeated using an arena resizing series to determine if gross changes in grid parameters may weaken the functional correlation between grid cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). Again, grid parameters co-varied between cells across conditions, showing a nearly identical pattern to rodent grid cells up to a scale factor. Like rodent grid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref043">43</xref>], probabilistic grid cell parameter ratios also varied with omnidirectional rescaling in novel environments, with the changes virtually identical between all cell pairs within each session (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s009">S9A Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>Additionally, rodent grid cells show small phase changes across different test sessions in the same arena, which exceed the variability of between-cell phase offsets across the same sessions (e.g., Fig 2 of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref043">43</xref>]). Since probabilistic grid peak locations depend on learned information, perhaps grid drift is negligible between recall sessions since learned information is unchanged. Instead, the magnitude of within-cell phase drift is significantly larger than the magnitude of change in between-cell phase offsets across two independent recall trials (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s009">S9B Fig</xref>, <italic>P</italic> = 3.3 × 10<sup>−267</sup>, <italic>z</italic> = 34.9, Wilcoxon rank sum test between the Between-cell and Within-cell magnitude distributions, <italic>n</italic> = 2,000). Similarly, the magnitude of within-cell phase drift is also larger than the phase offset of phase-matched grid cell pairs within each recall trial (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−300</sup>, <italic>z</italic> = 42.5, Wilcoxon rank sum test between the Within-cell magnitude distribution and phase offset distribution from Recall trial 1, <italic>n</italic> = 2,000; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−300</sup>, <italic>z</italic> = 44.6, Wilcoxon rank sum test between the Within-cell magnitude distribution and phase offset distribution from Recall trial 2, <italic>n</italic> = 2,000). These results demonstrate that probabilistic grid cells exhibit correlated phase changes across independent test sessions, similar to rodents. Notably, learned information was constant and equivalent between probabilistic recall sessions, suggesting that phase drift may primarily be a function of stochastic processes such as random movement and noise.</p>
<p>To determine if momentary system dynamics also display attractor character analogous to temporally-averaged grid patterns, the response of 200 phase-matched probabilistic grid cells were examined. As expected from momentary functional coupling, response time series between all grid cells within a scale module were correlated, orbiting an attractor in activity space (unit diagonal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Recall localization tests were performed in darkness to exclude compass stability as a possible explanation for the high correlation between cells (using arena 1-fold rotational symmetry for global orientation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref018">18</xref>]). In contrast, there was a clear reduction in the activity correlation between grid cells during non-probabilistic learning or recall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Here, non-probabilistic learning was identical to probabilistic learning in all respects except for the loss of useful feedback from boundary prediction error thereby specifically preventing the probabilistic fusion of self-motion and boundary information while preserving the distributed estimate of pose and associative learning (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). Initially disoriented, the perpendicular distance between the activity state and the attractor reduced and then stabilized during probabilistic recall, but remained high during non-probabilistic recall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). Once localized, correlation between intra-modular grid cells remained high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g005">Fig 5F</xref>, mean <italic>r</italic> &gt; 0.8 after the first minute) for probabilistic grid cells, but not for non-probabilistic grid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g005">Fig 5G</xref>, mean <italic>r</italic> &lt; 0.02), showing that successful localization was marked by strongly correlated grid cell activity. Taken together, these results demonstrate that probabilistic grid cells exhibit attractor properties similar to rodent grid cells, and that these properties specifically require probabilistic information fusion. Furthermore, attractor properties should be evident in darkness, initially disoriented, and on a momentary basis. SIFM also provides support that oscillatory and attractor dynamics may be complementary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref049">49</xref>]. Notably, attractor-like SIFM grid cell correlations arise from shared sensory inputs and convergence in learned information rather than direct coupling between grid cells, consistent with recent noise correlation analysis of rodent grid cells suggesting that relatively little spike train correlation is attributable to direct synaptic connections between cell pairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref050">50</xref>].</p>

Surprisingly, probabilistic grid cell rate maps do fragment, alternate across arms in a hairpin maze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), and depend on global running direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g006">Fig 6C</xref>), similar to rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g006">Fig 6B and 6D</xref>).

<p>Perhaps grid fragmentation arose from the complex interplay between cumulative error, altered path structure in hairpin mazes, and arena geometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref018">18</xref>], not the inserted maze walls <italic>per se</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref036">36</xref>]. If so, grid maps should still fragment in an open arena if hairpin-like paths are followed. Instead, both probabilistic and rat grid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g007">Fig 7C and 7D</xref>) preserved their hexagonal grid patterns along virtual hairpin (VH) paths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref036">36</xref>]. It should be noted that rats were trained progressively to run to successive turn locations along an approximate virtual hairpin path in an open arena (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g007">Fig 7D</xref>), whereas SIFM grid cells were tested along an ideal hairpin path without further training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). Bin-wise correlations were indistinguishable between rat and probabilistic grid maps for open arena and: hairpin maze, virtual hairpin maze, and a second open arena (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g007">Fig 7E</xref>, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.4 for all comparisons).</p>
<p>Contrary to the multiple submap hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref037">37</xref>], probabilistic learning resulted in a single map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g007">Fig 7F</xref>). Multiple geometrically-similar alleys were partially compressed, reducing the east-west spatial extent while preserving the north-south extent. Incomplete compression caused easterly and westerly global runs to use non-identical map information, causing directional-dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Compression was reduced using semi-transparent maze barriers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g007">Fig 7F, ST</xref>), resulting in a hybrid between arm-arm repetition and global tessellation patterns. The semi-transparent maze was modelled by including perimeter boundary inputs to boundary cells at all times to provide global arena geometry information, in addition to immediately adjacent walls. Semi-transparent walls were assumed to make perimeter walls visible to the rat. Consequently, arms with similar running directions remained correlated (<italic>P</italic> = 1.4x10<sup>-34</sup>, <italic>z</italic> = 12.3, Wilcoxon signed rank test) but reduced compared to opaque walls (<italic>P</italic> = 8.4x10<sup>-65</sup>, <italic>z</italic> = -17.0, Wilcoxon rank sum test), similar to rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref036">36</xref>]. This shows that global boundary cues can partially disambiguate repetitive local arena structure.</p>
<p>To further investigate the underlying cause of map compression during probabilistic learning, two hypotheses were tested. First, perhaps the resolution of the association map was too low to reliably learn the hairpin corridor structure, leading to map compression. Probabilistic learning trials were repeated using 4-fold and 0.25-fold association map resolution, but both map compression and grid fragmentation persisted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s011">S11A and S11B Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s015">S2 Table</xref>). Second, perhaps high positional uncertainty caused boundary cues to be more heavily weighted than self-motion cues during probabilistic information fusion, leading to ambiguity between adjacent corridors. If so, a sufficient reduction in self-motion noise should recover the hairpin structure during learning, and rescue the hexagonal tessellating grid pattern, which was indeed the case (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s011">S11C and S11D Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s015">S2 Table</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that grid fragmentation and map compression are due to the interaction between cumulative self-motion error and probabilistic learning.</p>
<p>If a single learned spatial representation is used for both easterly and westerly runs, it may be hypothesized that re-use of the same map should be evidenced by significant similarity in the response patterns between easterly and westerly runs where the local running directions matched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g007">Fig 7G</xref>). However, rat arm-arm correlations with the same local direction (but opposite global direction) were weakly correlated (mean ± SD = 0.07 ± 0.20, <italic>P</italic> = 2.4×10<sup>−4</sup>, <italic>t</italic><sub>104</sub> = 3.8, one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test). Surprisingly, probabilistic grid cells show similarly weak correlation (0.05 to 0.15, 95% C.I. of mean cross-correlation from 10<sup>4</sup> resamples of 105 probabilistic grid cells). The low correlation in probabilistic grid cells shows that re-use of a single map is still compatible with distinct response patterns where the local running direction matched but global direction differed. Taken together, the results suggest that a single laterally compressed spatial map parsimoniously explains the fragmentation of grid maps in hairpin mazes, and is an emergent property of probabilistic learning.</p>

<title>Three novel tests of probabilistic learning</title>
<p>Strong visual cues are often used to establish stable grid cell recordings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref047">47</xref>]. In rat pups, stable grids emerged after eyelids unsealed and following exploratory experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref051">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref052">52</xref>]. Even tests in darkness were performed in experienced rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref010">10</xref>], raising the possibility that naïve learning must fail in darkness. However, most experimental arenas have higher-order rotational symmetry in which multiple rotationally-equivalent solutions match sensory information in darkness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref018">18</xref>]. This confound is avoided in arenas with 1-fold rotational symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). Thus, SIFM predicts that a naïve rat can learn a spatial representation of a kite-shaped arena in total darkness, and re-localize in darkness when disoriented. Interestingly, resumed learning in light should cause global rotations of grid and boundary fields because novel long-range sensory boundary information cause large discrepancies between predictive and sensed boundary information, destabilizing the distributed estimate of pose to form a new map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g008">Fig 8A</xref> top row). A similar mechanism may have contributed to grid remapping during alternating lights on/off training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref013">13</xref>].

<p>The stability of standard attractor network models depend critically on balanced local connection strengths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref054">54</xref>], and it is unclear what effects local disruptions of connections may have on the spatial stability of grid cell rate maps. However, disruptions caused by the insertion of tetrodes into grid cell networks do not cause grid field drift [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref051">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref052">52</xref>], suggesting that underlying computations are robust to local damage. Consistent with rodent results, SIFM tolerates abrupt loss of grid cells either through lesioning 50% of all scale modules, or 50% of grid cells spanning all modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). Despite stable grids, boundary cell rate maps lost strict adherence to boundary geometry without large-scale grid modules due to increased spatial repetitiveness of the remaining grid code (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g008">Fig 8B</xref>, column 1).</p>
<p>Grids are predicted to fragment differently in spiral mazes compared to hairpin mazes. In a spiral maze, probabilistic grid maps are uncorrelated along the same running direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g008">Fig 8C, 8Is and 8Os</xref>), distinct from the hairpin maze [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref037">37</xref>] (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g007">7</xref>). Instead, rate maps along arms at the same location but opposite running direction were correlated (IO), encoding place-specific information. Different patterns of grid fragmentation may therefore be signatures of probabilistically-learned spatial information, which vary with environmental structure.</p>
<p>Another experiment may be useful for differentiating between SIFM and standard attractor models. Distributed grid codes in SIFM are expected to decouple over time in an unbounded 2D field devoid of visual or other localizing cues. For example, a blindfolded rat which forages in a very large field (in between contacts with boundaries or other cues) can only rely on PI to keep track of location. Spatial correlations between SIFM grid cells within a module should decrease gradually due to cumulative PI errors. In contrast, grid cells in standard attractor models should remain functionally coupled and show spatially correlated drift within any one scale module.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Rodent grid cells show consistent and specific properties of probabilistic computations, which include grid fragmentation in hairpin mazes, attractor dynamics, partial grid rescaling in resized arenas, and stable grids in darkness. A new spatial information fusion model (SIFM) successfully performed probabilistic learning and recall using grid and boundary cells, unifying diverse grid cell response properties. This contradicts prevailing theories that grid cell networks primarily perform PI, with a separate mechanism correcting cumulative PI errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref022">22</xref>]. The latter implies that a hitherto unidentified spatial system actually solves the hard problem of SLAM. Parsimoniously, SIFM suggests that grid cells can participate directly in SLAM computations to maintain spatial stability. The remarkable similarity between SIFM and rodent data across diverse experiments also show that noisy self-motion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref018">18</xref>] and boundary vector estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref045">45</xref>] adequately encapsulate the principal sensory information used by rodent grid cells in published experiments.</p>
<p>SIFM provides the first demonstration that grid and boundary rate codes suffice to perform probabilistic spatial learning, despite grid codes being surjective functions of position, and boundary inputs varying substantially with the availability of vision. Additionally, probabilistic learning copes with both self-motion and boundary estimation noise, while taking advantage of intrinsic grid phase noise. The breadth and depth of similarity between probabilistic and rodent grid cell responses, partly due to emergent properties of probabilistic learning, suggest that consideration of realistic learning and perceptual constraints can lead to deeper insights into grid cell behaviour and spatial cognition more broadly.</p>
<p>A valid question is whether SIFM still performs PI since individual grid cells are based on a PI model which can be considered to be equivalent to a simplified oscillatory interference model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s013">S1.1.2 Text</xref>). A key insight of SIFM is that grid stability depends crucially on maintaining a probability distribution of grid codes which is dynamically modulated through boundary prediction error. Hence PI should be treated as a special case of SIFM in which probabilistic aspects of the computations are disabled (e.g., by removing compensatory phase noise in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g002">Fig 2</xref> or preventing prediction error feedback in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s010">S10 Fig</xref>), the latter unable to form or maintain stable grids in the presence of sensory noise. It is also important to distinguish between spatial information fusion and simpler PI-reset models. The latter can be considered a special case of information fusion where the probabilistic weight distribution is a Delta function centred on the sensory input. For example, contact with a square arena’s westerly boundary resets the grid code due to previously learned associations between a westerly boundary cell and grid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref020">20</xref>]. However, such a model rigidly anchors the grid to the boundary, incompatible with partial grid expansion or contraction in resized arenas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref034">34</xref>]. Furthermore, PI-reset relies on sensory cues directly driving the correct boundary cell’s activity. In darkness therefore, the drift in grid orientation cannot be slower than the head direction system. Yet in darkness, head direction is unstable within 2 minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref040">40</xref>], whereas grid patterns remains stable for 10 to 20 minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref010">10</xref>]. Finally, associative learning between boundary and grid cells is particularly challenging for any PI-reset model because of the chicken-or-egg problem of SLAM. A noisy PI estimate diverges from true position unless reset via associated boundary cells, but those associations do not exist at the start of learning. This was avoided in a recent model by assuming error-free PI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref020">20</xref>], which is biologically unrealistic. Similarly, place cell based reset information can only be learned if sensory cues are sufficient to drive each place cell’s spatial response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref022">22</xref>]. In darkness, the same difficulties arise, where sensory cues far from a boundary are not sufficient to define position, and grid orientation should drift at least as rapidly as head direction. Hence it is specifically SIFM’s ability to perform probabilistic information fusion, rather than PI or PI-reset, which enables robust learning and recall, which in turn accounts for diverse grid cell response patterns in light and darkness. This work challenges the fundamental assumption of virtually all grid cell models that the computational problem to which grid cells provide a solution is PI.</p>
<p>Cues other than self-motion and boundary cues are likely to contribute to spatial stability of cell responses recorded from the hippocampal formation. Arena olfactory cues, for example, contribute to rodent place field stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref023">23</xref>] and may play a role in grid stability, although the latter has not been tested. However, as discussed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref017">17</xref>], multiple studies showed that even careful removal of olfactory cues (including [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref023">23</xref>]) did not abolish stable place fields, including in a Morris water maze [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref024">24</xref>]. In contrast, HD cells drifted even during a single session in darkness where olfactory cues were not specifically minimized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref041">41</xref>]. Taken together, these results suggest that olfactory cues are neither necessary nor sufficient to provide a coherent explanation of stable spatial fields in darkness. A simultaneous recording of grid and HD cells in darkness in a Morris water maze may allow definitive quantification of the contribution of olfactory cues to stable grids in darkness.</p>
<p>Since rodent spatial fields are stable across multiple combinations of sensory cues, including without vision or olfactory cues, the underlying computations must be adaptable to variable reliability of each information stream. For example, it would be disastrous for a rat to always learn or recall by relying entirely on either stable visual or olfactory cues since they are not always there. The fact that rodent spatial cognition allows multiple information streams to contribute, and not in an obligatory all-or-none fashion, suggests some sort of probabilistic algorithm. The behaviour of grids under different manipulations and environments provide important tests of any proposed model of rodent spatial learning and recall.</p>
<p>In multi-compartment environments, the unexpected emergent boundary representation arising from probabilistic learning resulted in grid fragmentation (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005165.g007">7</xref>). The learned representation is both a geometric distortion and a form of spatial information compression, in which multiple similar spatial structures are efficiently represented as one. Corridors in an opaque hairpin maze have identical geometry when considering only those walls which are visible to the rat. Thus the sensory boundary information within one corridor is equivalent to a number of other corridors. In the absence of any specific task or contextual disambiguation between the corridors, then arguably there is no need to maintain separate representations of multiple equivalent maze corridors. Potentially less neural resource is required to store a compressed representation. The close match between rodent and probabilistic grid cells in terms of global grid fragmentation, directional dependence, arm-arm-correlation matrices, a variety of arm-arm correlation distributions, and bin-wise 2D rate map similarity patterns shows that this novel and parsimonious explanation must be considered a viable alternative to the original hypothesis of multiple submaps linked at hairpin turns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref036">36</xref>]. A working model of the latter has yet to be reported.</p>
<p>A large number of attractor network models have been proposed to explain grid cell responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref021">21</xref>]. While the functional coupling between grid cells is consistent with attractor dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref043">43</xref>], the mechanism which supports such dynamics remains unclear. Here, biologically-realistic response patterns of probabilistic grid cells rely on functional coupling arising from shared self-motion inputs and feedback from boundary prediction errors, rather than static connections independent of environmental cues. Indeed, the typically rigid synaptic connectivity between attractor network grid cells would lead to near-perfect correlation in grid cell activity, voiding the ability to dynamically track growing uncertainty which is particularly important during prolonged periods in darkness. Furthermore, standard attractor networks require delicately balanced network weights to function so are highly sensitive to local damage, bringing into question their robustness to trauma, disease and even tetrode insertion. Nevertheless, a network implementation of SIFM has not been developed, and it is possible that attractor network properties may be modified to simultaneously enable: functional decoupling to track uncertainty while providing redundancy and robustness; and functional coupling via environmental inputs to maintain stability while explaining diverse grid cell responses. In that way, the shift in an attractor’s activity bump may depend on 1) self-motion cues, 2) compensatory phase noise which samples phase space, and 3) prediction error feedback such as via a boundary code. Intriguingly, cooperative oscillatory and attractor dynamics underpin SIFM function, and may also guide a connectionist instantiation of SIFM.</p>
<p>Overall, SIFM shows that a single probabilistic model concurrently and accurately explains numerous grid cell response properties, using realistic noisy inputs, and without assuming prior learned information. Probabilistic spatial computations manifest as a flexible yet stable set of response patterns which depend on arena information and experimental design, often indistinguishable from rodent grid cells. Hence grid cell ensembles may provide a hitherto unexplored window into probabilistic computations in a higher-order cognitive system. The dependence of grid response patterns on sensory inputs also supports the growing view that probabilistic perception complements probabilistic learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref004">4</xref>]. The convergence of experimental and theoretical evidence presented here suggests that spatial perception and spatial learning both depend on probabilistic interactions between grid and boundary cells.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The new spatial information fusion model (SIFM) was developed firstly to investigate whether probabilistic fusion of realistic noisy spatial information is possible, even in principle, when constrained by using only representations which can plausibly be encoded by neuronal responses of the hippocampal formation. A second objective of SIFM was to investigate whether rodent grid cell responses are consistent with predictions using probabilistic learning and recall computations, under diverse experimental conditions. The principle of SIFM is fusion of temporally-integrated self-motion information, egocentric boundary vector information, and occasionally head direction information when available, to produce a joint estimate of the current grid code (pose) and grid-boundary associations (map) distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s013">S1.1 Text</xref>). The specific implementation using noisy sensory cues, neuronal codes and a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter is briefly outlined below (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s013">S1.1.2–S1.1.10 Text</xref> for details). This is a mathematically succinct implementation of recursive Bayesian inferencing principles, aimed at a systems-level approximation of the computations carried out by neural networks involving grid and boundary cells.</p>
<p>Temporally-integrated self-motion information is encoded by a population of grid cells whose responses are modulated by both speed and heading (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s013">S1.1.2 Text</xref>). To function, SIFM requires a temporally-stable function of spatial phase, which need not be a regular grid (e.g., <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s004">S4C Fig</xref>). Noisy self-motion cues provide approximate linear and angular displacement inputs to grid cells, which in turn have independent phase noise which plays a compensatory role (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s013">S1.1.3 Text</xref>). Noisy boundary cues provide short-range vectorial information to boundary cells when within somatosensory contact range, and long-range vectorial information when vision is available (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s013">S1.1.4 Text</xref>). A noisy compass cue is provided in the presence of vision (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s013">S1.1.5 Text</xref>). Grid-boundary associations are approximated by a linear average over time, over a set of predefined map grid codes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s013">S1.1.6 Text</xref>). Each active grid code (activity of phase-correlated grid cells in multiple modules) and its association map corresponds to a single ‘particle’ in the particle filter implementation. Using learned grid-boundary associations, new grid codes generate predictive boundary codes, whose discrepancy with sensory boundary information yields a prediction error and importance weight for particle resampling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s013">S1.1.7 Text</xref>). Note that the population of predictive boundary cells have distinct properties from sensory boundary cells which have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005165.ref045">45</xref>]. Only predictive boundary cell responses are presented. Disorientation is modelled as a random redistribution of grid code activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s013">S1.1.8 Text</xref>). Pseudocode summarizes key implementation steps for probabilistic learning (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s013">S1.1.9 Text</xref>) and recall (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s013">S1.1.10 Text</xref>).</p>
<p>Random simulated trajectories were used to provide full coverage of each arena, mimicking the behaviour of trained rats, except in hairpin mazes where rats were trained to run along maze corridors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s013">S1.2 Text</xref>).</p>
<p>Methods for calculating firing rate maps, spatial crosscorrelograms, gridness index, grid rescaling and border score have been described previously so are only briefly summarized (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s013">S1.3.1–S1.3.5 Text</xref>). The parametric rate map correlation was developed to determine whether a cell’s response is more grid-like or boundary-like, based on computational hypotheses of each cell type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s013">S1.3.6 Text</xref>). Unlike the border score, this metric correctly classified long-range model boundary cells. Associative weight maps were displayed by averaging across all boundary codes at the nominal position corresponding to each grid code of an association map (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s013">S1.3.7 Text</xref>). For visual comparison with published data, grid cell and boundary cell spikes were simulated using an inhomogeneous Poisson process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s013">S1.3.8 Text</xref>). Predictive short-range boundary vector maps were produced to visualize the learned local boundary direction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s013">S1.3.9 Text</xref>). Spike-triggered dynamic rate maps and autocorrelograms were used to detect underlying spatial regularity in response patterns which may drift over time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s013">S1.3.10 Text</xref>). Grid phase change was quantified both between grid cells and within the same grid cell across different recall trials in darkness in a kite arena (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005165.s013">S1.3.11 Text</xref>).</p>

<title>Using boundary prediction error in a probabilistic learning model.</title>
<p>Three example grid codes and their associative weights with predictive boundary codes are shown (numbered [i-1], [i] and [i+1]). Environmental cues provide egocentric boundary vector information in the animal’s egocentric reference frame, and transformed via each grid code’s private heading estimate to an allocentric boundary code (sensory). Self-motion cues (angular and linear displacement estimates) cause grid cell phase shift, in conjunction with compensatory phase noise. Via each associative weight matrix, a boundary code (predictive) is generated from its corresponding grid code, compared to the sensory boundary code, producing an error signal (Error). The magnitude of each error determines the probability of a grid code and its association weight matrix being replaced during resampling (indicated by the red feedback arrow). Concurrently, associative weights between grid and predictive boundary codes continually update using current sensory boundary information.

(<bold>E</bold>) Predictive boundary cells with optimal tuning distances of 16.2 and 33.8 cm from the boundary were used to determine how predictive boundary field positions relate to the rescaling magnitude of grid cells. Other tuning distances were excluded because they were either too long for their fields to be within the arena, or too short for their narrow fields to be adequately sampled by the random trajectory and 2 cm spatial bins. Absolute field position along each tuning direction was scaled to both Trial 1 and 5, the average of which was treated as one vertical (collapsing north and south together) or horizontal (collapsing east and west together) rescaling estimate. The magnitude of partial rescaling was statistically indistinguishable from rat grid cells along all twelve dimensions tested (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05, two-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests, FDR corrected), demonstrating that predictive boundary field rescaling matches rat grid rescaling during arena resizing trials.</p>
