<abstract>
<p>Recent technical advances in the field of quantitative proteomics have stimulated a large number of biomarker discovery studies of various diseases, providing avenues for new treatments and diagnostics. However, inherent challenges have limited the successful translation of candidate biomarkers into clinical use, thus highlighting the need for a robust analytical methodology to transition from biomarker discovery to clinical implementation. We have developed an end-to-end computational proteomic pipeline for biomarkers studies. At the discovery stage, the pipeline emphasizes different aspects of experimental design, appropriate statistical methodologies, and quality assessment of results. At the validation stage, the pipeline focuses on the migration of the results to a platform appropriate for external validation, and the development of a classifier score based on corroborated protein biomarkers. At the last stage towards clinical implementation, the main aims are to develop and validate an assay suitable for clinical deployment, and to calibrate the biomarker classifier using the developed assay. The proposed pipeline was applied to a biomarker study in cardiac transplantation aimed at developing a minimally invasive clinical test to monitor acute rejection. Starting with an untargeted screening of the human plasma proteome, five candidate biomarker proteins were identified. Rejection-regulated proteins reflect cellular and humoral immune responses, acute phase inflammatory pathways, and lipid metabolism biological processes. A multiplex multiple reaction monitoring mass-spectrometry (MRM-MS) assay was developed for the five candidate biomarkers and validated by enzyme-linked immune-sorbent (ELISA) and immunonephelometric assays (INA). A classifier score based on corroborated proteins demonstrated that the developed MRM-MS assay provides an appropriate methodology for an external validation, which is still in progress. Plasma proteomic biomarkers of acute cardiac rejection may offer a relevant post-transplant monitoring tool to effectively guide clinical care. The proposed computational pipeline is highly applicable to a wide range of biomarker proteomic studies.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Novel proteomic technology has led to the generation of vast amounts of biological data and the identification of numerous potential biomarkers. However, computational approaches to translate this information into knowledge capable of impacting clinical care have been lagging. We propose a computational proteomic pipeline for biomarker studies that is founded on the combination of advanced statistical methodologies. We demonstrate our approach through the analysis of data obtained from heart transplant patients. Heart transplantation is the gold standard treatment for patients with end-stage heart failure, but is complicated by episodes of immune rejection that can adversely impact patient outcomes. Current rejection monitoring approaches are highly invasive, requiring a biopsy of the heart. This work aims to reduce the need for biopsies, and demonstrate the power and utility of computational approaches in proteomic biomarker discovery. Our work utilizes novel high-throughput proteomic technology combined with advanced statistical techniques to identify blood markers that guide the decision as to whether a biopsy is warranted, reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies, and ultimately diagnose the presence of rejection in heart transplant patients. Additionally, the proposed computational methodologies can be applied to a range of proteomic biomarker studies of various diseases and conditions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>After the first successful human-to-human heart transplant in 1967, cardiac transplantation became the primary therapy for patients with end-stage heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy or ischemic heart disease. Improvements in immunosuppressive drug therapies have significantly increased the number of successful transplants, yet episodes of acute rejection and progression of chronic rejection remain major factors that negatively impact long term graft survival. Acute rejection is predominantly considered to be an immunological reaction in response to the major and minor histocompatibility antigens recognized as ‘foreign’ by the graft recipient. This process triggers the subsequent activation, migration and infiltration of immune cells such as T- and B-lymphocytes, which can ultimately lead to cellular- and antibody-mediated destruction of the heart allograft tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Heeger1">[1]</xref>. Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB), through which histological features such as cellular infiltration and myocyte damage can be observed, is currently considered to be the only reliable gold standard for diagnosis and monitoring of acute cardiac allograft rejection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Stewart1">[2]</xref>. However, the invasive and qualitative nature, risk of complications, associated cost and lack of timeliness of the results render the EMB a suboptimal procedure for routine monitoring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Tilkian1">[3]</xref>. A more reliable, minimally invasive, inexpensive, and early diagnostic tool to monitor graft survival remains a significant clinical unmet need.</p>
<p>Since proteins may serve as molecular indicators (i.e., biomarkers) of cardiac allograft rejection, plasma proteomics offers an attractive and promising avenue for the development of diagnosis tools for cardiac transplantation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Atkinson1">[4]</xref>. Technical advances in the field of quantitative proteomics in the last decade have enabled the identification and quantitation of thousands of proteins and have stimulated a large body of research focused on the discovery of new biomarkers. However, the translation of candidate biomarkers from discovery research into proteomic tests for clinical use has faced significant challenges, due mostly to a lack of an adequate analytical pipeline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Anderson1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Anderson2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Paulovich1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Rifai1">[8]</xref>. In a significant step forward, technological proteomic pipelines have recently been proposed, optimizing the design of the discovery, validation, and clinical implementation stages of biomarker studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Rifai1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Addona1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Whiteaker1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Nilsson1">[11]</xref>. Nevertheless, the development of new clinical proteomic tests hinges on a tailored computational pipeline to distill the information contained in thousands of proteins into an accurate classifier score with demonstrable clinical utility.</p>
<p>Computational proteomics is a new and expanding field of research which primarily focuses on data management and mass-spectra analysis for the discovery phase of biomarker studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Kll1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Noble1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Cannataro1">[14]</xref>. Although previous work has acknowledged the need of a tailored computational pipeline in proteomics (e.g.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-McGuire1">[15]</xref>), a systematic and complete process that specifically addresses the challenges emerging from proteomic studies has not been proposed or demonstrated to date. Using unsuitable methodological tools to explore and analyze the data may result in the selection of biomarkers that ultimately fail in the final stages of validation, or may fail to select relevant biomarkers. For example, identifying a panel of candidate markers based only on the comparison of relative abundance between case and control samples, or the use of classical statistical tests when the sample size of the study is too small, may result in the identification of many false candidate markers.</p>
<p>We complement previous work by proposing a computation pipeline powered by extensive statistical analysis for all stages of quantitative proteomics biomarker studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002963-g001">Figure 1</xref>). At the discovery stage, the pipeline focuses on selecting an appropriate experimental design and statistical methodologies to identify and assess a panel of candidate biomarkers. At the validation stage, the pipeline emphasizes on the migration of discovery results to the validation platform, and the development and validation of a biomarker classifier. At the clinical implementation stage, the main aims are to develop an assay suitable for clinical deployment, and to calibrate the biomarker classifier using the developed assay.</p>

<p>We demonstrate the power of our methodology in a proteomic biomarker study in the context of cardiac transplantation, with a goal towards the development of a more accurate and less invasive blood test for monitoring graft survival. Our work identified a panel of five candidate plasma proteins that clearly discriminates acute cardiac allograft rejection from non-rejection. These biomarker proteins distribute broadly among three relevant biological processes: cellular and humoral immune responses, acute phase inflammatory pathways and lipid metabolism. Of the five candidate biomarkers, we corroborated four using two independent platforms. A classifier score based on these four corroborated proteins measured by multiple reaction monitoring mass-spectrometry (MRM-MS) demonstrated that plasma protein biomarkers have significant potential in serving as a reliable, minimally-invasive, inexpensive, and timely diagnostic tool for acute cardiac allograft rejection. Our results advance the approaches to diagnosis with respect to cardiac transplantation biomarker, as well as the computational methodologies tailored for a wide range of proteomic biomarker studies.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>A synopsis of the computational pipeline proposed in this study is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002963-g001">Figure 1</xref>. We first describe in detail each of its steps for the discovery, validation, and clinical implementation stages. We then present a brief description of the materials and methods related to the biomarker study in cardiac transplantation used to illustrate the proposed methodology.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Computation Pipeline: Discovery Stage</title>
<p>Recent technological advances in quantitative proteomics have enabled the untargeted quantitation and identification of hundreds to thousands of proteins simultaneously from complex samples such as human plasma. The aim of the discovery pipeline is to create a list of candidate markers from an extensive set of proteins identified and measured within each sample.</p>
<sec id="s2a1">
<title>Step 1: Data preprocessing</title>
<p>The first step of the discovery pipeline is to assemble the data generated by (untargeted) quantitative proteomics approaches to perform further statistical analysis. As broadly reviewed by Nesvizhskii and Aebersold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Nesvizhskii1">[16]</xref>, the appealing peptide-centric nature of most untargeted proteomics methods is faced with the challenge of recovering the identities of the proteins, originally present in the sample, from the list of peptides identified based on the observed MS/MS spectra. In accordance with established guidelines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Bradshaw1">[17]</xref>, most software tools report minimal protein lists sufficient to explain all observed peptides using protein groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Nesvizhskii1">[16]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Shilov1">[18]</xref>, and the example in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002963.s003">Figure S3</xref>). In general, each protein group contains proteins with a high degree of sequence similarity, including multiple entries for one gene product, and isoforms or multiple members of a protein family.</p>
<p>Because for many cases there is insufficient evidence to determine which protein(s) from each group was originally present in the analyzed samples, a comprehensive exploration of the data needs to link and compare protein groups, instead of single protein identities, across multiple experimental runs. Thus, we used an algorithm, called Protein Group Code Algorithm (PGCA), to pre-process protein summaries organized using protein groups (manuscript in preparation). PGCA creates global protein groups from connected groups identified across the different runs and assigns a protein group code (PGC) to each global group. Using this PGC to link groups across multiple runs enables the analysis of interesting proteins that are identified within groups with an unstable composition across runs (further details are given as supporting materials in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002963.s014">Text S1</xref>).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2a2">
<title>Step 2: Sample selection</title>
<p>Motivated by the diagnosis study in cardiac transplantation, this study was designed to ensure a rigorous case-control analysis at the event time. Thus, the discovery cohort (training set) was constructed by selecting one sample per patient to maintain usual assumptions of independence between samples in statistical tests. Samples in the case and control groups were matched 1 to 2 by time post-transplant and, where possible, age and gender. A power calculation was used to determine the number of samples statistically needed within the case and the control groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002963.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). A different design would be required to identify proteins with differential patterns across time requiring a longitudinal analysis of the data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Storey1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Forthofer1">[20]</xref>.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2a3">
<title>Step 3: Pre-filtering</title>
<p>A common observation in most shotgun proteomic studies is that, even when the same sample is processed multiple times, not all peptides are detected in every experimental run (undersampling) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Nilsson1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Nesvizhskii1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Chong1">[21]</xref>. Undersampling may introduce missing values or outlying protein levels in the resulting proteomics data. Considering undersampling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Nesvizhskii1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Chong1">[21]</xref>, the PGCs detected in at least two-thirds of the experimental runs within each analyzed group were considered for subsequent analyses. Although this approach usually increases the number of analyzed proteins, it also introduces missing values in the data.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2a4">
<title>Step 4: Candidate protein markers</title>
<p>An important step of the computational analysis is the selection of candidate protein markers through univariate statistical tests. It is important to note that low sample variance estimates associated with small sample sizes can increase the number of false positives in many classical tests. Thus, when the study sample size is small, we recommend the use of an empirical Bayes method (eBayes) that estimates protein-specific variances by pooling information from other proteins to construct moderated <italic>t</italic>-tests <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Smyth1">[22]</xref>. Further, a robust variant of eBayes tests can be used which is also less sensitive to outlying observations, usually present in proteomics data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Smyth1">[22]</xref>. In our biomarker study, robust eBayes tests were used to identify a list of candidate markers (two-sided test, significance level alpha = 0.01). Alternative univariate methods, including <italic>t</italic>-tests and Wilcoxon tests, can be used in larger discovery studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Hilario1">[23]</xref>. Considering the inherent variability observed in isobaric tagging for relative and absolute protein quantification (iTRAQ) data and the number of analyzed PGCs, <italic>p</italic> values were not adjusted when pursuing multiple inferences as usually performed in microarray data studies. Although the number of false positives was not controlled by this approach, further corroboration of the identified candidate markers was assessed with two independent platforms.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2a5">
<title>Step 5: Quality assessment</title>
<p>Another step of fundamental importance in any discovery study is quality assessment of the identified markers. Several quality control parameters were examined in accordance with guidelines for proteomic data publication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Bradshaw1">[17]</xref>, including the qualitative reproducibility of the depletion, the number of peptides used to identify the proteins in each sample, and other parameters to examine the quality of the identification and quantitation of the proteomics data (more details are given as supporting material in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002963.s014">Text S1</xref>).</p>
<p>The quality of the results was also assessed from a statistical perspective, by examining the potential existence of important confounding factors. As previously demonstrated by Culhane and Quackenbush, the signature of the identified panel may be influenced by the experimental design <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Hummel1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Culhane1">[25]</xref>. Failure to account for potential confounding factors may result in the identification of many false candidate markers that fail to pass the test of validation in an independent cohort. A multivariate ANCOVA approach can be used to test if the simultaneous association between the biomarker panel and the main effect (rejection <italic>versus</italic> non-rejection in our case) remains significant when corrected for potential confounding factors. This test was implemented using the GlobalAncova Bioconductor package (version 3.6.0) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Hummel1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Culhane1">[25]</xref>. Given that the focus of the pipeline is to identify a panel of proteins that <italic>together</italic> discriminate between case and control samples, using a multivariate test is desirable. Later in the pipeline, we also examined the potential effect of the confounding factors on the classifier score.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2a6">
<title>Step 6: Missing values</title>
<p>As some statistical methodologies do not allow the presence of missing values, the imputation of missing values can be a critical step of the computational pipeline. We used a k-nearest neighbor (kNN) approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Troyanskaya1">[26]</xref> to minimize the influence of specific modeling or class information through the imputation. For any missing protein level, the kNN method imputes the weighted average of the protein levels from amongst the k-nearest neighbor proteins available for the corresponding sample. The selection of the k nearest proteins is based on the comparison of protein levels with that of the protein of interest available in other samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Troyanskaya1">[26]</xref>. Different imputation methods were previously compared in a similar case study, suggesting that the decision to impute is more important than the choice of the imputation method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Gibbs1">[27]</xref>.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2a7">
<title>Step 7: Classifier score</title>
<p>The relative levels of the candidate biomarkers were combined into a single classifier score generated by a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier to demonstrate the joint performance of the identified candidate markers. As LDA seeks a linear combination of markers that best discriminates both groups <italic>together</italic>, the proteomics panel can sometimes achieve a satisfactory classification even when single markers do not clearly differentiate groups (i.e., even though some fold-changes appear relatively small). The score was centered at the LDA cut-off point so that samples with positive and negative scores are classified as cases and controls, respectively. Additional details about multivariate classifiers are given in <italic>Step 3</italic> of the Validation Stage.</p>
<p>Although the GlobalAncova analysis performs a simultaneous global assessment for all candidate PGCs, it does not test the influence of potential confounders in the aggregated classifier score. Thus, we also examined the potential effect of the confounding factors on the LDA score by looking at the Pearson correlation between the score and the potential confounders.</p>
</sec></sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Computation Pipeline: Validation Stage</title>
<p>As widely discussed in the literature, any list of candidate markers identified in a discovery stage must be validated in a large and independent cohort of patients before its clinical utility assessment. To bridge the gap between discovery and clinical technologies, the validation stage is usually performed in an independent platform which provides a timely and cost-effective approach to measure all samples. To overcome the dependence on antibody availability, we developed an MRM-MS assay to complete the validation stage. However, similar analytical steps would have been taken if another independent platform was used.</p>
<sec id="s2b1">
<title>Step 1: Technical corroboration</title>
<p>The first step is to corroborate that the results from the discovery are successfully translated to the proteomic technologies required in the validation stage. This technical corroboration was first examined by a correlation analysis among the protein levels in common samples measured by different proteomic platforms. To control the influence of outliers in the results, these correlations were estimated using the Spearman correlation coefficient.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b2">
<title>Step 2: Corroboration of discovery results</title>
<p>The second analytical step is to corroborate that the previously identified differentiation of protein levels between case and control samples is still present when the candidate markers are measured using the new platform(s). The number of samples required for this corroboration needs to be determined based on the estimated variation associated with the new platform (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002963.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). To allow the comparison of results between the discovery and the validation stages, we recommend using the same statistical test as that used in the discovery, e.g., robust eBayes in our biomarker study. Since the purpose of this corroboration is to test the translation of the results in the new platform, a less stringent statistical cutoff can be used, e.g., two-sided test, significance level alpha = 0.05.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b3">
<title>Step 3: Development of a classifier score</title>
<p>Despite the general consensus that a panel of biomarkers will be required to classify new samples in a clinical setting, a fundamental analytical step often neglected during the validation stage is the examination of the complementary contribution of each candidate marker to classify new samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Anderson2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Hastie1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Robin1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-McManus1">[30]</xref>. In general, most studies identify long lists of candidate markers that are then examined in isolation from each other to discriminate case from control sample groups.</p>
<p>In this study, different classifiers were built using MRM-MS measurements that sequentially incorporate the corroborated proteins to evaluate their complementary contribution to the classification performance. Although these multivariate classifiers were constructed by Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) in our biomarker study, alternative methodologies might be considered, including Support Vector Machines, Elastic Net logistic regression analysis, and Random Forests, among others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Hilario1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Hastie1">[28]</xref>. LDA assigns a weight to each contributing protein to generate an aggregated score, called the classifier score <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-McLachlan1">[31]</xref>. The numerical weights of each proteomic marker in the aggregated classifier score thus reflect their contribution to jointly differentiate the case from the control groups. As previously explained, the score was centered at the LDA cut-off point.</p>
<p>The examination of the contribution of each biomarker to the classifier performance can be used to select a final classifier (i.e., a final biomarker panel with the corresponding model) to be tested on an external cohort of patients. Since an independent test cohort was not available at this point, all classification performance measures of the panel were estimated by a stratified 6-fold cross-validation (more details are given as supporting material in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002963.s014">Text S1</xref>). If available, an intermediate cohort can be used to determine the final classifier and the corresponding threshold to be validated. More importantly, the output of this step is a locked-down model (with a threshold selected) to be validated in an independent cohort.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b4">
<title>Step 4: Validation of the classifier score</title>
<p>In the last step of the validation stage, the classifier score must be validated in a large external cohort of patients. Common performance measures include sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Fawcett1">[32]</xref> (definitions are given as supporting material in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002963.s014">Text S1</xref>). Previous methods have been proposed for the determination of the sample size of this stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Pepe1">[33]</xref>. In our biomarker study this stage is still in progress.</p>
</sec></sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Computation Pipeline: Clinical Implementation</title>
<p>The final translation of proteomic results from the validation to the clinical implementation stage requires careful examination of many factors, including the development of assays suitable for clinical laboratories, considerations from health economics, as well as approval of regulatory agencies (e.g., Food and Drug Administration, Conformité Européenne mark) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Rifai1">[8]</xref>. From a methodological point of view, the following steps are crucial to complete this last stage.</p>
<sec id="s2c1">
<title>Step 1: Assay migration</title>
<p>A critical next step towards clinical implementation is to develop and validate an assay suitable for clinical deployment according to Clinical Laboratory and Standards Institute's protocols to measure the proteins in the identified panel.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c2">
<title>Step 2: Calibration of the classifier score</title>
<p>After the assay migration step, the biomarker <italic>classifier score</italic> based on the panel proteins, rather than a simple set of individual proteins, needs to be calibrated using the developed assay. Even though the statistical model to integrate these proteins was locked down in <italic>Step 3</italic> of the Validation stage, new weights that reflect the contribution of each biomarker measured in the new assay to the classifier score must be calculated. This calibration can be performed using either the samples from the training set or those from an intermediate set.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c3">
<title>Step 3: Clinical performance</title>
<p>Lastly, the classifier needs to be tested in an independent and large cohort with clinical complexity. Different performance measures may be evaluated and emphasized depending on the “fit-to-purpose” of the study, including sensitivity, specificity, negative and/or positive predictive value.</p>

<title>Study cohorts</title>
<p>A prospective, longitudinal study, approved by the Human Research Ethics Board of the University of British Columbia, was conducted on 63 patients, with signed consent, who received a cardiac transplant at St. Paul's Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia between March 2005 and February 2008. Of these 63 patients, 44 were included in the acute rejection cohort and were thus part of this study. Patient demographic characteristics are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002963.s009">Table S1</xref>.</p>
<p>Pre-transplant and protocol heart tissue biopsies were blindedly reviewed by multiple cardiac pathologists and classified according to the current International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) grading scale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Stewart1">[2]</xref>. Samples graded with an ISHLT Grade ≥2R (multi-foci or diffuse immune cell infiltration with significant associated myocyte damage) were considered significant in the current study for the case group (acute rejection, AR). Samples with ISHLT Grade 0R (normal EMB with no evidence of cellular infiltration) were considered to construct the control group (non-rejection, NR). Mild non-treatable rejections (ISHLT Grade 1R; some cellular infiltrate with limited or absence of myocyte damage; 1R) were excluded from the case-control discovery analysis and were only used as test samples and for the correlation analysis.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2d3">
<title>iTRAQ samples and data processing</title>
<p>An important component of the experimental design for an untargeted platform like iTRAQ is the choice of the reference sample used to ensure interpretable results across different runs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Kerr1">[34]</xref>. Ideally, this sample should contain all relevant proteins related to the study of interest, thus, pooling some samples from the analyzed groups may be a good option. However, to allow the comparison of the samples in the cardiac study with those of other organs and conditions, a common, pooled normal plasma from 16 healthy individuals was used as a reference sample to run all iTRAQ experiments from different cohorts of the Biomarkers in Transplantation (BiT) initiative. This is consistent with the observations made by Song et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Song1">[35]</xref> that consistency of the reference used throughout the entire experiment, including future comparative studies, is more relevant than the actual composition of the reference sample.</p>
<p>All blood samples were processed following rigorously defined standard operating procedures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Ohlund1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-CohenFreue1">[37]</xref>. Briefly, peripheral blood samples were drawn into ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes. Plasma was separated and depleted of the 14 most abundant proteins (albumin, fibrinogen, transferrin, IgG, IgA, IgM, haptoglobin, α<sub>2</sub>-macroglobulin, α<sub>1</sub>-acid glycoprotein, α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin, apolipoprotein A-I, apolipoprotein A-II, complement C3, and apolipoprotein B) by immunoaffinity chromatography (GenWay Biotech, San Diego, CA), then trypsin digested and labeled (Applied Biosystems; Foster City, CA). Trypsin peptides from the reference sample were labeled with iTRAQ reagent 114 and peptides from 3 patient samples were randomly labeled with reagents 115, 116 and 117. Spotted peptides were analyzed by a 4800 MALDI TOF/TOF analyzer (Applied Biosystems; Foster City, CA), and MS/MS data were processed using ProteinPilot software v2.0 (Applied Biosystems). Database searching was performed against the International Protein Index (IPI HUMAN v3.39 database) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Kersey1">[38]</xref>. As recommended by the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), the IPI accession numbers of the protein identifiers in our biomarker panel were subsequently updated according to the latest version of UniProtKB database. For each analyzed sample, relative protein levels (ratios of labels 115, 116 and 117 relative to 114, respectively) were estimated for each protein group by ProteinPilot. Protein Group Code Algorithm (PGCA) was used to match protein groups identified by Protein Pilot from different experimental runs (manuscript in preparation).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2d4">
<title>Technical validation</title>
<p>Four out of five markers in the panel were assayed either by enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA), for adiponectin (ADIPOQ, R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), factor X (FX, Diapharma, West Chester, OH), and β<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin (B2M, standard clinical laboratory), or by immunonephelometric assay (INA) for serum ceruloplasmin (CP, standard clinical laboratory). ELISA/INA assays were not available for phospholipid transfer protein precursor (PLTP). The same pooled plasma control used for iTRAQ, and patient plasma samples were assayed in duplicate or triplicate. An analogous pooled serum control sample was used for CP. Data from ELISA kits was analyzed on a VersaMax Tunable Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).</p>

<title>Discovery Stage</title>
<p>In the discovery stage, multiplexed iTRAQ-LC-MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry was used to identify and quantitate proteins from 108 depleted plasma samples representing a time course of 20 weeks from the first 26 patients enrolled (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002963.s002">Figure S2</xref>). These samples were processed in 50 independent iTRAQ runs, including other samples from the heart cohort. In addition, each iTRAQ run included a normal pooled control plasma sample to provide a common reference across multiple runs. A total of 924 protein groups (PGCs) was cumulatively identified from the 50 runs with an average of 273 PGCs within each run.</p>
<p>Following the selection criteria and the power calculation described in the supporting material (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002963.s014">Text S1</xref>), the first AR samples from 6 (out of 8) AR patients were selected as cases, and samples from 14 (out of 18) NR patients at matching time points were selected as controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002963.s002">Figure S2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002963-t001">Table 1</xref>). The remaining 88 longitudinally collected iTRAQ samples were used as test samples to initially validate the results at the Discovery stage. Although samples in this test set are part of BiT cohort, none of them were previously used in the training set. As described in Step 3 of the Discovery stage, only those PGCs identified in at least 2/3 of the AR and the NR groups were considered for further analysis. The resulting data consisted of 127 PGCs measured in at least 4 (out of 6) AR patients and 10 (out of 14) NR patients. Of these 127 PGCs, 51 PGCs contained 133 missing values out of a total of 1020 values (i.e., 51 PGCs×20 patients).</p>

<p>The results from the iTRAQ discovery analysis were corroborated and initially validated by two independent assays: ELISA/INA (available for ADIPOQ, F10, B2M, and CP), and MRM-MS (developed for ADIPOQ, F10, B2M, CP, and PLTP). Following the results of the power calculation illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002963.s002">Figure S2B</xref>, a total of 43 patients were selected and plasma and serum samples were processed by ELISA/INA for an initial validation cohort that extends the discovery cohort. A subset of 25 of these 43 samples, 7 AR, 6 1R and 12 NR, were also part of the iTRAQ discovery cohort. Of these 25 samples, 23 were also processed by MRM-MS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002963-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002963.s002">Figures S2A and S2B</xref>).

In this initial validation, all test samples were correctly classified by the proteomic classifier score. However, because the test samples in the cross-validation were still part of the discovery analysis, these performance measures cannot be used to characterize the identified classifier. Although similar results were obtained using the ELISA/INA measurements on an extended cohort of patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002963.s008">Figure S8B</xref>), a larger validation in an external cohort of patients is still required to complete this phase.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Over the last two decades, the accelerating pace of technological progress has initiated a new era in the field of clinical proteomics. In particular, plasma proteomics offers a powerful tool to examine the underlying mechanisms of various diseases and opens novel avenues for biomarkers discoveries. To date, the number and quality of technical resources available for proteomic biomarker studies are well recognized. However, the development of statistical methods to address the challenges that have arisen in the field has lagged behind, dramatically reducing the pace, quality and precision of biomarker studies. An important piece of the puzzle in clinical proteomics is to distill the information contained in the very rich data generated by new proteomic technologies via a tailored computational pipeline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-McGuire1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study we propose and apply a computational pipeline that provides a systematic process to analyze proteomics data related to biomarker studies. The computational steps described in this study are consistent with, and complement those described in previous technological and analytical pipelines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Anderson2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Rifai1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Addona1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Whiteaker1">[10]</xref>. Our pipeline successfully generated an accurate classifier score based on four plasma proteins to diagnose acute rejection in patients who have received cardiac transplants.</p>
<p>There are likely additional plasma protein biomarkers that were not identified by this approach. For example, additional candidate markers may be identified using a different reference sample or an alternative proteomics platform. However, initial validation results indicate that a classifier score based on 4 corroborated biomarkers can achieve a satisfactory classification of acute rejection and non-rejection samples. If validated in a larger and external cohort of patients, the identified proteomic biomarker panel can be used to develop a more accurate and minimally invasive clinical blood test to monitor allograft rejection.</p>
<p>The analysis may also reveal some biomarkers previously associated with unrelated disease phenotypes, or that are not linked to cardiac transplantation. In general, looking at injury controls is a good idea and ideally one would want to include such to show that the identified panel is specific for the disease of interest. However, such comparisons would require additional carefully phenotyped cohorts, analyzed with the same analytical and technological methods on the same sample source, which for many relevant injuries are difficult or impossible to obtain. The data shown in our study do not address this point and much more work needs to be done on the comparison of acute rejection with other injuries.</p>
<p>The complex pathobiology of acute cardiac allograft rejection is reflected in the heterogeneity of markers identified in this study. The majority of proteins identified distribute broadly among three biological processes, consistent with the current understanding and pathogenesis of acute rejection: cellular and humoral immune responses, acute phase inflammatory pathways and lipid metabolism. Our results also highlight the anticipated distinction between the plasma proteome and that observed in tissue-based discovery studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Borozdenkova1">[44]</xref>. As well, while circulating protein markers of acute allograft rejection found by others were mainly indicative of tissue damage and stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Borozdenkova1">[44]</xref>, we also identified markers that implicate immune and vascular processes, in addition to other aspects of the rejection process. In general, knowing the biological process of the identified markers may lead to a better understanding of disease pathogenesis, and to novel therapeutic targets.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Cellular and Humoral Immunity</title>
<p>Transplantation elicits a host immune response that encompasses both cellular and humoral immunity, which together lead to graft tissue damage, and episodes of acute and chronic rejection. B2M is a protein associated with MHC Class I histocompatibility antigens, with increased levels reflecting allograft rejection, autoimmune or lymphoproliferative diseases as a result of increased immune activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Erez1">[45]</xref>. Several studies have reported higher circulating levels of B2M in cardiac or renal allograft rejection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Schmitt1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Goldman1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Roxe1">[48]</xref>, consistent with our observations. Importantly, our data demonstrates improved classification performance when additional markers are used with B2M.</p>

<title>Acute Phase Response/Inflammation</title>
<p>Acute rejection resulting from cellular infiltration of the graft leads to severe local inflammation, which has systemic consequences with a concomitant increase in circulating inflammatory markers. The acute phase response to inflammatory stimuli involves the production and release of numerous plasma proteins by the liver. CP, significantly up-regulated in AR relative to NR samples in this study, is a positive acute phase reactant. It is elevated in acute and chronic inflammatory states and elevated plasma CP is also associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Tang1">[49]</xref>. CP is a player in inflammation, coagulation, angiogenesis, and vasculopathy, but its role in the pathogenesis of acute rejection is unknown. Current evidence supports a relationship between inflammation and coagulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Levi1">[50]</xref>. FX, a key mediator in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, is up-regulated in our acute rejection cohort, and this finding may reflect an intersection between inflammatory and coagulation responses in acute rejection. However, this protein was not validated in our study. C reactive protein (CRP), an acute phase reactant protein previously studied in the context of acute cardiac allograft rejection, was not identified in our study. Consistent with this finding, previous work has demonstrated conflicting evidence regarding the informative value of CRP in monitoring acute cardiac allograft rejection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Arora1">[51]</xref>.</p>

<title>Lipid Metabolism</title>
<p>Dyslipidemia as a consequence of immunosuppressive therapy has been reported in cardiac allograft recipients, and is a risk factor for chronic rejection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Magnani1">[52]</xref>. Lipid metabolism is represented by two proteins in our panel: ADIPOQ and PLTP. ADIPOQ is a circulating plasma protein involved in metabolic processes shown to play a role in atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Okamoto1">[53]</xref>. Work by Nakano and others described elevated ADIPOQ as reflective of tolerance following a rat model of orthotopic liver transplantation, suggesting a mechanistic role for this protein and corresponding with the observed decrease in ADIPOQ levels during acute rejection episodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Nakano1">[54]</xref>. Further, recent work by Okamoto and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Okamoto2">[55]</xref> has demonstrated that ADIPOQ inhibits allograft rejection in a murine model of cardiac transplantation. PLTP plays a role in HDL remodeling and cholesterol metabolism but its involvement in acute rejection is unknown.</p>
<p>A comparison between the current panel identified for the diagnosis of cardiac allograft rejection, and that of renal allograft rejection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-CohenFreue1">[37]</xref>, reveals that the biological roles of identified proteins are shared in the setting of both transplantation situations. Moreover, the relative regulation of proteins involved in these biological processes is likewise shared. Our current data reveals a differentiation of particular molecules involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac versus renal allograft rejection.</p>
<p>The plasma protein markers identified in this study have the potential to be further assessed in combinatorial analyses with Biomarkers in Transplantation (BiT) genomic and metabolomic data. Notably, numerous research groups, including the BiT group, have identified potential gene expression markers of cardiac allograft rejection using microarray and qPCR analyses of peripheral and whole blood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Horwitz1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Deng1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Schoels1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002963-Lin1">[59]</xref>. These studies provide an opportunity for a systems biology approach to understanding allograft rejection.</p>
<p>Taken together, the panel of protein markers identified and initially validated in this study offers a fresh approach to the diagnosis of acute cardiac rejection, providing novel avenues of investigation and potential new targets for therapeutic intervention. The computational pipeline proposed and applied in this biomarker is highly applicable to a wide range of biomarker proteomic studies.</p>
