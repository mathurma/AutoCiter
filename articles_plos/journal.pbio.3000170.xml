<abstract>
<p>Depolarization of presynaptic terminals stimulates calcium influx, which evokes neurotransmitter release and activates phosphorylation-based signalling. Here, we present the first global temporal profile of presynaptic activity-dependent phospho-signalling, which includes two KCl stimulation levels and analysis of the poststimulus period. We profiled 1,917 regulated phosphopeptides and bioinformatically identified six temporal patterns of co-regulated proteins. The presynaptic proteins with large changes in phospho-status were again prominently regulated in the analysis of 7,070 activity-dependent phosphopeptides from KCl-stimulated cultured hippocampal neurons. Active zone scaffold proteins showed a high level of activity-dependent phospho-regulation that far exceeded the response from postsynaptic density scaffold proteins. Accordingly, bassoon was identified as the major target of neuronal phospho-signalling. We developed a probabilistic computational method, KinSwing, which matched protein kinase substrate motifs to regulated phosphorylation sites to reveal underlying protein kinase activity. This approach allowed us to link protein kinases to profiles of co-regulated presynaptic protein networks. Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα (CaMKIIα) responded rapidly, scaled with stimulus strength, and had long-lasting activity. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) was the main protein kinase predicted to control a distinct and significant pattern of poststimulus up-regulation of phosphorylation. This work provides a unique resource of activity-dependent phosphorylation sites of synaptosomes and neurons, the vast majority of which have not been investigated with regard to their functional impact. This resource will enable detailed characterization of the phospho-regulated mechanisms impacting the plasticity of neurotransmitter release.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Neurobiological processes are altered by linking neuronal activity to regulated changes in protein phosphorylation levels that influence protein function. Although some of the major targets of activity-dependent phospho-signalling have been identified, a large number of substrates remain unknown. Here, we have screened systematically for these substrates and extended the list from hundreds to thousands of phosphorylation sites, thereby providing a new depth of understanding. We monitored phospho-signalling for 15 min after the stimulation, which to our knowledge had not been attempted at a large scale. We focused on presynaptic protein substrates of phospho-signalling by isolating the presynaptic terminal. We also stimulated hippocampal neurons but did not monitor the poststimulus. Although the phospho-signalling is immensely complex, the findings could be simplified through data exploration. We identified distinct patterns of presynaptic phospho-regulation across the time course that may constitute co-regulated protein networks. In addition, we found a subset of proteins that had many more phosphorylation sites than the average and high-magnitude responses, implying major signalling or functional roles for these proteins. We also determined the likely protein kinases with the strongest responses to the stimulus at different times using KinSwing, a computational tool that we developed. This resource reveals a new depth of activity-dependent phospho-signalling and identifies major signalling targets, major protein kinases, and co-regulated phosphoprotein networks.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Depolarization of the presynaptic plasma membrane stimulates the opening of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> rapidly enters at the active zone. Increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggers neurotransmitter release by binding to Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors such as synaptotagmin 1, which facilitates fast synchronous fusion of docked synaptic vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref003">3</xref>]. Docking and priming of synaptic vesicles, as well as Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clustering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref005">5</xref>], are coordinated by scaffold proteins at the active zone. Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are tethered in proximity to synaptic vesicles directly by Rab3-interacting molecules (RIMs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref007">7</xref>] and/or by a complex including bassoon and RIM-binding protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref008">8</xref>]. As such, the protein composition of the active zone scaffold not only is important for vesicle release but also exerts influence on release probability and presynaptic homeostatic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>The influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> following depolarization also stimulates phosphorylation-based signalling. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of presynaptic proteins at the active zone are strongly coupled to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in the vicinity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, rather than the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref010">10</xref>]. Ca<sup>2+</sup> binds calmodulin, and this complex activates downstream phospho-signalling pathways that directly affect release properties. For example, Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) phosphorylation of synapsin 1 has a role in changing the availability of synaptic vesicles for release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref011">11</xref>]. Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin also activates the phosphatase calcineurin (protein phosphatase 2B) and downstream phosphatases. Three synapsin 1 sites—S62, S67, and S549—are dephosphorylated by calcineurin and may contribute to increased availability of synaptic vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref012">12</xref>]. Calcineurin has also been shown to directly regulate synaptic vesicle endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref014">14</xref>]. The main protein kinases mediating presynaptic phospho-signalling and plasticity are protein kinase C (PKC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref016">16</xref>], protein kinase A (PKA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref009">9</xref>], cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref017">17</xref>], and extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase 1/3 (MAPK1/3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref018">18</xref>]. However, the identity of the presumably large number of substrates, the timing and interdependence of protein kinase activation or inactivation, and mechanistic consequences remain largely unresolved, as the complex activity-driven network of presynaptic kinases has previously not been explored systematically, to our knowledge.</p>
<p>There are few global studies of activity-dependent neuronal phospho-signalling. The postsynaptic density has been enriched to reveal postsynaptic signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref020">20</xref>]. Here, we use a subcellular compartment enrichment strategy to focus on presynaptic proteins. Sucrose homogenates of brain tissue produce a particulate fraction that contains both pre- and postsynaptic components but is primarily enriched in isolated presynaptic terminals, i.e., synaptosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref022">22</xref>]. Synaptosomes contain synaptic vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref022">22</xref>], are metabolically active, generate adenosine triphosphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref023">23</xref>], and maintain a membrane potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref024">24</xref>] and calcium homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref025">25</xref>]. Thus, synaptosomes are a highly functional model for studying presynaptic phospho-signalling in isolation. Depolarization of synaptosomes with KCl stimulates concentration-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref026">26</xref>]. A subset of the targets of presynaptic phospho-signalling, which are dependent on the initial Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, has been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref027">27</xref>]. However, the broader and functionally important question of how synaptic phospho-signalling develops following a period of neuronal activity remains to be addressed. The poststimulus period has only been examined with very limited scope for a few well-characterized phosphorylation sites in synapsin 1 and MAPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref029">29</xref>]. Such transient and persistent changes in the presynaptic phosphoproteome following activity are of crucial importance, as they are likely tightly linked to several forms of synaptic plasticity, which ensure that activity in neuronal networks remains within physiological limits and provide the basis for information storage, learning, and memory.</p>
<p>Here, we used quantitative phosphoproteomics to extensively define the targets and regulators of presynaptic phospho-signalling by examining both the stimulus and poststimulus periods. Exploration of the data revealed distinct temporal patterns of regulation. The relevance of our data is further underscored by the finding that cultured hippocampal neurons exhibited a similar activity-dependent response and confirmed the identity of several predominantly presynaptic phospho-signalling integrator proteins. A new computational method, KinSwing, was used to determine the profile of relative protein kinase activity, based on protein kinase substrate prediction. The inferred protein kinase activity was matched to the patterns of presynaptic phospho-regulation, revealing that a poststimulus up-regulation of phosphorylation was likely to be substantially mediated by MAPK/ERK. Proteins regulating vesicle release were prominent substrates of poststimulus up-regulation of phosphorylation.</p>

<title>Phosphoproteomic analysis of depolarized and repolarized synaptosomes and depolarized hippocampal neurons</title>
<p>Synaptosomes were stimulated with 20 mM KCl or 76 mM KCl (half of total monovalent salt)—or mock treated by keeping 4.7 mM KCl—for 10 s and subsequently returned to 4.7 mM KCl to enable repolarization. We confirmed the acute nature of this stimulation protocol by showing that the depolarization only acted during the 10-s period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s001">S1 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s011">S1 Data</xref>). The synaptosomes were lysed at specific times to monitor changes to the phosphoproteome—i.e., at the end of the depolarization (10 s) and at three poststimulus time points (90, 300, and 900 s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Changes in phosphorylation levels relative to the mock stimulation over time were determined using a global quantitative phosphoproteomics workflow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref030">30</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and methods</xref>).</p>

<title>Quantitative analysis of activity-dependent phospho-signalling in synaptosomes and hippocampal neurons.</title>
<p>(A) The experimental workflow started with either synaptosomes from the whole brain of adult rats or cultured primary hippocampal neurons. Shown is a schematic of the stimulation protocol for synaptosomes and neurons and the time points examined. Only the synaptosomes were repolarized by including a centrifugation and solution exchange step and were studied for the temporal evolution of phospho-signalling. The lysed samples were digested, enriched for phosphopeptides, analyzed by quantitative phosphoproteomics, and processed using a bioinformatics approach that included determination of inferred protein kinase activity using KinSwing. (B) Principal component analysis of the processed time course data for 76 mM KCl stimulation. All six biological replicates for each time point are shown in the same colour. Counts of the phosphopeptides and phosphoproteins identified are shown for (C) synaptosomes and (D) primary hippocampal neurons. The counts were calculated with and without filtering for phosphorylation site localization and quantification confidence. The phosphopeptide data are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s009">S1 Table</xref>. The synaptosome data are the result of six independent experiments for each stimulation condition (20 mM and 76 mM KCl). The cultured hippocampal neuron data are from three independent experiments. HILIC, hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; IMAC, immobilized metal affinity chromatography; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry; TMT, tandem mass tag.</p>

<p>The synaptosome data were processed and interrogated using a robust bioinformatics approach. Only high-confidence phosphopeptides with a probability score ≥ 0.75 for phosphorylation site assignment detected in at least three of the six biological replicates were used for further analyses. Our statistical workflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and methods</xref>) involved normalization, missing value imputation, and correction for nonbiological sources of variation, as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref032">32</xref>]. Unsupervised principle component analysis (PCA) of all phosphopeptides separated the time points across the first principle component, indicating that phosphorylation of peptides was largely occurring in a time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). A total of 5,715 unique phosphopeptides were quantified in the intersection of 20 and 76 mM KCl stimulation experiments from 1,825 proteins (not counting isoforms and multiprotein identifications) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s009">S1 Table</xref>). A total of 1,917 phosphopeptides were significantly up-/down-regulated over time and detected in both the 20 mM and 76 mM KCl conditions. Significance across time was determined using a moderated F-statistic adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing. <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 was required for inclusion in the set of 1,917 phosphopeptides.</p>
<p>The phosphoproteome was perturbed more by 76 mM KCl stimulation, when compared to 20 mM KCl, and at earlier time points. At 10 s, there were approximately double the number of significant changes resulting from 76 mM KCl stimulation compared to 20 mM KCl (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s002">S2A–S2C Fig</xref>; a moderated t-statistic adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing was used to determine the significance of single time points, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). This supports the view of a graded response of the presynaptic phosphoproteome to different levels of stimulation. At 300 and 900 s, significant phospho-signalling persisted, but the difference in number of significantly regulated phosphorylation sites between 20 mM and 76 mM KCl stimulation was smaller (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s002">S2A–S2C Fig</xref>). Thus, perturbation of phospho-signalling was found to be long-lasting as a consequence of acute stimulation.</p>
<p>To provide a resource of broad utility, we also stimulated cultured hippocampal neurons with 76 mM KCl for 10 s and quantified changes in phospho-signalling using our bioinformatics approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g001">Fig 1A</xref><bold>)</bold>. This resulted in the confident identification of 22,063 unique phosphopeptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g001">Fig 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s009">S1 Table</xref>), of which 7,070 were significantly regulated by the stimulation (moderated t-statistic adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Only 4.6% of these activity-dependent sites have a known function or regulatory role, and only four of the top 100 largest magnitude significant changes have been explored up to now (PhosphoSitePlus, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref033">33</xref>]). A similarly small fraction of activity-independent phosphorylation sites (4.8%) identified have a known function or regulatory role. This indicates a very large gap in the knowledge of signalling mechanisms dependent on neuronal activity.</p>
<p>A total of 3,549 phosphopeptides were identified in both neurons and synaptosomes (intersection). An intersection of 195 phosphopeptides from 123 proteins were significantly regulated after 10 s of 76 mM KCl stimulation in synaptosomes and neurons. These phosphopeptide signals were well correlated (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.51, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s002">S2D Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s011">S1 Data</xref>). To avoid comparison of phosphoproteins that occur in multiple subneuronal compartments, we focused on active zone scaffold and synaptic vesicle–associated proteins, which are highly specific to the nerve terminal and key components of the release machinery (listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s009">S1 Table</xref>), thereby excluding postsynaptic proteins by default. This presynaptic-focused correlation analysis is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g002">Fig 2A</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s011">S1 Data</xref>).

The high correlation between the activity-induced phospho-signalling in synaptosomes and cultured hippocampal neurons indicates that signalling pathways in synaptosomes were well preserved.</p>

<title>Comparison of activity-dependent changes in synaptosomes and cultured neurons identifies bassoon as a major target of phospho-signalling.</title>
<p>(A) Plot of log<sub>2</sub>(76 mM KCl 10-s-stimulated intensity/control intensity) for selected phosphopeptides from cultured hippocampal neurons versus whole-brain synaptosomes. The phosphopeptides compared were required to be from well-established presynaptic proteins. That is, they were exclusively active zone scaffold proteins or synaptic vesicle–associated proteins. Thus, by default, all postsynaptic and ubiquitous proteins were excluded. Solid circles are phosphopeptides significantly regulated in both types of samples. Open circles are phosphopeptides significantly regulated in at least one sample. Selected solid circles have a red outline and are labelled with a gene name. Two specific synapsin 1 phosphorylation sites are featured. Underlying data for this figure can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s011">S1 Data</xref>. (B) Heat map of bassoon log<sub>2</sub>(stimulated intensity/control intensity) values across time for significantly regulated phosphopeptides from synaptosomes and hippocampal neurons using the indicated colour scale. Note that some log<sub>2</sub> fold changes are outside of the colour scale range. The chosen scale was intended to provide greater emphasis for low-moderate fold changes throughout this work, even though some signals will be saturated. See (A) for an example of the data shown on a larger log<sub>2</sub> scale. The bassoon domain structure of UniProt accession O88778, obtained from Pfam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref034">34</xref>], is shown with accurate phosphorylation site positions. Synaptosome data were required to have significant up-/down-regulation at one or more time points. For hippocampal neurons, “ns” means not significantly regulated. Phosphorylation site positions are from bassoon accessions O8878 and G3V984 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s009">S1 Table</xref>). (C) A protein localization and interaction network for selected protein components of the active zone scaffold, synaptic vesicles, postsynaptic density, and glutamate receptor proteins. The log<sub>2</sub> intensities for phosphopeptides after 10 s of 76 mM KCl stimulation of hippocampal cultured neurons were summed for each protein. This value was used to scale the letter size of the gene name in the protein network. Experimentally verified protein interactions (STRING) are shown as red edges. (D) Graphs of the number of significantly regulated phosphorylation sites against the protein length (amino acid residues) for synaptosomes (upper) and hippocampal neurons (lower). Proteins with relative high numbers of regulated phosphorylation sites are labelled by their gene name. Proteins proposed to be presynaptic signal integrators have blue labels. There was no linear correlation between the parameters in either graph of synaptosome (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.06) or neuronal data (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.04). The synaptosome data are the result of six independent experiments for each stimulation condition (20 mM and 76 mM KCl). The cultured hippocampal neuron data are from three independent experiments.

<p>Eight of the top 100 largest changes from hippocampal neurons were sites from bassoon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Bassoon appears to be the major target of neuronal activity-dependent phospho-signalling and is targeted for phosphorylation and dephosphorylation along its entire lengthy sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). In contrast, the postsynaptic density proteins and glutamate receptors had a relatively modest response to stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). A formal comparison of the number of significantly regulated phosphorylation sites against protein length revealed that bassoon did indeed have one of the highest numbers of regulated phosphorylation sites per amino acid residue. There was no correlation between number of regulated phosphorylation sites and length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g002">Fig 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s011">S1 Data</xref>). The same lack of correlation was observed for the regulated phosphorylation sites from hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Presynaptic substrates, such as RIM1 and microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B; gene names: <italic>Rims1</italic> and <italic>Map1b</italic>) featured among the high-magnitude changes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s009">S1 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s011">S1 Data</xref>), indicating that activity-dependent phospho-signalling has a pronounced effect on a subset of presynaptic substrates.</p>

<title>Validation of activity-dependent phospho-signalling</title>
<p>The vesicle-tethering protein synapsin 1 is the only presynaptic protein that has been substantially examined during the poststimulus period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref028">28</xref>]. We identified 26 significantly regulated synapsin 1 phosphopeptides from synaptosomes. Synapsin 1 S566, a CaMKIIα substrate site from in vitro studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref035">35</xref>], was the most up-regulated site at 10 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Another CaMKIIα substrate and activity-dependent site, S603 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref012">12</xref>], was also up-regulated at 10 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), and this was confirmed by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s011">S1 Data</xref>) using 76 mM KCl stimulation. Phosphorylation of these D domain sites is expected to promote the dispersion of the recently identified synapsin liquid phase and associated vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref036">36</xref>]. Phosphorylation was generally up-regulated for the vesicle binding A domain and the E domain of synapsin 1. The phospho-regulation patterns were complex for domains B and D that contain evolutionarily conserved low complexity and disordered sequences, as identified by the Pfam (protein families) database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref034">34</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). In agreement with a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref028">28</xref>], we observed bidirectional regulation of S549 and S62+S67 in our synaptosome data for both 20 and 76 mM KCl stimulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Another well-studied presynaptic substrate, dynamin 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref038">38</xref>], was down-regulated at major activity-dependent phosphosites S774 and S778 at 10 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). Thus, our synaptosome phosphoproteomics data reproduce known stimulus and poststimulus phospho-specific profiles, verifying the validity of our stimulation and repolarization paradigm.</p>

<title>Data clustering and enrichment analysis</title>
<p>To determine which groups of proteins and/or biological processes had similar activity-dependent temporal phospho-signalling, the 1,917 significantly regulated phosphopeptides from synaptosomes were k-means clustered across time for both concentrations of KCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g004">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s009">S1 Table</xref>). Phospho-regulated postsynaptic proteins were not filtered from the data prior to the clustering, or for any analysis in this work, except where stated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). We rely on the knowledge that, although small intact postsynaptic compartments are present in synaptosome preparations, the predominant component is the isolated presynaptic terminal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref022">22</xref>]. Six clusters were determined as optimal for enrichment analysis (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s003">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s011">S1 Data</xref>).

<p>Cluster 4 phosphorylation was, overall, slightly down-regulated at 10 s and highly up-regulated at 300–900 s after 20 mM KCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g004">Fig 4A–4C</xref>). After 76 mM KCl, the down-regulation at 10 s was greater in magnitude, and there was less up-regulation at 300–900 s. Cluster 2 phospho-regulation also exhibited an overall slight bidirectionality; a change in direction occurred for some phosphopeptides from 90 to 300 s after 20 mM KCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g004">Fig 4A–4C</xref>). The pattern changed to down-regulation at all time points after 76 mM KCl. Cluster 1 and 2 had high-magnitude initial regulation that continued into the poststimulus, and the regulation extended further after 76 mM KCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g004">Fig 4A–4C</xref>). Cluster 1 up-regulation outlasted cluster 2 down-regulation for at least 10 min of the time course after 20 mM KCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). Cluster 3 phosphorylation sites mainly failed to respond at 10 s but were down-regulated throughout the poststimulus, and this was independent of the strength of stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g004">Fig 4A–4C</xref>). This implies a temporally controlled signalling mechanism that specifically changes the poststimulus balance of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation independent of the level of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Cluster 5 was similarly disconnected from the stimulus strength in the poststimulus but at a relatively low level of down-regulation. Low-magnitude up-regulated cluster 6 had more phosphopeptides up-regulated at 300 s after 76 mM KCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g004">Fig 4A–4C</xref>). Thus, clustering enabled the identification of six specific patterns of phosphopeptide regulation, including high-magnitude up-regulation &gt; 5 min post stimulus, and some were highly influenced by the stimulus strength.</p>
<p>Each cluster was subsequently investigated for gene ontology enrichment. The cellular component term “presynaptic active zone” was most enriched in cluster 2, followed by clusters 1, 4, and 5. There was a lack of enrichment in cluster 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s011">S1 Data</xref>). Clusters showing enrichment contained active zone proteins such as bassoon, piccolo, RIM1, liprin-α3, ELKS1, and ELKS2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref005">5</xref>]. High-magnitude down-regulated cluster 2 was also enriched with the “synaptic vesicle” term (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) and contained synapsin 1 and endocytic proteins known to be substrates of calcineurin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref013">13</xref>]. Multiple members of the microtubule-binding collapsin response mediator protein family were specifically enriched in cluster 1, resulting in inclusion of the “hydrolase activity, acting on carbon-nitrogen (but not peptide) bonds” molecular function term in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g005">Fig 5B</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s011">S1 Data</xref>). The “protein serine/threonine kinase activity” molecular function term was enriched for clusters 1 and 4. The “protein kinase binding” term was enriched for up-regulated clusters 1 and 6 and somewhat enriched for down-regulated clusters 2 and 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Poststimulus up-regulated cluster 4 was enriched with the molecular function term “microtubule binding” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Low-magnitude down-regulated cluster 5 was most enriched for “GTPase activator activity”. Low-magnitude up-regulated cluster 6 was the only cluster enriched for “voltage-gated potassium channel activity” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g005">Fig 5B</xref>) and the biological process term “potassium ion transmembrane transport” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s011">S1 Data</xref>). The term “neurotransmitter secretion” was enriched for clusters 1, 2, 4, and 6. Clusters 2 and 6 were enriched for “exocytosis” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Cluster 1 was enriched for the “microtubule cytoskeleton organization” term (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Cluster 3 lacked significant enrichment for most terms, except “cytoskeletal organization” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). In general, higher-magnitude clusters 1, 2, and 4 revealed phospho-signalling that targeted active zone scaffold components, protein kinases, the collapsin response mediator protein family, and vesicular and cytoskeletal-related proteins, which may influence neurotransmitter release, the synaptic vesicle cycle, and regulation of the cytoskeleton/microtubules.</p>

<p>The enriched gene ontology terms lacked cluster specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g005">Fig 5A–5C</xref>).

Further separation of proteins was achieved by using the largest magnitude change of log<sub>2</sub> intensity as a multiplier of cluster number (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s004">S4B Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s011">S1 Data</xref>). Tau (<italic>Mapt</italic>), SNAP25-interacting protein (<italic>Srcin1</italic>), and RIM1 (<italic>Rims1</italic>) were identified as proteins represented in four of six clusters, with relatively high-magnitude responses and numbers of significantly regulated phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s004">S4A and S4B Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s011">S1 Data</xref>). In contrast, spectrin beta chain (273 kDa, <italic>Sptbn1</italic>) had 14 regulated phosphopeptide signals that were present in only two clusters, 13 of which were in lower-magnitude cluster 5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s009">S1 Table</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g002">Fig 2D</xref> (blue-coloured gene names), the same proteins we singled out for representation in multiple clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s005">S5A–S5F Fig</xref>) had higher numbers of regulated sites per length but were not required to be large proteins. Representation in many clusters suggests participation in multiple phospho-signalling pathways, which can potentially be independently modulated and impact multiple downstream functions. These highly phospho-regulated proteins are important presynaptic signal integrators and indicate that presynaptic protein functions can be subject to diverse phospho-signalling pathways.</p>
<p>Since phosphorylation site functions do not relate directly to ontology terms at the gene level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g005">Fig 5A–5C</xref>), we investigated ontology at the level of phosphorylation sites. Publicly available curated descriptions of the regulatory role of specific phosphorylation sites are available from PhosphoSitePlus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref033">33</xref>]. We determined the enrichment of these phospho-regulation terms for each cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g005">Fig 5D</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and methods</xref>). Most clusters exhibited a different pattern of enrichment. However, the low number of phosphorylation sites associated with phospho-regulation terms (&lt;5%, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s009">S1 Table</xref>) limited the power of this analysis. Significant fold enrichment was determined in poststimulus up-regulated cluster 4 for “intracellular localization” and “cytoskeletal reorganization” terms (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). The process of cytoskeletal reorganization was collectively regulated by specific phosphorylation sites in tau (<italic>Mapt</italic>), phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase type-1 γ (<italic>Pip5k1c</italic>), insulin receptor substrate p53 (IRSp53; <italic>Baiap2</italic>), Septin 7 (<italic>Sept7</italic>), and exocyst complex component 7 (<italic>Exoc7</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s009">S1 Table</xref>). Thus, poststimulus phospho-regulation of the cytoskeleton was a significant process identified in the pattern of cluster 4.</p>

<title>Unbiased assessment of protein kinase contribution over time using KinSwing</title>
<p>The clusters of phosphopeptides in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g004">Fig 4A</xref> were first analyzed for protein kinase substrate motif enrichment using motif-x [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref040">40</xref>]. The CaMK protein kinase family RXXS motif was enriched for cluster 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s006">S6A Fig</xref>). Proline-directed motifs, with proline in the +1 position relative to the phosphorylation site, were mainly enriched for down-regulated clusters. The PXSP motif associated with MAPK substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref041">41</xref>] was enriched in cluster 4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s006">S6A Fig</xref>). These results indicate that particular families or classes of protein kinases may be associated with the clusters of regulated phosphorylation sites. However, this approach lacks the sophistication required to narrow the prediction to specific protein kinases.</p>
<p>Ideally, we would identify and determine the contribution of the major protein kinases at specific time points. To achieve this, we developed a computational method named KinSwing. KinSwing is a statistical approach that integrates known protein kinase substrate motifs, probabilistic matching to substrate sequences, significance of phospho-regulation, and direction of phospho-regulation over time to infer the contribution of specific protein kinases to phospho-signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and methods</xref>). KinSwing does not require the data to be clustered a priori. Instead, KinSwing determines protein kinase contribution at each time point, which can be subsequently used for clustering. First, position weight matrices, representing the frequency of occurrence for each amino acid residue, at and adjacent to the phosphorylation site, were determined for 355 protein kinases using experimentally verified substrate sequences described in the PhosphoSitePlus database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref033">33</xref>]. The probability of a significant motif match for each phosphopeptide in our study was then determined and used to identify substrate sequences. The substrates that either significantly increased or decreased in phosphorylation, at each time point, were assigned a positive or negative “swing” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). An overall sum of “swings” was calculated, with consideration for the number of substrate sequence matches, such that the sum for each protein kinase was weighted and transformed into a z-score, enabling relative comparisons between protein kinases and across time (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and methods</xref>). The z-score will henceforth be referred to as the KinSwing score (KS score).</p>

<title>Determination of the inferred protein kinase activity across time using KinSwing.</title>
<p>(A) Schematic of the process for generating KS scores. The human data contained in PhosphoSitePlus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref033">33</xref>] were used to determine PK substrate motifs for each protein kinase (CaMKIIα shown as an example). The probability of a sequence match, <italic>P</italic><sub>m-s</sub>, between the PK substrate motif and the centred sequence of each detected phosphorylation site was calculated. The magnitude of the significantly regulated phosphorylation sites (<italic>P</italic><sub>mag.</sub> &lt; 0.05) was used to assign positive or negative (+1/−1) swing. An overall swing was determined from the sum of swings for the group of probable PK substrates. The swing was transformed to a z-score (KS score) to allow for comparison across time points (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and methods</xref> for a detailed description). The process was repeated for each condition and time point independently.

<p>KinSwing aims to predict the positive or negative inferred activity for a specific protein kinase. Eighty-seven KS score profiles were clustered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g006">Fig 6B</xref>) after removing protein kinases based on consensus sequences with limited and highly variable scores (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s009">S1 Table</xref>). Clusters are represented as line graphs of averaged KS scores in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g006">Fig 6C</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s011">S1 Data</xref>). It is important to appreciate that protein kinase activity should be considered in light of opposing protein phosphatase activity. Since substrate motifs for protein phosphatases lack specificity relative to protein kinase substrates and protein kinases have a more diverse impact on cellular pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref042">42</xref>], we take a protein kinase–centric view of activity. Also, KinSwing cannot resolve the activities of protein kinases and protein phosphatases at the subcellular level when applied to phosphoproteomics data from whole cells.</p>
<p>KS profiles allowed the identification of the major regulatory protein kinases and their patterns of regulation. CaMKIIα (<italic>CAMK2A</italic>) clustered alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>, cluster vii) and was the only protein kinase predicted to have increased activity after 76 mM KCl stimulation, relative to 20 mM KCl stimulation. Many protein kinases contain regulatory phosphorylation sites, which could be utilized to validate activity inferred by KinSwing. There were 23 and 68 significantly perturbed protein kinase regulatory sites identified from synaptosomes and hippocampal neurons, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s009">S1 Table</xref>, regulatory sites listed). The T286 autoactivation site and the T306 inhibitory site for CaMKIIα were up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, at 10 s in hippocampal neurons but were not detected in synaptosomes using mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s007">S7A Fig</xref>). Western blotting demonstrated that T286 was indeed significantly up-regulated at 10–300 s in synaptosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s007">S7A Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s011">S1 Data</xref>). In support of increased protein kinase activity, the CaMKIIα S275 putative autoactivation site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref043">43</xref>] was significantly up-regulated at all time points in synaptosomes by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s007">S7A Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>CaMKIIα binds the postsynaptic density and to synaptic vesicles. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s007">S7B Fig</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s011">S1 Data</xref>), we compared the regulatory patterns and probabilities of confident CaMKIIα, PKAα, and PKCα substrate motif matches for the pre- and postsynaptic substrates in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g002">Fig 2C</xref>. Disks large-associated protein 4 (<italic>Dlgap4</italic>) and SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains protein 3 (<italic>Shank3</italic>) had the largest up-regulation of those predicted as CaMKIIα substrates by KinSwing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s007">S7B Fig</xref>). Known CaMKIIα substrate glutamate receptor 1 S849 (S831 in mature protein, gene name: <italic>Gria1</italic>) was weakly up-regulated in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s009">S1 Table</xref>) but was above the probability threshold for prediction as a CaMKIIα substrate in the KinSwing analysis. Of the presynaptic proteins in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, RIM1, piccolo, and known substrate synapsin 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s005">S5A, S5D and S5E Fig</xref>) were supported by probability as CaMKIIα substrates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s007">S7B Fig</xref>). Bassoon had many long-lasting up-regulated phosphorylation sites, which can be considered as putative CaMKIIα substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, synaptosome data), but only S2845 and S1126 were supported by probability as CaMKIIα substrates (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Likely, many more substrates exist in nonlinear motifs, defying prediction. In these cases, the pattern of regulation may be useful for predicting kinase substrate relationships. Not all putative CaMKIIα substrates were up-regulated or regulated in the same direction on the same protein, indicating incorrect prediction or site-specific effects of CaMKIIα or opposing protein phosphatase activity that depended on localization or other biological factors. Nevertheless, correlation of protein kinase activity patterns, via KinSwing and regulatory sites, with substrate phosphorylation patterns allowed for the identification of approximately 20 putative CaMKIIα substrates.</p>
<p>Clusters vii, viii, and ix were exclusively made up of CaMK and protein kinase A, G, and C (AGC) family members and were generally up-regulated at 10 s and 300 s after 20 mM KCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>). The PKAα subunit (<italic>PRKACA</italic>) was the most up-regulated at 300 s after 20 mM KCl, but unlike CaMKIIα, its inferred activity was much reduced with increased stimulation strength (76 mM KCl). PKCα (<italic>PRKCA</italic>) in cluster ix underwent the most rapid reversal from positive to negative KS score from 10 s to 90 s after 20 mM KCl. Another pattern was that the PKA, CaMK-like (CaMKL), sterile 20 (STE20), and ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (RSK) classes of protein kinases had positive inferred activity after 20 mM KCl stimulation that was diminished or ablated after 76 mM KCl stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s006">S6B Fig</xref>). The PKC class separated into its own cluster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s006">S6B Fig</xref>) and was not as affected by the stimulation level as PKCα individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). PKCζ (<italic>PRKCZ</italic>) had a stimulation level–independent negative KS score for all poststimulus time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref> cluster v), which most resembled the down-regulated phosphopeptide clusters 3 and 5 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g004">Fig 4A</xref>. Thus, the inferred activity of some subclasses of the CaMK and AGC families were up-regulated at particular times and were dependent on the strength of the stimulus.</p>
<p>The CDK, glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), MAPK, and CLK (CGMC) family members CDK1/2/5, GSK3α/β, and MAPK1/3/8/14 in clusters i and ii (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>) had the most negative KS scores at 10 s, implying rapid deactivation of CMGC kinases and/or dephosphorylation of the putative CGMC substrates. GSK3β S9 up-regulation was detected at 10 s in hippocampal neurons, which inhibits GSK3β [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref044">44</xref>]. Protein kinase Bα (AKT1), which targets GSK3β S9, also had corresponding up-regulated phosphorylation at S129, which induces activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s009">S1 Table</xref>) in agreement with a positive AKT1 KS score at 10 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). However, GSK3β KS scores were negative at all times after 76 mM KCl, and this did not correlate with increased AKT1 KS scores. Higher protein phosphatase activation may have had a greater effect on GSK3β substrates than AKT1-mediated GSK3β inactivation after 76 mM KCl. At 300 s after 20 mM KCl, MAPK1 had the highest inferred activity of cluster ii (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). In contrast, at 300 s after 76 mM KCl stimulation, the positive KS score was ablated, indicating dominance of protein phosphatases in both stimulus and poststimulus periods following 76 mM KCl stimulation. KS profiles implicate cluster ii protein kinases, particularly MAPK1 in the poststimulus up-regulated cluster 4 pattern in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g004">Fig 4A</xref>.</p>
<p>In summary, several patterns of inferred protein kinase activity emerged. CaMKIIα was active under all conditions, aligning with the high-magnitude up-regulated cluster 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g004">Fig 4A</xref>. A subset of CMGC protein kinases, including MAPKs, CDKs, and GSK3α/β, had negative KS scores at 10 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), aligning with the high-magnitude down-regulated pattern of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g004">Fig 4A</xref> cluster 2. Poststimulus activity of MAPKs, PKA, and other protein kinases could contribute to the recovery of cluster 2 substrates or the poststimulus up-regulated pattern of cluster 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g004">Fig 4A</xref>. Many protein kinase contributions were ablated after stronger stimulus. Thus, our newly developed KinSwing analysis identified protein kinases potentially contributing to the patterns of regulated phospho-signalling.</p>
<p>Using our activity-dependent phosphoproteome of hippocampal cultured neurons, we independently calculated KS scores for each protein kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). The response at 10 s after 76 mM KCl stimulation was highly correlated with that of synaptosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g006">Fig 6D, R</xref><sup>2</sup> = 0.81). Casein kinase 2α (CK2α; <italic>CSNK2A1</italic>) was the only protein kinase with substantial deviation between synaptosomes and hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). CK2α inferred activity also deviated greatly between 20 mM and 76 mM stimulations, resulting in a unique cluster (cluster iii, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>). Interpretation of the inferred CK2α activity requires further experiments. Overall, the high correlation supports the concept that the synaptosomes and hippocampal neurons had a similar signalling network.</p>

<title>A potential role for MAPK in poststimulus up-regulated phosphorylation of a network of presynaptic proteins</title>

Thus, we compared the probability of a confident match for cluster 4 substrates to the MAPK1 substrate motif, as a heat map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g008">Fig 8B</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s011">S1 Data</xref>), using the first step of the KinSwing process to generate probabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Alongside, we also compared GSK3β and CDK5, which co-clustered with MAPK1, and PKAα, which was the most up-regulated at 300 s after 20 mM KCl (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g006">6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g008">8B</xref>). Thus, we present the phospho-signalling network for cluster 4 and identify known and potential substrates of MAPK1 and other protein kinases.</p>

<p>Phosphorylation of (the protein expressed from) <italic>Pip5k1c</italic> at S552 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g008">Fig 8B</xref>) promotes its role in the formation of focal adhesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref047">47</xref>]. B-Raf (<italic>Braf</italic>) phosphorylation at S134 is known to be up-regulated in a feedback loop within the MAPK pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref048">48</xref>] and was up-regulated in cluster 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). Phosphorylation of two sites on IRSp53 (<italic>Baiap2</italic>) by a CaMKL family protein kinase Par1b (<italic>Mark2</italic>), itself a cluster 4 member, may negatively regulate cell polarity and spreading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref049">49</xref>]. The calcium-activated potassium channel subunit alpha-1 (<italic>Kcnma1</italic>) was up-regulated from 90 s at S712, which is known to cause reduced probability of channel opening and is expected to be a substrate of PKC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref050">50</xref>]. These phosphorylation sites with known functions in diverse processes can now be put into the context of neuronal activity through determination of their patterns of phospho-signalling.</p>
<p>In contrast to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g007">Fig 7A</xref>, in which all synapsins were prominent, only synapsin 1 had cluster 4 phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). Synapsin 1 domain B sites S62 and S67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g008">Fig 8B</xref>) and S549 in domain D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) are known MAPK substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref028">28</xref>]. MAPK phosphorylation of synapsin 1 limits neurotransmitter release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref018">18</xref>]. Active zone scaffold proteins were major targets within the rapidly responding clusters 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>) and also within the poststimulus up-regulated phosphorylation of cluster 4, having four proteins with at least three represented phosphopeptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). However, a different set of proteins and phosphorylation sites were prominent in cluster 4: liprin-α3 (<italic>Ppfia3</italic>), Munc13-1 (<italic>Unc13a</italic>), and Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase-interacting protein 1 (<italic>Caskin1</italic>). This indicates that a poststimulus phospho-signalling pathway targets the active zone scaffold using a distinct subset of protein components and activity-dependent sites. Phosphorylation of S2845 on bassoon promotes 14-3-3 binding and changes bassoon molecular exchange rates with the proposed effect of dissociation from the cytomatrix at the active zone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref051">51</xref>]. S2845 is an in vitro RSK family substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref051">51</xref>], and the RSK family had a pattern of inferred regulation that was consistent with cluster 4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s006">S6B Fig</xref>). Dynamin 1 was poststimulus up-regulated at S857, a phosphorylation site that is de-enriched at presynaptic terminals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref038">38</xref>]. The up-regulation of dynamin 1 phosphorylation is inhibitory for synaptic vesicle supply [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref017">17</xref>], which could promote a depression of vesicle release. The dynamin 1 phospho-dependent binding partner syndapin 1 (<italic>Pacsin1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref052">52</xref>] was among a group of endosomal proteins that were prominent in cluster 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g008">Fig 8A</xref>) but not cluster 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>). The phosphorylation of Munc18-1 (<italic>Stxbp1</italic>) on Y473 has been shown to inhibit neurotransmitter release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref053">53</xref>] and was one of three Munc18-1 sites with poststimulus up-regulation. Two other cluster 4 proteins were associated with the vesicle fusion machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g008">Fig 8A</xref>, <italic>Syt7</italic> and <italic>Nsf</italic>). Thus, MAPK1 and other protein kinases are implicated as regulators of cluster 4. MAPK1 may be upstream of protein kinases in cluster 4, but this is currently only supported by motif prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). Many substrate sites in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g008">Fig 8B</xref> have not been functionally investigated; however; the known roles of bassoon, dynamin 1, synapsin 1, and Munc18-1 implicate the poststimulus up-regulation of cluster 4 in influencing the synaptic vesicle cycle.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This first study of the temporal dynamics of the presynaptic phosphoproteome has led to a number of new insights and provides a valuable resource for future analyses. Firstly, it is now apparent that activity-dependent poststimulus phospho-signalling is complex and long-lasting and targets distinct protein domains and networks of phosphoproteins across time. Secondly, initial activity-dependent phospho-signalling in synaptosomes closely correlates with signalling in cultured hippocampal neurons, despite the more numerous compartments harvested with the latter. Thirdly, we have identified specific protein kinases that mediate the initial and poststimulus response, which we have analyzed at unprecedented depth. This achievement was facilitated by our development of a new computational method, KinSwing. These insights greatly advance our knowledge about the stimulus-coupled dynamics of phospho-signalling at the nerve terminal.</p>
<p>A key feature of the KinSwing method was to enable a comparison of the inferred protein kinase activity at each time point and condition. The underlying protein phosphatase activity was also indicated. For example, MAPK1 was highly activated by the stimulus, but its substrates were mainly dephosphorylated prior to 300 s. Although KinSwing weights kinase activity by the number of substrates used to build a kinase model, the kinase substrate matching and the extent of representation of the kinome in the output is limited by the availability of protein kinase substrate data. This can be important when considering substrates that are targeted by closely related protein kinases with limited a priori specificity data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref033">33</xref>]. In addition, KinSwing best leverages large-scale experimental data that are rich in repeated patterns of phospho-regulation. However, the value of KinSwing and similar approaches will scale well as the size of public phosphorylation site databases increases. Thus, KinSwing can be applied to any phosphoproteomics study, including any neuronal stimulation paradigm amenable to biochemical analysis, and demonstrates the value of using and developing probabilistic methods for future phosphoproteomics studies.</p>
<p>KinSwing identified CaMKIIα as a protein kinase with a large change in inferred activity across the time course that scaled with stimulation strength and CaMKIIα activity correlated with the profile of high-magnitude up-regulated phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, cluster 1). CaMKIIα activation is known to enhance neurotransmitter release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref054">54</xref>], but very few presynaptic substrates and mechanisms are known. The putative substrates identified here in the active zone scaffold, including bassoon, piccolo, liprin-α3, and RIM1, might participate in phospho-regulated mechanisms that promote vesicle release and presynaptic plasticity.</p>
<p>Calcineurin is the primary candidate for the observed high-magnitude dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, cluster 2), since known substrates associated with synaptic vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref013">13</xref>] were enriched in this phospho-signalling pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is also a candidate, since it can undergo Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref055">55</xref>]. The high-magnitude up-regulation (cluster 1) lasted longer than the high-magnitude dephosphorylation (cluster 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g004">Fig 4A–4C</xref>). This observation fits with the knowledge that calcineurin or PP2A are dependent on elevated calcium, but CaMKIIα becomes autoactivated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref056">56</xref>]. Stronger stimulation increased the magnitude of dephosphorylation for the initially down-regulated patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g004">Fig 4A–4C</xref>, clusters 2 and 4). This resulted in a delayed return to prestimulus levels and a dampened poststimulus up-regulation for the bidirectional pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g004">Fig 4A–4C</xref>, cluster 4). Mechanistically, the former could be achieved by sustained inactivation of protein kinases (cluster 2), such as the inhibition of GSK3β [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref044">44</xref>]. For the latter, initial stronger down-regulation could have dampened up-regulation (cluster 4); however, an alternative mechanism could be the increased activation of protein phosphatases. Phosphatases could have feasibly kept up-regulation low at 900 s after 76 mM KCl while MAPK1 activation was high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) acts downstream of calcineurin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref057">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref058">58</xref>]. PP1 and PP2A account for the vast majority of basal phosphatase activity in presynaptic terminals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref057">57</xref>] and are implicated in the regulation of neurotransmitter release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref059">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref061">61</xref>].</p>
<p>Poststimulus up-regulated phosphorylation (cluster 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g008">Fig 8A</xref>) was associated with the increased activity of MAPK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g006">Fig 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s006">S6A Fig</xref>). KinSwing predicted that PKAα, CaMKL, STE20, and RSK classes of protein kinases also contributed to poststimulus up-regulation. These predictions were supported by evidence from the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref049">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref051">51</xref>]. Substrates of poststimulus up-regulation included synapsin 1, Munc18-1, and distinct components of active zone scaffold proteins. Endocytosis and endosomal proteins were also implicated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). MAPK1/3 activation and targeting of synapsin 1 was found by others to have a negative effect on posttetanic enhancement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref018">18</xref>]. In this context, the poststimulus up-regulation may be a homeostatic plasticity mechanism that dampens the effects of strong stimuli. The up-regulated phosphorylation we identified involves a possible MAPK-signalling pathway that has many more components beyond synapsin 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g008">Fig 8B</xref>).</p>
<p>Activity-dependent phosphorylation in synaptosomes and hippocampal neurons was highly correlated for presynaptic proteins at the common 10-s time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Active zone scaffold proteins and synapsins were more highly targeted than postsynaptic scaffold proteins and neurotransmitter receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). This indicates that the active zone scaffold proteins may be more finely tuned to respond to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, despite vastly greater postsynaptic abundance of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive proteins such as CaMKIIα. We have identified bassoon as the major presynaptic signalling hub and the most targeted protein for activity-dependent phospho-signalling within hippocampal neurons. Piccolo, RIM1, microtubule-regulating MAP1B, and tau, as well as SNAP25-interacting protein, were also identified as candidate signal integrators. Thus, phospho-signalling in synaptosomes and intact neurons was similar, and several presynaptic proteins were identified as potential signal integrators, of which bassoon was most prominent.</p>
<p>Our 10-s stimulation with KCl would have caused a large calcium influx, which likely exceeds that produced by electrophysiological stimulation. Thus, our results likely include some nonphysiological phospho-signalling, necessitating validation of our work with electrophysiological stimulation paradigms. However, the strength and duration of stimulation may be more important from a physiology prospective than the method of depolarization. A 10-s high-frequency (≥40 Hz) electrical stimulation, combined with phospho-specific antibody detection, produced virtually identical phospho-signalling responses for the proteins dynamin 1, Akt/PKB, and GSK3β [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref062">62</xref>]. High-frequency firing rates within the brain are not typical but occur naturally in specific neurons during tasks such as spatial navigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref063">63</xref>]. Obtaining meaningful biochemical measurements at low frequencies will be challenging. In this work, we could have missed regulated phosphorylation sites because of undersampling but also because the change in phosphorylation was too low to measure (despite functional significance). In general, our lower potassium concentration produced robust phospho-signalling, particularly during the poststimulus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s002">S2B and S2C Fig</xref>), indicating that high potassium concentrations can potentially be avoided. Nevertheless, elevated potassium stimulation is highly physiologically relevant to understanding the molecular consequences of traumatic brain injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref064">64</xref>] and in the understanding of homeostatic plasticity mechanisms, since pretreatment with elevated potassium was shown to be neuroprotective in a model of excitotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref065">65</xref>]. Our 10-s stimulation was relatively acute, compared to the previous sustained depolarization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref027">27</xref>], and allowed for the first examination of the poststimulus response. Stimulating synaptosomes at a high and low level increased our ability to discern Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration–dependent patterns of temporal regulation. Future work will require a combination of synaptic vesicle turnover and electrophysiological measurements in neurons to obtain a clearer view of the functional consequences of our stimulations and phosphoproteome dynamics.</p>
<p>The value of information on activity-dependent phosphorylation is in knowing which protein domains and functions are mechanistically linked to neuronal activity, while ruling out phosphorylation that is independent of activity. Our studies revealed that the vast majority of phospho-regulated functions remain unidentified. The lack of association with activity indicates that neuroscience-relevant signalling mechanisms have not yet been a significant focus for research, which might be explained by known biases in research effort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref066">66</xref>]. Here, we have highlighted the activity-dependent phosphorylation site data relevant to presynaptic mechanisms and neurotransmitter release. The sensitivity of presynaptic phospho-signalling, if translated into major functional changes, could have implications for the pharmacological targeting of protein kinase/phosphatase activity within neurons. Other important targets of phospho-signalling that regulate diverse cellular functions are contained within this resource for neuroscientists. Therefore, this resource, and our highly developed analysis approach, will allow others to further decipher the functional significance of synaptosomal and neuronal activity-dependent phosphorylation.</p>

<title>Stimulation of presynaptic terminals for phosphorylation analysis</title>
<p>Prior to stimulation, the synaptosomes were warmed to 37 °C for 5 min. To depolarize the synaptosomes, aliquots of 300 μL of synaptosomes were mixed with an equal volume of solution such that the final KCl concentration was 20 or 76 mM, and the sodium concentration was lowered by a similar amount such that the monovalent salt and osmotic concentration was constant. The depolarization continued for 10 s only before centrifugation at 13,500 rpm in a CM-50 MP (ELMI, Riga, Latvia) benchtop centrifuge. To repolarize the synaptosomes, they were resuspended in Krebs solution and incubated for up to 15 min. Samples were collected after 10 s of mock treatment or depolarization and at 90 s, 300 s, and 900 s in the repolarization solution. Prior to lysis, the synaptosomes were pelleted by centrifugation and the supernatant removed. The synaptosomes were lysed in a 300 μL solution and briefly agitated with a benchtop vortex. The lysis solution consisted of 2% SDS, 25 mM HEPES/Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1 mM ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 1x Roche Complete protease inhibitor cocktail, and 1x Calbiochem Phosphatase inhibitor cocktail II.

<p>The list of identified proteins from the MaxQuant “proteinGroups.txt” output file was used as the background protein list for the “Enrichment analysis” section below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec020">
<title>Processing of MaxQuant output</title>
<p>To map and quantify individual phosphosites, we utilized the MaxQuant “evidence.txt” (ProteomeXchange dataset identifier PXD010007) output file containing all identified PSMs for all further analyses. To remove redundancy due to sequences being present as both Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL entries, instances of PSMs to duplicated protein sequences in UniProtKB were removed using a custom Perl script. Only Swiss-Prot entries were kept where exact sequence duplication was observed (two instances: P03926;Q7HKW2 and P05508;Q7HKW3). Then, to determine the amino acid position of phosphosites relative to the full-length canonical protein sequence, a “mapping file” was created (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s010">S2 Table</xref>), using a custom Perl script. A total of 22,643 unique phosphopeptides were present in the “evidence.txt” file. A total of 11,055 phosphopeptides mapped to a single unique protein accession. Of those phosphopeptides, 10,530 contained more than one protein accession, and 478 mapped to more than one unique gene identifier. Using a custom Perl script, 1,058 were excluded from downstream analyses because they did not contain a localized phosphosite or were contaminant peptides (“CON__”) or those identified in the reverse database by MaxQuant processing for a false-discovery rate of identification (“REV_”). To map the phosphosite positions, we developed a “best” evidence algorithm according to the following rules:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>For phosphopeptides that mapped to multiple UniprotKB protein accessions, the accession with the highest “protein existence (PE)” value was kept as the best evidence (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/protein_existence" xlink:type="simple">http://www.uniprot.org/help/protein_existence</ext-link>). Where the protein accession was an isoform (therefore lacking PE information), the PE value was taken from the parent protein.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>When the PE value was equal, a Swiss-Prot (sp) entry was taken over a TrEMBL (tr) entry.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If both entries were Swiss-Prot, the nonisoform was selected.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If both entries were isoforms, the lowest-numbered isoform was selected.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If the phosphopeptide mapped to multiple unique genes, we determined the “best” annotation for each unique gene (steps 1–5) and recorded this as a multigene-mapped phosphopeptide.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>For each of the annotations and phosphosites, the centred sequence of amino acids mapping to each phosphosite was retrieved from the UniProtKB fasta file (i.e., phosphopeptides containing more than one phosphosite would also have more than one centred sequence). Each phosphopeptide identified was then given an identifier, which was composed of the “BEST_PROTEIN” and “BEST_PHOSPHO_POSITION” (e.g., D4A3S7:15, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s010">S2 Table</xref>) and was the basis for downstream statistical analysis of phosphorylation.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis of phosphoproteomics data</title>
<p>To determine the significance of phosphorylation changes over time, the mapping file (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s010">S2 Table</xref>) and “evidence.txt” (ProteomeXchange dataset identifier PXD010007) were imported into R version 3.4.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) for further analysis. Each entry (phosphopeptide) in the “evidence.txt” file was merged to its corresponding identifier from the mapping file. The MaxQuant normalized intensity for each unique identifier for the 20 and 76 mM KCl 10-s, 90-s, 300-s, and 900-s time point samples was divided by the intensity of the mock-stimulated (4.7 mM KCl 10 s) sample to provide a ratio, which was log<sub>2</sub> transformed. Where merged phosphopeptides did not contain a minimum phosphosite localization probability score of 0.75 in any of the experiments conducted or were not detected in at least three of the six replicates in either the 20 mM or 76 mM KCl conditions, these phosphopeptides were excluded from further analysis. These criteria retained 6,489 phosphopeptides for the 20 mM KCl treatment and 6,215 unique phosphopeptides for the 76 mM KCl treatment. For the combined 20 mM and 76 mM KCl analysis, this was the intersect of phosphopeptides passing these criteria in both 20 mM and 76 mM KCl treatments, a total of 5,715.</p>
<p>For 20 mM and 76 mM KCl data, these data were normalized independently for separate analyses as well as together (the intersection) for comparative analyses. Initial inspection indicated requirement for normalization and correction of nonbiological sources of variation. For downstream normalization and analysis, we followed the statistical preprocessing method we previously implemented for analysis of phosphoproteomics data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref031">31</xref>], and more detail is provided in Waardenberg, 2017 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref032">32</xref>]. Data were first rescaled using quantile normalization, assuming that data were missing at random [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref076">76</xref>], followed by missing value imputation using the k-nearest neighbour approach (k = 10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref077">77</xref>], and data were iteratively reweighted using the surrogate variable analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref078">78</xref>]. Consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref031">31</xref>], this improved separation of biological samples, where the biological variable of interest (time) was clearly clustering together and separating across the first principle components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000170.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>For statistical comparison of 76 mM or 20 mM KCl data, we fit a linear model with Bayes variance shrinkage using limma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref079">79</xref>] and tested for differential phosphorylation at each time point by computing moderated t-statistics (10 s versus control; 90 s versus control; 300 s versus control; 900 s versus control) and the F-statistic for change at any time point and performed pairwise comparisons for each time point. <italic>P</italic> values were corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini and Hochberg method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref080">80</xref>].

Six clusters (k) was determined to be optimal for enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s003">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>). Thus, very small and very large clusters were avoided for enrichment analysis. Clusters 1 and 2, which consisted of the highest magnitude changes, contained 57 and 44 unique UniProt accessions, respectively. Clusters 3, 4, 5, and 6 contained 130, 129, 451, and 368 unique accessions. The entire set of 1,917 unique phosphopeptides contained 865 unique accessions. Each of these sets were imported into DAVID (database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref081">81</xref>] for gene ontology enrichment analysis. The protein content of our P2 synaptosomes was determined by LC-MS/MS analysis in a separate experiment (see section “Preparation of samples, mass spectrometry, and data processing for determination of the P2 synaptosomes proteome used in the enrichment analysis” above). The identified proteins contained 3,866 unique accessions. These accessions were combined with the 865 unique proteins accessions from phosphopeptides identified from synaptosomes and 4,947 unique protein accessions from phosphopeptides identified from hippocampal neurons. The intersection of these sets was a list of 7,588 nonredundant protein accessions, which was used as the background. Gene ontology enrichment was queried for “molecular function”, “biological process”, and “cellular component” using “MF_Direct”, “BP_Direct”, and CC_Direct”, since these sets provide direct annotations for each accession [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref082">82</xref>]. The default threshold <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.1 was used to extract an initial list of enriched terms, which was also required to have at least four accessions, prior to further filtering. For comparison of clusters, the top five most probable enriched terms/domains from each cluster with <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 were arranged into a heat map of probabilities. Columns (clusters) in the heat map were allowed to exceed the initial limit of five terms if they were highly ranked in another cluster, but each row was required to contain a term with at least <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01. The <italic>P</italic> values for each term were hierarchically clustered by row (each term) using Perseus 1.5.8.5.</p>
<p>Phosphorylation site regulation ontology term enrichment was performed as follows. Terms were extracted from the “ON_FUNCTION” and “ON_PROCESS” columns of the “Regulatory_sites.gz” file, downloaded 26 May 2018 from PhosphoSitePlus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref033">33</xref>]. The terms are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s009">S1 Table</xref>. Only terms with at least nine matching phosphorylation sites within the set of 1,917 significantly regulated phosphorylation sites from synaptosomes were considered. There were 83, 82, 201, 191, 797, and 563 unique phosphopeptides for clusters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively. This included possible redundant multisite phosphorylation assignments, which were kept. The number of occurrences for each term per cluster was determined. Fold enrichment was calculated by considering the ratio between foreground and background terms as a 2 × 2 contingency table of (1) the number of terms matched within a cluster, (2) the size of the cluster, (3) the number of term matches for all 1,917 peptides, and (4) 1,917 as the total background. For each term, significance of the fold enrichment was determined by applying a Fisher’s exact test to the 2 × 2 contingency table (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). All clusters with no term matches were assumed nonenriched and given a <italic>P</italic> value of 1.</p>
<p>The centred peptide sequences for each of the six clusters were examined for enriched protein kinase substrate motifs using motif-x [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref040">40</xref>] with the following settings: central character, S; width, 15; occurrences, 20; significance, 0.000001; and background, IPI Rat Proteome.</p>

<p>The raw output was filtered such that each reported z-score, <italic>Z</italic>(<italic>swing</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>), which we name the KS score, required (1) at least 19 experimentally validated protein kinase substrate matches and (2) ≥1 time point with a KS score greater than the corresponding standard deviation for that score (such that the KS score deviated from zero). See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s009">S1 Table</xref> for KS scores and standard deviations for all protein kinases examined across time. KS scores were also calculated for groups of protein kinases that were annotated according to classes, and these results are also in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000170.s009">S1 Table</xref>. The remaining scores were clustered using the Perseus 1.5.8.5 hierarchical clustering function.</p>
<p>During the course of this work, methods with similarities to KinSwing were published, i.e., KARP (kinase activity ranking using phosphoproteomics data) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref084">84</xref>], IKAP (inference of kinase activities from phosphoproteomics) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref085">85</xref>], and iKAP (in silico kinome activity profiling) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref086">86</xref>]. KARP has a fundamentally different output, resulting in a ranking of protein kinases on a strictly positive scale, not inferring overall directionality of activity. Although iKAP is concerned with quantification of directionality of kinase substrates, they utilize a chi-squared test for testing the proportion of positive and negative phosphosite edges within a sample condition, rather than transforming to a statistic, which is valuable for comparison across multiple conditions and time courses, as we have done. IKAP uses an optimization procedure based on precise kinase substrate database matching followed by correlation, which assumes that kinase substrate networks act in a linear manner. Future studies that determine precision based on experimental prediction would further guide the development of these algorithms.</p>

<title>Protein interaction network–cellular component mapping</title>
<p>Network edges were determined by submission of a nonredundant list of gene names for the 1,917 significantly regulated phosphopeptides to STRING [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref087">87</xref>] using <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic> as the organism.

The following <italic>R</italic>. <italic>norvegicus</italic> gene names used by STRING were manually changed to match the gene names used by DAVID and/or UniProt: ENSRNOG00000018712, <italic>Camk2a</italic>; <italic>Dmxl2-ps1</italic>, <italic>Dmxl2</italic>; <italic>LOC687090</italic>, <italic>Tprg1l</italic>; <italic>Sec311</italic>, <italic>Exoc1</italic>. Within Cytoscape, the network was filtered by discarding proteins without specific cellular component annotations. Nodes were required to have the following DAVID “CC_Direct” cellular component annotations, which were grouped into nine categories: (i) cytoskeleton and actin cytoskeleton, (ii) endosome, (iii) microtubule and microtubule organizing centre, (iv) synaptic vesicle, (v) active zone scaffold, (vi) voltage-gated potassium channel, (vii) voltage-gated calcium channel, (viii) soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex, (ix) clathrin-coated pit, and (x) presynaptic membrane and membrane raft. Protein kinases, protein phosphatases, and subunits/regulators of phosphatases were also retained (identified by UniProt gene ontology annotation as of 31 July 2017).</p>
<p>The cellular component data were curated to improve relevance to synaptic biology. The following manual changes were made to cellular component annotation or protein kinase/phosphatase annotation based on UniProt annotations as of 31 July 2017 or references provided: <italic>Syn1</italic> changed from “active zone scaffold” to “synaptic vesicle”, <italic>Syn2</italic> changed from “SNARE complex” to “synaptic vesicle”, <italic>Camk2a</italic> changed from “presynaptic membrane” to “synaptic vesicle”, <italic>Caskin1</italic> annotated with “active zone scaffold” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000170.ref005">5</xref>], <italic>Stxbp1</italic> annotated with “SNARE complex”, <italic>Nefh</italic> annotated with "cytoskeleton", <italic>Sh3gl2</italic> annotated with "synaptic vesicle", <italic>Syt9</italic> annotated with "synaptic vesicle", <italic>Rab12</italic> annotated with “endosome”, <italic>Rab27a</italic> annotated with "synaptic vesicle", <italic>Rab8b</italic> annotated with "synaptic vesicle", <italic>Sgsm1</italic> annotated with "synaptic vesicle", <italic>Ppfia1</italic> annotated with "active zone", <italic>Exoc1</italic> annotated with "synaptic vesicle", <italic>Exoc7</italic> changed from “microtubule” to “synaptic vesicle”, <italic>Dbnl</italic> annotated with "synaptic vesicle", <italic>Slc30a3</italic> annotated with "synaptic vesicle", <italic>C2cd2l</italic> annotated with "presynaptic membrane", <italic>Dnajc6</italic> annotated with "clathrin-coated pit", <italic>Doc2a</italic> annotated with "synaptic vesicle", <italic>Dnm3</italic> changed from “microtubule” to “synaptic vesicle”, <italic>Cadps</italic> annotated with “synaptic vesicle", <italic>Synj1</italic> changed from “microtubule” to synaptic vesicle, <italic>Ap3b2</italic> and <italic>Ap3d1</italic> annotated with “clathrin-coated pit”, <italic>Dlg4</italic> “synaptic vesicle” annotation was deleted, <italic>Sptbn1</italic> annotated with “actin cytoskeleton”, <italic>Sptbn2</italic> annotated with “actin cytoskeleton”, <italic>Sptbn4</italic> annotated with “actin cytoskeleton”, <italic>Dyrk1b</italic> annotated with “protein kinase”, <italic>Itsn1</italic> changed from cytoskeleton to “clathrin-coated pit”, and <italic>Dpysl3</italic>, <italic>Dpysl4</italic>, and <italic>Dpysl5</italic> annotated with “microtubule”. Each of the 11 groups were separately arranged in Cytoscape 3.5.1 using the “grid layout”. Arbitrary adjustments in the layout of each grid were made to improve clarity; thus, no conclusions should be drawn from the distance between nodes. Membrane proteins were arbitrarily arranged in a line. A subset of inositol kinases and phosphatases were moved to the membrane (<italic>Pip5k1c</italic>, <italic>Inpp4a</italic>, and <italic>Pi4k2a</italic>).</p>
<p>The network was made up of a total of 267 nodes and 907 edges. The edges were coloured red if the “experimentally_determined_interaction” value from STRING was ≥0.3. Proteins were represented by gene names. Proteins with three or more responding phosphorylation sites had gene names presented in blue letters. Letter size for each node/gene name was scaled linearly (from an arbitrary minimum value) by using the quantitative phosphopeptide data. For clusters 1 and 2, the absolute value of the largest log<sub>2</sub>(stimulated intensity/control intensity) after either 20 mM or 76 mM KCl stimulation was used to scale the letters. For cluster 4, the largest up-regulation from 10 s to 300 s or from 10 s to 900 s after 20 mM KCl was used to scale the letter size. For clusters 3, 5, and 6, the average poststimulus log<sub>2</sub>(stimulated intensity/control intensity), using all 20 mM and 76 mM KCl values, was used in scaling letters. Networks for specific clusters were filtered to remove proteins that were not significantly phospho-regulated within the cluster.

<title>Investigation of solution exchange step in synaptosome stimulations.</title>
<p>The switch from 20 or 76 mM KCl to 4.7 mM KCl required a centrifugation step and manual exchange of the solution, which was a 35-s (±1 s, standard deviation; <italic>n</italic> = 9) process, using our equipment. If Ca<sup>2+</sup> could continue to enter the pelleted synaptosomes during the exchange process, then our stimulation would be longer than intended. We investigated the potential for KCl to influence pelleted synaptosomes. We used up-regulation of synapsin 1 S603 as a marker of depolarization. We compared standard stimulation with elevated KCl—i.e., 10-s 76 mM KCl stimulation, centrifugation, and manual solution exchange (35 s) to a 45-s stimulation of the supernatant after centrifugation. This latter condition was used to test if elevated KCl could stimulate/depolarize the pelleted synaptosomes. Volumes and ionic strength were consistent throughout (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and methods</xref>). Left: representative western blot of the comparison of 4.7 mM KCl mock treatment and 76 mM KCl depolarizing treatment of suspended synaptosomes alongside a 76 mM KCl treatment of the supernatant of pelleted synaptosomes. Successful depolarization (positive control) was confirmed by western blot with anti-syn1-pS603. Anti-β-actin was used as a loading control. Right: quantification of the western blotting. Bar graph of the average and SEM of three independent experiments (normalized to mock-treated/control sample, one-way analysis of variance and Dunnett’s post hoc test; **<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). Below: schematic of the experimental procedure for each condition in the bar graph. The failure of high-concentration KCl in the supernatant to up-regulate pS603 allowed us to conclude that KCl present during the solution exchange is unlikely to influence phospho-signalling in pelleted synaptosomes. Thus, our 10-s stimulation paradigm was established as an acute stimulation.

<title>The substrates of low-magnitude down-regulated and low-magnitude up-regulated phosphorylation within a network of presynaptic proteins.</title>
<p>A word cloud visualization of (A) cluster 5 low-magnitude down-regulated phosphorylation and (B) cluster 6 low-magnitude up-regulated phosphorylation, from synaptosomes, using gene names anchored to cellular component ontology (subcellular localization). The size of the gene name was scaled to the average poststimulus log<sub>2</sub>(stimulated intensity/control intensity) value after both 20 mM and 76 mM KCl stimulation. Localizations: (i) cytoskeleton and actin cytoskeleton, (ii) endosome, (iii) microtubule and microtubule organizing centre, (iv) synaptic vesicle, (v) active zone scaffold, (vi) voltage-gated potassium channel, (vii) voltage-gated calcium channel, (viii) SNARE complex, (ix) clathrin-coated pit, and (x) presynaptic membrane and membrane raft. (xi) Protein kinases and protein phosphatases, including regulatory subunits, with no specific localization are also shown. Gene names in blue letters have three or more responding phosphorylation sites. Experimentally verified protein interactions (STRING) are shown as red edges, i.e., connecting lines. The data are the result of six independent experiments for each stimulation condition (20 mM and 76 mM KCl). SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor.</p>
