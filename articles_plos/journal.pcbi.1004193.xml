<abstract>
<p>Identifying control strategies for biological networks is paramount for practical applications that involve reprogramming a cell’s fate, such as disease therapeutics and stem cell reprogramming. Here we develop a novel network control framework that integrates the structural and functional information available for intracellular networks to predict control targets. Formulated in a logical dynamic scheme, our approach drives any initial state to the target state with 100% effectiveness and needs to be applied only transiently for the network to reach and stay in the desired state. We illustrate our method’s potential to find intervention targets for cancer treatment and cell differentiation by applying it to a leukemia signaling network and to the network controlling the differentiation of helper T cells. We find that the predicted control targets are effective in a broad dynamic framework. Moreover, several of the predicted interventions are supported by experiments.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Practical applications in modern molecular and systems biology such as the search for new therapeutic targets for diseases and stem cell reprogramming have generated a great interest in controlling the internal dynamics of a cell. Here we present a network control approach that integrates the structural and functional information of the network. We show that stabilizing the expression or activity of a few select components can drive the cell towards a desired fate or away from an undesired fate. We demonstrate our method’s effectiveness by applying it to a type of blood cell cancer and to the differentiation of a type of immune cell. Overall, our approach provides new insights into how to control the dynamics of intracellular networks.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>An important task of modern molecular and systems biology is to achieve an understanding of the dynamics of the network of macromolecular interactions that underlies the functioning of cells. Practical applications such as stem cell reprogramming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref003">3</xref>] and the search for new therapeutic targets for diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref006">6</xref>] have also motivated a great interest in the general task of cell fate reprogramming, i.e., controlling the internal state of a cell so that it is driven from an initial state to a final target state (see references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref013">13</xref>]).</p>
<p>Theoretically derived control methods are based on simplified models of the interactions and/or the dynamics of cellular constituents such as proteins or mRNAs. Some of these models only include information on which cell components (e.g. molecules or proteins) interact among each other, i.e., the structure of the underlying interaction network. Other models, known as dynamic models, include the structure of the interaction network and also an equation for each component, which describes how the state of this component changes in time due to the influence of other cell components (e.g. how the concentration of a molecule changes in time due to the reactions the molecule participates in).</p>
<p>Although the topic of network controllability has a long history in control and systems theory (see, for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref017">17</xref>]), most of this work is not directly applicable to large intracellular networks. There are several reasons for this: (i) combinatorial complexity and the size of the matrices involved makes control theory applicable to small networks only, (ii) linear functions are used for the regulatory functions and it is unclear how the switch-like behavior of many biochemical processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref019">19</xref>] will affect these results, and (iii) the notion of controllability in control theory, i.e. control of the full set of states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref016">16</xref>] or <italic>complete controllability</italic>, is different from that in the biological sense, which commonly encompasses only the <italic>biologically admissible states</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>In recent work on network controllability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref022">22</xref>] some of the limitations of standard control theory approaches are addressed. For example, Akutusu, Cheng, Tamura et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref022">22</xref>] extend the framework of control theory to systems with Boolean (switch-like) dynamics and provide some formal results in this setting. In the work of Liu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref007">7</xref>] the size limitation of linear control theory is overcome by using a maximal matching approach to identify the minimal number of nodes needed to control a variety of real-world large scale networks. Specifically, for some gene regulatory networks, Liu et al. find that control of roughly 80% of the nodes is needed to fully control the dynamics of these networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref007">7</xref>]. In contrast, experimental work in stem cell reprogramming suggests that for biologically admissible states the number of nodes required for control is drastically lower (five or fewer genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref008">8</xref>]). Fiedler, Mochizuki et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref013">13</xref>] use the concept of the feedback vertex set, a subset of nodes in a directed network whose removal leaves the graph without directed cycles (i.e. without feedback loops). They show that, for a broad class of regulatory functions, controlling any feedback vertex set is enough to guide the dynamics of the system to any target trajectory of the uncontrolled network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref013">13</xref>]. As one of their examples, the authors use a signal transduction network with 113 elements and show that the minimal feedback vertex set is composed of only 5 elements.</p>
<p>Since systems whose interaction networks and dynamics are known equally well are rare, current control strategies are based on either the network structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref013">13</xref>] or its dynamics (function) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref022">22</xref>]. Yet, as manipulating the activity of even a single intracellular component is a long, difficult, and expensive experimental task, it is crucial to reduce as much as possible the number of nodes that need to be controlled. We hypothesize that integrating network structure with qualitative information on the regulatory functions or on the target states of interest could yield control strategies with a small number of control targets. Qualitative information about the regulatory functions is commonly known (e.g. positive/negative regulation, cooperativity among regulators, etc.), and relative qualitative information on the desired/undesired states also exists (e.g. upregulation or downregulation of mRNA levels in a disease state with respect to a healthy state). Thus, we choose a logical dynamic framework as our modeling method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref023">23</xref>]. This framework is well suited for modeling intracellular networks: discrete dynamic models have been shown to reproduce the qualitative dynamics of a multitude of cellular systems while requiring only the combinatorial activating or inhibiting nature of the interactions, and not the kinetic details [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>Logical dynamic network models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref038">38</xref>] consist of a set of binary variables {<italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>}, <italic>i</italic> = 1,2,…,<italic>N</italic>, each of which denotes the state of a node (also referred to as node state). The state ON (or 1) commonly refers to above a certain threshold level, while the state OFF (or 0) refers to below the same threshold level. The vector formed by the state of all nodes (<italic>σ</italic><sub>1</sub>,<italic>σ</italic><sub>2</sub>,…,<italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>N</italic></sub>) denotes the state of the system (or system/network state). To each node <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> one assigns a Boolean function <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> which contains the biological information on how node <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>’s inputs influence <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>; these functions are used to evolve in time the state of each element. We use the general asynchronous updating scheme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref036">36</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Methods</xref>), a stochastic scheme which takes into consideration the variety of timescales present in intracellular processes and our incomplete knowledge of the rates of these processes.</p>
<p>In a logical (Boolean) model, every temporal trajectory must eventually reach a set of system states in which it settles down, known as an attractor. The attractors of intracellular networks have been found to be identifiable with different cell fates, cell behaviors, and stable patterns of cell activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref040">40</xref>]. In general, the task of finding Boolean network attractors is limited by combinatorial complexity; the size of the state space grows exponentially with the number of nodes <italic>N</italic>. To address this, we recently proposed an alternative approach to find the attractors of a Boolean network which allowed us to identify the attractors of networks for which a full search of the state space is not feasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref041">41</xref>]. This attractor-finding method is based on identifying certain function-dependent network components, referred to as <italic>stable motifs</italic>, that must stabilize in a fixed state. A stable motif is defined as a set of nodes and their corresponding states which are such that the nodes form a minimal strongly connected component (e.g. a feedback loop) and their states form a partial fixed point of the Boolean model. (A partial fixed point is a subset of nodes and a respective state for each of these nodes such that updating any node in the subset leaves its state unchanged, regardless of the state of the nodes outside the subset.) It is noteworthy that stable motifs are preserved for other updating schemes because of their dynamical property of being partial fixed points. For more details on the attractor-finding method and the identification of the stable motifs see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s001">S1 Text</xref> and ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref041">41</xref>]; for a more formal and mathematical discussion see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s002">S2 Text</xref> section A or Appendix A of ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref041">41</xref>].</p>
<p>Once a network’s stable motifs and their corresponding fixed states are identified, a network reduction technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref044">44</xref>] is used for each stable motif by tracing the downstream effect of the stable motif on the rest of the network (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s001">S1 Text</xref>). Repeating this procedure iteratively for each separate stable motif until no new stable motifs are found yields the attractors of the logical model. Formally, the result is a set of network states called quasi-attractors, which capture steady states exactly and are a compressed representation of complex attractors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref041">41</xref>]. The network control method we propose here builds on the concept of stable motifs and its relation to (quasi-)attractors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref041">41</xref>] and takes it much further by connecting stable motifs with a way to identify targets whose manipulation (upregulation or downregulation) ensures the convergence of the system to an attractor of interest. The use of quasi-attractors in our method does not compromise its general applicability, but it does require that certain networks with special types of complex attractors are treated with care when our method is applied. None of the networks we discuss in this work nor any intracellular network models we are aware of fall in this category; for more details see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s001">S1 Text</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s002">S2 Text</xref>, and ref [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref041">41</xref>].)</p>
<p>As an illustration, consider the logical network shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004193.g001">Fig 1(a)</xref>. This logical network has four stable motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004193.g001">Fig 1(b)</xref>): (i) {A = 1, B = 1}, (ii) {A = 0}, (iii) {E = 1}, and (iv) {C = 1, D = 1, E = 0}. Network reduction for each of these stable motif yields four reduced networks, each of which has its own stable motifs, all of which are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s009">S1 Fig</xref>. For example, the reduced logical network obtained from the first stable motif consists of two nodes (D and E) and has two stable motifs: {E = 1} and {E = 0}. The stable motifs of the remaining three reduced logical networks are, respectively: {E = 1} and {D = 1}; {A = 1, B = 1} and {A = 0}; {A = 1} and {A = 0}. Repeating the same network reduction procedure with each of the new stable motifs leads to either a new reduced network or one of four attractors (𝒜<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>,<italic>i</italic> = 1,…,4). The stable motifs obtained from the original network and from each reduced network, and the attractors they lead to are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004193.g002">Fig 2</xref>. This diagram is a compressed representation of the successive steps of the attractor finding process, which include the original network, the stable motifs of the original network, the reduced networks obtained for each stable motif, the stable motifs of these reduced networks, and so on (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s009">S1 Fig</xref>). We refer to such a diagram as a <italic>stable motif succession diagram</italic>, and we note that it is closely analogous to a cell fate decision diagram. We propose to use this stable motif succession diagram to guide the system to an attractor of interest.</p>

<p>The stable motif succession diagram shows the stable motifs obtained successively during the attractor finding process and the attractors they finally lead to. A more detailed representation of the first steps of the attractor finding method is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s009">S1 Fig</xref>. Nodes are colored based on their respective node states in the motifs or the attractors: gray for 0 and black for 1. The four stable motifs of the original logical network and their matching node states are shown in the leftmost part of the figure. The attractors obtained for each possible sequence of stable motifs are shown in the rightmost part of the figure. The result of applying network reduction using a stable motif is represented by each dashed arrow. If network reduction due to a stable motif leads to a simplified network with at least one stable motif, then the dashed arrows point from the stable motif being considered to the stable motifs of the simplified network. Otherwise, network reduction leads directly to an attractor and the dashed arrow points towards the attractor.</p>

<title>Stable motif control implies network control</title>
<p>The stable motifs’ states are partial fixed points of the logical model, and as such, they act as “points of no return” in the dynamics. Normally, the sequence of stable motifs is chosen autonomously by the system based on the initial conditions and timing. We propose to use our knowledge of the sequence of stable motifs to guide the system to an attractor of interest. We refer to this network control method as <italic>stable motif control</italic>.</p>
<p>The basis of the stable motif control approach is that a sequence of motifs from a stable motif succession diagram like <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004193.g002">Fig 2</xref> uniquely determines an attractor, so controlling each motif in the sequence must prod the system towards this attractor. We give the proof of this statement in Lemma 4 and Proposition 6 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s002">S2 Text</xref> section B. The number of nodes that need to be controlled can be minimized by removing motifs that do not need to be controlled and by finding a subset of nodes in a motif which can fix the whole motif’s state. A step by step description of the stable motif control algorithm is given in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Methods</xref>.

There are two sequences of stable motifs that lead to 𝒜<sub>2</sub>: ({C = 1, D = 1, E = 0}, {A = 1}) and ({A = 1, B = 1}, {E = 0}). For motif {C = 1, D = 1, E = 0} in the first sequence, fixing E = 0 is enough to fix the whole motif’s state; for motif {A = 1} in the same sequence there is only one node, so the only choice is to fix A = 1. The control set obtained from the first sequence is then {E = 0, A = 1}. For the second sequence, a similar reasoning leads to the same control set, {E = 0, A = 1} (E = 0 from {E = 0}, and A = 1 from {A = 1, B = 1}). The result is a single set of network control interventions for attractor 𝒜<sub>2</sub>, <italic>C</italic><sub>𝒜<sub>2</sub></sub> = {{A = 1, E = 0}}. For a step by step description of the stable motif control algorithm applied to this example see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s001">S1 Text</xref>.</p>
<p>Using our approach with each of the remaining attractors we obtain the following network control interventions: <italic>C</italic><sub>𝒜<sub>1</sub></sub> = {{A = 1, E = 1}}, <italic>C</italic><sub>𝒜<sub>2</sub></sub> = {{A = 1, E = 0}}, <italic>C</italic><sub>𝒜<sub>3</sub></sub> = {{A = 0, E = 1}}, and <italic>C</italic><sub>𝒜<sub>4</sub></sub> = {{A = 0, E = 0}}. Inspecting these network control interventions we conclude that controlling nodes A and E is enough to guide the system to each of the four possible attractors, with the exact combination being given by the <italic>C</italic><sub>𝒜<sub><italic>i</italic></sub></sub>’s.</p>
<p>In order to gauge the potential improvement in the control set’s size brought about by our method, we compare our network control set with the feedback vertex set, the subset of nodes whose removal leaves the network without directed cycles. This set was demonstrated to be an effective control target and set an upper limit in the size of the control set in references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref013">13</xref>]. Because removing the feedback vertex set from the network must destroy all cycles, including self-loops, there are two possible minimal feedback vertex sets, {A, B, D, E} and {A, C, D, E}. The number of nodes that need to be controlled in our method is half of the size of the feedback vertex set, a substantial improvement. It should be noted that our method does not guarantee that the resulting control sets are small nor that the control sets are the smallest possible, though our case studies suggest that the resulting control sets tend to be relatively small (between one and five nodes out of more than fifty, see Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004193.t001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004193.t002">2</xref>, and ref [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref045">45</xref>]).</p>

<title>Blocking stable motifs may obstruct specific attractors</title>
<p>In many situations the main interest is to prevent the system from reaching an unwanted state (e.g. the proliferative cell state encountered in tumors). Based on the motif-sequence point of view provided by the stable motif succession diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004193.g002">Fig 2</xref>), we hypothesize that blocking the stable motifs that lead to an attractor will either prevent or make it less likely for the system to reach this attractor. We refer to this network control method as <italic>stable motif blocking</italic>. The algorithm for the method is given in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Methods</xref>.</p>
<p>The interventions obtained from this method are negations of node states of the target attractor, and as such, have the property of eliminating the intended attractor. However, new attractors can arise that are similar to the destroyed attractor. In biological situations (like in our test cases) one commonly has certain molecular markers of cell fate which specify the attractor to a large degree but not at the level of every node. Thus the final state obtained after stable motif blocking may still be consistent with the biological specification of the undesired attractor, making the intervention unsuccessful. We also adopt a stricter definition for a successful intervention: if a long-term but not permanent intervention (i.e. a transient intervention) reduces the number of network states or trajectories that lead to the unwanted attractor, then the intervention is considered to be <italic>long-term successful</italic>. The best-case scenario would be that the manipulated network has only the desired attractors of the original network (i.e., any but the unwanted attractors), in which case the network will stay in these attractors even if the intervention is stopped.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the network in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004193.g001">Fig 1(a)</xref> and the attractor 𝒜<sub>3</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004193.g002">Fig 2</xref>. From the stable motif succession diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004193.g002">Fig 2</xref>), the stable motifs involved in the sequences that lead to 𝒜<sub>3</sub> are {A = 0}, {D = 1}, and {E = 1}. Our approach proposes blocking these motifs to obstruct the system from reaching 𝒜<sub>3</sub>, that is, it provides ℬ<sub>𝒜<sub>3</sub></sub> = {{A = 1}, {E = 0}, {D = 0}} or a combination of these node states as intervention candidates.</p>
<p>To verify the effectiveness of the interventions, we analyze the dynamics of the manipulated network with each individual intervention. The first intervention (A = 1) causes the system to have 𝒜<sub>1</sub> and 𝒜<sub>2</sub> as its only attractors, and thus, the network is driven towards these attractors and away from the unwanted attractor 𝒜<sub>3</sub>. Furthermore, the network stays in those attractors even after the intervention is stopped, as they are also attractors of the original network, so the intervention is long-term successful. Similarly, the second intervention (E = 0) causes the system to have 𝒜<sub>2</sub> and 𝒜<sub>4</sub> as its sole attractors, so it is also a long-term successful intervention. The third intervention (D = 0) only leaves attractor 𝒜<sub>1</sub> intact, and also gives rise to two new attractors. To evaluate if this intervention is long-term successful we compare the probabilities that an arbitrary initial condition ends in 𝒜<sub>3</sub> with and without the intervention. For the intervened case, we set D = 0 for a long time, then stop the intervention and wait for the network to reach an attractor. We find that the intervention makes it more likely for an arbitrary initial condition to reach 𝒜<sub>3</sub>, so this intervention is not long-term successful.</p>

<title>Verification of the method’s effectiveness in test cases</title>
<p>The network control framework we propose is applicable to any cell fate reprogramming process for which a logical dynamical model can be constructed. This is a broad and increasing domain of application: refs. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref028">28</xref>] are examples of recent logical models that had experimentally validated predictions, while other examples can be found in the review articles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>To demonstrate the potential of our framework, we choose two types of cell fate reprogramming processes: disease therapeutics and cell differentiation. More specifically, we use our network control framework to predict network control interventions on previously developed logical dynamic models for a leukemia signaling network and for the network controlling the differentiation of helper T cells. We confirm the effectiveness of the predicted stable motif control interventions using dynamic simulations, an independent verification of the result we prove in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s002">S2 Text</xref>. For the case of stable motif blocking interventions, whose effectiveness is not guaranteed, we use dynamic simulations to test the effectiveness of the predicted interventions.</p>

<title>T cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia network</title>
<p>Cytotoxic T cells are a central part of the immune system’s response to infection. These T cells detect antigens in infected cells and, in response, induce the self-destruction of the infected cells. After fighting infection normal cytotoxic T cells undergo activation-induced cell death (apoptosis), but in T-cell large granular lymphocyte (T-LGL) leukemia cytotoxic T cells avoid cell death and survive, which eventually leads to diseases such as autoimmune disorders.</p>
<p>A Boolean network model of cytotoxic T cell signaling that reproduces the known experimental results of these T cells in the context of T-LGL leukemia was previously constructed by Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref028">28</xref>]. This network model consists of 60 nodes and 142 regulatory edges, with the nodes representing genes, proteins, receptors, small molecules, external signals (e.g. Stimuli), or biological functions (e.g. Apoptosis). The T-LGL network is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004193.g003">Fig 3</xref> and its logical functions are reproduced in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s004">S4 Text</xref>.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref046">46</xref>] has shown that in the sustained presence of the external signals IL15, PDGF, and Stimuli (antigen presentation) the system has two attractors: one that recapitulates the survival phenotype and node deregulations seen in T-LGL leukemia, and a second one that corresponds to self-programmed cell death (apoptosis) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s004">S4 Text</xref> for more details about attractor specification).</p>

<p>The succession diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004193.g004">Fig 4</xref> suggests a simple picture for the cell fate determination process: the activation of any of the three S1P-related motifs is enough to drive the system to either apoptosis (either the teal or the green stable motif in Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004193.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004193.g004">4</xref>) or T-LGL leukemia (the red stable motif in Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004193.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004193.g004">4</xref>). This result agrees with previous studies of T-LGL leukemia, in which it was found that blocking S1P signaling induced apoptosis in leukemic T-LGL cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref047">47</xref>], a result reproduced by the network model when the state of S1P was set to OFF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref046">46</xref>].</p>
<p>Next, we use the stable motif diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004193.g004">Fig 4</xref> and our two control strategies to find intervention targets for the T-LGL leukemia network. The obtained intervention targets for each control strategy are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004193.t001">Table 1</xref>. Note that some intervention targets may be present in both control strategies (e.g. {S1P = OFF} is a target both for apoptosis control and T-LGL attractor blocking). For the case of stable motif blocking one may have the same intervention for blocking two different attractors (e.g. {TBET = OFF}), which means that this intervention could block either attractor.</p>
<p>To validate an intervention target, we compare the probabilities that an arbitrary initial condition ends in the target attractor with and without the intervention (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Methods</xref>). The results of the intervention target validation are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s014">S1 Table</xref>. For all the stable motif control interventions we obtain 100% effectiveness in reaching the desired state, both for the case in which the intervention is permanent and for the case in which it is not. This means that all stable motif control interventions are <italic>long-term successful</italic>, in agreement with our formal results in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s002">S2 Text</xref>. For example, when fixing S1P = OFF the apoptosis attractor is reached for all the initial conditions, indicating that the T-LGL attractor is unreachable. For the case of the stable motif blocking interventions we find that each of them but one (GRB2 = OFF) is successful in blocking its target attractor or one of its target attractors, though not always with 100% effectiveness. For example, for TBET = OFF the apoptosis attractor is reached from 10% of the initial conditions, which is a substantial reduction from the baseline of 62% in the case of no intervention, indicating that this interventions is effective as an apoptosis blocking strategy. We also find that most of the stable motif blocking interventions are effective when the intervention is permanent, but only a few of them are effective when the intervention is temporary.</p>
<p>Single interventions are the most commonly used therapeutic strategies for treating diseases. Thus, we evaluate the success of each single intervention from control sets with more than one node (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s014">S1 Table</xref>). We find that one of the 12 single node interventions, Ceramide = ON, is 100% effective and long-term successful. Of the remaining 11 single node interventions only a few are successful (Ceramide = OFF, SPHK1 = ON, and PDGFR = ON) and/or long-term successful (SPHK1 = ON and PDGFR = ON) but none of them are 100% effective. This result illustrates the benefit of combinatorial interventions over single interventions.</p>

<title>Helper T cell differentiation network</title>
<p>Helper T cells are crucial in the regulation of the immune response in mammals. These T cells release specific cytokines that alter how the immune system responds to external agents, for example, by recruiting specific immune system cells to fight infection, promoting antibody production, or inhibiting the activation and proliferation of other cells. Various subtypes of helper T cells are known, such as Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg, which are distinguished by a differential expression of specific transcription factors and cytokines.</p>
<p>A logical network model of the regulatory and signaling pathways controlling helper T cell activation and differentiation was constructed by Naldi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref048">48</xref>]. This network model has several attractors, which correspond to the known canonical helper T cell subtypes, and also to some hybrid cell types (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref048">48</xref>] and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s005">S5 Text</xref>). The reachability of each attractor depends on the presence of several external environmental signals (either cytokines or antigen), which are represented as input nodes in the network. For our study we use one of the environmental conditions studied by Naldi et al. (TGFB_e = ON, IL2_e = ON, and APC = ON) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref048">48</xref>] because it allows us to explore control targets for all T cell subtypes. The helper T cell differentiation network under the selected environmental conditions consists of 55 nodes and 121 edges and is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004193.g005">Fig 5</xref>. Its corresponding logical functions are reproduced in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s005">S5 Text</xref>.</p>

An arrowhead or a short perpendicular bar at the end of an edge indicates activation or inhibition, respectively.

<p>We obtain 17 stable motifs, each of which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004193.g005">Fig 5</xref> with a different node/edge color, and a stable motif succession diagram composed of 697 sequences. Despite the large size of the succession diagram, a closer look at it gives a simple interpretation: the stable motifs associated with each attractor regulate the characteristic transcription factor of each helper T cell subtype. To check this, we look at the minimal subsets of stable motifs that are sufficient for a sequence to lead to a single differentiated helper T cell subtype (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004193.g006">Fig 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s005">S5 Text</xref>). We use the stable motif succession diagram and our stable motif control and stable motif blocking strategies to find intervention targets for each helper T cell subtype (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004193.t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>To validate the proposed intervention targets we use the same procedure as in the T-LGL leukemia network case (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Methods</xref>). We also look at the effect of single node interventions for control sets with more than one node. The results of the intervention targets for the stable motif control, stable motif blocking strategies, and single node interventions are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s015">S2 Table</xref>. We find that (i) there is a 100% effectiveness in reaching the desired state for all the stable motif control interventions, (ii) most of the stable motif blocking interventions are successful in blocking their target attractor or one of their target attractors, though not always with 100% effectiveness, and (iii) some single interventions are successful, but none of them are 100% effective.</p>

<title>The control targets transcend the logical modeling framework</title>
<p>The network control approach we propose is formulated in a Boolean framework, which brings up the question of whether the control targets identified are dependent on the logical modeling scheme. To address this, we translate the studied Boolean network models into ordinary differential equation (ODE) models using the method described by Wittmann et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref049">49</xref>]. In the ODE models the node state variables <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004193.e001"><mml:math id="M1" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi> <mml:mo>˜</mml:mo></mml:mover> <mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> can take values in the range [0, 1]; the differential equations of the translated model have the form <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004193.e002"><mml:math id="M2" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mo>˜</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo>˜</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mo>˜</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo>…</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mo>˜</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mo>˜</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004193.e003"><mml:math id="M3" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>f</mml:mi> <mml:mo>˜</mml:mo></mml:mover> <mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is a smooth Hill-type function parameterized by Hill coefficients and threshold parameters, and <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is a time-scale parameter.

Thus, the fixed point attractors of the Boolean model are preserved in the ODE model.</p>
<p>We test the effectiveness of the stable motif control interventions in the translated ODE models by comparing the probability for an uniformly chosen initial condition to reach the target attractor with and without the intervention (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s006">S6 Text</xref>). We find that the stable motif control interventions are still 100% effective or very close for both permanent and transient interventions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s016">S3 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s017">S4 Table</xref>). We also find that the effectiveness of the interventions is mostly unchanged by varying the Hill coefficients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s018">S5 Table</xref>), varying the the time-scale parameters <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and thresholds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s019">S6 Table</xref>), or fixing the intervened node variables close to but not exactly at the intervention-prescribed values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s020">S7 Table</xref>). We finally test single interventions and find that they still underperform combinatorial interventions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s016">S3 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s017">S4 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>To further validate the successful control targets we identified, we searched the literature for experimental support for these targets. We find that several of the single interventions predicted to be successful in inducing apoptosis of leukemic T cells or in inducing specific T cell types were found to be successful experimentally. The control targets for which experimental support was found, the attractors they lead to, and the references are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004193.t003">Table 3</xref>. Collectively, these results strongly suggest that the control targets identified by our approach transcend the logical framework.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Identifying control targets for intracellular networks is of crucial importance for practical applications such as disease treatment and stem cell reprogramming. Despite recent advances in network controllability approaches, most of them rely solely on the topology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref013">13</xref>] or the dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref022">22</xref>] of the network. Thus, potentially important effects that depend on the interplay between structure (topology) and function (dynamics), such as combinatorial interactions, are not considered. In this work we proposed a network control approach that combines the structural and functional information of a discrete (logical) dynamic network model to identify control targets. The method builds on the concept of stable motif and its relation to finding attractors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref041">41</xref>], and takes it much further by connecting stable motifs with a way to identify targets whose manipulation (upregulation or downregulation) ensures the convergence of the system to an attractor of interest. We illustrated our method’s potential to find intervention targets for cancer treatment and cell differentiation by applying it to network models of T-LGL leukemia and helper T cell differentiation.</p>
<p>The control interventions identified by our method have many desirable characteristics. For example, stable motif control interventions are guaranteed to drive an initial state to the target attractor state with 100% effectiveness, regardless of the initial state, a general result which we prove in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s002">S2 Text</xref> and corroborate in our test cases (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s014">S1 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s015">S2 Table</xref>). They are also long-term successful, meaning that the intervention only needs to be applied transiently for the network to reach and stay in the desired state, a general result which we also verify in our test cases (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s014">S1 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s015">S2 Table</xref>). We attribute these properties to the use of the natural (autonomous) dynamics of the network to control its dynamics.</p>
<p>Another noteworthy characteristic of our stable motif control method is the combinatorial nature of the multi-target interventions. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s014">S1 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004193.s015">S2 Table</xref>, only one single-node intervention (namely, Ceramide = ON in the T-LGL leukemia network) was able to match the 100% effectiveness of the multi-target interventions. This agrees with recent clinical studies on the advantages of combinatorial over single target interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref050">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref052">52</xref>]. Finally, the stable motif control interventions for our case studies target only a few nodes (between one and five out of more than fifty), which matches what is expected from stem cell reprogramming experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>The framework presented in this work is formulated and applied in the context of logical network modeling of cell fate reprogramming processes but its applicability is not restricted to it. Indeed, our control approach is applicable to any dynamic process that can be captured qualitatively by a Boolean dynamic network model such as ecological community dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref053">53</xref>], social dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref054">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref055">55</xref>], or disease spreading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref056">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004193.ref057">57</xref>]. The validity of the control targets on the translated ODE models of our two case studies and the experimental support found for several of these targets demonstrates the broader, potentially model-independent reach of our method. Further work is needed to address exactly how to extend the concept of stable motif and our network control approach to continuous models; formalizing our framework to admit an arbitrary number of discrete states and other updating schemes may prove a valuable step in this direction.</p>
<p>Taken together, our results provide a novel framework for the control of the dynamics of intracellular networks that combines realistically obtainable structural and functional information of the network of interest. As such, we expect this framework to be significant to a variety of practical applications and to also provide a new avenue to better understand how the complex behaviors of cells in living organisms emerges from the underlying network of biochemical interactions.</p>

<title>Intervention target validation</title>
<p>To validate an intervention target, we fix the node states prescribed by the intervention, choose a random (uniformly chosen) initial condition, and evolve the system using the general asynchronous updating scheme for a sufficiently large number of time steps so that the system reaches an attractor. We find that, for our test cases, temporal evolution for 10,000 time steps ensures reaching an attractor from any initial condition considered with stable motif control intervention or without an intervention; to be safe, we choose to evolve for 50,000 time steps in all cases. We repeat this for a large number of initial conditions (100,000) and calculate the probability of reaching each attractor from an arbitrary (uniformly chosen) initial condition. We also look at the probability of reaching each attractor when the intervention is not permanent (i.e. it is transient), that is, we fix the prescribed node states for a large number of time steps, then stop fixing these states and wait for another large number of time steps for the system to reach an attractor. For our test cases, we find that using 10,000 time steps for each evolution stage (with and then without prescribed node states) is enough to preserve the first three digits of the estimated probabilities <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>Attr</italic></sub> of reaching the attractor of interest, consistent with what is expected from the standard deviation of the estimated probability <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>Attr</italic></sub>. To be safe, we choose to evolve for 50,000 time steps for each evolution stage.</p>
<p>The number of initial conditions we use is chosen to give three significant figures in the estimated probabilities <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>Attr</italic></sub>. For our test cases, we find that 100,000 initial conditions are enough to estimate the probabilities <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>Attr</italic></sub> of reaching the attractor of interest with an error (standard deviation of the estimated probability <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>Attr</italic></sub>) of 3⋅10<sup>−3</sup>[<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>Attr</italic></sub>(1−<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>Attr</italic></sub>)]<sup>1/2</sup>. Equivalently, if <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>Attr</italic></sub> is expressed as a percentage (which we denote as %<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>Attr</italic></sub> for clarity), the error in it is estimated as 3⋅10<sup>−3</sup>[%<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>Attr</italic></sub>(100%−%<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>Attr</italic></sub>)]<sup>1/2</sup>% (e.g. 0.03% for a %<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>Attr</italic></sub> of 1%, and 0.15% for a %<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>Attr</italic></sub> of 50%). The number of time steps we use is enough to show no changes in <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>Attr</italic></sub> beyond what is expected from the standard deviation of the estimated probability <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>Attr</italic></sub>, and is also found to be enough for the initial conditions to reach the attractors when no interventions are applied.</p>
