<abstract>
<p>Mendelian disorders are often caused by mutations in genes that are not lethal but induce functional distortions leading to diseases. Here we study the extent of gene duplicates that might compensate genes causing monogenic diseases. We provide evidence for pervasive functional redundancy of human monogenic disease genes (MDs) by duplicates by manifesting 1) genes involved in human genetic disorders are enriched in duplicates and 2) duplicated disease genes tend to have higher functional similarities with their closest paralogs in contrast to duplicated non-disease genes of similar age. We propose that functional compensation by duplication of genes masks the phenotypic effects of deleterious mutations and reduces the probability of purging the defective genes from the human population; this functional compensation could be further enhanced by higher purification selection between disease genes and their duplicates as well as their orthologous counterpart compared to non-disease genes. However, due to the intrinsic expression stochasticity among individuals, the deleterious mutations could still be present as genetic diseases in some subpopulations where the duplicate copies are expressed at low abundances. Consequently the defective genes are linked to genetic disorders while they continue propagating within the population. Our results provide insight into the molecular basis underlying the spreading of duplicated disease genes.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Duplicated genes, as opposed to singletons, are genes that have additional copies in a genome due to evolutionary mechanisms such as whole genome duplication, homologous recombination or retrotransposition events. Duplicates can have similar functions and thus mask the phenotypic consequences when one copy is mutated. Conversely, the corresponding phenotypes would manifest themselves when mutations occur in singletons, since functional compensation is rare among non-duplicated genes. It would thus be expected that the primary source of monogenic diseases, diseases caused by mutations within a single gene, is singletons. However, the opposite was found to be true. Additionally, we found the functional similarity of duplicated disease genes to be greater than that of duplicated non-disease genes of an equivalent duplication age. So how could the stronger functional compensation among duplicates increase their likelihood to associate with diseases? We propose that due to functional compensation in duplicates, disease-causing mutations are less likely to be removed from a human population in large scale since the phenotypes are masked; however, the functional compensation could be lost in a subpopulation, perhaps due to intrinsic variation in gene expression, and therefore lead to diseases. As a result, the duplicated disease genes are linked to genetic diseases, yet they continue to spread within the human population.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Elucidating the molecular basis of human genetic disorders is one of the most important tasks in medical biology. The availability of the human genome sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Lander1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Venter1">[2]</xref> has facilitated the identification of individual disease genes, e.g. in family pedigree analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Bamshad1">[3]</xref> as well as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Rosenberg1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Ott1">[5]</xref>.

<p>However, recent studies have revealed some controversial findings related to duplicated genes and no clear explanation has been given so far. For example, the accepted hypothesis was that disease genes tend to be singletons with fewer paralogs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Forslund1">[15]</xref> since duplication can lead to functional redundancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Dean1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Hsiao1">[18]</xref> and thereby mask the effect of deleterious mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Forslund1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Wagner1">[19]</xref>; however, disease genes were found surprisingly enriched in duplicates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Dickerson1">[8]</xref>. Moreover, the molecular mechanism by which the duplication statuses of disease genes contribute to their increased presence in the human genome is still unclear. Recently, it has been proposed that the presence of duplicates permits the accumulation of disease-causing mutations, the emergence of disease genes thus would be more likely to associate with duplicates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Dickerson1">[8]</xref>. Here we argue that this line of reasoning does not necessarily predict the enrichment of disease genes in duplicates even when the compensational capacity between duplicates is considered. For example, in duplicates (i.e. more recent ones) whose functional redundancy is resilient enough to mask some disease-causing mutations in one of the copies, the proportion of disease genes would be lower compared with that of overall singletons; however, for duplicates (i.e. older ones) whose compensation capacity is partial or no longer effective, they would be purged from the human genome at the same rate as singletons; combined together, the overall proportion of disease genes in duplicates would still be lower. Summarizing recent literature, we realized that the duplication-functional redundancy theory alone is perhaps insufficient in explaining the observed enrichment of disease genes in duplicates, and the contribution of additional factors should be explored and taken into consideration.</p>
<p>In this work, we sought to provide a clear illustration on the evolutionary forces governing the propagation of disease genes in the human population by surveying exhaustively the characteristics of disease genes and comparing those with non-disease genes. We focused on monogenic disease genes (MDs) that have a clear association with and contribution to human genetic disorders, and tried to address the following questions. First, can the enrichment of disease genes in duplicates first revealed by Dickerson et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Dickerson1">[8]</xref> be reproduced in an updated dataset and what are the contributions of multiple paralogs in multi-gene families? Second, if disease genes indeed tend to have functional backups, is this supported by evidence showing a higher functional similarity between paralogs of disease genes than paralogs of non-disease genes? A key factor being, if the functional divergence of disease genes is greater than that of non-disease genes, a lower or comparable proportion of disease genes in duplicates would be expected, mimicking a behavior that of singletons. Due to the divergence of the functional redundancy of duplicated genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Gu1">[20]</xref> stratification of the genes according to their duplication age was necessary, otherwise resulting in false conclusions as shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Chen1">[21]</xref>. Third, what are the evolutionary factors acting on human disease genes within and/or across species that could contribute further to the functional compensation of duplicated disease genes? And finally, what are the molecular mechanisms underlying the spreading of disease genes as duplicates or singletons in the human population? In other words, how could the functional redundancy between duplicates actually increase their likelihood of being disease genes?</p>

<title>Disease genes are enriched in duplicated genes</title>
<p>Initially, we investigated the duplications of human disease genes. Here, we considered three widely used approaches to detect duplicated genes in the human genome, including those based on simple homology (FASTA), gene family evolution (TreeFam) and orthology (eggNOG v3) (see Methods) which resulted in similar conclusions for all methods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003073.s001">Figures S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003073.s002">S2</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003073-g001">Figure 1</xref>, we found that 55% monogenic disease genes (MDs) were duplicates, a significantly higher fraction than in non-disease genes (NDs; <italic>p</italic> = 2×10<sup>−8</sup>; Fisher's Exact Test); similarly, we found 23% of the duplicates are also MDs, compared to 18% in singletons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003073-g001">Figure 1B</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003073.s009">Dataset S1</xref>). Since duplicates are often found to be functionally compensating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Dean1">[16]</xref>, our results suggest disease genes are enriched in functional backups. Strikingly, we found that the number of paralogs in the same gene family did not have a significant impact on gene disease status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003073-g001">Figures 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003073.s001">S1B and S2B</xref>), suggesting non-additive functional compensation from multiple gene family members.</p>

<title>Functional redundancy in duplicated disease genes</title>
<p>We next sought to find additional evidence for functional redundancy in duplicated disease genes by comparing with duplicated non-disease genes. Since the functional redundancy between duplicates decreases over time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Gu1">[20]</xref>, it is essential to compare duplicates of a similar age. We therefore first divided duplication pairs (gene-closest paralog) into distinct groups according to their duplication age, and then divided them into disease gene containing pairs, if at least one gene in a pair is disease-related (MD-pairs), and non-disease gene containing pairs otherwise (ND-pairs) (see Methods).</p>
<sec id="s2b1">
<title>Evidence from unbiased datasets</title>
<p>We first of all analyzed the differential expression patterns and sequence divergences between duplicated genes, which are widely believed to be important indicators of functional similarities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Hanada1">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>Using gene expression profiles in 36 human normal tissues obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Ge1">[23]</xref>, we found that the co-expressions between MDs and their closest paralogs are in general higher than that of non-disease genes of similar duplication age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003073-g002">Figure 2A</xref>; duplication age delineated by the total branch length from the node representing where the duplication event happened on the species tree to the leaf node of human; see Methods); this is also true when ages are omitted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003073-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Additionally, we found the co-expressions tend to decrease with increasing duplication age, consistent with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Gu1">[20]</xref>. The same results can be obtained using the expression data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Roth1">[24]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003073.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
<fig id="pcbi-1003073-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003073.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption>
<title>Evidence for functional redundancy in duplicated disease genes.</title>
<p>Comparing with duplicated non-disease genes (ND) of similar duplication age (represented by branch length, see Methods), monogenic disease genes (MD) tend have A) higher co-expression co-efficient (p-value = 1.69×10<sup>−3</sup>, Hypergeometric Distribution test), C) higher sequence similarity (p-value = 1.66×10<sup>−3</sup>, Hypergeometric Distribution test). Results in A) can be repeated using another set of gene expression data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003073.s003">Figure S3</xref>). P-values shown in the boxplots (B and D) were calculated using two-sample Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for more details regarding the statistical tests. Numbers shown next the boxplots are the numbers of valid samples (after removing samples with missing values).</p>
</caption><graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003073.g002" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>Similarly, we found that the protein sequence identities of MD-pairs are higher than that of ND-pairs of similar age. Similar to the co-expression results, the sequence identity in general correlates negatively with the divergent time, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003073-g002">Figure 2C</xref>. Thus in both datasets we obtained consistent results indicating higher functional similarities between monogenic disease genes and their closest paralogs than for ND paralog pairs. Since all genes in the two datasets are either present (e.g. protein sequences) or have an equal possibility to be present (e.g. gene expression data from microarrays), we considered the two datasets unbiased.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b2">
<title>Additional evidence from biased/incomplete datasets</title>
<p>We then compared the characteristics between MD- with ND-pairs using two additional datasets, namely Gene Ontology (GO) and human physical protein-protein interactions (PPIs). GO annotations are known to be biased towards highly expressed and more conserved genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Hao1">[25]</xref>; the same would also apply to the PPI data. Additionally, current GO annotation and human PPI network only cover limited numbers of genes; consequently, only ∼37% duplication pairs were annotated by GO, and ∼36% by PPIs. We thus considered the two datasets biased.</p>
<p>We obtained GO annotations for human gene products from Ensembl Biomart and used the Bioconductor package GOSemSim <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Yu1">[26]</xref> to measure semantic similarities between GO terms associated with duplicate genes (see Methods). In light of recent discussions on possible biases in GO and wrong interpretations of the results due to the biases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Nehrt1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Thomas1">[28]</xref>, we tested whether disease and non-disease genes were equally represented in the GO annotations. We found MD genes were significantly better annotated by GO and associated with more GO terms (<italic>p</italic> = 2.36×10<sup>−32</sup>, Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003073.s004">Figure S4</xref>); the GOSemSim value measured on a pair of duplicated genes is inversely correlated with the maximum number of GO terms of individual genes associated with in a pair (Pearson's correlation: <italic>p</italic> = 1.12×10<sup>−35</sup>, R = −0.27). We therefore adopted a normalized version of GOSemSim as an approximation for functional redundancy. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003073-g003">Figure 3</xref>, we found disease genes tend to have similar functions with their closest paralogs compared with that of non-disease genes of similar age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003073-g003">Figure 3A</xref>); the same results could be obtained when age was omitted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003073-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

<title>Evidence for pervasive functional redundancy in duplicated disease genes based on Gene Ontology annotations.</title>
<p>Compared with duplicated non-disease genes (ND) of similar duplication age (represented by branch length, see Methods), monogenic disease genes (MD) tend to have A) higher functional similarity according to Gene Ontology annotations with their most recent duplications (MRDs; p-value = 7.77×10<sup>−5</sup>, Hypergeometric Distribution test); B) the same are also true when duplication ages are omitted (Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test).</p>
</caption><graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003073.g003" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>Similarly, by calculating the percentage of shared PPI partners between duplicates, we found disease genes also tend to have higher functional similarity with their duplicates than non-disease genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003073.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Thus all the datasets generated consistent results, thereby providing extensive evidence for the pervasive functional redundancy by duplicates for human monogenic disease genes.</p>
</sec></sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Higher purifying selections on duplicated disease genes</title>
<p>Previous studies suggested that disease genes were under purifying selections compared with non-disease genes, by measuring the numbers of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site (dN) between human-mouse orthologs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Cai1">[11]</xref>. We confirmed these observations in our dataset using one-to-one orthologs between human and mouse, as well as those between human and macaque; the results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003073-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>, respectively. Furthermore, we found the selective constraints on disease duplicates are higher than on disease singletons (genes that do not have homologs in the human genome), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003073-g004">Figure 4C and 4D</xref>.</p>
<fig id="pcbi-1003073-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003073.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption>
<title>Higher purifying selections on duplicated disease genes.</title>
<p>Compared with non-disease genes (NDs), disease genes tend to have lower dN values with their mouse- (A) and Macaca- (B) one-to-one orthologs. Furthermore, compared with disease singletons (singlet genes or singletons refer to those that do not share significant protein sequence similarities with other human genes), duplicated disease genes tend to have lower dN values with their mouse- (C) and Macaca- (D) orthologs. The higher selective constraints on duplicated disease genes can be also seen within the human genome; for example, compared with duplicated non-disease genes (ND) of similar duplication age, disease genes tend to have lower dN values with their closest paralogs within human (E; p-value = 4×10<sup>−7</sup>, Hypergeometric Distribution test). However the same isn't true when age is omitted (F), highlighting the importance of dividing gene pairs according to their duplication age. P-values shown in the boxplots (A∼D and F) were calculated using two-sample Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test. A similar plot showing no outliers is also available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003073.s006">Figure S6</xref>.</p>

<p>The higher purifying selection on duplicated disease genes can also be observed within the human genome; as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003073-g004">Figure 4E</xref>, we found that MD- pairs always have lower dN values than ND-pairs of similar age.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In summary, we have made two interesting observations regarding disease genes in duplicates. First, we have shown that human monogenic disease genes tend to frequently have functionally redundant paralogs, by comparing their characteristics to that of non-disease genes, stratifying both categories according to duplication age. Second, duplicates tend to harbor more disease genes than singletons, confirming the observation by an earlier study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Dickerson1">[8]</xref>, but contradicting theoretical expectations.</p>
<p>What are possible explanations for these observations? A possible scenario is that a disease gene and its duplicate are simultaneously required for certain functions; for example, they might be involved in the same protein complex. In this case, the two genes would be highly co-expressed and evolve similarly. However this is unlikely because the so-called “balance hypothesis” – both underexpression and overexpression of protein complex subunits would lower fitness of the host organism – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Papp1">[29]</xref> predicts that 1) duplicates are rarely involved in protein complexes and 2) the two duplicates from a common ancestor are rarely retained by the same complex unless all other members of the complex are also duplicated and the extra copies are also retained; otherwise the protein complex is imbalanced and evolutionarily deleterious <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Papp1">[29]</xref>. We found that the first held true in MDs as well as NDs in human using a protein complex dataset from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Ruepp1">[30]</xref>, and comparing them with non-disease genes. Disease genes and their closest paralogs are significantly less likely to be involved in the same complexes (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0002, Odds Ratio = 0.57; Fisher's Exact Test). These results are consistent with a previous study in which only one gene out of a pair of duplicates was found to be associated with diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Dickerson1">[8]</xref>. A previous study suggested that duplicates associated with whole genome duplications (WGDs) are dosage balanced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Makino1">[31]</xref> and thus might not abide by the balance hypothesis. However, we found that pairs of WGD duplicates do not have a high likelihood to be in the same complexes compared with pairs of duplicates associated with small scale duplicates (SSDs) (<italic>p</italic> = 0.22, Fisher's Exact Test); similar results could be obtained (<italic>p</italic> = 0.63; Fisher's Exact Test) using protein complex data from a genome-wide experimental survey on soluble proteins in human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Havugimana1">[32]</xref>. Thus, WGD is not a confounding factor for our observation.</p>
<p>So how could functional redundancy actually promote the enrichment of disease genes in duplicates? Here we propose a new model. We argue that functional compensation by duplication of genes would help mask the phenotypic effects of deleterious mutations, as previously suggested, and reduce the probability of purging the defect genes from the human population. The functional compensation could be further enhanced by the higher purifying selection on duplicated disease genes within and between species. However, due to the intrinsic expression stochasticity among individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Elowitz1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Burga1">[34]</xref>, the deleterious mutations could present as genetic diseases in subpopulations where the duplicate copies express in low abundances. In other words, the corresponding genes would manifest as disease genes, while the mutant allele would remain in the population instead of being removed. This model is illustrated in more details in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003073-g005">Figure 5</xref>. Consequently, duplicates would be enriched in disease genes; the enrichment is weak, albeit significant, due to the complexity of gene regulation in the human genome.</p>

<title>A model for the effect of functional compensation on the propagation of duplicated disease genes in the human population.</title>
<p>This model is based on two previous experimental studies. The first showed that genes with identical promoters could have very different expression abundances in individual <italic>E. coli</italic> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Elowitz1">[33]</xref>. The second showed different <italic>C. elegans</italic> individuals carrying the defect gene could demonstrate varying phenotypes ranging from wild type to stalled development on embryogenesis, depending on the expression abundance of a duplicate gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Burga1">[34]</xref>. We therefore propose that in cases where a duplicate (A1_human) exists (panel A), the functional impairment caused by mutations on a disease gene (A2_human) could be compensated; however due to intrinsic expression stochasticity of the duplicate copy, some individuals would appear to be normal while some others show reduced fitness (panel B). Consequently this gene A2 is linked to genetic disorders while the deleterious mutations it carries continue to spread instead of being removed in the human population. On the other hand, if a disease gene (B_human; panel C) is a singlet without any paralogs, its mutations then would be more likely to be purged from the population (panel D) since compensation by non-duplicates via genetic interactions is relatively rare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Dean1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Li1">[17]</xref>.</p>

In each of the sources disease genes were divided into two categories, MDs – those associated with monogenic diseases, and PDs – those associated with polygenic diseases. We assigned genes associated with both types of diseases into the MD group; please note that changing this definition, for example by assigning this type of genes into the PD group did not change our main conclusions (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003073.s009">Dataset S1</xref>).</p>
<p>All other genes that are not included in any of the three sources are considered non-disease genes (NDs).</p>

<title>Duplicated genes</title>
<p>We used three approaches to find duplicated genes in the human genome, including methods based simple homology search (FASTA), gene family evolution (TreeFam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Ruan1">[39]</xref>) and orthology (eggNOG3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Powell1">[40]</xref> using euNOG).</p>
<p>Using the homology-based method, if two human genes had a bitscore higher than 80 in a FASTA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Pearson1">[41]</xref> search at protein level, and the aligned region covers at least 50% of the shorter protein, they are considered as duplicates; please consult ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Chen1">[21]</xref> for more information about the chosen cutoffs. Changing the cutoffs, for example by increasing the required proportion of the aligned regions for homology detection did not affect our results; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003073.s001">Figure S1</xref> for more details.</p>
<p>In the latter two methods, if a gene family or an orthologous group contains two or more human genes, these genes are duplicates. The numbers of duplicated genes identified by the three methods are 14,014, 14,084 and 11,853, respectively.</p>

<title>Dating duplication events on species tree</title>
<p>We downloaded all gene families as well as their corresponding phylogenetic trees from TreeFam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003073-Ruan1">[39]</xref> ver8.0. We excluded gene families that do not contain human genes, or contain genes from less than four different species, resulting in a set of 9,643 gene families.</p>
<p>For each pair of duplicates in a gene family, we dated the (putative) duplication event by comparing the topology of the corresponding gene tree with that of a species tree. To compare with the TreeFam gene trees, we used a species tree downloaded from Ensembl (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/compara" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/compara</ext-link>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003073.s008">Figure S8</xref>).</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003073.s007">Figure S7</xref>, to date a duplication event of a pair of duplicated genes (A2 and A3 in this case; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003073.s007">Figure S7A</xref>), we first located their last common ancestor (LCA) on the gene tree, and collected all the genes that are descendent to this LCA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003073.s007">Figure S7A</xref>; in this case A_rat, A_mouse, A2_human and A3_human) and their corresponding species (in this case human, mouse and rat); then we mapped these species on to the species tree (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003073.s007">Figure S7B</xref>) and located the corresponding LCA; the age (divergent time) of the duplication event was then defined as the total branch length from this LCA to human on the species tree.</p>

<title>Statistical tests</title>
<p>In this study we applied three statistical tests to different types of datasets. 1) Fisher's Exact Test. We used it to test whether monogenic disease genes (MDs) are more likely to be duplicates compared with non-disease genes (NDs). Since genes can be divided into four groups according to two kinds of classifications (association with diseases and being duplicates), it is suitable to use Fisher's test. 2) Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test. We used this test to compare two sets of numerical values (for example two sets of dN values for MD and ND genes respectively) and access whether one tends to have higher values than the other; in this study it was often associated with boxplots. 3) Hypergeometric Distribution Test. To test whether duplicated MD genes tend to have higher functional redundancy with their most recent duplicates than that of ND genes of similar age, each of the two groups would be further divided into more than 10 age groups. We found in all cases, the majority of the MD groups had higher (or lower) mean values than the ND groups of the same age (for example <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003073-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). To check whether such observations were significantly different from random expectation, we applied the Hypergeometric Distribution Test using the following function in R: phyper(q, m, n, k), where m refers the number of cases where the mean values of the MD groups are higher (or lower) in the pool, n refers the number of cases where the mean values of the MD groups are lower (or higher) in the pool, k refers the number of cases randomly chosen from the pool of m + n, and q refers to the number of cases out of k where the mean values of the MD groups are higher (or lower). In this study we set m = n = k = the number of valid age groups. All tests were performed using R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>).</p>
