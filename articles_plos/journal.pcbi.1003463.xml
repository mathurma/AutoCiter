<abstract>
<p>Borders are important as they demarcate developing tissue into distinct functional units. A key challenge is the discovery of mechanisms that can convert morphogen gradients into tissue borders. While mechanisms that produce ultrasensitive cellular responses provide a solution, how extracellular morphogens drive such mechanisms remains poorly understood. Here, we show how Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) and Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) pathways interact to generate ultrasensitivity and borders in the dorsal telencephalon. BMP and FGF signaling manipulations in explants produced border defects suggestive of cross inhibition within single cells, which was confirmed in dissociated cultures. Using mathematical modeling, we designed experiments that ruled out alternative cross inhibition mechanisms and identified a cross-inhibitory positive feedback (CIPF) mechanism, or “toggle switch”, which acts upstream of transcriptional targets in dorsal telencephalic cells. CIPF explained several cellular phenomena important for border formation such as threshold tuning, ultrasensitivity, and hysteresis. CIPF explicitly links graded morphogen signaling in the telencephalon to switch-like cellular responses and has the ability to form multiple borders and scale pattern to size. These benefits may apply to other developmental systems.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>During development, morphogen gradients play a crucial role in transforming a uniform field of cells into regions with distinct cell identities (marked by the expression of specific genes). Finding mechanisms that convert morphogen gradients into sharp borders of gene expression, however, remains a challenge. Cellular ultrasensitivity mechanisms that convert a linear stimulus into an on-off target response offer a good solution for making such borders. In this paper, we show how a cross-inhibitory positive feedback or toggle switch mechanism driven by two extracellular morphogens – BMP and FGF - produces ultrasensitivity in forebrain cells. Experiments with cells and explanted brain tissue reveal that BMPs and FGFs cross inhibit each other's signaling pathway. Such cross inhibition could occur through four possible mechanisms. By an iterative combination of modeling and experiment, we show the toggle switch to be the mechanism underlying cross inhibition, the ultrasensitive expression of multiple genes, and hysteresis in forebrain cells. As the toggle switch explicitly links extracellular morphogens to cellular ultrasensitivity, it provides a mechanism for making multiple sharp borders that can also scale with tissue size – an important issue in pattern formation. This might explain the abundance of BMP-FGF cross inhibition during development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The formation of borders between compartments and body parts is crucial for embryonic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Lawrence1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Irvine1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Lander1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Lander2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Ashe1">[5]</xref>. A challenge in understanding border formation is the elucidation of mechanisms that convert shallow morphogen gradients into sharp expression domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Lander1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Rogers1">[6]</xref>. Such mechanisms fall into two categories: those that involve cell-cell cooperation, such as cell sorting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Irvine1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Ashe1">[5]</xref>, and those that do not and are therefore cell-intrinsic. Cell-intrinsic border-forming mechanisms amplify small fold-changes in extracellular morphogen concentration into large fold-changes in target gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Melen1">[7]</xref>. Such ‘switch-like’ behavior, also known as ultrasensitivity, enables cells embedded in a morphogen gradient to convert slight differences in morphogen concentration into sharp gene expression domains.</p>
<p>Extensive studies in many systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Rogers1">[6]</xref>, including the mammalian spinal cord <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Balaskas1">[8]</xref> and syncytial fly blastoderm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Rogers1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Manu1">[9]</xref>, show that ultrasensitivity and border formation can result from complex interactions between a morphogen and its downstream transcription factor network, or within a transcriptional network alone. While such morphogen-transcription networks have been explored, the interactions between extracellular morphogens as a basis for ultrasensitivity has not been described, even though such interactions are common in development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Laslo1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>One system patterned by interacting morphogens is the dorsal telencephalon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Monuki1">[11]</xref>, in which cell-intrinsic ultrasensitivity was proposed to mediate border formation between the telencephalic dorsal midline (DM) and cerebral cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Hu1">[12]</xref>. The DM - located between the cerebral cortices – develops from the roof plate and adjacent tissues to form the choroid plaque, choroid plexus epithelium (CPE), and cortical hem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Currle1">[13]</xref> along the mediolateral axis. These tissues produce BMPs - including BMP4 - at high levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Furuta1">[14]</xref> to form an activity gradient of BMP signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Hu1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Cheng1">[15]</xref>, with BMP-dependent genes <italic>Msx1</italic> and <italic>Ttr</italic> being expressed in the CPE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Cheng1">[15]</xref>, where BMP activity is highest. <italic>Msx1</italic> is a high-threshold BMP target gene in many patterning systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Ramos1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Cornell1">[17]</xref>, including the dorsal telencephalon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Hu1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Currle1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Furuta1">[14]</xref>, while <italic>Ttr</italic> is induced specifically in the CPE at the onset of its definitive differentiation (∼embryonic day 11, or E11, in mice) and is stably expressed thereafter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Stauder1">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although <italic>Msx1</italic> is restricted to the midline, BMP4 can induce <italic>Msx1</italic> expression in dissociated cortical precursor cells (CPCs) in an ultrasensitive fashion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Hu1">[12]</xref>. Both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, <italic>Msx1</italic> ultrasensitivity contrasts with graded changes in nuclear phospho-Smad1, 5, or 8 (pSmad) levels (a direct readout of BMP signaling intensity), within the same cells. This implies that <italic>Msx1</italic> ultrasensitivity occurs downstream of pSmad activation. The mechanism underlying this ultrasensitivity, however, remains unknown.</p>
<p>Dorsal telencephalic cells responsive to BMP also respond to other morphogens, such as FGFs (most notably FGF8) produced in the adjacent rostral midline (RM) and cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Monuki1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Shimogori1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Dono1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Yaylaoglu1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-FukuchiShimogori1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Cholfin1">[23]</xref>. FGF8 in the RM functions as a graded morphogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Toyoda1">[24]</xref>, and in the chick dorsal forebrain negatively regulates BMP target genes by inhibiting dorsal BMP4 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Ohkubo1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Crossley1">[26]</xref>. In other systems, FGFs inhibit BMP signaling through MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of Smads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Sapkota1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Fuentealba1">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>We investigated the influence of FGFs on DM BMP target genes, and found that ultrasensitivity requires cell-intrinsic interactions between the BMP and FGF pathways. Using explants and dissociated cell cultures, we showed that the BMP and FGF pathways mutually inhibit at the single cell level; Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) acts similarly to FGF. Next, we used modeling to identify experiments that distinguish among different models of cross-inhibition. These experiments identified a cross-inhibitory positive feedback (CIPF) mechanism, or “toggle-switch”, between the BMP and FGF signaling pathways as the basis for ultrasensitivity. We further show how this mechanism is capable of generating multiple sharp borders simultaneously, among other potential advantages.</p>

<title>Exogenous BMP4 upregulates <italic>Ttr</italic> and <italic>Msx1</italic> in midline and cortical cells, respectively</title>
<p>To experimentally study <italic>Ttr</italic> and <italic>Msx1</italic> regulation in the dorsal telencephalon, we used two previously-characterized <italic>in vitro</italic> systems: a dorsal forebrain explant system and dissociated cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Hu1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Cheng1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Monuki2">[29]</xref>. First, we treated dorsal forebrain explants with BMP4. E9.5 explants cultured with BMP4 exhibited marked expansion of <italic>Ttr</italic> expression towards the RM (n = 19/23 compared to 0/12 BSA-treated controls; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g001">Figure 1A,C</xref>). The <italic>Ttr</italic> induction was restricted to the midline, with no expression seen laterally in the cortex. Sections revealed <italic>Ttr</italic> induction in cells lining the ventricular surface (1–2 cell diameters deep), with the <italic>Ttr</italic>-expressing cells often bending inward towards the ventricle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s001">Figure S1C</xref>); these features are characteristic of endogenous CPE. Correspondingly, RT-qPCR analysis revealed that CPE and DM marker gene <italic>Lmx1a</italic> was also upregulated rostrally in BMP4-treated explants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s001">Figure S1B</xref>).

<p>Interestingly, in response to exogenous BMP4, <italic>Msx1</italic> was ectopically induced in the cortex (n = 5/5 compared to 0/4 BSA-treated explants; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g001">Figure 1B,D</xref>), but not rostrally in the RM. Thus <italic>Msx1'</italic>s ectopic induction to exogenous BMP4 differs from <italic>Ttr'</italic>s response, which ectopically expands rostrally towards the RM, but not laterally into the cortex.</p>
<p>To determine whether these BMP4-mediated responses are cell-intrinsic, we applied BMP4 to dissociated midline cells and CPCs. Midline cultures included cells from dorsal and rostral regions, as both regions were clearly competent for <italic>Ttr</italic> induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g001">Figure 1A,C</xref>). Both <italic>Ttr</italic> in midline cells and <italic>Msx1</italic> in CPCs were positively regulated by exogenous BMP4 in a concentration-dependent fashion. In midline cultures, (mRNA) <italic>Ttr</italic> levels peaked at a BMP4 concentration of 16 ng/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). In CPCs, (mRNA) <italic>Msx1</italic> levels increased monotonically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g001">Figure 1F</xref>), as reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Hu1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Cheng1">[15]</xref>. These findings indicate that the <italic>Ttr</italic> and <italic>Msx1</italic> responses to BMP4 are cell-intrinsic.</p>

<title>FGF receptor inhibition mimics the effects of exogenous BMP4</title>
<p>The rostral expansion of <italic>Ttr</italic> in BMP4-treated explants suggests that a suppressor of <italic>Ttr</italic> expression exists in the rostral midline. FGFs produced in the RM, particularly FGF8, are candidates for mediating this suppression, as FGF8 has been shown to negatively influence the BMP pathway in the dorsal telencephalon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Ohkubo1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Crossley1">[26]</xref>. To test this idea, we treated explants with 100 nM PD173074, a pan-FGF receptor (FGFR) inhibitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Mohammadi1">[30]</xref> (IC<sub>50</sub> = 21.5 nM, K<sub>d</sub> = 45.2 nM). These explants displayed rostral <italic>Ttr</italic> expansion reminiscent of that seen in BMP4-treated explants (n = 4/6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g001">Figure 1I</xref>); no such changes were seen in control DMSO-treated explants (n = 0/4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). Additionally, placing FGF8-soaked beads adjacent to the endogenous CPE resulted in consistent <italic>Ttr</italic> suppression (n = 8/12 compared to 0/12 BSA-soaked controls; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s001">Figure S1D</xref>). These results suggest that FGF8, and possibly other rostral FGFs, normally suppress CPE fate and <italic>Ttr</italic> expression. In addition, the similarity between BMP4- and PD173074-induced <italic>Ttr</italic> responses suggests that individual midline cells can respond identically to either increased BMP or reduced FGF signaling. Restricted <italic>Ttr</italic> induction towards the RM also supports a biphasic model for rostral FGF functions in DM development – i.e. rostral FGFs first provide competency for DM fates, then inhibit them <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Monuki1">[11]</xref> – as seen for FGFs in the chick midbrain DM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Monuki1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Alexandre1">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>We then examined <italic>Msx1</italic> expression in PD173074-treated explants. Ectopic <italic>Msx1</italic> induction was less extensive with PD173074 than with BMP4, but like BMP4, PD173074 treatment led to ectopic <italic>Msx1</italic> induction in the cortex but not the midline (n = 7/8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g001">Figure 1H,J</xref>). In addition, ectopic <italic>Msx1</italic> expression in cortical regions overlapped with PD173074- and BMP4-treated explants (arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g001">Figure 1D and J</xref>). These findings reveal an FGFR-mediated suppression of <italic>Msx1</italic> in the cortex, possibly mediated by FGFs expressed by cortical cells, such as FGF2 and FGF1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Dono1">[20]</xref>. They also indicate that cortical cells can respond similarly to either increased BMP or reduced FGF signaling.</p>
<p>To test if FGFR signaling regulates BMP target gene responses at the single cell level, we treated dissociated midline cells or CPCs with PD173074. We found that FGFR inhibition upregulated (mRNA) <italic>Ttr</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g001">Figure 1K</xref>) in midline cells and <italic>Msx1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g001">Figure 1L</xref>) in CPCs. This indicated that FGFR signaling, presumably activated by FGFs produced by the cultured cells themselves, inhibits the BMP target genes. Next, we tested whether exogenous FGFs inhibit BMP target genes in dissociated midline cells and CPCs. Given the explant results, FGF8 was used in midline cultures, while CPCs were treated with FGF2. Increasing FGF8 led to decreasing <italic>Ttr</italic> expression in midline cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g001">Figure 1M</xref>). Similarly, FGF2 resulted in concentration-dependent <italic>Msx1</italic> decreases in CPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g001">Figure 1N</xref>). Thus, FGF-mediated inhibition of BMP target genes is intrinsic to both midline and cortical cells.</p>
<p>To examine FGF-mediated inhibition at the single cell level, we performed immunocytochemistry on CPCs using an anti-MSX1/2 antibody, as done previously to demonstrate ultrasensitivity at the single CPC level in response to BMP4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Hu1">[12]</xref>. <italic>Msx1/2</italic> expression in E12.5 CPCs was examined under three conditions: 1) at low BMP4 concentrations (1.5 ng/ml) with and without FGF2 (10 ng/ml), 2) at mid-level BMP4 concentrations (16 ng/ml) with and without FGF2, and 3) at mid-level BMP4 concentrations and FGF2 with and without PD173074 (100 nM). As expected, <italic>Msx1/2</italic> positivity and expression levels in CPCs were higher at 16 ng/ml than at 1.5 ng/ml BMP4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s007">Figure S7A</xref>). FGF2 addition led to markedly decreased <italic>Msx1/2</italic> expression at both BMP4 concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g002">Figures 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s007">S7A</xref>), while PD173074 coapplication rescued <italic>Msx1/2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g002">Figures 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s007">S7B</xref>), with increased expression levels (right-shift) in MSX1/2-positive cells and fewer MSX1/2-negative cells in the presence of PD173074 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g002">Figures 2H</xref>, S7B). Thus, FGF-mediated suppression of BMP target responses in CPCs at the population level, as determined by RT-qPCR, also occurs at the level of individual CPCs.</p>

<title>BMP signaling downregulates FGF target responses</title>
<p>We next investigated whether BMP4 can inhibit FGF responses.

When BMP4 was administered, (mRNA) <italic>Spry1</italic> levels were downregulated in a dose-dependent fashion in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g002">Figure 2B,E</xref>). Thus, BMP4 can downregulate an FGF target gene in dissociated midline and cortical cells. We also treated CPCs with the BMP receptor inhibitor LDN193189 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Yu1">[33]</xref> (IC<sub>50</sub> = 5 nM). The treatment resulted in dose-dependent decreases in (mRNA) <italic>Msx1</italic> levels, while (mRNA) <italic>Spry1</italic> levels increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s001">Figure S1F</xref>). These results with LDN193189 - the converse of those obtained with BMP4 – provide further support that BMP signaling inhibits the FGF target gene <italic>Spry1</italic>.</p>
<p>As an additional test for BMP4 inhibition of the FGF pathway, we examined how BMP4 affected FGF-stimulated cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Borello1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Mason1">[35]</xref>. FGF2 is a known mitogen for CPCs in culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Dono1">[20]</xref>. We found that FGF8 also acted as a concentration-dependent mitogen for dissociated midline cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s001">Figure S1E</xref>). When BMP4 was coapplied with FGF2 or FGF8, FGF-induced proliferation decreased in a dose-dependent fashion in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g002">Figure 2C,F</xref>). Thus, BMP4 inhibits FGF-driven proliferation as well as <italic>Spry1</italic> expression.

<title>Models of BMP-FGF cross inhibition</title>
<p>How might such BMP-FGF cross inhibition occur? One possibility is that FGF directly inhibits <italic>Ttr</italic> and <italic>Msx1</italic> and BMP4 directly inhibits <italic>Spry1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). Inhibition could also occur upstream at the level of signaling pathway components or other genes that themselves regulate target responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). Such upstream inhibition might lead to feedforward and feedback loops (e.g. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s002">Figure S2B</xref>) and complicated response dynamics. To investigate the behaviors of such systems, we turned to mathematical modeling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s008">Text S1</xref> for rationale and details). In our single cell models, signaling pathways are represented by extracellular morphogens (FGF and BMP), intermediate signals (FGF and BMP intermediates, or F<sub>I</sub> and B<sub>I</sub>), and target responses (F<sub>T</sub> and B<sub>T</sub>). Inhibitory links between the pathways were then introduced, resulting in 81 possible configurations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Models were reduced to ordinary differential equations, with interactions represented by Hill functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Gardner1">[36]</xref>, then grouped by similarity in their steady-state behaviors and topology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s003">Figure S3</xref>, Numerical Methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s008">Text S1</xref> sections 2 and 3).</p>
<p>This grouping resulted in four classes of models described by generalized equations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003463-t001">Table 1</xref>): two non-feedback classes, with FGF-to-BMP inhibition occurring at or upstream of B<sub>T</sub>, one feedforward, and one feedback. We refer to these classes as: 1) simple target inhibition (STI), 2) simple upstream inhibition (SUI), 3) coherent feedforward (CFF), and 4) cross-inhibitory positive feedback (CIPF). Representative models that captured the basic response dynamics of each class are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g003">Figure 3A</xref> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003463.e006">equations 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003463.e009">4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s008">Text S1</xref> for modeling rationale). For simplicity, and because our work focuses on BMP targets (B<sub>T</sub>), interaction and nodes that have no influence on B<sub>T</sub> (e.g. F<sub>T</sub>) are omitted from these depictions. Later, we will argue that the particular selections of inhibitory connections in the representative models are likely to be well justified (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>).</p>

Each point represents the relative change upon FGF addition for a specific parameter set, and each graph represents 2000 simulations, or 500 per context. (Top row) Maximum levels are maintained with CFF (contexts 3 and 4) and CIPF (all contexts). STI and SUI generally lead to reduced maximum levels. (Second row) Except for STI, EC<sub>50</sub> values generally increase across models and contexts. (Third row) Only CFF and CIPF increase nH upon FGF addition. Except for a few parameter sets, CIPF consistently increases nH, even under all linear conditions. (<bold>C</bold>) Representative BMP dose-response simulations with and without FGF (solid and dashed lines, respectively) for context 1 (inhibitory strength 88%, nH = 1) and context 3 (inhibitory strength 65%, nH = 4). Upon FGF addition, CFF (context 3 only) and CIPF lead to B<sub>T</sub> suppression at low BMP concentrations, while B<sub>T</sub> maximum levels are maintained at high BMP concentrations. This leads to increased EC<sub>50</sub> values and the emergence of ultrasensitivity. (<bold>D</bold>) BMP dose-response simulations (inhibitory strength 76%, nH = 4) with different initial conditions (B<sub>T</sub> starts ‘off’ in blue or ‘on’ in red).

<p>Both CFF and CIPF are known motifs. CFF can provide for a “sign-sensitive delay” that protects outputs against transient activation spikes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Mangan1">[37]</xref>. CIPF, first identified by Monod as the theory of double bluff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Monod1">[38]</xref>, is also known as mutual negative feedback <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Saka1">[39]</xref>, double negative feedback <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Johnston1">[40]</xref>, or the “toggle switch” motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Gardner1">[36]</xref>. It operates during cell fate specification in many developmental systems (e.g <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Laslo1">[10]</xref>). In these systems, CIPF serves to compare two inputs, ultimately turning on targets for the stronger one while turning off those for the weaker input. Depending on the relative strengths of the inputs, CIPF can therefore toggle between two mutually-exclusive sets of target genes.</p>

<title>The BMP-FGF cross inhibition models generate distinct responses</title>
<p>One way to compare the different models is to examine the dose-response relationships between BMP and its targets (B<sub>T</sub>) in the presence or absence of a fixed amount of FGF. Under these circumstances, three features of the B<sub>T</sub> response are potentially informative: maximal levels, EC<sub>50</sub> values, and sensitivity. The sensitivity could be either linear (hyperbolic) or ultrasensitive (sigmoidal) to varying degrees, as quantified by its apparent Hill coefficient, or nH. Changes in these response features were evaluated over a wide range of parameter space and across different “contexts” in which different links within the models were made nonlinear to different degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g003">Figures 3B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s004">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s008">Text S1</xref> sections 3 and 4, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for curve fitting).</p>
<p>While CIPF and STI produced consistent response changes across contexts, CFF and SUI produced more context dependent response changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g003">Figures 3B,C,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s004">S4B</xref>). Notably, only CFF and CIPF created or enhanced ultrasensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g003">Figure 3B,C,E</xref>). CIPF always increased ultrasensitivity even with all links linear and more so with non-linear inhibitory links (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g003">Figures 3B,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s004">S4B</xref>). With CFF and CIPF parameters that increased ultrasensitivity, FGF decreased B<sub>T</sub> levels at low BMP concentrations and had negligible effects on B<sub>T</sub> at high BMP concentrations. Such selective B<sub>T</sub> suppression at low BMP concentrations invariably resulted in more sigmoidal dose-response curves with higher EC<sub>50</sub> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g003">Figures 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s004">S4E</xref>).

<title>Presence of hysteresis implicates CIPF</title>
<p>To further distinguish among models, we tested for a property of positive feedback systems known as hysteresis, a form of cellular memory or bistability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Angeli1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Lisman1">[44]</xref>.

<p>The STI, SUI, and CFF models, unlike CIPF, yielded steady state solutions for B<sub>T</sub> that were amenable to analysis. When tested mathematically, STI, SUI, and CFF always produced identical on- and off-curves for B<sub>T</sub>. However, CIPF - which was examined with simulations and monotone stability analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Angeli1">[43]</xref> - produced different on- and off-curves under certain conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g003">Figures 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s004">S4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s005">S5</xref>). Thus, amongst the four cross inhibition models, only CIPF is capable of generating hysteresis. It is possible to produce bistable responses with other motifs, such as auto-regulatory feedback, but these are unlikely in this system (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s004">Figure S4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s008">Text S1</xref> sections 5 and 6 for discussion on feedback and other models).</p>
<p>Further analysis showed that hysteresis occurs only if at least one of the CIPF loop links was nonlinear, and both links were roughly matched in strength (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s005">Figure S5B</xref>–D, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s008">Text S1</xref> section 5). This requirement for a “balanced” CIPF loop can be explained by considering cases in which F<sub>I</sub> or B<sub>I</sub> is far stronger than the other. When F<sub>I</sub> dominates, CIPF reduces to SUI, whereas when B<sub>I</sub> is too strong, CIPF reduces to the BMP core pathway; and neither SUI nor the BMP core pathway alone can generate hysteresis. A balanced CIPF loop was also required to produce ultrasensitivity, and the magnitudes of increased sensitivity and hysteresis (i.e. size of the hysteresis ‘window’) correlated strongly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s005">Figure S5C</xref>–E). Thus, a balanced nonlinear CIPF loop is required for hysteresis and increased ultrasensitivity.</p>
<p>To test for hysteresis, CPCs were cultured for two hours with high BMP4 (64 ng/ml) to induce the <italic>Msx1</italic> ‘on’ state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Hu1">[12]</xref>, or with BSA to maintain CPCs in the <italic>Msx1</italic> ‘off’ state. After washing out the BMP4 or BSA thoroughly, media alone (no BMP4) or BMP4 at different concentrations (4–64 ng/ml) was reapplied before harvesting CPCs two days later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). In CPCs exposed to BSA, then low BMP4, <italic>Msx1</italic> expression remained low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, blue line). However, in CPCs exposed to high BMP4, then no or low BMP4 after washout, (mRNA) <italic>Msx1</italic> levels remained high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, red line), as previously observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Hu1">[12]</xref>. Since <italic>Msx1</italic> did not turn off after BMP4 removal, <italic>Msx1</italic> appeared irreversible rather than hysteretic. However, another explanation was persistent BMP signaling after washout. Persistent signaling was possible, since slow dissociation of BMP and other TGF-beta molecules from their receptors can lead to prolonged signaling even after free extracellular ligand is removed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Jullien1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Natsume1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Dyson1">[47]</xref>.</p>
<p>To address the possibility of persistent signaling, we modified the above experiment in two ways. First, we cultured the cells for a longer period after washout before harvesting (four days; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). In CPCs treated with high BMP4, then no or low BMP4 after washout (0–4 ng/ml), (mRNA) <italic>Msx1</italic> did indeed return to low baseline levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g004">Figure 4F</xref>, red line). Thus, <italic>Msx1</italic> induction was not irreversible. When comparing the CPCs initially treated with BSA (<italic>Msx1</italic>-off) or high BMP4 (<italic>Msx1</italic>-on), (mRNA) <italic>Msx1</italic> levels were higher in the <italic>Msx1</italic>-on CPCs regardless of the BMP4 concentration that was reapplied after washout (compare red and blue lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). In other words, we observed hysteresis.</p>
<p>For the second modification, we repeated the two-day culture studies, but also included the BMPR inhibitor LDN193189 during and after BMP4 washout to block persistent BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g004">Figure 4G</xref>). In CPCs initially exposed to high BMP4, LDN193189 caused (mRNA) <italic>Msx1</italic> to return to low baseline levels when no or low BMP4 was reapplied (0–4 ng/ml; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g004">Figure 4H</xref>, red line). Thus, persistent BMPR signaling contributed to the maintained <italic>Msx1</italic> expression observed initially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, red line). As in the four-day cultures, there were two distinct curves that depended on initial conditions - i.e. whether CPCs were initially <italic>Msx1</italic>-on or <italic>Msx1</italic>-off (compare red and blue lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g004">Figure 4H</xref>). Thus, the response again displayed hysteresis. Collectively, the two lines of evidence for hysteresis strongly implicate CIPF as the mechanism underlying BMP-FGF cross inhibition in CPCs.</p>

<p>While <italic>Msx2</italic> and <italic>Msx1</italic> responses were qualitatively similar, the <italic>Msx2</italic> EC<sub>50</sub> (22 ng/ml BMP4) was significantly lower than that of <italic>Msx1</italic> (32 ng/ml BMP4) in the same cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). In traditional views of morphogen action, EC<sub>50</sub> values and border positions are inversely related – e.g. a lower EC<sub>50</sub> shifts borders away from a morphogen source, thus creating a larger expression domain for a positively-regulated target gene. Published images of the dorsal telencephalon suggest that the <italic>Msx2</italic> domain is indeed larger than the <italic>Msx1</italic> domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Grove1">[48]</xref>. To verify this, we stained adjacent sections from <italic>Msx1</italic> (<italic>Msx1-nlacZ</italic>) embryos which express nuclear <italic>lacZ</italic> in the <italic>Msx1</italic> domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Houzelstein1">[49]</xref>, with antibodies that detect lacZ or MSX1/2 proteins.

<p>For morphogen thresholds ∼1.5 fold apart (22 vs. 32 ng/ml BMP4 for <italic>Msx2</italic> and <italic>Msx1</italic>, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) and separated by 100 µm, the length scale of an exponential morphogen gradient (the distance over which morphogen concentration falls by 1−<italic>e</italic><sup>−1</sup>, or ∼63%) would be ∼270 µm. This value agrees well with the dorsoventral pSmad gradient in the E10.5 dorsal telencephalon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Cheng1">[15]</xref>, whose best-fit exponential curve had a length scale of ∼290 µm (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).

<p>How might CIPF produce different borders or EC<sub>50</sub> values with the same BMP and FGF gradients? We found that it is possible to produce two distinct EC<sub>50</sub> values and borders, when BMP and FGF drive two different intracellular CIPF loops with common elements. The two CIPF loops can differ in two ways: either at the level of the CIPF loop - through differential regulation of the intermediates (B<sub>I</sub> and F<sub>I</sub>) by BMP and FGF or differential loop inhibition between the intermediates - or downstream of the CIPF loop.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A variety of mechanisms have been proposed to explain how shallow morphogen gradients are converted into sharp borders of gene expression and cell fate. In the dorsal telencephalon, previous work implicated cell-intrinsic BMP-driven ultrasensitivity in this conversion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Hu1">[12]</xref>. Here we show that this form of ultrasensitivity arises from cross inhibition between BMP and FGF (and EGF) signaling pathways. Such inhibition manifests as cross-inhibitory positive feedback (CIPF), a mechanism characterized by ultrasensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g003">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s004">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s005">S5</xref>), hysteresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g003">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s004">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s005">S5</xref>) and an ability to generate different thresholds (EC<sub>50</sub> values) within a gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g005">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s006">S6</xref>).</p>
<p>The complete elimination of <italic>Msx1</italic> and <italic>Msx2</italic> ultrasensitivity in the absence of FGF2 and EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g004">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g005">5</xref>) indicates that CIPF alone can account for <italic>Msx1</italic> and <italic>Msx2</italic> ultrasensitivity. In midline cells, however, FGF elimination caused a left-shift of the bimodal <italic>Ttr</italic> induction by BMP4 without eliminating ultrasensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Consistent with this, FGFR inhibition shifted the rostral <italic>Ttr</italic> boundary in forebrain explains, without making a more diffuse boundary or extending expression into the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This implies that mechanisms in addition to CIPF might contribute to sharp <italic>Ttr</italic> borders. The relatively late induction of <italic>Ttr in vivo</italic> (two days after <italic>Msx</italic> genes) and its apparent irreversibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Stauder1">[18]</xref> suggest that regulation of <italic>Ttr</italic> is more complex than <italic>Msx</italic> genes, which are direct and immediate BMP targets. The differences between <italic>Ttr</italic> and <italic>Msx1</italic> in the BMP4- and FGFR inhibitor-treated explants also raise the possibility that <italic>Ttr</italic> and <italic>Msx1</italic> are regulated by different FGFs (e.g. FGF8 and FGF2). Although changes in cell composition after two days in culture may contribute to observed findings, previous two-day cultures on more naïve E10.5 CPCs yielded similar ultrasensitive <italic>Msx1</italic> responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Hu1">[12]</xref>, and BMP2 (which has very similar effects to BMP4 on CPCs) did not significantly alter cell type ratios in comparably-staged rat CPC cultures in the presence of FGF2 even after eight days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Mehler1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Mabie1">[51]</xref>. While no single parameter set from the simulations and parameter searches can be considered representative, these modeling techniques enable investigation of complex models such as CIPF and CFF that are not otherwise amenable to analytical techniques, which can be sampled over large areas of parameter space (Tables S1, S2, S3, S4, S5 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s008">Text S1</xref>) and cross-validated with other methods (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003463-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Molecular basis for BMP-FGF CIPF in the forebrain</title>
<p>BMP-FGF cross inhibtion, particularly specification of mutually exclusive BMP- and FGF-dependent cell fates, has been reported in diverse developmental contexts (Table S6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s008">Text S1</xref>, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Maier1">[52]</xref>). The most well-studied molecular mechanism proposed to explain FGF inhibition of BMP signaling has been the ability of FGF-activated ERK to phosphorylate and trigger the degradation of BMP-activated pSmads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Sapkota1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Fuentealba1">[28]</xref>. This mechanism, however, is unlikely to account for CIPF in the forebrain for two reasons. First, there is no apparent pSmad ultrasensitivity to BMP in CPCs. <italic>In vivo</italic>, pSmad1/5/8 immunoreactivity declines gradually and smoothly with distance from the DM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Cheng1">[15]</xref> while MSX1 and MSX2 borders are sharp (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s006">Figure S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Ramos1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Grove1">[48]</xref>). In CPCs <italic>in vitro</italic>, in the presence of FGF2 and EGF, nuclear pSmad levels exhibit a graded relationship to BMP4 dose while <italic>Msx1</italic> and <italic>Msx2</italic> inductions are ultrasensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g004">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Hu1">[12]</xref>). Ultrasensitivity must then be generated downstream of pSmad. Second, the occurrence of <italic>Msx1</italic> and <italic>Msx2</italic> EC<sub>50</sub> values at different BMP4 doses suggests a mechanism downstream of pSmad as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). As <italic>Msx1</italic> and <italic>Msx2</italic> share the pSmad activation pathway, the points of FGF inhibition into the BMP pathway required for separate EC<sub>50</sub> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g005">Figure 5C,D</xref>) probably lie downstream of pSmad (e.g. a Smad-induced gene or Smad coactivator complex). Although less is known about mechanisms underlying BMP inhibition of FGF signaling, the smooth gradient of phospho-ERK in the developing cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Toyoda1">[24]</xref> suggests that this inhibition may similarly occur downstream of ERK activation.</p>

<p>Cross-inhibition (or cross-repression) is, of course, not new in developmental biology (Table S7 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s008">Text S1</xref>). Specifically, cross inhibition in the form of a toggle switch (i.e. CIPF) is thought to underlie the generation of sharply-bounded domains of mutually-exclusive cell fates in diverse contexts e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Sprinzak1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Goldbeter1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Wittmann1">[55]</xref>, including the two well-studied systems of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo and mammalian spinal cord <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Balaskas1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Manu1">[9]</xref>. In these systems, patterning emerges from the collaboration between transcription factor morphogens (Bicoid-Caudal in the syncytial <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo) or a single extracellular morphogen and a transcriptional network (Sonic Hedgehog in the mammalian spinal cord) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Rogers1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Balaskas1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Manu1">[9]</xref>. Both architectures contain a toggle switch sub-motif similar to BMP-FGF CIPF, which can generate ultrasensitivity, hysteresis (buffering noise), and multiple sharp borders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Rogers1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Balaskas1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Manu1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-ManuSurkova1">[56]</xref>. The Bicoid-Caudal system also reduces variation in border position and scales borders to tissue size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Rogers1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Manu1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-ManuSurkova1">[56]</xref>, which we reason below should apply similarly to BMP-FGF CIPF.</p>
<p>What is unique about BMP-FGF CIPF – compared to Shh, Bicoid-Caudal, and other defined patterning systems – is that a cellular-level toggle switch is explicitly driven by and dependent on multiple extracellular morphogens. BMP-FGF CIPF therefore provides a direct and explicit link between tissue-level patterning by antagonistic morphogens and cellular-level ultrasensitivity. Unlike the antagonistic Bicoid-Caudal system, BMP-FGF CIPF occurs in a non-syncytial system that may apply broadly to vertebrates, given the prevalence of BMP-FGF cross-inhibition in vertebrate development (Table S6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s008">Text S1</xref>). Furthermore, the current study defines new requirements for CIPF-mediated toggle switches (nonlinearity and loop balance) that likely apply to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, mammalian spinal cord, and other cross-inhibition systems belonging to the CIPF class of models (Table S7 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s008">Text S1</xref>).</p>
<p>In the dorsal telencephalon, DM rostral border position would be determined by BMPs interacting with rostral FGF8 and related FGFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g006">Figures 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003463.s001">S1A</xref>). Mediolaterally, the same BMPs would interact with FGF2 and FGF1 in the cortex, and possibly with EGF from the antihem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Assimacopoulos1">[42]</xref>. Along both axes, interactions between opposing BMP and FGF/EGF gradients would determine cellular ultrasensitivity thresholds and gene expression borders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003463-g006">Figure 6</xref>). These border positions coincide with “equivalence” points – i.e. points at which BMP and FGF signaling (or B<sub>I</sub> and F<sub>I</sub>) balance each other.

Pattern scaling is important in development, as size variations naturally arise as functions of time, genetic background, and environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Lander2">[4]</xref>. As others have pointed out, mechanisms that assign positional values based on the ratio between signals emanating from opposing sources, rather than as a function of a single signal, have an inherent tendency to scale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-McHale1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Howard1">[60]</xref>, although not necessarily with equivalent accuracy at every location. While no studies have investigated scaling of pattern in the forebrain DM, the forebrain provides a promising avenue for future studies. The forebrain grows rapidly during early development, and scaling needs to occur on a spatiotemporal scale. Additionally, mouse and human microcephaly and megalencephaly cases in which patterning appears to be maintained represent a potentially rich area for research into the toggle switch mechanism and brain scaling.</p>
<p>Notably, for morphogen-driven CIPF to specify border positions, it is not necessary for both morphogens to be graded. For example, a BMP gradient superimposed on a uniform FGF field would also produce sharp boundaries at locations corresponding to BMP-FGF equivalence points. This scenario may apply to mediolateral borders in the dorsal telencephalon, where FGF2 production appears to be relatively uniform <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003463-Dono1">[20]</xref>. Referring to FGF as a “morphogen” in this scenario departs from conventional usage (which presumes a graded distribution), but perhaps in patterning systems driven by collaborations between diffusible signals, such a departure is justified.</p>
