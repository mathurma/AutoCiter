<abstract>
<p>Regulatory networks that control gene expression are important in diverse biological contexts including stress response and development. Each gene's regulatory program is determined by module-level regulation (e.g. co-regulation via the same signaling system), as well as gene-specific determinants that can fine-tune expression. We present a novel approach, <italic>Modular regulatory network learning with per gene information</italic> (MERLIN), that infers regulatory programs for individual genes while probabilistically constraining these programs to reveal module-level organization of regulatory networks. Using edge-, regulator- and module-based comparisons of simulated networks of known ground truth, we find MERLIN reconstructs regulatory programs of individual genes as well or better than existing approaches of network reconstruction, while additionally identifying modular organization of the regulatory networks. We use MERLIN to dissect global transcriptional behavior in two biological contexts: yeast stress response and human embryonic stem cell differentiation. Regulatory modules inferred by MERLIN capture co-regulatory relationships between signaling proteins and downstream transcription factors thereby revealing the upstream signaling systems controlling transcriptional responses. The inferred networks are enriched for regulators with genetic or physical interactions, supporting the inference, and identify modules of functionally related genes bound by the same transcriptional regulators. Our method combines the strengths of per-gene and per-module methods to reveal new insights into transcriptional regulation in stress and development.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The state of a cell is largely determined by the genes the cell expresses. Transcriptional control of gene expression is exerted by transcription factor proteins that bind to regulatory regions of genes and affect their expression. Transcriptional programs have a modular organization enabling multiple genes to be coordinately regulated, and at the same time are fine-tuned for each gene through interactions of transcription factors with a gene's regulatory region. Transcription factors are themselves controlled by upstream signaling proteins, that in turn can be transcriptionally controlled. This complex process of gene expression control is described by a regulatory network that captures who regulates whom. A key challenge in systems biology is to reconstruct regulatory networks that capture precise gene-specific regulatory information, as well as the modular organization of transcriptional programs. We developed a novel regulatory network inference approach, MERLIN, <italic>Modular regulatory network learning with per gene information</italic>. When applied to examine transcriptional responses in two distinct processes, stress response and cellular differentiation, MERLIN accurately reconstructed regulatory programs of individual genes while revealing regulatory module organization and predicted upstream signaling proteins for regulatory modules. MERLIN is applicable to different environmental, developmental and disease contexts to dissect regulatory programs and ultimately build network-based predictive models of cellular states.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Regulatory networks that connect regulators (signaling proteins and transcription factors) to target genes are core information processing components in cells and control <italic>what</italic> genes must be expressed <italic>when</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Capaldi1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Kim1">[3]</xref>. Eukaryotic regulatory networks have several organizational properties: (1) regulatory networks are modular, enabling multiple genes to be simultaneously regulated through the same regulatory mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Ihmels1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Wohlbach1">[5]</xref>, (2) individual genes are often regulated by multiple transcription factors that combinatorially bind to promoters of genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Harbison1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Venters1">[9]</xref>. Activation of upstream signaling proteins and their downstream transcription factors alters global gene expression in dynamic ways and often, upstream regulators are themselves regulated, via feedback and feed-forward loops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Gasch1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-McIsaac1">[10]</xref>. These dynamic patterns can be readily quantified through advances in regulatory genomics, enabling us to describe cellular states by signature patterns of expression and chromatin modifications. Computational reconstruction of regulatory networks provide a powerful approach to dissect these states relying on the premise that the expression patterns of genes encoding upstream regulators are predictive of the expression of other target genes of that signaling system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Amit1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Wang1">[16]</xref>. A major challenge that remains is to combine these regulatory network properties of individual genes and sets of genes in a module to build predictive models of system state.</p>
<p>Computational methods for network reconstruction can be broadly classified into two groups: (1) per-gene methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003252-g001"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>), which infer a regulatory network one gene at a time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Friedman1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Peer1">[21]</xref>, and (2) per-module methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Segal1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-DeSmet1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Joshi1">[23]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003252-g001"><bold>Figure 1C</bold></xref>), which infer a regulatory network by grouping similarly expressed genes into modules and inferring a single regulatory program for the module. While the per-gene methods can infer precise regulatory logic of every gene, considering each gene separately ignores the modular organization of networks. On the other hand, per-module approaches learn concise and modular structures, but they simplify the regulatory network by requiring all genes in the module to have the same regulatory program. This simplification comes at the cost of important regulatory information at individual genes, such as variations in transcription factor interactions due to gene-specific promoter architecture. Thus, while per-module approaches succeed in identifying regulators that affect larger module-level behavior, they cannot identify the regulators that are important from an individual genes perspective because they do not incorporate gene-specific parameters.</p>

<p>We propose a novel regulatory network reconstruction approach, <italic>Modular regulatory network learning with per gene information</italic>, MERLIN, that combines the strengths of per-gene and per-module network inference methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003252-g001"><bold>Figure 1D</bold></xref>). Specifically, our approach learns separate regulatory programs for each gene, but constrains the network using a probabilistic graphical model such that genes in the same module have similar, but not identical, regulatory programs. Furthermore the algorithm learns both the network structure and network parameters that can be used to predict expression in a test condition.</p>
<p>Comparison of our approach to state of the art per-gene and per-module methods clearly identified the strengths of our approach in accurately recovering both edge and module-based regulatory information. We applied our method to published transcriptome measurements of yeast stress responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Gasch2">[24]</xref> and a new human embryonic stem cell differentiation dataset. In both processes, MERLIN inferred transcription factors and signaling proteins that work in concert to regulate the same module, allowing us to predict the upstream signaling networks that function together in the cell. We identify regulatory networks recapitulating the combinatorial transcriptional control of amino acid metabolism genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Lee1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Gasch2">[24]</xref>, and additionally implicate the HOG1 MAP kinase to be the upstream regulator of numerous modules associated with osmotic and cell wall stress. In humans, we predict regulators from major signaling pathways including Notch and Hedgehog pathways for modules associated with the maintenance of pluripotency and with the onset of cellular differentiation.</p>

<title>MERLIN: An approach to capture per-gene and per-module regulatory information</title>
<p>A mathematical model of a regulatory network has two components: the <italic>structure</italic> specifies the regulators of a target gene, and the <italic>logic</italic>, encoded in mathematical functions, describes the sign and magnitude of individual and combinations of regulators that specify the expression of that gene. Several different mathematical functions could relate the expression of the upstream regulators to the mRNA level of a target, e.g. boolean functions, differential equations, probabilistic functions. The MERLIN approach is based on a probabilistic graphical model representation of a regulatory network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003252-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Friedman1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Peer1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Friedman2">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Markowetz1">[26]</xref>. Within our probabilistic graphical model, both genes and their regulators (which can be targets as well) are represented as random variables whose associated probability distributions represent the range of values a gene can take in different microarray or RNA-seq experiments. In probabilistic graphical models, the mathematical functions relating the level of a regulator to the level of a gene is a conditional probability distribution, specifying the probability of a target gene to take a specific expression value given the expression values of its regulators. We use a conditional Gaussian model for the conditional distribution, with mean of the Gaussian derived as a linear function of the expression levels of the regulators (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><bold>Materials and Methods</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>We assume that we have measured expression levels of both gene targets and encoded regulators under multiple conditions, and regulators and target genes co-vary under different conditions. To reconstruct the regulatory network from given gene expression data we need to infer both the structure as well as parameters of the mathematical functions. Our network inference approach, MERLIN, combines the two popular strategies of expression-based network inference approaches described above: per-gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Haury1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-HuynhThu1">[19]</xref>, and per-module <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Segal1">[14]</xref> approaches. MERLIN learns the gene-specific regulatory programs while imposing a module constraint as a probabilistic prior. Instead of selecting regulators independently for each gene <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the prior enables us to take into account regulators that are predicted to regulate other genes co-expressed with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the same module. In this way we impose a “soft” module constraint so that two genes in a module are favored to have similar but not necessarily identical regulators as in a per-module approach.</p>
<p>The MERLIN learning algorithm begins with a set of modules, which are typically defined by an expression-based clustering step, and a set of candidate regulators of gene expression (e.g. all transcription factors, kinases, phosphatases annotated in an organism). It then iterates over two steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003252-g001"><bold>Figure 1E</bold></xref>): (a) a regulator identification step, and (b) a module inference step. In the regulator identification, the modules are kept fixed and the regulator sets of each gene are identified by adding new regulators that reduce the prediction error of a gene <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>'s expression value from the expression values of the regulators, while using a probabilistic “module” prior on the graph that favors regulators regulating other genes in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>'s module, (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><bold>Materials and Methods</bold></xref>). The prior enables us to favor graph structures that are more modular. In the module inference step, genes are grouped into modules using co-expression and co-regulation based on the inferred set of regulators for a pair of genes. Co-expression is measured by the Pearson's correlation between two gene expression profiles. Co-regulation is measured by the similarity of inferred regulators for each gene (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><bold>Materials and Methods</bold></xref>). The algorithm repeats these two phases of the algorithm until convergence. In addition to the module prior, we also use a model complexity prior that penalizes excessive parameters in the model (for example, due to a large number of regulators). Such a complexity prior avoids over-fitting the model to the data. Both the structure complexity prior and the module prior are controlled by user-defined parameters, and can be flexibly adjusted to control how strongly we want to impose each prior.</p>

<title>MERLIN accurately infers per-gene regulatory programs as well as module-level organization on both simulated ground truth and real expression data</title>
<p>We compared the quality of networks inferred by MERLIN to those inferred from three other algorithms using several criteria defined below. The algorithms include a linear regression per-gene network inference method (LINEARREGR), GENIE3 a state-of-the-art per-gene network inference algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-HuynhThu1">[19]</xref>, and Module networks (MODNET) from Segal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Segal1">[14]</xref>. The LINEARREGR approach that we used is a special case of MERLIN where we set the module prior to zero; this served as the baseline to study the gain in performance by adding the “module” constraint in our MERLIN approach. We also considered a Bayesian network as a baseline (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003252.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>), but the performance was much worse than any of the methods above.</p>
<p>We used both simulated gene expression data where the ground truth of the networks generating the data were known, as well as real gene expression data where the ground truth networks are not known. Simulated data was generated for networks of different number of genes, <italic>n</italic> = 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 1000 genes using GeneNetWeaver (GNW) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Schaffter1">[27]</xref>. This simulator takes networks as inputs and uses stochastic differential equations to generate simulated expression data. The simulated data had 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 and 1,000 measurements generated by perturbing one node and propagating the system to steady state. The simulated networks were generated so that they were modular, that is, genes in the same module tended to share more regulators than genes in different modules (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><bold>Materials and Methods</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>We defined three criteria to compare the inferred networks: (a) <bold>Edge-based comparison</bold> used fold enrichment and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Davis1">[28]</xref>, to assess edge overlap between the simulated ground truth network and inferred networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003252-g002"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003252.s001">Figure S1A</xref></bold>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><bold>Materials and Methods</bold></xref>), (b) <bold>Regulator-based comparison</bold> measured the number of regulators whose targets significantly matched between the true and inferred networks (FDR<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003252-g002"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref>), (c) <bold>Module-based comparison</bold> measured how many regulators associated with modules in the ground truth networks matched regulators associated with these modules in the inferred networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003252-g002"><bold>Figure 2C</bold></xref>). The AUPR edge-based comparison requires a ranking of edges and does not require us to specify a particular cutoff. The edge-based fold enrichment, regulator- and module-based measures require use to define a network. Because GENIE3 does not provide a discrete network but rather a ranking of all edges, and since the edge ranking does not translate into edge confidence, we considered networks with the top 20% or the top 40% edges from the GENIE3 output.</p>

<p>On simulated data MERLIN outperformed LINEARREGR and MODNET using edge-, regulator- and module-based metrics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003252-g002"><bold>Figure 2A–C</bold></xref>), suggesting that adding a module prior is beneficial for inferring better networks. MERLIN was significantly better than GENIE3 using fold enrichment (t-test <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-value &lt;0.003), and both approaches were at par using AUPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003252-g002"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>, t-test <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-value = 0.5), suggesting an overall improved performance than GENIE3. On both regulator- and module-based metrics GENIE3's performance depended greatly on the threshold used to define a network; in no case was it better than MERLIN, but significantly worse on the module-regulator relations than MERLIN (t-test <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-value &lt;0.04). We were surprised to see that MODNET did not perform well on the simulated network datasets. This is likely due to the extremely sparse networks MODNET infers. We observe a more comparable performance, although still low, when considering the yeast regulatory networks.</p>

While these networks are not perfect in reflecting the ground truth of the yeast regulatory network because ChIP-chip or -seq networks are condition-specific and the conditions do not overlap completely with the conditions from which we have mRNA data, an enrichment in these edges provides support of our inferred networks.

<p>Using edge-based measures we found that the network inferred by MERLIN had the highest fold enrichment with the different networks compared to the other methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003252-g003"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref>) (t-test <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-value &lt;0.003). Interestingly, none of the inferred networks were enriched in Venter et al's network measured in exponentially growing cells, but exhibited enrichment in the network measured in heat shock stress, suggesting all methods can capture condition-specific edges to some extent, and are also internally consistent with each other. Comparisons using regulator-based measures showed that MERLIN's inferred network was as good or better than other inferred networks exhibiting overlap of ChIP-chip targets of as many regulators as any other method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003252-g003"><bold>Figure 3C</bold></xref>). For module-based comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003252-g003"><bold>Figure 3D</bold></xref>), since true modules were not known, we used curated gene sets as modules. This included Gene Ontology Slim terms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Ashburner1">[33]</xref> and Yeastcyc bio-chemical pathways downloaded from the Saccharomyces Genome Database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Cherry1">[34]</xref>. We treated the MacIsaac network as the true network and compared the number of regulator-module relationships from the MacIsaac network with those from the inferred regulatory networks. We found that in all measures MERLIN was better or as good as other methods with only a slight decrease in enrichment for the Ecocyc pathways. In all these measures the relative performance of MODNET was closer to the other networks compared to simulated networks.</p>
<p>As a final comparison, we asked whether the modules inferred by MODNET and MERLIN represented targets of specific TFs by examining each module for enrichment of a TFs' ChIP-based targets in the module. This analysis was possible only for MODNET and MERLIN which infer modules but not for any of the per-gene methods. We found both MODNET and MERLIN modules were enriched for the ChIP targets of a large number of transcriptions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003252-g003"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>, column 5). This suggests that the module information captured in both MERLIN and MODNET represent co-regulated sets of genes, and allows us to gain new insight into the module-level properties of networks that are not evident in the per-gene methods.</p>
<p>Overall, we find that MERLIN performs as well or better than other methods on different types of metrics. Per-gene methods did not reveal any module structure and thus assessing whether TF's targets were associated in modules was not possible. The per-module method, MODNET, performed poorly on edge-based metrics, but had better performance on the yeast regulatory network which had more genes (although we cannot rule out that simulated networks are not perfect). Thus MERLIN combines the strengths of both the per-gene and per-module network inference methods, inferring high quality reconstructions of individual regulatory edges, as well as high confidence target sets localized to specific modules.</p>

<title>MERLIN identified tightly co-expressed modules with distinct regulatory programs exhibiting coherent biological function</title>
<p>First we asked whether MERLIN modules are indeed coherent groups of co-expressed and co-regulated genes by measuring: (a) the average Pearson's correlation for pairs of genes within a module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003252-g004"><bold>Figure 4C</bold></xref>), (b) regulatory modularity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003252-g004"><bold>Figure 4D</bold></xref>), which quantifies how different the regulatory programs are of one module compared to other modules (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><bold>Materials and Methods</bold></xref>). Correlation and regulatory modularity measures are always between −1 to 1 for each module, with a positive number indicating that genes in a module are tightly co-expressed and have distinct regulatory programs, respectively. We found that genes within modules indeed are tightly co-expressed (average Pearson's correlation &gt;0.5 for 82% of modules) and have high regulatory modularity (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), confirming that genes in a module share many more regulators with genes within the module than with genes not in the module.</p>
<p>Next, we evaluated whether modules are biologically meaningful by testing whether the modules were enriched for genes annotated with specific Gene Ontology (GO) processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Ashburner1">[33]</xref> (FDR corrected hypergeometric test, FDR&lt;0.05, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003252.s007">Table S1</xref></bold>), targets of transcription factors based on ChIP-chip assays or genes with upstream sequence-specific binding motifs. The majority of the modules (63 of 96) were enriched either for genes of the same GO process, ChIP-chip targets of TF, or genes with sequence-specific motif instances of a TF. This enrichment together with the high Pearson's correlations between gene expression profiles assigned to each module suggests that modules inferred by MERLIN are co-expressed gene regulons that capture biological meaningful relationships among genes in a module.</p>
<p>Using the inferred regulatory network and module memberships, we derived a regulator-module relationship network if the regulator's predicted “targets” (defined here merely as the genes whose expression was predicted by the regulators expression pattern) were enriched in a given module (FDR&lt;0.05). This network connected 175 different regulators to one or more of 96 modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003252-g004"><bold>Figure 4A,B</bold></xref>). We found the modules varied greatly in size, ranging from 5 to 117 genes with a median size of 11 genes. For each module we computed a “module in-degree” defined as the number of regulators whose targets were significantly enriched in the module. The module in-degree grew with the module size for most modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003252-g004"><bold>Figure 4E,F</bold></xref>, Pearson's correlation of 0.81), which is significantly higher than what is observed in random clustering (average Pearson's correlation = <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-test <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-value &lt;1E-33). This suggests that the high in-degree is perhaps because these modules have more regulators associated with them (but perhaps also influenced by ascertainment bias). However, there were exceptions to this trend. For example Module 2 (enriched for genes involved in cell-wall organization), Module 83 (amino acid biosynthesis genes) and Module 30 (respiration genes) had the largest number of associated regulators but only 42, 45 and 64 genes, respectively. The high number of regulators associated with these modules might represent complex combinatorial regulation or distinct condition-specific regulatory programs that operate under distinct situations, discussed more below. Other modules with the enrichments are available at our web-supplement <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pages.discovery.wisc.edu/~sroy/merlin" xlink:type="simple">http://pages.discovery.wisc.edu/~sroy/merlin</ext-link>.</p>

<title>Combinatorial regulation specifies distinct module expression patterns despite shared regulators</title>
<p>Several regulators were associated with a large number of genes in the MERLIN-inferred network, that is they had large out-degrees (e.g. Gcn20: 123 genes, Ime4: 82 genes, Met32: 81 genes) compared to the average (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003252-g004"><bold>Figure 4H</bold></xref>). Because a regulator can influence gene expression differently depending upon the other regulators associated with these genes, we asked whether the targets of a given regulator were localized to a single module or whether they were distributed across different modules. First we identified the number of modules to which the regulator was associated (based on statistical enrichment of the regulator's predicted targets in the module, FDR&lt;0.05). A large fraction of regulators (41.7%, 73 of 175) were associated with at least two modules, with a maximum of six modules linked to a given regulator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003252-g004"><bold>Figure 4G</bold></xref>). The number of associated modules was only moderately correlated with the number of gene targets of a regulator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003252-g004"><bold>Figure 4G</bold></xref>), e.g. the 40 Bas1 targets were distributed into six modules, while the 123 Gcn20 targets were distributed in four modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003252-g004"><bold>Figure 4H</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>There are two possibilities for why a regulator's predicted targets belong to different modules: either those modules are distinguished by dramatically different expression patterns across the diverse stress experiments, or they are distinguished by distinct set of predictive regulator sets even if their expression patterns are similar (but not identical). To systematically test these possibilities we computed the Silhouette index for each module, which measures how different a module's expression is compared to other modules. A positive Silhouette index for a module suggests that the expression of the module is distinct in expression from other modules. The Silhouette index was significantly higher than random clusters (KS test <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-value &lt;1E-38), however, the Silhouette indices for individual modules was low. In particular, while a third of modules had positive Silhouette indexes, the remaining two thirds of the modules had negligible or negative Silhouette scores indicating that the modules share some similarity in expression patterns. This observation in concert with the high regulatory modularity measure and high co-expression within each module suggests that distinct regulatory programs are associated with modules that are similar, but not identical, in expression pattern.</p>
<p>An example of this situation is seen for the Met32 transcription factor, a key regulator of sulfur metabolic genes that was associated with several different modules. All of these modules were enriched for amino acid pathway genes, but the modules exhibited different expression patterns in subsets of the diverse stress experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003252-g005"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref>). Genes in Modules 83, 21, and 3 were characterized by strong induction during amino acid starvation, conditions under which cells attempt to generate their own amino acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Gasch2">[24]</xref>. However, the modules were distinguished under other conditions: whereas genes in Module 83 were also induced under long-term nitrogen and carbon starvation, genes in Module 3 were additionally induced in response to the oxidizing drug menadione. In contrast, Module 57 genes were strongly repressed under amino acid and nitrogen starvation - this module included specialized amino acid transporters that are known to be repressed upon general amino acid starvation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Petti1">[8]</xref>.</p>

<p>Beyond expression, the modules were particularly differentiated in terms of the inferred regulatory networks. In addition to Met32, genes in Module 83 and Module 3 were associated with other regulators that are known to combinatorially interact in the sulfur regulatory network, including Met4, Met28, Met31 and Cbf1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Lee1">[7]</xref>. In addition, many genes were associated with Gcn4, which induces these genes in response to general amino acid starvation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Natarajan1">[35]</xref>. In contrast, Module 21 was associated with Met32 and the Bas1 transcription factor, which regulates purine biosynthesis genes – indeed, this module was enriched for purine genes that are induced during amino-acid starvation along with amino acid genes. Finally, genes in Module 57 were associated with Met32 and the nitrogen-responsive regulator Dal80, and enriched for the known targets of the Stp2 and Stp4, which regulate expression of amino acid transporters. In this case, the expression of Met32 is predictive of the repression of the specialized amino-acid transporters in the module, which are functionally related to but anti-correlated with Met32 targets.</p>

<p>To more broadly study these relationships, we asked if the set of regulators selected for each module exhibited functional relationships.

<title>MERLIN identifies regulatory modules exhibiting waves of transcriptional changes during differentiation neural progenitor cells</title>
<p>To test our approach on another dataset, we applied MERLIN to infer transcriptional regulatory networks in a very different biological context: during differentiation of human embryonic stem cells to neural progenitor cells.

<title>Transcriptional behavior during differentiation is captured by two large modules associated with ES state maintenance and neural differentiation</title>

<title>Fine-grained modules associate oncogenes as potential drivers of neural differentiation</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Per-gene methods for reconstructing gene regulatory networks do not exploit modular organization of regulatory networks, whereas per-module methods do not have the resolution for capturing gene-specific regulatory information. Our novel approach, MERLIN, combines the strengths of both per-gene and per-module network inference methods by inferring the regulatory programs for each gene and also capturing the modular structure of the regulatory network. On both simulated and real expression data MERLIN correctly inferred precise regulatory programs associated with individual genes and also captured modular organization of regulatory networks that provide new insight into the dynamics and regulation of transcriptional responses in our studied biological contexts.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>MERLIN strikes a balance between gene-specific and module-level regulatory information in the same algorithm</title>
<p>We found that while GENIE3, a state-of-the-art per-gene method performed well using edge-based metrics, when applied to yeast, it did not perform as well on module-based measures. In contrast, MODNET, a state-of-the-art module-based method, performed poorly using edge-based measures, but performed better on module-based measures. This improvement in performance was due to the module information allowing us to restrict ourselves to targets that are co-expressed in a module and thereby exhibit coherent function. Indeed identifying co-expressed sets of genes is a pre-requisite to identifying meaningful <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements enriched with a set of genes. A per-gene method does not provide such information making it difficult to identify the regulatory modules comprising genes sets that are co-regulated by multiple regulators. MERLIN's strengths are in its ability to combine the complementary advantages of both classes of methods. An additional advantage of MERLIN is that it is based on a probabilistic graphical model, which infers network parameters in addition to structure. Our preliminary work on assessing expression prediction on a holdout set shows that MERLIN outperforms LINEARREGR on more genes than it is outperformed, suggesting that incorporating the module constraints can also benefit the predictive power of the model (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003252.s002">Figure S2</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>MERLIN is widely applicable to biological processes with different dynamics</title>
<p>Our application of MERLIN to the yeast stress response data and the human embryonic stem cell differentiation data reveals its ability to dissect the transcriptional regulatory programs especially in large datasets that measure diverse conditional responses. In particular, in the human embryonic stem cell differentiation data, the module with genes that are up-regulated in the later time points but not in the earlier (ES) time points had little or no enrichment in the ChIP-seq targets. Incidentally, ChIP-seq datasets were generated in the H1-ES (human embryonic stem cells) cell line, and the modules in which there was enrichment comprised genes that were most expressed in the earlier time points that reflect a more ES-like state. MERLIN therefore captures context-specific regulatory interactions. Such interactions are most enlightening for modules exhibiting induced expression in conditions or tissues that have not been studied in great detail, perhaps due to under-sampling of these biological responses. Even in the yeast stress response data, which is a very well studied dataset, we derived new insight into the role of HOG1 and the downstream modules that might be regulated through intermediate transcription factors as we discuss below.</p>
<p>Our ability to capture these regulatory networks likely centers on the inherent feedback and feed-forward loops in eukaryotic transcriptional responses: genes encoding signaling proteins are often themselves targets of the pathways they encode. In other cases, genes encoding regulatory proteins (especially negative regulators) are augmented in anticipation of their future need; nonetheless, their expression patterns remain predictive of physiologically related genes. These features are likely to be common to many different responses across diverse organisms.</p>
<p>An important difference between the yeast and the human dataset was the number of biological conditions the genes were measured in. In particular, in yeast we had more than a dozen environmental perturbations whereas in human we had four relatively similar kinds of perturbations. While the relatively uniform nature of expression dynamics in this dataset enables us to identify the major patterns of expression as two large modules, adding more diverse perturbations can help us identify smaller fine-grained modules as in the yeast dataset that are easier to interpret biologically and for follow-up studies with smaller functional assays.</p>

<title>Extensions to MERLIN</title>
<p>There are several directions of future work associated with MERLIN. An immediate step is to more accurately model expression levels from next-generation sequencing data by considering conditional negative binomial or Poisson distributions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Witten1">[62]</xref>. MERLIN can be easily applied to other regulatory genomics datasets including global chromatin states that are becoming increasingly available using approaches similar to Marbach <italic>et al</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Marbach2">[63]</xref>, taking a weighted union of different MERLIN inferred networks. Another, perhaps more principled, way of integrating such datasets would be through extending MERLIN's prior to incorporate more detailed features of the promoter architecture of a gene such as sequence-specific motifs and nucleosome occupancies. On a related note, it is possible to combine different types of proteomic datasets within the MERLIN framework, e.g. using measured protein levels of transcription factors and signaling proteins and existing physical interactions to predict the mRNA levels of genes. Such extensions can likely better capture the transcription factors based on ChIP-chip than what we are able to do based on expression alone that might miss changes such as post-translational modifications on the regulators. Specifically focusing on temporal dynamics, one direction of research is to predict the expression state based on observations made at a previous state, which can model delays in transcriptional responses. MERLIN can also be extended to capture non-linear relationships between a target and a regulator expression profile. This can be done using a random forest regression approach which has the additional advantage that the trees can be gleaned to identify combinatorial rules of regulatory logic or through an S-system model that models both non-linear and temporal dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Wang1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>The increasing abundance of environment-specific, tissue-specific and disease-specific transcriptional profiles, especially for poorly characterized organisms, makes our ability to infer regulatory networks especially important. Approaches such as MERLIN that identify the gene-specific regulatory information for individual genes, while revealing the global modular organization of regulatory networks can significantly advance our understanding of wiring and combinatorial regulation of transcriptional responses governing cellular states.</p>

We assume that we have a set of gene expression measurements for the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> genes denoted by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denotes the joint assignment of expression values for all <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> genes in the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> sample.</p>
<p>The model that MERLIN learns has three components: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denotes the unknown regulatory network of interest describing the regulatory relationships between genes and regulators. Note that a regulator itself is also a gene and we can infer its regulators as well. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denotes the set of module memberships of each gene, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denotes the total number of modules. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denotes the set of parameters, with each <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denoting the parameters of the conditional distribution, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, of a target gene <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and its regulators, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Several forms are possible for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. For example if we assume <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a linear combination of the levels of the regulators, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the set of regression coefficients for each regulator selected for a gene. If we want to capture non-linear relationships, we can use a regression tree, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> would represent a collection of means and variances of a target gene at each leaf node. As we discuss in the score below, we assume that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and its regulators are distributed according to a multivariate Gaussian.</p>

<p>Given <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the set of candidate regulators <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and an initial assignment of modules <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> our goal is to infer the regulatory network <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and new module assignments <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Note the number of modules specified in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> might not be the same as the number of modules specified in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. To infer the unknowns in our model we use a score based approach in a Bayesian framework. We treat <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as random variables and we wish to find the posterior probability of these unknown variables. Our score <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is proportional to the posterior probability of these unknowns <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e059" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. By Bayes rule <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

We assume that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a uniform prior and does not influence the score. Given a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e065" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> we set <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e066" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to its maximum likelihood settings. The quantity that we need to define is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the graph prior. It is in this quantity that we incorporate our module constraint. We write <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e068" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as a product over regulatory edges that are present (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and edges that are absent (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) in the graph <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, that is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> corresponds to a target gene and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a regulator. The probability of an edge <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is written as a logistic prior <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are hyper-parameters and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is an edge-specific feature measuring the extent to which regulator <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> regulates other genes in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>'s module, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> controls the sparsity of the graph and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> controls the affect of the module prior.

For a very negative value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e091" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the data likelihood has to improve by a much greater margin for an edge to be added into the network. Thus, the more negative the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e092" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the more sparse is the network.</p>
<p>Given a module assignment and a graph at a particular learning iteration, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e094" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the ratio, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e095" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e096" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the number of predicted targets of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e097" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e098" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>'s module in iteration <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e099" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e100" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the total number of predicted targets of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e101" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We rewrite the graph prior part of the score as a product over the regulatory edges associated with each variable, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e102" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003252.e103"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e103" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e104" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the set of regulators associated with gene <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e105" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We denote the term inside the product as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e107" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to denote the subgraph induced by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e108" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and it's regulators, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e109" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>The likelihood <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e110" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> also can be written as a product over each variable, where each term in the product specifies the contribution of a variable to the overall likelihood part of score. The graph <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e111" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> itself is a dependency network which allows us to capture cycles, thus <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e112" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the pseudo likelihood. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the set of regulators associated with gene <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the parameters associated with the conditional distributions <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are values assigned to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> data sample. We denote the likelihood contribution of each variable as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We assume that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e123" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are distributed according to a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-dimensional Gaussian. This Gaussian is estimated for each <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and candidate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> pair. We convert the joint Gaussian into a conditional Gaussian with parameters, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as described in Lauritzen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Lauritzen1">[64]</xref>. Thus <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e129" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We have found that our approach of using the multivariate Gaussian works better than the standard linear regression approach because it takes into account the dependencies among the co-variates. Because both the likelihood and structure prior decompose over individual variables, we can write the score over the full graph as sum over variables: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e130" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>

<title>MERLIN learning algorithm</title>
<p>The algorithm (<bold>Algorithm 1</bold> in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003252.s010">Text S1</xref></bold>) begins with a set of modules <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e131" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which are typically defined by an expression-based clustering step. It then iterates over two steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003252-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>): (a) identifying the regulators for each gene given the current module assignments, and (b) re-inferring the modules using both co-expression and the inferred regulators for a pair of genes. It repeats these two phases of the algorithm until convergence. During the regulator identification step, the algorithm grows the regulator set of each gene based on the improvement in prediction error of expression of a gene, subject to a structure complexity prior that penalizes too many regulators.</p>
<p>To infer the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e132" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for each gene we directly estimate the Markov blanket of each gene, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, defined as the set of variables in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e134" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>'s immediate neighborhood and which render <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e135" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> independent of all other variables.

To identify <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e137" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> we use a greedy approach that grows the regulator set (initially empty) for each gene <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e138" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by adding the next regulator which when added gives the greatest score improvement. In particular, we optimize <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e139" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e140" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the current regulator set or Markov blanket of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e141" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We add <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e142" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> only if we observe an improvement in score.

To enable efficient computation of the graph prior, we pre-compute this quantity for an empty graph, and update it as we add edges during the learning process.</p>
<p>Once we finish the regulator selection phase for all genes, we have for each gene, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e146" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the weight <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e147" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of regression coefficients for each <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e148" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

In particular, let <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e162" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denote the indices of regulators associated with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e163" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e164" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e165" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, then <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e166" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

<p>Once we have defined the pairwise distance metric for each pair of genes we use a hierarchical clustering algorithm to define modules, stopping when the smallest distance between any two modules is greater than a given threshold, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e169" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. To efficiently do hierarchical clustering, we use the min-heap datastructure and merge nodes only if their distance is less than the threshold <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e170" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This approach of defining modules allows us to use the data to define the number of modules, and is not dependent excessively on the initial set of modules. When the algorithm converges, we have for each gene the module to which the gene belongs, as well as its regulator program (both the regulators as well as the parameters associated with each regulator). These steps are repeated until no more moves on the network structure changes gives a significant improvement in the likelihood score.</p>

<title>Sensitivity of different parameters to performance of MERLIN</title>
<p>There are three parameters in MERLIN that need to be specified: (<bold>1</bold>) <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e171" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> controls the number of edges in the network, that is the overall sparsity of the network, (<bold>2</bold>) <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e172" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, controls the extent of modularity in the network, (<bold>3</bold>) <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e173" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the cutoff for deciding at what point we must stop the hierarchical clustering of the modules. To determine how the parameters influence the final structure, we carried out an extensive simulation experiment on networks of different sizes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e174" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> genes, and different modular structures. We used GeneNetWeaver (GNW) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Schaffter1">[27]</xref> to generate simulated expression data. We generated the structure of these networks outside of GNW in order to impose different extents of modularity by controlling a parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e175" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We partitioned the data into random non-overlapping modules, which included both a set of target genes and a set of regulator genes. For each edge we used <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e176" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to probabilistically determine whether a regulatory edge would be added between a target and regulator gene with the same module membership, or different modules. Thus a higher value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e177" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> would favor greater regulatory modularity.</p>
<p>To assess the quality of the inferred network structure, we used F-score, which is defined as the harmonic mean of precision and recall. Precision in turn is the ratio of the true positives to the number of edges inferred, and recall is the ratio of the true positives to the total number of edges in the true network. The F-score gives us a single number that assesses the quality of the inferred network. The closer F-score is to 1, the better the performance. We also computed module statistics to assess the size and coverage of genes in each module: (a) number of good-sized modules, where a good-sized module must have at least 5 genes, (b) percentage of total genes that are in the good-sized modules. Ideally we would be able to include as many genes as possible in these good sized modules without losing biological coherence.</p>
<p>We found that the most important parameter that affected F-score was <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e178" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which controls the total number of edges in the network (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003252.s003">Figure S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003252.s004">S4</xref></bold>). This was true for both the high modularity (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e179" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and low modularity (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e180" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) networks. For all networks of different sizes the optimal value as determined by the best F-score was <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e181" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We also tried to pick <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e182" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> based on the cross-validation error, and picked <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e183" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to have the lowest cross-validation error, but had considerably lower performance as measured by F-score. For a fixed <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e184" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the other parameters had less affect on the F-score. The value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e185" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> controlled the number of modules, with small values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e186" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> producing too many small clusters (&lt;5 genes) and large values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e187" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> producing very large clusters (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003252.s005">Figure S5</xref></bold>). In general, the optimal value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e188" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ranged from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e189" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, regardless of low or high modularity networks. Finally for a given <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e190" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, higher values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e191" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> parameter tended to increase the number of good sized modules (at least five genes) and also the coverage of genes in these modules. The value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e192" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> also affected the structure recovery. In particular for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e193" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the network with 500 nodes, a value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e194" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e195" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> had a greater preference of low <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e196" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the low modularity networks. This suggests that this parameter can effectively capture modular networks, however not very high values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e197" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are required to do so.</p>
<p>Finally, we studied the effect of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e198" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> parameter on the modularity of the network (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003252.s006">Figure S6</xref></bold>). Because the networks we infer are directed regulatory networks, standard measures of modularity which are defined for undirected graphs were not sufficient. We defined a measure of regulatory modularity (defined below) that measures the extent of shared regulators of genes in a module compared to shared regulators with genes outside a module. We find that as we increase <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e199" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the estimated modularity of the network increases, but asymptotes after <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e200" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 8.</p>

<title>Data pre-processing</title>
<p>We applied MERLIN to two transcriptomic datasets, one in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Gasch2">[24]</xref>, and one in human (Manuscript in preparation, some of the data was released in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Xie1">[50]</xref>). The yeast expression data was obtained from Gasch et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Gasch2">[24]</xref> and comprised 173 microarray measurements. The data was pre-processed by Segal et al, to remove genes that did not change significantly producing a total of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e201" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> genes of which <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e202" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> genes were signaling proteins and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e203" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> were transcription factors. We replaced missing values of a gene with its mean from other samples where its expression was available.</p>
<p>For the human data, we had RNA-seq read counts from four time courses, two each for two cell lines: human ES line H1 and human iPS cell line DF19.7. We assembled these reads into a per gene count using RSEM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Li1">[65]</xref> and transformed the counts, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e204" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for each gene <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e205" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e206" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> sample as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e207" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Next we computed the mean of each time course and subtracted the mean. Thus each expression level in the RNA-seq data, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e208" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e209" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denotes the mean from a time course. The data were thus zeromean transformed for each time course separately. While this transformation does not account for the over-dispersed nature of RNA-seq data, we found that clustering the RNA-seq data using a Gaussian mixture gave us good performance as measured by Gene Ontology enrichment. Extending MERLIN to handle the “count” nature of RNA-seq data to reconstruct networks is an area of future work. After this we filtered out genes that changed less than ±1 in all time points. This produced a total of 5670 genes, of which 535 were transcription factors and 288 were either a kinase or phosphatase as annotated in Uniprot.</p>
<p>To apply MERLIN to each of these data sets we started with five random initializations. For the yeast data we split the data into five equal folds and learned models on four fifths of the data, and repeated this five times. A high confidence network was that which had an edge in three of the five random initializations. For the human data since we did not have as much data as in yeast, we used the entire data, but generated different MERLIN networks by starting with five different random initializations of clusterings <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e210" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We created a high confidence network by considering edges that were present in all five random initializations. MERLIN was applied on the different datasets using <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e211" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e212" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e213" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We selected these settings based on our experiments on simulated data where we found that the optimal values of modularity ranged between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e214" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e215" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>

<title>Comparison of network inference methods based on edge and module-based metrics</title>
<p>We compared the performance of MERLIN on simulated networks to the performance of three other algorithms using edge-based, regulator-based and module-based metrics. These comparisons were done on simulated ground truth networks where the true networks were known. We used GeneNetWeaver (GNW) to generate simulated expression data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Schaffter1">[27]</xref> for networks of 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 and 1,000 nodes. GNW takes networks as inputs and uses a stochastic differential equation model to generate expression data. To generate data from GNW we used a similar strategy as was used in the DREAM project on network inference comparisons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Marbach1">[20]</xref>. A set of measurements for all nodes was the steady-state values reached when the system was perturbed by simulating a gene knockout. All genes were knocked out, one at a time, producing datasets of size 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 or 1,000 measurements for the networks of different sizes.</p>

<title>Edge-based metrics for comparing the network inference algorithms</title>
<p>We first examined the agreement between the ground truth networks of different sizes to the inferred networks using standard precision-recall measures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Davis1">[28]</xref>. We computed the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) for each method, and used this as a metric to compare different methods on different networks. The AUPR ranges between 0 and 1, and the closer it is to 1, the better the inferred network in terms of the true edges recovered, and the false edges not inferred. As AUPR requires a continuously varying quantity we generated 100 random subsets of the data and computed an edge confidence using networks inferred on these 100 subsets.</p>
<p>In addition to AUPR we also compute the significance of overlap of edges between true and inferred edges using a hypergeometric <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e244" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-value and a fold enrichment. In fact, on the yeast network, AUPR was not informative due to the large number of “false” edges. The fold enrichment is defined as a ratio <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e245" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (also used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Marbach2">[63]</xref>), estimated from the same numbers used to estimate the hypergeometric <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e246" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-value. Namely, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e247" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e248" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e249" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the number true positive edges, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e250" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the total number of edges inferred, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e251" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the total number of edges in the true network, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e252" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the total number of edges possible, when restricted to common regulator and target nodes in the inferred and true networks. The fold enrichment gave us a single measure to compare both the simulated networks as well as the yeast network.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4g2">
<title>Regulator-based measures</title>
<p>In addition to edge-based comparisons, we developed measures that compare the inferred networks based on each regulator's target sets. This is done by considering one regulator at a time. For each regulator, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e253" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we ask whether its targets in the true network significantly overlap with its targets in the inferred network. Significance of overlap is assessed based on the hypergeometric distribution followed by a Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple hypothesis testing. We use FDR&lt;0.05 to determine whether a regulator's predicted and true targets significantly overlap.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4g3">
<title>Module-based measures</title>
<p>To assess regulator-module relationships in the simulated datasets we used the modules that were part of the ground truth simulation. We generated the “true” regulator-module graph by asking what regulators' targets were significantly over-represented (hypergeometric <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e254" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-value with FDR correction, FDR<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e255" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), in each module using the “true” network. Such regulators were considered as the true regulators of the module. Next we asked, using the inferred networks, what regulators' targets are significantly overrepresented in the modules of the simulation. These gave us the predicted regulator-module relationships. We measured precision (defined as the fraction of predicted regulator-module relationships that were obtained from the true network), recall (defined as the fraction of true regulator-module relationships), and an F-score to summarize the precision and recall.</p>
<p>Our module-based measures on the yeast expression data used modules from GO slim annotations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Ashburner1">[33]</xref>, or from the Yeastcyc pathways downloaded from the Saccharomyces genome database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Cherry1">[34]</xref>. We next asked what transcription factors with ChIP-chip data identified in the MacIsaac et al network were enriched in each of these modules. A regulator whose ChIP-chip targets are enriched in a module is said to be associated with a module giving us “true” regulator-module relationships. Next for an inferred network we asked which regulators' predicted targets were enriched in each of these modules producing predicted regulator-module relationships. We computed both F-score and the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e256" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-value from a hypergeometric test of overlap between the true and inferred regulator-module relationships. We report the hypergeometric test <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e257" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-value as this was more sensitive to the differences between the algorithms on the real data. We generated our Regulator- and Module-based scores on the MacIsaac et al network only as this was the gold standard in the recent DREAM competitions of network inference methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Marbach1">[20]</xref>.</p>

<title>Enrichment analysis of modules using Gene Ontology and transcription factor binding sites</title>
<p>To assess the biological meaning of modules inferred by MERLIN we used gene set enrichment analysis of various modules using the hypergeometric test followed by an FDR correction method of Benjamini and Hotchberg. We considered only modules of size at least 5 genes. These gene sets included genes annotated with a Gene Ontology process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Ashburner1">[33]</xref> (yeast and human), ChIP-chip or ChIP-seq targets of transcription factors (yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-MacIsaac1">[30]</xref> and human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Gerstein1">[44]</xref>), gene sets from Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB, humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Liberzon1">[43]</xref>), or genes with motif instances in DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Thurman1">[45]</xref>. To assess the association of Modules 2, 19 and 37 in the Gasch stress data we obtained a curated Hog1 signaling network from Tiger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Tiger1">[67]</xref> and combined it with a curated gene set from Gasch lab (unpublished), and asked whether any module members or the regulators of the module were enriched in this list. Based on a hypergeometric test of overlap we found regulators of Module 2 to be significantly enriched (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e258" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-value &lt;0.02), and a lower stringency of (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e259" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-value &lt;0.3) for the other modules. Module 19's regulators were also enriched for genes in this list (hypergeometric <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003252.e260" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-value &lt;0.13).</p>
<p>To map ChIP-seq and DNAse1 sites in the human dataset we focussed on ±2000 bps of the transcription start site (TSS) of a gene, where the TSS coordinates were obtained from Gencode10 as used in the ENCODE project <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Consortium1">[68]</xref>. Motifs were obtained from Jaspar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Bryne1">[69]</xref>, and DHSs were obtained from Thurman et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Thurman1">[45]</xref>, downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ensembl/encode/integration_data_jan2011/byDataType/openchrom/jan2011/combined_peaks/" xlink:type="simple">http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ensembl/encode/integration_data_jan2011/byDataType/openchrom/jan2011/combined_peaks/</ext-link>. To find genes with motif instances of a transcription factor we used the Finding Individual Motif Occurrences (FIMO) from MEME suite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003252-Grant1">[70]</xref> to scan the DHSs with a q-value &lt;1E-5. To map a gene to a ChIP-seq peak of a transcription factor we obtained peak calls from the ENCODE project from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ensembl/encode/integration_data_jan2011/byDataType/peaks/jan2011/spp/optimal/hub/" xlink:type="simple">http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ensembl/encode/integration_data_jan2011/byDataType/peaks/jan2011/spp/optimal/hub/</ext-link>, and associated a gene to the transcription factor if its peak was within ±2000 bps of the TSS of the gene.</p>
