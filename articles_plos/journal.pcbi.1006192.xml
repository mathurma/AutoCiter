<abstract>
<p>Prediction of drug combinations that effectively target cancer cells is a critical challenge for cancer therapy, in particular for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a highly aggressive breast cancer subtype with no effective targeted treatment. As signalling pathway networks critically control cancer cell behaviour, analysis of signalling network activity and crosstalk can help predict potent drug combinations and rational stratification of patients, thus bringing therapeutic and prognostic values. We have previously showed that the non-receptor tyrosine kinase PYK2 is a downstream effector of EGFR and c-Met and demonstrated their crosstalk signalling in basal-like TNBC. Here we applied a systems modelling approach and developed a mechanistic model of the integrated EGFR-PYK2-c-Met signalling network to identify and prioritize potent drug combinations for TNBC. Model predictions validated by experimental data revealed that among six potential combinations of drug pairs targeting the central nodes of the network, including EGFR, c-Met, PYK2 and STAT3, co-targeting of EGFR and PYK2 and to a lesser extent of EGFR and c-Met yielded strongest synergistic effect. Importantly, the synergy in co-targeting EGFR and PYK2 was linked to switch-like cell proliferation-associated responses. Moreover, simulations of patient-specific models using public gene expression data of TNBC patients led to predictive stratification of patients into subgroups displaying distinct susceptibility to specific drug combinations. These results suggest that mechanistic systems modelling is a powerful approach for the rational design, prediction and prioritization of potent combination therapies for individual patients, thus providing a concrete step towards personalized treatment for TNBC and other tumour types.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Resistance to anti-cancer drugs is a major clinical problem and a prevalent cause of cancer-related death. Consequently, combination therapy has recently emerged as a powerful strategy to circumvent drug resistance and thus is being actively pursued in many cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref001">1</xref>]. Yet, we face daunting challenges of how to predict the best combinations of targets and importantly, how to prioritize those combinations for clinical testing. Given the number of possible target combinations are vast but clinical trials are slow and expensive, there is an urgent need to develop rational and unbiased approaches to predict effective drug combinations, prioritize them and stratify patients for optimal benefit.</p>
<p>Analysis of the activity and dynamics of signalling networks should aid in the development of effective combination therapies against oncogenic kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref002">2</xref>]. However, signalling networks often contain complex pathway crosstalk and feedback regulation, making it difficult to analyse the drug-induced network behaviours and emergent network features using experimental approaches alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref003">3</xref>]. Instead, experimentally-grounded mathematical models of signalling networks that integrate pathway crosstalk and feedback loops provide a powerful quantitative framework for the systematic analysis of network-level dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref006">6</xref>]. As feedback loops often lead to unexpected adverse effects of drug treatments, these models have the power to predict effective and non-trivial combination treatments in cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref003">3</xref>]. Here, we employ a systems-based approach combining mechanistic modelling and biological experiments to predict and prioritize drug combinations for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive subtype of breast cancer.</p>
<p>While targeted therapies have vastly improved the survival of ER/PR-(Estrogen/Progesterone receptor) and HER2/ErbB2-positive breast cancers, TNBC, which is defined by the absence of these hormone receptors and of HER2 amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref007">7</xref>], remains a major clinical challenge with no efficient targeted therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref008">8</xref>]. TNBC comprises an heterogeneous group of cancers with at least six molecular subtypes (BL1: basal-like 1, BL2: basal-like 2, IM: immunomodulatory, M: mesenchymal, MSL: mesenchymal stem-like, and LAR: luminal androgen receptor), which display different clinico-pathological features and divergent responses to treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref009">9</xref>]. This heterogeneity requires efficient patient stratification strategies, capable of predictively selecting most suitable patients for specific treatments, while excluding the unsuitable individuals or subgroups.</p>
<p>Several signalling pathways, including the PI3K/mTOR pathway, JAK/STAT, Ras/Raf as well as the EGFR and c-Met pathways have been considered as potential therapeutic targets for TNBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref010">10</xref>]. The Tyrosine Receptor Kinases EGFR and c-Met are highly expressed in TNBC and implicated in TNBC progression and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref013">13</xref>]. However, their targeting by monotherapeutic agents has a marginal clinical efficacy possibly due to bidirectional compensatory responses, activation of alternative pathway(s), and/or other resistance mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref015">15</xref>]. EGFR and c-Met share overlapping downstream signalling pathways and can trans-phosphorylate one another. We have recently found that PYK2 is a common downstream effector of EGFR and c-Met; and have delineated their crosstalk signalling in TNBC, demonstrating that knockdown of PYK2 facilitates receptor degradation and concomitantly inhibits EGF-induced ERK1/2 and STAT3 phosphorylation. PYK2 positively regulates STAT3-phosphorylation in response to EGFR activation, while pSTAT3 binds to the PYK2 promoter and enhances PYK2 transcription, and indirectly upregulates c-Met expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref016">16</xref>]. These results suggest a number of positive-feedback loops between PYK2, STAT3, c-Met and EGFR, and imply that co-targeting of components of this circuit could have therapeutic impact.</p>
<p>Here, we develop and experimentally validate a quantitative mechanistic model of the EGFR-PYK2-c-Met interaction network and demonstrate the utility of this model in accurately predicting and importantly, prioritizing synergistic drug combinations for TNBC. Notably, model predictions supported by <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> data reveal co-inhibition of EGFR-PYK2 and EGFR-c-MET yield the most synergistic effects among other possible drug combinations. Moreover, integrated modelling-experimental analysis uncovers switch-like response to single-drug inhibition at both the signalling (STAT3 and ERK activation) and cell proliferation levels, and establish a link between these switches and the drug synergy displayed by the combination treatment. Excitingly, simulations of patient-specific models generated through incorporating gene expression data from individual TNBC patients led to stratification of patients into subgroups with distinct susceptibility to EGFR-PYK2 co-inhibition, thereby predicting a subset of highly susceptible patient characterized by high PYK2 expression. Collectively, we present a proof-of-concept study demonstrating the power of quantitative mechanistic modelling in the rational discovery and prioritization of effective drug combinations for TNBC. Importantly, the principles contained in this work are highly applicable to other signalling systems and/or tumour types, which should significantly aid in the selection of best target combinations for further in-depth preclinical and clinical testing.</p>

<title>Description of the EGFR-PYK2-c-Met network interactions and mathematical model assumptions</title>
<p>The interconnection between EGFR, PYK2 and c-Met signalling in TNBC cells and the involvement of STAT3 activation in a positive feedback loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref016">16</xref>] led us to examine the dynamic behaviours of the EGFR-PYK2-c-Met signalling network in a quantitative and predictive manner. To this end, we constructed, calibrated and validated a computational model of this network. Reconstruction of the network structure revealed a multitude of interconnected positive and negative feedback loops, suggesting the network is likely to display highly non-linear and emergent dynamical properties. This model is based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) which incorporates these key feedback interactions as well as other established regulatory mechanisms. A detailed reaction scheme of the EGFR-PYK2-c-Met network is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, while a simplified schematic diagram depicting the core signal flow and salient feedback loops is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g001">Fig 1B</xref>. Detailed description of the model reactions, ODEs and parameter values are available in the Supplementary Information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s024">S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s026">S3</xref> Tables). Below, we describe the mechanistic biological observations and regulatory mechanisms that underlie the key model assumptions built into the model.</p>

<title>Positive feedback between EGFR and PYK2</title>
<p>We reported recently that PYK2 is a downstream effector of both EGFR and c-Met in TNBC cell lines, and that stimulation of EGFR or c-Met by their cognate ligands EGF or HGF, induced rapid phosphorylation of PYK2 on tyrosine 402 (pY402) and ensuing activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref016">16</xref>] (reaction 9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). On the other hand, PYK2 depletion substantially reduced EGFR level shortly (30–120 mins) after EGF stimulation. These observations suggest that PYK2 either attenuates receptor ubiquitination and consequently its lysosomal degradation (reaction 3) or facilitates receptor deubiquitination (reaction 4). Although we assumed the former to be the case, the model’s dynamic features are not significantly affected even if we assumed the later instead. The reciprocal interactions between PYK2 and EGFR form a positive feedback between these proteins, denoted as F1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g001">Fig 1B</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec005">
<title>Negative feedback loops involving EGFR</title>
<p>As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, EGFR is assumed to exist in three inter-convertible molecular states: unmodified, phosphorylated (activated) and ubiquitinated (EGFR<sub>ub</sub>); transition between these states are regulated by the relevant enzyme regulators. Upon EGF binding, EGFR undergoes rapid phosphorylation, internalization and ubiquitination by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl, which targets it for lysosomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref017">17</xref>]. As activated EGFR induces phosphorylation (on tyrosine 371) and activation of Cbl (reaction 19) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref018">18</xref>], which eventually leads to EGFR degradation, EGFR and Cbl are connected via a negative feedback. For simplicity, we avoid modelling of EGFR synthesis and degradation processes, and instead assume that EGFR molecules targeted for degradation are locked in a dynamic pool of ubiquitinated EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Similar to EGFR ubiquitination, EGFR phosphorylation is also regulated by a negative feedback loop between EGFR and tyrosine phosphatases, such as SHP-1 (denoted generically as PTP), which are activated by EGFR and induce receptor dephosphorylation and consequently its inactivation (reactions 21 and 2).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec006">
<title>Transcriptional positive feedback between PYK2 and STAT3</title>
<p>By using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase-reporter assay we previously showed that STAT3 directly binds to PYK2 promoter and enhances its transcription in response to EGF stimulation in TNBC cells. We further showed that STAT3 inhibition by Stattic or AG490 (JAK/STAT3 inhibitor) significantly reduced PYK2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref016">16</xref>], and that PYK2 enhances STAT3 phosphorylation on its primary activating tyrosine site (Y705) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref016">16</xref>]. Together, these data established a transcriptional positive feedback loop between PYK2 and STAT3, which is described by reactions 5, 6, 9, 10 and 11 in the model’s reaction scheme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) and by F2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g001">Fig 1B</xref>. Further, we showed that EGF stimulation of MDA-MB-468 cells, as opposed of PYK2-depleted cells induced co-localization of EGFR with phospho-STAT3 (pY705) at endosomal-like structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref012">12</xref>], implying that PYK2 is essential for EGFR-STAT3 interaction. The association between PYK2, EGFR and STAT3 was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref012">12</xref>]. Consequently, the EGFR-PYK2-STAT3 interactions are modelled as a sequential cascade of signalling activation, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g001">Fig 1A</xref>.</p>

<sec id="sec007">
<title>Positive feedback between PYK2 and c-Met via STAT3</title>
<p>We previously showed that PYK2 positively regulates the steady-state level of c-Met protein as well as its transcription in response to EGF stimulation in TNBC cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref016">16</xref>]. We also showed that inhibition of c-Met using a specific inhibitor (PHA-665752) reduced the phosphorylation of both PYK2 and STAT3 in response to EGFR stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref016">16</xref>], while STAT3 inhibition decreased c-Met transcription, suggesting that STAT3 enhances the transcription of c-Met (reaction 13). Together, our model (i) suggests a positive feedback loop in the PYK2-STAT3-c-Met axis (F4 and F3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) and (ii) incorporates the degradation of c-Met by Cbl-mediated ubiquitination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref019">19</xref>] (reaction 16).</p>

<p>Binding of HGF to c-Met induces c-Met phosphorylation of two tyrosine residues (Y1234 and Y1235) within the catalytic loop of the tyrosine kinase domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref020">20</xref>], and the subsequent recruitment of effector proteins including growth factor receptor bound protein 2 (GRB2) and Src homology-2-containing (SHC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref020">20</xref>] which leads to activation of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signalling cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref021">21</xref>]. To keep the model minimal without compromising its dynamic accuracy, we simplified this multi-step signalling cascade into a single lumped reaction where ERK phosphorylation and activation are catalysed by both EGFR and c-Met (reaction 23). We assumed EGF and HGF as inputs into the model, while activities of STAT3 and ERK indicated by their phosphorylated levels are considered as the main model outputs, which together regulate cancer cell proliferation and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>We integrated all the essential molecular interactions and feedback regulation described above, based on which an ODE model was formulated using a combination of kinetic laws including Michaelis-Menten (MM) kinetics for catalytic reactions (e.g. (de)phosphorylation, (de)ubiquitination), Hill kinetics (transcription) and mass-action kinetics (association/ dissociation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref024">24</xref>]. As a result, the model comprises 13 ODEs and 70 kinetic parameters.

<title>Model calibration and kinetic parameters estimation</title>
<p>The adequacy of a model is generally justified by its ability to recapitulate experimental data. Thus, to ensure model quality we calibrated (trained) the EGFR-PYK2-c-Met model using time-course and perturbation data obtained from TNBC MDA-MB-468 cells. These include the dynamic response of phosphorylated and total levels of key network components (EGFR, PYK2, c-Met, ERK and STAT3) following EGF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g001">Fig 1C–1G</xref>). While EGF stimulation monotonically increased the activities of EGFR, ERK and STAT3, it instead induced a biphasic response of c-Met where c-Met level was initially decreased but then dramatically increased beyond its basal level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). In addition, time-course profiles of PYK2 and c-Met mRNA measured over 8 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g001">Fig 1H–1J</xref>), and of pSTAT3, pERK1/2, c-Met and PYK2 measured over 2 hours (24 hours for c-Met) following EGF stimulation in control and PYK2-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g001">Fig 1K–1R</xref>) were used for model training. Finally, data regarding the effect of c-Met inhibition on signalling nodes were also used (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s004">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Model calibration involved the estimation of unknown model parameters using a global parameter estimation method called genetic algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref027">27</xref>] implemented in Matlab and run in parallel on high-performance supercomputers at Monash University (see Methods for details). Model simulations using the optimal parameter values successfully recapitulated the observed network dynamics demonstrated by the strong agreement between model simulations and quantified data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g001">Fig 1C–1T</xref>), as well as by a quantitative assessment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s005">S2 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s001">S1 Text</xref>). The fitted model also accurately captured the intricate detail involving the biphasic dynamics of EGF-induced c-Met expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). Moreover, additional independent simulations have further validated the model’s predictive capability. Specifically, simulation results of constitutive STAT3 activation qualitatively recapitulated the corresponding experiment data not used in training (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s004">S1C and S1D Fig</xref>). Together, these analyses demonstrate that the model is predictive and could be used to make new predictions.</p>

<title>Identification and predictive ranking of synergistic drug combinations</title>
<p>While synergistic drug combinations have been identified for different cancers, most combinations rely on empirical observations or expensive drug or siRNA/shRNA/CRISPR based screens that lack mechanistic anchoring and scalability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref031">31</xref>]. As our calibrated EGFR-cMET-PYK2 model recapitulated the experimental data, we asked whether it can identify and prioritize synergistic drug combinations.</p>
<p>To this end, we considered EGFR, PYK2, c-Met and STAT3 as four potential targets with associated small-molecule inhibitors: Gefitinib, PF396, EMD and Stattic, respectively, and six different pair-wise combinations between them: Gefitinib+PF396, Gefitinib+Stattic, Gefitinib+EMD, PF396+EMD, PF396+Stattic and Stattic+EMD. To analyse the effects of these drug combinations on cell signalling, we simulated the steady-state levels of pERK and pSTAT3 in response to the individual drugs alone or in combinations, at their corresponding IC<sub>25</sub> levels. IC<sub>X</sub> is defined as the concentration at which a drug inhibits a signalling output (e.g. pERK/pSTAT3) by X% (X = 0–100) compared to the untreated condition (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s006">S3 Fig</xref>). Model simulations showed that while single-drug treatments only modestly suppressed pERK/pSTAT3, the combined treatments produced greater-than-additive effects for co-inhibition of EGFR-PYK2 or EGFR-c-Met, while this is much less pronounced for co-inhibition of c-Met-STAT3 or PYK2-STAT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). Similar simulations were also observed when we varied the applied drug concentrations by using different IC values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s007">S4 Fig</xref>), showing their consistency. Together, these simulations predicted varying levels of efficacy for different drug combinations, among which co-inhibition of EGFR and PYK2 and EGFR and c-Met seemed to yield effects significantly better than additive.</p>

</fig>
<p>However, greater-than-additive effects do not necessarily indicate drug synergy. Thus, to systematically and quantitatively evaluate the level of synergism of the considered drug pairs, we employed different methods to calculate the levels of drug synergy (Chou-Talalay’s Combination Index, (CI score) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref032">32</xref>], Bliss Independence (BI score) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref033">33</xref>] and Coefficient of Drug Interaction (CDI score) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref034">34</xref>], see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec017">Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s002">S2 Text</xref> for details). Synergy scores &lt;1, = 1 or &gt;1 indicate synergistic, additive or antagonistic effects, respectively; with the magnitude of synergism/antagonism signified by how much smaller/larger they are compared to 1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, our model predicted a strong synergy between Gefitinib and PF396 or EMD, indicated by the CI scores much less than 1 for both pERK and pSTAT3 as outputs. In contrast, the CI scores for the combinations EMD-Stattic and PF396-Stattic are marginally different to 1 for both pERK and pSTAT3, indicating these drug pairs are unlikely to yield synergistic effects. In addition, co-targeting EGFR-STAT3 (by Gefitinib+Stattic) was predicted to be mostly additive, while co-targeting c-Met-PYK2 (by EMD+PF396) was slightly synergistic, which is more pronounced for pERK than pSTAT3. Importantly, these simulations were consistent between different synergy computational methods (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s009">S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s010">S7</xref> Figs for BI and CDI scores). As pERK and pSTAT3 are major regulators of cell growth and survival, our simulations collectively led us to hypothesize that drug combinations that co-target EGFR-PYK2, EGFR-c-Met or PYK2-c-Met may yield synergistic effects in inhibiting TNBC growth, while those co-targeting STAT3 with either c-Met or PYK2 are unlikely to induce synergy.</p>
<p>To experimentally validate model predictions, we exposed TNBC MDA-MB-468 cells to increasing levels of Gefitinib, PF396, EMD, and Stattic in six combinations, and measured the effects on cell viability using the MTT assay and colony formation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s011">S8 Fig</xref>). To mitigate possible off-target effects (e.g. PF396 is known to also inhibit FAK), we aimed to use minimal drug concentrations sufficient to suppress downstream signalling. The combination index values (CI) were then calculated (CompuSyn software, CompuSyn. Inc) and synergistic (CI &lt; 1), additive (CI = 1), and antagonistic (CI &gt; 1) effects were defined.</p>
<p>As shown, the experimental data supported our predictions, and indicate that Gefitinib+PF396 was the most synergistic combination, followed by Gefitinib+EMD and Gefitinib+Stattic, whereas combined treatments of EMD+Stattic and PF396+Stattic did not show synergistic effects but mildly antagonistic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>). Consistent with these results, we have recently showed that co-targeting of EGFR and PYK2 substantially reduced the growth of basal-like TNBC cells both in vitro and in animal models, and further showed that this drug combination is more potent than dual inhibition of EGFR and c-Met [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref012">12</xref>]. Taken together, these results suggest that our model not only accurately predicted synergistic drug combinations, but also correctly prioritized and ranked them according their efficacy, and thus, could be applied for selecting best drug combinations for clinical testing.</p>

<title>Model-based analysis of dynamic network response to drug treatments</title>
<p>Although the above drug combinations had synergistic effects, it was unclear why the steady-state activities of ERK and STAT3 were only marginally suppressed by single-drug treatments but markedly reduced by the combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). To investigate this we focused on EGFR-PYK2 co-targeting, and utilized the model to simulate the time-dependent signalling responses to EGF stimuli in the absence or presence of Gefitinib, PF396 or both. Interestingly, model simulations showed that although ERK activity was rapidly inhibited by Gefitinib as a single-drug treatment, the inhibition was transient and pERK bounced back at 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The combined Gefitinib + PF396 treatment, however, abolished this late pERK recovery. Moreover, simulations showed that Gefitinib have similar bounce-back effects on pSTAT3, albeit the latency time caused by single-drug treatment (duration of brief suppression) were slightly different to that of pERK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Similarly, model simulations suggest that single-drug treatment with PF396 alone did not efficiently suppress pERK/pSTAT3 compared to the combination, inducing a slight recovery of pERK at 24 hr and a transient response in pSTAT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>To validate these predictions, we stimulated MDA-MB-468 cells with EGF in the absence or presence of Gefitinib, PF396 or both, and assessed the protein and phosphorylation levels of the key signalling nodes of the EGFR-c-Met-PYK2 network over 24 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s013">S10A and S10B Fig</xref>). Active EGFR and PYK2 phosphorylations were strongly inhibited under Gefitinib (1μM) and PF396 (4μM) treatment, respectively, indicating these drugs acted on the desired targets (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s014">S11 Fig</xref>). Consistent with model simulations, the experimental data indeed reproduced the predicted late bounce back of both pERK and pSTAT3 in response to Gefitinib treatment alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, 2<sup>nd</sup> column), but not to the combined treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, right column). The drug combination markedly outperformed both drugs as single-agent treatment in long-term suppression of ERK/STAT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g003">Fig 3F and 3G</xref>), consistent with model predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>). Moreover, PF396 treatment alone did not significantly affect ERK activity, and induced a transient response of pSTAT3 which is in accordance with previous simulations. Interestingly, further simulations predicted that the dynamic patterns of ERK and STAT response depend on PF396 dosage, with late bounce back of pERK appearing at lower PF396 concentration, accompanying a disappearance of the transient pSTAT3 response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s013">S10C and S10D Fig</xref>). Treating MDA-MB-468 cells with a lower PF396 concentration indeed confirmed these predictions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s013">S10E–S10G Fig</xref>). Together, these simulations and experimental data suggest that Gefitinib and PF396 as single agents failed to induce durable inhibition of ERK/STAT3 activation, while their co-treatment blocked the late bounce back of these oncogenic signals, and thus resulting in synergistic effects.</p>
<p>To assess the contribution of feedback loops to monotherapy treatment and the associated late response of pERK/pSTAT3 re-activation, we systematically perturbed each feedback loop (F1-F4) <italic>in silico</italic>. Interestingly, the late pERK response induced by Gefitinib was controlled by the PYK2-STAT3-c-Met positive feedback loop (F3/F4), while F1 and F2 had relatively minor influence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g003">Fig 3H</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g003">Fig 3L</xref>). In contrast, feedback perturbations did not seem to significantly affect the magnitude of the PF396-induced ERK response as well as its latency time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g003">Fig 3I and 3M</xref>). For pSTAT3 as a readout, F2/F3/F4 significantly regulate its late response caused by both Gefitinib and PF396, while F1 had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g003">Fig 3J and 3K</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g003">Fig 3N and 3O</xref>). These results suggest that EGFR inhibition in combination with interference of the PYK2-c-Met positive feedback loop (F3/F4) and thus PYK2 or c-Met inhibition, synergistically block ERK activation, as we predicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g002">Fig 2C</xref>) and supported by experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, these results demonstrate the power of our kinetic model in precisely predicting the time-dependent responses of network dynamics to drug treatments. The model-based analyses helped to identify the dynamic molecular features that underlie the re-activation of survival signals and to prioritize synergistic combinations.</p>

<title>Switch-like signalling and phenotypic switches mediate drugs synergy</title>
<p>Simulations of our calibrated model showed that pERK/pSTAT3 responded in a switch-like manner to increasing concentrations of EGF or HGF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s012">S9 Fig</xref>). As switch-like responses are often emerged from a combination of positive and negative feedback regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref036">36</xref>], we examined the possible link between the degree of switch-like response and drugs synergy in our model system. Simulation of the 3-dimensional (3D) dose-responses of pERK/STAT3 to increasing concentrations of individual drugs using the six drug pairs applied earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s015">S12 Fig</xref>), clearly showed a highly switch-like response landscapes of both pERK and pSTAT3 to concurrent changes of Gefitinib and PF396 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). As shown, each individual drug (blue dot) slightly inhibited the signal outputs compared to control (black dot), while intermediate doses of the combined drugs dramatically pushed the output toward the bottom of this steep landscape (red dot), generating a cooperative effect. Importantly, the three other predicted synergistic combinations: Gefitinib + PF396, Gefitinib + EMD and Gefitinib + Stattic, but not the non-synergistic combinations (PF396 + EMD, Stattic + EMD, PF396 + Stattic; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s015">S12 Fig</xref>), also displayed switch-like responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s015">S12 Fig</xref>) for the two signalling output pERK and pSTAT3.

<p>Importantly, we confirmed these switch-like responses also by 2D dose-response simulations of Gefitinib and PF396 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g004">Fig 4D and 4E</xref>). In addition, these simulations suggest that pSTAT3 is more sensitive to both drugs than pERK, indicated by a shift to the left of its dose-response curves (blue vs red, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g004">Fig 4D and 4E</xref>). To verify these predictions, we exposed MDA-MB-468 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g004">Fig 4C and 4H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g004">4I</xref>) and BT-20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g004">Fig 4J and 4K</xref>) cells to increasing concentrations of either Gefitinib or PF396 and assessed their impact on ERK and STAT3 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) and on cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g004">Fig 4H–4K</xref>). As shown, pERK and pSTAT3 responded in a switch-like fashion to increasing Gefitinib, being high at low doses but jumping to significantly lower levels at higher doses of Gefitinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). pSTAT3 was more sensitive to both drugs compared to pERK as correctly predicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g004">Fig 4D and 4E</xref>). Furthermore, the switches detected at the signalling level were also translated into switch-like behaviour at the cell growth level in both TNBC cell lines; further demonstrating the power of our predicted modelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g004">Fig 4H and 4J</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Further model simulations predicted that Gefitinib can sensitize the cells to PF396 and vice versa, as evident by a left shift in the dose-response curves and the lower IC50 values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s016">S13A–S13C Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s016">S13G–S13I Fig</xref>). These predictions were confirmed by experimental data demonstrating that Gefitinib treatment indeed sensitized TNBC cells to PF396 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s016">S13D and S13E</xref> Fig, red vs. blue curves), and reduced the IC50 of PF396 in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s016">S13F Fig</xref>). Similarly, knockdown of PYK2 by shRNA markedly sensitized MDA-MB-468 and BT-20 to Gefitinib (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s016">S13J–S13L Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, our combined analysis revealed a switch-like pattern as a feature of the steady-state response profiles of the EGFR-PYK2-c-Met network, and further demonstrated the link between cell proliferation-associated switch-like response and drug synergy, implying that a similar response pattern in other signalling networks could be used to predict drugs synergy.</p>

<p>Switch-like dose-response curves can be quantitatively characterized by fitting the curves to a Hill function where the Hill coefficient and IC50 value signify the curve steepness (sigmoidality) and the sensitivity to the inhibiting drugs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g005">Fig 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s017">S14 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref038">38</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec017">Methods</xref> for details). Interestingly, proportionally equal perturbations of the feedback loops did not result in equivalent changes in the dose-response profiles. F4 exerted strongest control as its disruption significantly shifted these curves to the left with reduced sigmoidality, as evidenced by lower IC50 and Hill coefficient values, particularly for pSTAT3 as output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g005">Fig 5D–5K</xref>). This suggests F4 strongly promotes the switch-like response of STAT3 to both Gefitinib and PF396. Conversely, F1 was found to have little impact on all dose-response curves, indicating this feedback plays a minor role in shaping these switches. In addition, we found the pSTAT3 switches are also sensitive to F2 blockage, while the pERK switches are slightly sensitive to F3 disruption instead.</p>
<p>Next, we asked if these feedback links influence the synergy between Gefitinib and PF396. Thus we re-evaluated the synergy indexes (BI and CDI values) with respect to pERK and pSTAT3 under similar feedback perturbations. Shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g005">Fig 5L–5O</xref>, disruption of F2 and particularly F4 dramatically increased the BI/CDI values for both signalling outputs, suggesting these links strongly promote the drugs’ synergistic effect. Together, these results reveal F4 as a key feedback link that promotes both switch-like behaviour and drug synergy, further supporting a connection between these entities.</p>

<title>Model-based stratification of patients identifies subgroups benefiting from combinatorial therapies</title>
<p>We next exploited our model to predictively stratify TNBC patients into subgroups who may or may not benefit from a certain drug combination, focusing on the EGFR-PYK2 co-inhibition as an example. To this end, we developed a general computational pipeline to generate patient-specific models using patient data, and compute the level of predicted synergy towards a chosen drug combination in each patient using their corresponding model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Sorting the patients by the predicted synergy levels allows us to group them into subgroups displaying different levels of response to the combination, thereby stratifying the patients. Furthermore, differential expression analysis across these subgroups enables the identification of potential molecular patterns that differentially characterize these subgroups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g006">Fig 6</xref>, right).</p>

<title>A computational analysis pipeline for patient stratification.</title>
<p>The pipeline consists of 3 phases. TNBC patient samples (e.g. from TCGA) are subclassified into subgroups based on Vanderbilt subtyping (left panel). The sample data is normalized by the median value of the BL subtype (see text for details), which is then incorporated in the network model to generate patient-specific network models (middle panel). Simulations using patient specific models predict synergic effect by Gefitinib plus PF396 co-treatment. Patients are sorted according to the predicted synergy (right panel). Subgroups comprising highly synergistic (Q1) and non-synergistic patients (Q2) (i.e., low and high BI/CDI) are identified. Differential expression analysis is conducted to identify molecular patterns (biomarkers) that characterize these subgroups.</p>

<p>We first obtained protein and gene expression data from a TNBC cohort (called the ‘discovery cohort’) containing 108 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref039">39</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec017">Materials &amp; Methods</xref> for details). Using the Vanderbilt-based subtyping system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref040">40</xref>], the patients were classified into different subgroups: Basal-Like (BL1/2), Mesenchymal (M), Luminal Androgen Receptor (LAR), and unclassified (UNC). Examining the mutation profiles of these patients showed that the patient heterogeneity primarily comes from variation in expression levels of the network nodes rather than point mutation events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s029">S6 Table</xref>). As our model was constructed based on the MDA-MB-468 cell line previously aligned to the Basal-Like (BL1) TNBC subtype (18), expression data from each patient was normalised by the median values of the BL1 patient subgroup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g006">Fig 6</xref>, left). This normalisation step allowed us to tailor the cell-based model for each patient by adjusting the expression levels of the model species according to the normalised fold change. For instance, if a patient displays a two-fold increase in EGFR expression, then the EGFR abundance is doubled in the model describing that patient. This procedure was followed for all the model components resulting in 108 personalized kinetic models of the EGFR-PYK2-c-Met network (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec017">Materials &amp; Methods</xref> for more details). Note that an alternative normalisation strategy where we normalised all the patients against a patient whose expression profile most closely resembles that of the MDA-MB-468 cell line did not change the results’ main conclusions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s021">S18</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s022">S19</xref> Figs). Using these patient-specific models, we next computed the predicted synergy levels of the Gefitinib+PF396 combination using the BI scores for each patient, which were then used to rank the patients, allowing identification of patient subgroups with different susceptibility to the co-treatment. To enhance the prediction accuracy of drug synergy, we excluded patients who did not respond at all to either drug when treated alone as informed by simulations.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g007">Fig 7</xref>, the network nodes exhibit highly heterogeneous expression patterns across different TNBC subtypes within the discovery cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g007">Fig 7A and 7C</xref>, top, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s021">S18 Fig</xref>). Interestingly, computation of the drug synergy index showed that patients displaying potent or weak synergistic effects towards ERK (or STAT3) inhibition were found in all subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g007">Fig 7A and 7C</xref>, bottom &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s022">S19 Fig</xref>). Moreover, the synergy index did not show any significant statistical differences between the subtypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s019">S16 Fig</xref>), suggesting classical TNBC subtypes may not be sufficient to predict the synergy of the Gefitinib+PF396 co-treatment. Next, we sorted the patients by the synergy index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g007">Fig 7B</xref> for pERK as output and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g007">Fig 7D</xref> for pSTAT3) and identified a highly ‘synergistic subgroup’ (termed Q1) and a ‘non-synergistic subgroup’ (Q3), containing patients having the synergy index values &lt; the lower quartile and &gt; the upper quartile, respectively. Differential expression analysis revealed that PYK2 was significantly upregulated in Q1 compared to Q3, which were consistent for both pERK and pSTAT3 as outputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g007">Fig 7E and 7F</xref>). To validate these findings, we additionally performed the patient stratification analysis on a second, independent patient cohort (‘validation cohort’, described in Materials &amp; Methods). Consistent with the discovery cohort, model simulations predicted PYK2 is significantly upregulated in the synergistic patient group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s020">S17 Fig</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that upregulation of PYK2 could serve as indicators of susceptibility to treatments co-targeting EGFR-PYK2.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Kinases are the largest class of cancer therapeutic targets, yet most tumours can escape from the inhibition of any single kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref015">15</xref>]. Although combination therapies targeting multiple kinases have become necessary to effectively combat cancer, it remains a major challenge to identify the best combinations and most susceptible patients for clinical testing. However, drug combination identification based on experimental screening techniques remains costly and often identify only small numbers of synergistic combinations, which motivates development of alternative computational approaches for the task. Notably, an open challenge was recently launched by the DREAM consortium to computationally predict pair-wise drug synergy in human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref041">41</xref>], resulting in over 30 community-generated algorithms, several of which performed significantly better than random guessing. Most were statistical methods but an ODE-based kinetic modeling approach was also proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref041">41</xref>]. While the accuracy of the predictions were suboptimal, these efforts strongly demonstrate that computational prediction of drug synergy is feasible and can be useful in advancing the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Here, we address the same challenge by employing a systems approach that integrates mechanistic kinetic modelling with experimental validation in an iterative manner. Focusing on the EGFR-PYK2-c-Met interaction network in TNBC as a model system, we demonstrated the significant potential of this integrative approach in the rational identification and prioritization of synergistic drug combinations, as well as predictive stratification of patients for optimal benefit from these combinations. The strength of this approach further lies in its flexibility and scalability where the presented principles and computational frameworks could be reused and adapted to investigate similar questions in other systems and/or other tumour types beyond TNBC.</p>
<p>Model predictions validated by in vitro experimental data showed that EGFR-PYK2 co-targeting yields most synergistic effect in basal-like TNBC cell lines among other possible combinations, followed by EGFR-c-Met co-targeting. Indeed, previous studies suggest that combined targeting of both EGFR and c-Met receptors could be an effective therapeutic strategy for TNBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref042">42</xref>], and have reported in vivo data supporting synergy in co-inhibition of EGFR-c-Met [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref043">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref045">45</xref>]. In addition, our recent results further demonstrated the potent synergistic effect of EGFR and PYK2/FAK co-targeting on basal-like TNBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref012">12</xref>]. While these experimental data were obtained both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> using TNBC cell lines and xenograft mouse models, respectively, the systems approach described here, using a quantitative modelling of EGFR-PYK2-c-Met interaction network in TNBC, precisely predicted the outcome results and the obtained synergistic effects of the combined treatments. Not only our model-based analysis could identify highly synergistic target combinations, we also uncovered non-synergistic (antagonistic) combinations for TNBC, such as c-Met-STAT3 or PYK2-STAT3 co-targeting, that is also valuable in informing subsequent studies. While EGFR-PYK2 co-targeting was identified to be synergistic in TNBC, PYK2 may have a larger role in coordinating EGFR and c-MET signalling depending on the cancer types, evident by data showing PYK2 activation was not affected by Gefitinib in lung cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref046">46</xref>]. Thus, the presence of drug synergy may be context specific and therefore should be treated accordingly.</p>
<p>Although effective drug combinations are being identified in many cancers, most resulted from empirical observations and/or expensive experimental screens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref031">31</xref>] that frequently lack mechanistic anchoring, making it difficult to predict if the identified combinations may work in different biological contexts (and so patients). This issue is similarly faced by machine-learning or statistical based computational approaches aimed to predict effective drug combinations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref047">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref049">49</xref>]. In contrast, our modelling captures the mechanistic details contained within the interaction network under study. Thus, it allowed us to link the molecular and dynamic network features with observed drug synergy. Indeed, time-dependent simulations backed up by experiments helped reveal that while inhibition of EGFR or PYK2 alone (by Gefitinib or PF396, respectively) only temporarily suppressed the activities of ERK/STAT3 which were subsequently restored to basal levels; this activity recovery was abolished by the combined treatment. This finding suggests that knowledge of drug synergy could be gained by understanding and exploiting the dynamic behaviour of signalling networks. We further found that the signalling and phenotypic switches mediated primarily by the positive feedbacks within the EGFR-PYK2-c-Met network contributed to the synergistic effects between Gefitinib and PF396. Importantly, feedback perturbation analysis unveiled that the PYK2-controlled feedback loops play crucial roles in mediating the signal restoration of ERK and STAT3. This analysis also helped pinpoint the PYK2-c-Met positive feedback loops as a critical regulator of the switches as well as drug synergy. These findings highlight the utilities of our mechanistic model in elucidating a systems-level understanding of drug-induced network dynamics and mechanisms that underlie monotherapy resistance as well as synergistic effects by drug combination.</p>
<p>The heterogeneous nature of TNBC is thought to underlie the sporadic and low response rates to targeted agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref051">51</xref>]. However, effective strategy in order to improve patient stratification is strongly lacking. While the expression or mutation status of the drug targets can inform drug response, these are not always sufficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref052">52</xref>] particularly in the context of multi-target inhibition, possibly because these biomarkers do not capture the mechanistic connection between the targets. We provided a proof-of-concept demonstration of the prognostic significance of our modelling by showing its ability in stratifying patients into subgroups exhibiting different susceptibility for a certain combination treatment through generation of patient-specific models utilizing patient-specific data. As an example, this enabled prediction of two patient subgroups, one highly susceptible to EGFR-PYK2 co-targeting and one least likely to benefit from the same combination. Importantly, differential expression analysis revealed upregulation of PYK2 was particularly enriched in the highly responsive subgroup, consistent between two independent patient cohorts analysed. Interestingly, upregulation of EGFR was not predicted to be significantly enriched in this group, however this finding was not surprising given that high EGFR expression is not always predictive of sensitivity to EGFR-directed inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref053">53</xref>]. These results support the notion that network-based biomarkers, rather than expression of the drug target, could offer better sensitivity indicator for drugs co-targeting. While the patient stratification analyses here were mainly focused on the EGFR-PYK2 co-inhibition, the patient-specific models could be utilised to discover new drug combinations in each patient for personalized therapies. Moreover, as our models were primarily kinases based, future availability of high-resolution proteomic data from patients instead of transcriptomic data would potentially further enhance model predictability.</p>
<p>In summary, our systems modelling presents a powerful and highly adaptable approach for the rational design and predictive prioritization of combinatorial therapies in an individualized manner, providing a concrete step towards personalized treatment for TNBC and other cancers. Given the space of possible drug combinations is vast while clinical trials are slow and costly, this predictive approach opens exciting avenues for drug repurposing and quick translation of combination therapies into the clinic.</p>

<title>Implementation</title>
<p>The mathematical model was formulated using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and implemented in MATLAB (The MathWorks. Inc. 2016b). The model is also available in the standard SMBL format as part of this paper. All model simulations and analyses were performed using MATLAB. The ODE system was integrated and solved using the <italic>ode15s</italic> function in MATLAB, which is a variable-step and variable-order solver based on the numerical differentiation formulas (NDFs), and is specially designed for stiff systems.</p>

<title>Calibration</title>
<p>MATLAB’s Global Optimization toolbox was employed for model calibration and parameter estimation (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s001">S1 Text</xref> for details). Specifically, a genetic algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref027">27</xref>] was used to find the optimal model parameter values that minimize the discrepancy between model simulations and the training datasets, by minimizing the following aggregated objective function:

<p>Genetic algorithms are powerful methods to solve both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems based on a natural selection process that mimics biological evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref059">59</xref>]. The algorithm repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions. At each step, the genetic algorithm creates new individuals using crossover and mutation as well as selection of best individuals from the current population, and uses them as parents to produce the offspring for the next generation. Over successive generations, the population ‘evolves’ toward an optimal solution. Model fitting (parameter estimation) was performed using high-performance computing facilities at Monash University (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.monash.edu/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.monash.edu</ext-link>), consisting of two Haswell CPU sockets with a total of 16 physical cores (or 32 hyperthreaded cores) at 3.20 GHz and 300 TB usable storage.</p>

<title>Patient-specific models</title>
<p>Detailed description of patient-specific model generation is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s003">S3 Text</xref>. Patient-derived expression data (combining RPPA and RNA-seq based expression data) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was used as inputs to tailor the cell-based model for each patient and generate the patient-specific models. For instance, if a patient displays a two-fold increase in EGFR expression, then the EGFR abundance is doubled in the model describing that patient. This procedure was followed for all the model components. For components that are not conserved (i.e. subject to synthesis/degradation) including PYK2 and c-Met, their mRNA levels were adjusted by modifying the corresponding kinetic parameter (synthetic and degradation rates) values (<italic>Vs5</italic> and <italic>kdeg6</italic> for PYK2 mRNA, and <italic>Vs13</italic> and <italic>kdeg14</italic> for c-Met mRNA) based on implicit reverse functions such that these mRNA levels reflect the fold change of gene expression in each patient (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s023">S20 Fig</xref>). The form of these functions: <italic>Y = f(ks</italic>,<italic>kd)</italic> (where <italic>Y</italic>, <italic>ks</italic> and <italic>kd</italic> denote the mRNA level, synthetic and degradation rate, respectively) was obtained numerically through model simulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s023">S20 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Data acquisition and processing for the patient stratification</title>
<p>A discovery patient cohort and an independent validation cohort were used for the patient stratification analyses. The former was obtained from The Broad Institute TCGA GDAC Firehose (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gdac.broadinstitute.org/" xlink:type="simple">gdac.broadinstitute.org</ext-link>), containing 108 patients with both patient-specific transcriptomic (RNA-seq) and proteomic (Reverse Phase Protein Array, RPPA) data for some proteins. As RPPA data was not available for all network nodes (state variables), RPPA data for selected nodes (EGFR, ERK and STAT3) were used in combination with gene expression data for the remaining nodes (PYK2, c-Met and CBL). The discovery cohort data (N = 108) was subclassified into different subtypes (Basal-Like1 (BL1, 34), Mesenchymal (M, 34), Luminal Androgen Receptor (LAR, 26), and unclassified (UNC, 1)) using the Vanderbilt subtyping system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref040">40</xref>]. The independent cohort for validation was obtained from the European-Genome Phenome Archive (accession number EGAS00001001178) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref060">60</xref>], consisting of 75 TNBC patient samples that were further subclassified into different subtypes (Basal-like 1 (BL1, 8), Basal-like 2 (BL2, 5), Immunomodulatory (IM, 16), mesenchymal stem-like (MSL, 6), Mesenchymal (M, 17), Luminal Androgen Receptor (LAR, 2), unspecified (UNS, 10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref040">40</xref>].

<title>Reported mutations related to the EGFR-PYK2-cMET network within the discovery patient cohort.</title>
<p>Out of 108 TNBC patients with available mutation information, we identified 10 patients who have reported mutations in any of the network nodes. Specifically, four patients contain EGFR mutations, two contain PYK2 mutations, another two contain STAT3 mutations, and Met and Cbl mutation were found in one single patient. The most common mutation types are SNP. However, searching for these mutations in the COSMIC mutation catalogue (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic" xlink:type="simple">http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic</ext-link>), the most comprehensive mutation database currently available, we found mostly no functional effects (i.e. GOF or LOF) reported for these genetic changes, except that STAT3 H410R (indicated by an asterisk) is associated with induction of STAT3 phosphorylation and SOCS3, CCL2, JUNB and BCL3 upregulation in large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006192.ref061">61</xref>]. Therefore, within the EGFR-PYK2-cMET network, the majority of the considered TNBC patients displayed no functionally significant mutation events. Rather, the heterogeneity of the patient landscape primarily comes from alteration in expression levels.</p>
