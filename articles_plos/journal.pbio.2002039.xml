<abstract>
<p>Growing cells are subject to cycles of nutrient depletion and repletion. A shortage of nutrients activates a starvation program that promotes growth in limiting conditions. To examine whether nutrient-deprived cells prepare also for their subsequent recovery, we followed the transcription program activated in budding yeast transferred to low-phosphate media and defined its contribution to cell growth during phosphate limitation and upon recovery. An initial transcription wave was induced by moderate phosphate depletion that did not affect cell growth. A second transcription wave followed when phosphate became growth limiting. The starvation program contributed to growth only in the second, growth-limiting phase. Notably, the early response, activated at moderate depletion, promoted recovery from starvation by increasing phosphate influx upon transfer to rich medium. Our results suggest that cells subject to nutrient depletion prepare not only for growth in the limiting conditions but also for their predicted recovery once nutrients are replenished.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Cells must have sufficient nutrients in order to perform their different functions. This becomes particularly critical when the nutrient composition in their environment changes. To accommodate such changes, cells have evolved specialized adaptation pathways that sense the nutrients available in their surrounding and adapt their gene expression and protein functions accordingly. It is typically assumed that these different starvation pathways have been optimized to enable growth in conditions in which nutrients are limiting. We reasoned, however, that since starvation periods are necessarily followed by nutrient retrieval, the starvation response may further function to optimize the recovery from starvation once nutrients are replenished. In the present study, we show that this is indeed the case for the well-studied phosphate starvation pathway in budding yeast. Using a combination of transcription profiling and high-resolution competition assays, we have characterized, at high temporal resolution, the growth-fitness advantage cells gain from activation of the phosphate starvation program when they enter into starvation and also when they exit starvation when nutrient is replenished. We find that the cells activate the starvation program in 2 temporal waves. The first wave is activated at intermediate depletion that is not yet limiting for growth, while the second wave is activated when phosphate becomes limiting. Of note, we provide evidence that the early response promoted recovery from starvation by increasing phosphate influx. Our results corroborate the notion that cells have evolved not only to optimize their instantaneous growth but also to prepare for future, predicted challenges.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Growing cells require an influx of nutrients from their environment to sustain metabolic activity. Depletion of essential nutrients arrests cell growth until the nutrients are replenished [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref001">1</xref>]. Prior to this arrest, a starvation program that regulates the expression and activity of multiple genes and proteins is activated. This starvation program increases the level of internal nutrient, e.g., by expressing high-affinity transport, mobilizing stored nutrients, or scavenging the limiting nutrient from internal or external sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref002">2</xref>]. This starvation program does not eliminate growth arrest but only delays its onset: a growing population will still deplete the available nutrient and arrest, but this arrest will be postponed by a limited number of generations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Once the depleted nutrient is replenished, cells reenter the cell cycle and begin to proliferate. Return to growth is not immediate but follows a lag time during which cells adjust to the rich medium. Since growth is exponential, minimizing the lag time would provide cells with a significant competitive advantage. Indeed, subjecting cells to continuous cycles of nutrient depletion and replenishment selects for cells with accelerated recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>We hypothesized that the starvation program activated when nutrients are depleted prepares cells not only for growth in the limiting environment but also for their subsequent recovery once nutrients are replenished. To examine this hypothesis, we focused on the phosphate starvation program in budding yeast, whose molecular basis has been characterized in detail. Cells transferred to a medium containing low phosphate induce dozens of genes. Those genes regulate intracellular phosphate levels by enabling high-affinity phosphate transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref008">8</xref>], phosphate mobilization in and out of vacuolar storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref010">10</xref>], and phosphate scavenging from different intra- and extracellular sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref014">14</xref>]. Induction of all phosphate-responsive genes depends on the transcription factor Pho4. When intracellular phosphate levels are reduced, Pho4 is dephosphorylated and enters the nucleus to activate its target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref019">19</xref>].</p>

<title>Two-wave induction of the phosphate starvation response.</title>
<p>(A) Schematic illustration of the phosphate starvation response: Reduction in internal phosphate leads to the nuclear localization of the transcription factor Pho4 and the induction of its target genes. Genes induced by Pho4 include high-affinity transporters (e.g., <italic>PHO84</italic>) and an inhibitor of low-affinity transporters (<italic>SPL2</italic>), genes involved in phosphate mobilization in and out of vacuole storage as PolyP (e.g., <italic>PHM3</italic>), and phosphatases, which scavenge phosphate from molecules inside or outside the cell. (B) Cells grow for a limited number of generations following transfer to media containing different low phosphate levels: Shown is the temporal increase in cellular density (measured by optical density [OD]) following transfer to low-phosphate media, as indicated (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and methods</xref>). The data are the mean and standard error of 2 replicates. (C–D) Sequential induction of the phosphate transcription response: Wild-type (WT) cells were transferred from rich medium into media containing the indicated low Pi level and followed for 24.7 hours (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and methods</xref>). Samples for RNA sequencing were taken at the indicated time points. Shown in (C) is the log<sub>2</sub>(expression) change in Pho4-target genes, stress response genes (Stress), and genes coding for ribosomal proteins (Protein Synthesis), as defined in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref020">20</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s009">S2 Data</xref>). Data were normalized as described in the Materials and methods, and values under detectable levels (not a number [NaN]) are depicted in grey. Vertical lines indicate the second transcription wave, as defined by clustering (using k-means) of the Pearson correlation matrix, shown in (D). Note that when transferred to 0.06 mM Pi, cells transiently induced the second wave approximately 3–4.5 hours following the transfer, followed by a stable induction at approximately 7 hours after the transfer. This transient induction is likely due to the double-feedback design of the system, as we showed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref021">21</xref>]. The reduction in growth rate (see E–F below) is observed already with first induction of the second transcription wave. The data in (C–D) are from 1 replicate. Additional biological (and experimental) replicates for growth in 0.06 mM and 0.2 mM Pi are found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g003">Fig 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s001">S1C Fig</xref>, respectively, and for 0 mM Pi, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref021">21</xref>]. For further supporting data for (C), see (E). See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref> for definition of Pho4-target genes. (E–F) Phosphate becomes growth limiting concomitant with the induction of the second transcription wave: The PHO84p-Venus reporter is up-regulated following transfer of cells to low-phosphate media, as indicated (E). The cell growth rate was calculated by the logarithmic slope of the OD curve, shown in (B), and is plotted as a function of reporter expression (F). To control for density-dependent effects, the growth rate was normalized by that of cells transferred to rich phosphate medium (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and methods</xref>). The data in (E–F) are the mean and standard error of 2 replicates. Note that growth rate begins to decrease when the PHO84p-Venus reporter crosses a given threshold, independently of the incubating conditions. This crossing of the activation threshold coincides with the time at which the second transcription wave is induced, as defined by clustering (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s001">S1E Fig</xref>). See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s001">S1D Fig</xref> for the normalized growth rate as a function of time.

<p>We previously suggested that the phosphate starvation program promotes not only growth in phosphate-limiting conditions but also recovery from starvation, based on our analysis of cells that constitutively express <italic>PHO84</italic>, the high-affinity phosphate transporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref022">22</xref>]. When transferred to media containing low phosphate levels, the <italic>PHO84</italic>-constitutive cells induced the starvation program with a delay relative to wild-type cells, and when transferred back to rich media, these cells showed a longer lag time and were outcompeted by wild-type cells. Notably, the impaired recovery was rescued by partially activating Pho4 also in nonstarving cells, suggesting that optimal recovery depends on the proper, early induction of the starvation program, as seen in wild-type cells. Still, the contribution of the phosphate starvation program to cell growth has not been measured directly.</p>
<p>In this study, we set to quantify the contribution of the phosphate starvation program to cell growth in limited phosphate and upon recovery from starvation. We reasoned that this contribution may depend on the kinetics by which phosphate is depleted. In particular, gradual depletion of phosphate may provide cells with enough time to prepare for the upcoming limitation, activating the starvation program before arresting cell growth. We therefore considered different kinetics of phosphate depletion and followed, at high temporal resolution, the gene expression and growth rate of wild-type cells and of mutant cells that do not properly activate the starvation program. We find that cells activate the starvation program sequentially: the first activation wave is seen when phosphate is only partially depleted and before cell growth is reduced. This phase may serve as a preparation period, as deleting <italic>PHO4</italic> does not affect cell growth at this phase. This initial activation is followed by a second wave of expression, observed at the time when cell growth begins to slow down. At this stage, deletion of <italic>PHO4</italic> further reduces growth rate. Notably, we show that the early transcription wave contributes to the recovery from starvation by increasing phosphate influx once nutrients are replenished. We propose that cellular signaling is tuned not only for optimizing instantaneous cell growth but also for preparing cells for predictable future needs.</p>

<title>A 2-step induction of the phosphate starvation response during growth in low-phosphate media</title>
<p>The phosphate starvation program in budding yeast is activated when intracellular phosphate levels are reduced. The kinetics by which the starvation program is activated therefore depends on the rate by which internal phosphate is depleted. To monitor different kinetics of phosphate depletion, we inoculated cells in media containing different low-phosphate levels, ranging from 0 mM to 0.5 mM of inorganic phosphate (Pi). Cells incubated in these media grew for a different number of generations, ranging from approximately 8 generations when incubated to 0.5 mM Pi to only approximately 3.5 generations when incubated in medium lacking phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>We measured the growth rate of the cells following their transfer to the low-phosphate media and profiled their transcription response at multiple time points following the transfer, as indicated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). To examine the starvation program, we first focused on the induction of Pho4-target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>). Pho4-targets were defined by comparing gene expression in cells lacking <italic>PHO4</italic> to that in cells that express a constitutive strong <italic>PHO4</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and methods</xref>) and were consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s001">S1A Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref019">19</xref>]. As expected, the starvation program was induced with different temporal kinetics, depending on the phosphate level in the inoculation medium. Cells transferred to a medium containing 0.5 mM Pi, for example, did not activate Pho4-target genes during the approximately 9 initial hours, showing a partial induction only at the 24.7-hour time point. By contrast, cells transferred to a medium lacking any phosphate induced Pho4-target gene expression practically immediately upon the transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies reported that cells transferred to medium lacking phosphate activated the starvation program in 2 sequential waves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref023">23</xref>]. To examine whether this sequential induction is seen also in our data, we measured the similarity in the expression response at different time points following the transfer, as defined by the Pearson correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g001">Fig 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). Indeed, 2 waves of transcription response were observed. The temporal delay between the 2 waves varied depending on the incubating conditions, ranging from approximately 2 hours in cells transferred to medium lacking phosphate to approximately 9.5 hours in cells transferred to medium containing 0.2 mM Pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). This differential kinetics reflected the delayed induction of the second transcription wave. By contrast, the first transcription wave was induced practically immediately upon transfer to all media containing low Pi levels &lt; 0.5 mM. The 2 waves differed primarily by the strength of gene induction. At the first wave, most (but not all) of the Pho4-target genes were moderately induced. At the second wave, the induction of these genes became stronger, and some additional Pho4-targets, not induced in the first wave, were now up-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>Budding yeast activate a characteristic large-scale transcription program termed the environmental stress response (ESR) when subjected to a variety of environmental stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref024">24</xref>]. To examine whether this response is activated also in our data, we considered the group of stress response genes as defined in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref020">20</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and methods</xref>). We noted that this response was not activated immediately upon transfer to low-phosphate media but was observed concomitant with the second wave of Pho4-target gene induction. Also at this time, cells down-regulated the expression of genes coding for ribosomal proteins and ribosome-associated functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>The synchronization of the stress response with the second wave of Pho4-target induction suggested to us that it is at this point that phosphate becomes growth limiting. To examine this, we monitored cell growth following the transfer. Cells maintained rapid growth rate during the initial stages of incubation, independent of the level of phosphate in the inoculation medium, but began to reduce their growth only at a later stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). To comonitor growth rate and the induction of Pho4-target genes, we used cells that express a well-established reporter: <italic>PHO84</italic> promoter-driven Venus (PHO84p-Venus) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref025">25</xref>]. <italic>PHO84</italic> is a Pho4-target gene that encodes for the high-affinity phosphate transporter. Upon transfer to low-phosphate media, <italic>PHO84</italic> expression is induced as part of the first transcription wave and is further up-regulated when the second transcription wave is activated (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Induction of the PHO84p-Venus reporter was seen immediately upon transfer to low-phosphate media (&lt;0.5 mM Pi), and its levels continued to increase in time as phosphate was further depleted, with different kinetics depending on the incubation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Notably, comparing cell growth rate with reporter induction, we observed that cells began to reduce their growth rate when the reporter crossed a particular activation threshold, independent of the initial low-phosphate levels into which the cells were incubated or of the time of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). Further, this activation threshold coincided with the induction of the second wave of Pho4-target gene induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s001">S1E Fig</xref>). We conclude that cells induce the initial transcription wave when phosphate levels are reduced but are not yet limiting for growth. In contrast, the second transcription wave is induced when intracellular phosphate becomes growth limiting.</p>

<title>Contribution of the starvation program to growth in low-phosphate media</title>
<p>As mentioned above, the group of Pho4-targets induced upon transfer to low-phosphate media includes multiple genes that regulate the availability of internal phosphate, including high-affinity transporters (<italic>PHO84</italic> and <italic>PHO89</italic>), genes that mobilize phosphate vacuolar storage as PolyP (PHM1-5), and phosphatases that can scavenge phosphate from other molecules inside or outside the cells (e.g., <italic>PHO5</italic>, <italic>PHM8</italic>, and <italic>PHO11</italic>). Induction of these genes could therefore promote growth in low-phosphate media. To quantify the contribution of this transcription program to cell growth, we considered 2 mutants that cannot activate the pathway: a strain that lacks the transcription factor Pho4 and a strain that lacks the Pho4 activating protein, Pho81. We compared the growth rate of the mutant and wild-type cells using a growth-competitive assay. For this assay, we labeled wild-type cells using a fluorescence marker mCherry, driven by the constitutively strong TEF2 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). When mixed with unlabeled cells, the fraction of labeled (wild-type) cells in the population was measured using flow cytometry. To monitor the activation of the starvation program, we further engineered the cells to express PHO84p-Venus and monitored its induction using flow cytometry as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). mCherry and/or Venus reporter expression did not detectably affect growth rate in our experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>The starvation program promotes growth in low phosphate.</title>
<p>(A) Experimental scheme: Cells deleted of <italic>PHO4</italic> were mixed with fluorescently labeled wild-type cells and were coincubated in different low-Pi media. Samples were taken at different times following the incubation and analyzed using flow cytometry to define the relative fraction of Δ<italic>pho4</italic> cells (cells not expressing mCherry) and the activation of the starvation program reporter PHO84p-Venus in individual cells. (B–C) The early phase of Pho4-target gene induction does not contribute to cell growth: The relative abundance of Δ<italic>pho4</italic> cells in the mixed culture is shown as a function of time (B) and as a function of the PHO84p-Venus reporter induction in wild-type cells (C). The data in (B–C) are the mean and standard error of 2 replicates. The raw data are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s011">S4 Data</xref>. Note that, regardless of the inoculation conditions, Δ<italic>pho4</italic> cells begin to reduce in frequency when the reporter level increases beyond the same activation threshold at which wild-type cells begin to reduce their growth (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g001">Fig 1F</xref>) and induce the second wave of Pho4-target gene expression (compare <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s001">S1E Fig</xref>).

<p>Mutant and fluorescently labeled wild-type cells were coincubated in media containing different phosphate levels, and the fraction of wild-type cells in the population was measured periodically following this incubation, as cells grew and further depleted the phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Initially, the pathway-defective mutant Δ<italic>pho4</italic> or Δ<italic>pho81</italic> grew as well as wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g002">Fig 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s002">S2D Fig</xref>). Wild-type cells began to outcompete the mutants only after a delay, which varied depending on the level of phosphate in the incubating media. For example, when incubating the cells in no-Pi or in 0.2 mM Pi, the fraction of mutant cells began to decrease only around 2 hours or around 8.5 hours after incubation, respectively.</p>
<p>The PHO84p-Venus reporter was induced practically immediately upon transfer of wild-type cells to low-phosphate media (&lt;0.5 mM Pi) and continued to increase with time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s002">S2C Fig</xref>), as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Notably, in all conditions, the time at which the frequency of mutant cells in the mixed population began to decrease coincided with the time at which the PHO84p-Venus reporter reached a given activation threshold level, independently of the incubating conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g002">Fig 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s002">S2E Fig</xref>). This time coincided with the second wave of Pho4-target gene induction and the time at which wild-type cells began to reduce their growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g001">Fig 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s001">S1E Fig</xref>). Therefore, induction of Pho4-target genes promotes growth in low-phosphate media, but only from the onset of the second wave of gene induction, the time at which phosphate becomes limiting for growth.</p>
<p>We next examined mutants that express the PHO regulon constitutively (expressing the PHO4<sup>SA12346</sup> allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref019">19</xref>] or with <italic>PHO80</italic> deleted). Constitutive strong activation of Pho4-target genes reduced growth in rich medium and when phosphate levels were low but not yet growth limiting. By contrast, this constitutive strong activation promoted growth once phosphate became growth limiting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g003">Fig 3A–3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s003">S3A–S3D Fig</xref>). Interestingly, the phenotypic effects of the PHO4<sup>SA12346</sup> alleles were fully dependent on the <italic>PHM3</italic> gene, which mobilizes phosphate into vacuolar storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref010">10</xref>], suggesting that the reduced growth rates in both rich and intermediate phosphate conditions are explained by transferring too much phosphate into storage. This excessive storage promotes growth once phosphate becomes growth limiting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g003">Fig 3D–3G</xref>).</p>

<p>Taken together, we find that the initial induction of Pho4-target genes occurs before phosphate becomes growth limiting and that Pho4-target induction does not contribute to cell growth during this phase. The phosphate starvation program starts contributing to growth only when phosphate becomes growth limiting, a time that is marked by the second wave of Pho4-target gene induction and up-regulation of the stress response.</p>

<title>Contribution of the starvation program to recovery when phosphate is replenished</title>
<p>We asked whether, in addition to its role during growth in limited phosphate, the starvation program promotes recovery from starvation once phosphate is replenished. We reasoned that this contribution may depend primarily on the first wave of Pho4-target gene induction, since this wave is activated before phosphate becomes growth limiting and before it is needed for maintaining maximal growth rate. This early induction could prepare cells for upcoming starvation and further contribute to their recovery. We therefore denote the time between the induction of the first and second transcription waves as the “preparation phase.”</p>
<p>Cells that are incubated in media containing intermediate phosphate show a preparation phase that is prolonged relative to cells incubated in medium containing no phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). If preparation promotes recovery, cells with prolonged preparation will recover faster than cells incubated directly in a no-phosphate medium. To examine this, we incubated cells into media containing different levels of phosphate for 21 hours, transferred them back to rich medium, and measured the lag time before growth was recovered. As predicted, the lag time decreased monotonically with increasing levels of phosphate in the incubating media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). In particular, cells incubated directly into medium lacking phosphate showed the longest lag time before resuming growth.</p>

<p>(A) Recovery time depends on the conditions leading to starvation: Cells were incubated in media containing different low phosphate levels and maintained in the starvation conditions for 21 hours before being transferred back into a rich medium. The number of generations that cells underwent 3 or 5.7 hours after the transfer to rich medium is shown as a function of the phosphate level in the incubating media. The data in (A) are the mean and standard error of 2 replicates. (B) Pho4-target genes are rapidly down-regulated when phosphate is replenished: Recovery expression profiles of cells grown for 24.7 hours in low-Pi media (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) and recovered in rich medium. The data in (B) are from 1 replicate.

See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s011">S4 Data</xref> for related experiments using a reporter gene. (C) The starvation program promotes recovery: Competition experiments, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g002">Fig 2</xref>, were performed to compare the growth of Δ<italic>pho4</italic> and wild-type cells following recovery in rich medium. Wild-type and Δ<italic>pho4</italic> cells were coincubated in media containing different levels of low phosphate, grown to saturation, and maintained in the starvation conditions for 24.7 hours before being transferred back into rich medium. The (log<sub>2</sub>) relative abundance of Δ<italic>pho4</italic> cells at different times following return to rich medium is shown. Note that Δ<italic>pho4</italic> cells are outcompeted by wild-type cells during recovery from starvation that was induced by incubation in media containing intermediate phosphate (e.g., 0.2 mM Pi). These conditions introduce the longest time gap between the first and second wave of Pho4-target gene induction (“preparation” time). The data in (C) are the mean and standard error of 2 replicates.

The (log<sub>2</sub>) relative abundance of mutant cells during recovery from starvation induced by incubating in media containing 0.2 mM Pi is shown in (D).

This fitness difference is shown as a function of the initial phosphate level in the starvation media. Note that deletion of <italic>PHO4</italic> impaired recovery when cells were first incubated at intermediate phosphate levels (around 0.2 mM Pi), allowing sufficient preparation time, and that constitutive expression of <italic>PHO84</italic> partially rescued this phenotype.

<p>To directly examine whether the starvation program promotes recovery, we examined the Δ<italic>pho4</italic> and Δ<italic>pho81</italic> mutants that do not activate the pathway. This was done using a competition assay: fluorescently labeled wild-type cells containing the constitutive TEF2p-mCherry marker were mixed with mutant cells, incubated in low-phosphate media for 24.7 hours, and then transferred back to rich medium. The fraction of wild-type cells was measured at subsequent times following the transfer to rich medium using a flow cytometer. The gene expression profile of wild-type cells was monitored in parallel to define the kinetics by which cells down-regulate the expression of Pho4-target genes.</p>
<p>Replenishing phosphate rapidly repressed Pho4-target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g004">Fig 4B</xref>).

This was observed in cells that showed a prolonged preparation time (brought to starvation following incubation in media containing an intermediate level of phosphate). In fact, in cells incubated in 0.2 mM Pi, the starvation program contributed to recovery more than to growth in the low-Pi medium itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g002">Fig 2B</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g004">Fig 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s002">S2D Fig</xref> versus <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). By contrast, the starvation program did not detectably contribute to the recovery of cells that were incubated directly in very low or no-phosphate medium, conditions in which preparation time was limited (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g004">4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g001">1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s004">S4A Fig</xref>).

<title>Phosphate influx is limiting during recovery in rich media</title>
<p>The starvation program could promote recovery from starvation by limiting phosphate toxicity. Indeed, upon recovery, cells are subject to a large, sudden influx of phosphate, which may be toxic. To examine whether phosphate toxicity limits recovery of the pathway defective Δ<italic>pho4</italic> or Δ<italic>pho81</italic> cells, we constitutively expressed the high-affinity transporter <italic>PHO84</italic> (PHO84<sup>c</sup>) in these backgrounds. We reasoned that this constitutive expression will increase phosphate uptake and toxicity, further delaying recovery from starvation. In contrast to this expectation, constitutive expression of <italic>PHO84</italic> did not abrogate but rather compensated for the delayed recovery of Δ<italic>pho4</italic> and Δ<italic>pho81</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g004">Fig 4D and 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s004">S4B Fig</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s002">S2F and S2G Fig</xref> for growth in low Pi). This refutes the hypothesis that pathway activation is needed to prevent toxicity upon phosphate replenishment but suggests that it is required to promote phosphate influx. Indeed, to resume growth, cells must synthesize a large amount of RNA, likely requiring an increased phosphate influx.</p>
<p>If phosphate influx is limiting during recovery, cells without the high-affinity phosphate transporter (Δ<italic>pho84</italic> cells) will exit starvation with a delay. To test that, we examined the recovery time of Δ<italic>pho84</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g004">Fig 4F–4I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s004">S4C and S4D Fig</xref>). The starvation program in Δ<italic>pho84</italic> cells was maintained active for at least 10 hours following phosphate replenishment, contrasting its rapid down-regulation in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g004">Fig 4H–4I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s004">S4D Fig</xref>) and confirming that the high-affinity transporter largely contributes to phosphate influx during recovery. As was expected when phosphate influx limits recovery, the growth of those cells was severely delayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g004">Fig 4F–4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s004">S4C Fig</xref>). Further, the impaired recovery of Δ<italic>pho84</italic> cells was rescued by deleting <italic>SPL2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g004">Fig 4F–4I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s004">S4C and S4D Fig</xref>). As one of the Pho4-target genes, <italic>SPL2</italic> is induced in low-phosphate media and down-regulates the activity of Pho90 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s002">S2H–S2J Fig</xref> for growth in low Pi). Deletion of <italic>SPL2</italic> therefore maintains the active status of the low-affinity transporter, leading to a higher phosphate influx, which we suggest explains the cells’ faster recovery. This recovery is still not as fast as wild-type cells, which can utilize both the low- and high-affinity transporters during recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g004">Fig 4F–4I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s004">S4C and S4D Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, our results suggest that phosphate influx is limiting during the recovery of cells from phosphate starvation. Pho4-target gene induction may therefore promote recovery by facilitating the increase in internal phosphate upon recovery.</p>

<title>Delayed induction of Pho4-target genes delays recovery by decreasing phosphate influx</title>
<p>Our analysis above mapped the contribution of the starvation program to cell recovery to the first wave of Pho4-target genes, induced before phosphate becomes limiting. Further, we showed that this contribution is pronounced only when the duration of this first wave is sufficiently long. We previously showed that constitutive activation of the high-affinity transporter <italic>PHO84</italic> leads to the delayed induction of the first transcription wave and shortens the delay between the 2 waves. Consistent with this first wave being important for recovery, PHO84<sup>C</sup> cells recover with a delay, and this phenotype is rescued by partial activation of the starvation program using the weak PHO4<sup>SA1234</sup> constitutive allele, which may mimic the first induction wave [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref022">22</xref>]. We recapitulated these results here and confirmed that delayed recovery was apparent when incubating cells in conditions that enable a long preparation phase in wild-type cells (0.2 mM Pi) but was less pronounced when preparation was short or absent (no Pi, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s005">S5A–S5D Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) Constitutive expression of the high-affinity <italic>PHO84</italic> transporter limits recovery from phosphate starvation: Competition experiments are the same as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g004">Fig 4C</xref> but for cells that express <italic>PHO84</italic> using the constitutive <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter (PHO84<sup>C</sup>). Note that PHO84<sup>C</sup> cells recover with a delay and that the delay is particularly significant when cells are recovered from a medium containing intermediate phosphate levels (0.2 mM Pi). During growth in 0.2 mM Pi, wild-type cells have a long preparation time, while PHO84<sup>C</sup> triggers Pho4-target genes at a delay; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s005">S5A Fig</xref>. The data in (A) are from 1 replicate; see (B) for additional supporting data.

<p>Several additional results support the hypothesis that the impaired recovery of the PHO84-constitutive cells is due to an insufficient phosphate influx upon recovery. First, the recovery phenotype was partially rescued by increased phosphate in the recovery media (20 mM compared to 7.3 mM Pi in synthetic complete (SC) medium, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). It was also rescued by an <italic>SPL2</italic> deletion and by constitutive expression of the low-affinity transporter <italic>PHO90</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Further, the PHO84-constitutive cells maintained the starvation program as partially active for a considerable time following phosphate replenishment, indicating low internal phosphate. Notably, Pho4-target genes were in fact repressed rapidly upon phosphate replenishment but were also rapidly reinduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). As we have shown before, this oscillatory behavior characterizes cells that are transferred from deep to intermediate internal phosphate limitation conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref021">21</xref>]. This phenotype was again rescued when transferring cells into 20 mM Pi, in Δ<italic>spl2</italic> deleted cells and in cells that constitutively express <italic>PHO90</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002039.g005">Fig 5D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Cells respond to the depletion of nutrients by changing the expression and activities of a large number of genes and proteins. Previous studies implicated cellular starvation programs in optimizing cell growth and survival in limiting condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref028">28</xref>]. Our results suggest that the starvation programs can also promote the recovery of cells once nutrients are replenished.</p>
<p>The phosphate starvation program in budding yeast was investigated extensively, revealing general principles of nutrient homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref031">31</xref>]. Yet, while the molecular properties of this response are well understood, its contribution to cell growth remained relatively unexplored. Here, we closed this gap by following, at high temporal resolution, the growth of wild-type and mutant cells at different stages of phosphate depletion and recovery. We found that cells activate the starvation response before this response is required for growth. In fact, expression of Pho4-target genes is observed before cells reduce their growth rate or show any signs of stress such as expression of stress-responsive genes or down-regulating genes coding for ribosomal proteins. We propose that this initial response serves as a preparation phase, allowing cells to prepare for the upcoming limitation and for their subsequent recovery. As phosphate levels are further depleted, phosphate becomes limiting for growth, at which stage a second wave of Pho4-target genes is induced, concomitant with the induction of the general stress response. At this point, the starvation program starts contributing to cell growth. It is interesting that induction of the general stress response is delayed and becomes weaker in cells that are deleted of Pho4 and thereby do not activate the starvation program (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s003">S3A–S3C Fig</xref>), suggesting an inherent connection between this general stress response and the more specific induction of Pho4-target genes.</p>
<p>Most notably, we find that the phosphate starvation program also promotes recovery from starvation. As we show, recovery times might be limited by phosphate influx during the recovery, and the starvation program may promote this influx. Further, this role of the starvation program appears to depend on the early wave of Pho4-target genes, induced before phosphate becomes growth limiting.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that nutrient homeostasis circuits have evolved not only for promoting growth in the limiting conditions but also for preparing cells for their predictable recovery once nutrients are replenished. Recent studies suggest that this “preparation” or “anticipation” presents a general principle in microbial stress signaling. For example, the ESR is induced by moderate stresses that do not affect growth rate either in the presence or in the absence of the stress response. Thus, rather than contributing to growth in these moderate stresses, the ESR promotes survival in cases of subsequent, more severe stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref032">32</xref>]. Similar anticipatory regulation was observed in other microbial systems, including examples from bacteria and yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref037">37</xref>]. These evolved paradigms strongly suggest that throughout their natural history, yeasts encountered complex and perhaps predictable combinations of stresses so that their signaling circuits evolved to optimize not only the immediate conditions but also probably upcoming needs.</p>

<title>WT growth rate and reporter activation dynamics</title>
<p>WT cells with a starvation response reporter (Pho84promptor-Venus) and with or without mCherry were grown overnight in Erlenmeyer flasks in rich Pi medium of 7.3 mM Pi to reach logarithmic growth (OD<sub>600</sub> approximately 0.4, NovaSpec Plus Visible Spectrophotometer) and were then transferred into 5 tubes. The samples were centrifuged, and all supernatant was discarded. Next, for each tube, the relevant Pi medium was added, and the samples were resuspended. The washed samples were then inoculated to the specified low- or rich-Pi medium (0 mM, 0.06 mM, 0.2 mM, 0.5 mM, and 7.3 mM Pi), and the initial OD<sub>600</sub> was set to 0.05. Cells were grown in Erlenmeyer flasks at 30°C until Pi was exhausted and they reached the stationary phase (26 hours). Samples for optical density (OD<sub>600</sub>) and flow cytometry (to measure reporter activation levels) were taken during growth in high Pi (before wash, t = 0) and during growth in the various Pi media approximately every 30 minutes for 12 hours and at a final time point after 26 hours.</p>
<p>To calculate the growth rate in the different Pi media, the log<sub>2</sub> (OD<sub>600</sub>) versus time was fitted with the MATLAB function csap (smoothing parameter of 0.4), and the values of the fitted growth curve data were determined at 1-minute intervals. The growth rate was calculated for each measured time point (between 0.5 hours and 11.5 hours) from its slope with 2 surrounding (±1 minute) fitted values. To control for density-dependent effects, the growth rate was normalized by the growth rate of cells transferred to rich phosphate medium: The growth rates in rich medium with the same optical density (OD) were subtracted from the cell’s growth rate at each time point in a given Pi medium. The growth rate used for normalization was derived from the fitted growth curve values of cells grown in rich medium (as above). The time point on the fitted growth curve with the closest OD to that of the sample was chosen for normalization. The growth rate of this time point was determined with 2 surrounding (±1 minute) values.</p>

Cells were grown at 30°C until Pi was exhausted and they reached the stationary phase (approximately 24 hours). The following day, cells were recovered in high Pi levels of 7.3 mM or 20 mM Pi as indicated, diluted to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.05, and grown for approximately 24 hours until they reached the stationary phase.

Initial events acquired by the flow cytometer were removed to reduce noise and carryover from the previous sample as follows: the acquired events were binned according to their acquisition time. A section of early acquired bins was removed only if all neighboring bins had shown a mean fluorescence deviated by more than 3 STDs from the mean. The mean was calculated from the last bins that were acquired (constituting 60% of the acquired events). The retained data constitute at least 60% of all acquired events (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s010">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002039.s011">S4</xref> Data). Mutants’ (versus WT) relative abundances during growth in low Pi and during recovery were normalized to the initial time point t = 0 (prior to transfer to low Pi or prior to recovery, respectively).</p>

<title>Mutant relative fitness</title>
<p>The fitness was established from competition experiments preformed in 96-well plates. WT and mutant cells, marked with different fluorescent proteins, were grown overnight in 96-well flat-bottom plates in rich Pi medium of 7.3 mM Pi. The next day, the stationary cells were diluted 1/50 for 3 hours of growth in 7.3 mM Pi. WT and mutant cells were mixed at a ratio of approximately 1:1. Cells were diluted 1/10 for growth in high-Pi medium (20 mM Pi) and for flow cytometry analysis (t = 0). Prior to transfer into low-Pi media, 200 μl of mixed cells was centrifuged for 1 minute in a 96-well round-bottom plate, and 180 μl of the supernatant was discarded. Cells were resuspended with 180 μl of no-Pi medium. This wash was repeated, and the overall Pi in the medium was diluted by 1/100. Washed cells were then diluted 1/10 and grown (in 96-well flat-bottom plates) in all the relevant low-Pi media (ranging from no Pi up to 0.5 mM Pi). Therefore, cells grown in no Pi are still expected to have maximal initial Pi residues of approximately 7.3 μM Pi in their environment. After approximately 24 hours, the samples were recovered into high-Pi medium with 2 dilution steps (total of 10<sup>−3</sup> dilution). The first dilution plate was read in the flow cytometer (t = approximately 24 hours in starvation, and t = 0 of recovery). After approximately 24 hours of growth in high Pi, the change in the mutant and WT ratio was measured by flow cytometry (t = approximately 24 hours of recovery). The mutants’ relative fitness was calculated for growth in Pi limitation and for the following recovery, from the slope of its relative frequencies (in log) as a function of the number of generations (based on OD measurements), divided by log(2).</p>

<p>WT cells with and without a starvation response reporter (PHO84p-Venus) were grown overnight in 50-ml tubes until reaching an OD<sub>600</sub> of approximately 0.5 (NovaSpec Plus Visible Spectrophotometer). To control for the lack of fitness impact due to reporter presence, differentially labeled WT cells were mixed (WT-PHO84p-Venus was mixed with WT-mCherry, and WT-PHO84p-Venus + mCherry was mixed with WT-GFP) in a deep 96-well plate. Mixed WT cells (approximately 1:1 ratio) were transferred (240 μl) and centrifuged for 1 minute in a 96-well round-bottom plate. The supernatant was removed by flipping the plate. The cells were resuspended in the relevant low-Pi media (200 μl). This wash was repeated 2 additional times. The cells were then diluted (1/6) to an OD<sub>600</sub> of approximately 0.1 (NovaSpec Plus) for growth in Pi limitations (ranging from no Pi to 0.5 mM Pi) and high-Pi medium (20 mM Pi). Cells in 96-well flat-bottom plates were grown for 21 hours in low-Pi conditions at 30°C. For recovery, cells were diluted into several plates with a high-Pi medium of 20 mM Pi (initial OD<sub>600</sub> of approximately 0.1). During (and prior to) recovery, one of the diluted plates was taken both for OD measurements (OD<sub>600nm</sub>, Tecan Sunrise) to calculate the number of generations and for the cells’ relative growth measurements (flow cytometer) to control for a neutral fitness impact of the starvation response reporter.</p>

Mapped reads were filtered for reads not mapped to rRNA, and the aligned filtered reads were down-sampled to 400,000 reads in order to have similar data from all samples. PCR bias was normalized for by using the unique molecular identifier (UMI), scoring each position on the genome by the unique number of UMIs it had out of the 256 possible UMIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002039.ref041">41</xref>]. The expression of each gene was determined by summing all of the reads aligned to the 400 base pairs upstream to its 3′ end to 200 base pairs downstream from the 3′ end. For genes with high sequence similarity in the region being summed (thus having sequences aligning as good to both genes), the reads aligned were separated to both genes according to the amount of uniquely mapped sequences. The sum of all gene expression was normalized to be 1,000,000, and genes with an expression below the threshold of 10 reads were excluded.

<title>Classification of PHO-regulated genes, stress genes, and protein synthesis genes</title>
<p>Genes were classified as PHO-regulated genes if they met 2 RNA expression criteria. The first required up-regulation in ON cells (PHO4<sup>SA12346</sup>) versus OFF cells (Δ<italic>pho4</italic>) in at least 15 out of 25 samples. The samples (3*8) were taken during growth in low Pi of 0.06 mM, 0.2 mM, and 0.5 mM Pi (time points: 1, 2, 3.5, 5, 6.5, 8, 9.5, 24.7 hours), and 1 sample was taken from logarithmically growing cells in high-Pi medium (prior to the transfer to the different low-Pi media). Genes were considered up-regulated if the expression ratio between ON and OFF cells was larger than or equal to 2 or if the OFF cells were below detection levels (NaN) and the ON cells were 10 times higher than the defined RNA detection level (10 reads). The second criterion required up-regulation in WT cells during growth in no Pi medium in at least 6 out of 8 time points (1, 2, 3.5, 5, 6.5, 8, 9.5, and 24.7 hours). Genes were considered up-regulated if the expression ratio between no Pi and high Pi levels was larger than or equal to 2. The sample grown in high-Pi medium was taken during logarithmic growth in 7.3 mM Pi, prior to transfer into no Pi. Genes that were below detection levels in high Pi were removed from the analysis.

<title>Experimental evolution</title>
<p>A PHO84<sup>C</sup> strain marked with mCherry and with a reporter of the starvation response (PHO84p-Venus) was evolved in the lab to create 16 independent populations. The experimental evolution was performed in 50-ml tubes, with a volume of 10 ml. Stationary cells grown in high-Pi (20 mM Pi) medium were transferred (10 μl) into 16 tubes with low Pi (0.2 mM Pi) and grown until they reached the stationary phase (an OD<sub>600</sub> of approximately 8.5; cells underwent approximately 10 generations). Next, cells were transferred (10 μl) in parallel from each tube to very low-Pi (0.06 mM Pi) medium. In order to reach prolonged Pi starvation, cells were grown for at least 2 days, reaching a final OD<sub>600</sub> of approximately 4 and undergoing approximately 9 generations. Then, 25 μl of stationary cells from each tube was recovered into a 20 mM Pi medium and grown until stationary phase (an OD<sub>600</sub> of approximately 9.5, cells underwent approximately 10 generations). This cycle of fluctuating Pi levels was repeated 10 additional times, for a total of approximately 300 generations of evolution. Before each transfer, OD<sub>600</sub> was measured and PHO84p-Venus levels were verified by flow cytometry. Samples were frozen for further analysis throughout the evolution.</p>

<title>Whole genome sequencing of evolved isolates</title>
<p>Whole genome sequencing was performed to identify the adaptive mutations in evolved isolates. To this end, the ancestor and 60 isolates from 10 evolved populations were sequenced. The isolates were taken from the middle (after approximately 150 generations, 30 isolates) and the end of a lab-evolution experiment (after approximately 300 generations, 30 isolates). The fitness of the isolates was verified by a competition assay. Only isolates in which the limited recovery of the ancestor (PHO84<sup>C</sup>) cells was rescued were sequenced. All of the isolates after approximately 300 generations were adapted, while after approximately 150 generations, only 30 out of the 56 isolates were adapted.

The cells were pelleted, resuspended in 10 ml sorbitol 1M at 4°C, and centrifuged for 2 minutes at 4°C at 4,000 rpm, and the supernatant was discarded. The cells were then resuspended in 300 μl of lysis buffer (50 mM HEPEs pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% TritonX-100, and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate) and transferred to 2-ml safe-lock Eppendorf tubes with 0.5-mm Zirconium Oxide beads.
