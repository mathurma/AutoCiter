<abstract>
<p>Membrane proteins are frequently present in crowded environments, which favour lateral association and, on occasions, two-dimensional crystallization. To better understand the non-specific lateral association of a membrane protein we have characterized the free energy landscape for the dimerization of a bacterial outer membrane protein, NanC, in a phospholipid bilayer membrane. NanC is a member of the KdgM-family of bacterial outer membrane proteins and is responsible for sialic acid transport in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Umbrella sampling and coarse-grained molecular dynamics were employed to calculate the potentials of mean force (PMF) for a variety of restrained relative orientations of two NanC proteins as the separation of their centres of mass was varied. We found the free energy of dimerization for NanC to be in the range of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Differences in the depths of the PMFs for the various orientations are related to the shape of the proteins. This was quantified by calculating the lipid-inaccessible buried surface area of the proteins in the region around the minimum of each PMF. The depth of the potential well of the PMF was shown to depend approximately linearly on the buried surface area. We were able to resolve local minima in the restrained PMFs that would not be revealed using conventional umbrella sampling. In particular, these features reflected the local organization of the intervening lipids between the two interacting proteins. Through a comparison with the distribution of lipids around a single freely-diffusing NanC, we were able to predict the location of these restrained local minima for the orientational configuration in which they were most pronounced. Our ability to make this prediction highlights the important role that lipid organization plays in the association of two NanCs in a bilayer.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Cells are surrounded by selectively-permeable bilayer membranes, enabling the cell to control its internal environment. Embedded within these membranes are a variety of membrane proteins, many of which facilitate this environmental control and are integral to numerous metabolic processes. Their location within the membrane and their mutual association are controlled by many factors. We use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the free energy of association for a pair of relatively simple membrane proteins. By doing so, we are able to characterize the effect that the geometrical properties of the protein have on their mutual association in a bilayer environment, showing that there is a correlation between the buried surface area of two proteins when in contact and the strength of their interaction. We also observe the effect of protein-lipid-protein interactions in this free energy characterization. Such interactions are related to the preferential distribution of lipids around proteins in the membrane.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cellular membranes not only separate the contents of a cell from its surroundings, they also play a key role in cell regulation and metabolism. Accounting for approximately a quarter of the coding regions of an organism's genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Nilsson1">[1]</xref>, membrane proteins control the transport of solutes between a cell and its surroundings, facilitate cellular movement, and regulate many aspects of cellular behaviour.</p>
<p>Gram-negative bacteria are surrounded by two membranes separated by a periplasmic layer. The outer membrane lipid bilayer is composed of phospholipids in the inner (i.e. periplasmic) leaflet, and of lipopolysaccharides in the outer leaflet. Within this membrane are many species of outer membrane proteins (OMPs), a class of integral membrane proteins whose secondary structures are almost exclusively <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Koebnik1">[2]</xref>. Many of these <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are porins (OmpC, OmpF, LamB, NanC, for example), through which small (approximately <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) molecules can diffuse across the membrane. Porins provide a route for many antibiotics into bacterial cells and are potential vaccine targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Nikaido1">[3]</xref>.</p>
<p>Both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, membrane proteins are often present in a crowded environment. Thus, cell membranes generally have a high membrane area fraction (approximately 25% or greater) occupied by proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Dupuy1">[4]</xref>. A similar degree of crowding may be found in membranes studied <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-LeBrun1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Casuso1">[6]</xref>. Such crowding may result in the clustering of proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Sieber1">[7]</xref>. Whilst the majority of discussion as to the nature of membrane protein cluster formation has focussed on lipid rafts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Lingwood1">[8]</xref>, it should be noted that lateral interactions of crowded membrane proteins are a more general property <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Mileykovskaya1">[9]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Spector1">[12]</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic>, control of lateral association of a single membrane species in a highly crowded system may be used to induce two-dimensional crystallization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Pope1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>Interactions within a crowded environment may lead to dynamic lateral interactions of membrane proteins, for example, those seen in recent time-resolved AFM studies of OmpF-containing membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Casuso1">[6]</xref>. In studying such interactions, one wishes to distinguish between specific oligomerization of membrane proteins (for example dimerization of transmembrane <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in glycophorin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Fleming1">[14]</xref> and of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in OMPLA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-EbbieTan1">[15]</xref>) and less specific interactions. Specific protein interactions are those in which the distributions of orientations of the oligomerized proteins are grouped almost exclusively into very few states (often only a single state). Less specific (or non-specific) interactions are those determined by other effects, such as (local) crowding, rather than purely due the specific interactions between residues on each of the proteins. In less specific oligomerization there may be some orientational dependence, but a more broad distribution of orientations is generally found among the oligomers. Benjamini and Smit found that it was important to determine the effect that non-specific interactions had on the crossing angle for pairs of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> before investigating the role of any specific interactions between the helices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Benjamini1">[16]</xref>. It is therefore of interest to explore the energy landscape of lateral interactions of a relative ‚Äòfeatureless‚Äô OMP. NanC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) provides a good example of such a protein, as it is both structurally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Wirth1">[17]</xref> and functionally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Giri1">[18]</xref> monomeric, whilst forming two dimensional crystals in DMPC lipid bilayers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Signorell1">[19]</xref>.

<p>Experimental determination of the free energy of membrane protein dimerization <italic>in vitro</italic> has been used to characterize their properties in a membrane or membrane-like environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Russ1">[20]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-MacKenzie1">[25]</xref>. Characterization of the free energy landscape for membrane proteins gives us an insight into how the proteins will move and interact within the membrane and allows us to make predictions about their behaviour. There are many published examples of experimentally determined dimerization energies for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> membrane proteins and peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Russ1">[20]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Doura1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Ebie1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-MacKenzie1">[25]</xref>, but relatively few for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> proteins: one important example being the dimerization free energy of the phospholipase OMPLA, which was found to be in the region <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Stanley1">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>Computer simulations provide a complement to both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Stansfeld1">[26]</xref>, enabling us to probe the microscopic interaction underlying membrane protein association. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to explore a range of membrane proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Stansfeld1">[26]</xref>, in addition to related approaches such as Monte Carlo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Janosi1">[27]</xref> and Brownian dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Cui1">[28]</xref> simulations. In particular, simulations using a coarse-grained approximation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Monticelli1">[29]</xref> have been used to study dimerization of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> transmembrane domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Sengupta1">[30]</xref> and of rhodopsin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Periole1">[31]</xref>. In the latter case the simulations were also used to characterize large-scale organization of rhodopsin dimers into rows-of-dimers, as seen experimentally in disk membranes.</p>
<p>Many computational studies that explore free energy landscapes use the potential of mean force (PMF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Roux1">[32]</xref> as a convenient description because it enables us to characterize a given reaction or transition as a function of a specific reaction coordinate (or set of coordinates). Not only does this enable us to characterize the free energy landscape as a function of the reaction coordinate (or coordinates), it also provides an opportunity subsequently to parameterize reduced models of complex systems using different simulation paradigms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Yiannourakou1">[33]</xref>.</p>
<p>Calculations of PMFs for the association of membrane proteins have largely focussed on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> proteins. Thus, dimerization free energy landscapes for transmembrane <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> have been calculated using MD with umbrella sampling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Sengupta1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Chng1">[34]</xref> and with adaptive biasing force methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Hnin1">[35]</xref>; and also using Monte Carlo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Janosi1">[27]</xref>, and dissipative particle dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-deMeyer1">[36]</xref>. These have yielded free energies of dimerization in the region of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

<p>It has long been suggested that lipids play an important role in the interaction between proteins in a membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Marcelja1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Killian1">[38]</xref>. For example, simulation studies have shown that hydrophobic mismatch may modulate the aggregation of proteins in the membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Lage1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Parton1">[40]</xref>. It is therefore important that we capture the effects that lipids have on free energy landscapes if we are to understand membrane protein association in different bilayer environments.</p>
<p>In this paper we develop and apply a method for calculating the free energy of association for rotationally restrained proteins in a lipid bilayer. This allows us to resolve detailed structure in the (one-dimensional) PMFs, which reflect protein-lipid-protein interactions. We apply this method to characterize the association free energy of a coarse-grained model of NanC.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In order to characterize the proteins' free energy of association, we employed MD simulations of a coarse-grained model of NanC in a POPE bilayer to calculate the PMF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Monticelli1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Bond1">[41]</xref>. Two orthogonal orientations of our coarse-grained NanC are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g001">Figures 1B and C</xref>. It can be seen from these two views of the coarse-grained protein that, perpendicular to the pore axis, the protein is approximately elliptical in cross section, as it is wider in one direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) than it is in the other orthogonal direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). We calculated the PMF for four different orientational configurations of two NanC proteins, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g001">Figures 1D‚ÄìG</xref>. These four configurations were chosen as examples of extremes of the possible contact regimes between the two proteins on association. In each of the configurations the proteins have either a wide (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) or narrow face (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) facing the other protein. These orientational configurations are categorized as: two configurations corresponding to maximal protein contact, where wide faces of both proteins face the other protein (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g001">Figures 1D and E</xref>); one intermediate configuration, in which a narrow face of one protein faces a wide face of the other protein (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g001">Figure 1F</xref>); and one configuration corresponding to minimal contact, where narrow faces of both proteins face the other protein (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). From these combinations of protein orientations we were able to investigate the differences between the PMFs for the various protein contact regimes.</p>

<p>We categorized the PMFs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g002">Figure 2</xref> by the depths of their potential well, which resulted in three categories of well depth. The first category contains the PMFs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g002">Figures 2A and B</xref>, which both have depths of approximately <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> occurring at inter-protein separations of approximately 3.2 nm. This first category corresponds to the orientational configurations of maximal contact, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where wide faces of both proteins are brought into contact (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g001">Figures 1D and E</xref>, respectively). It is interesting to note that the depths of the PMFs for these two parallel and anti-parallel orientational configurations are approximately the same. They are also similar in depth to the orientationally-unrestrained PMF calculated for this coarse-grained NanC system (shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003417.s003">Figure S2</xref>), which has a depth of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This is much greater than the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> calculated for the dimerization of OMPLA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Stanley1">[23]</xref>, the only experimental free energy for dimerization of an OMP, but as that was for a protein exhibiting specific oligomerization measured in detergent micelles, we would not expect a good agreement. The next category contains the PMF in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, with a potential well depth of approximately <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> occurring at a separation of approximately 3.5 nm. This corresponds to the intermediate orientational configuration in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g001">Figure 1F</xref>, where a wide face of one protein is brought into contact with a narrow face of the other. The decrease in the depth of the PMF indicates that the configurations with two wide faces in contact are more stable than this intermediate contact configuration, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The third category contains the PMF shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, which is the shallowest of the four PMFs with a potential well depth of approximately <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, occurring at an inter-protein separation of 3.5 nm. This PMF corresponds to the orientational configuration with minimal protein contact, where narrow faces of both proteins are brought into contact (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). This configuration is the least stable of the four configurations considered here. The correlation between the depth of the PMFs and the orientational configuration of the proteins suggests that the strength of the interaction may correlate with the overall extent of the resultant protein-protein interface.</p>

<title>Restrained metastable states are observed at various inter-protein separations</title>
<p>As well as the restrained global minima (the global minima for the specific restrained orientations) of the potential wells in the PMFs of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g002">Figure 2</xref>, there are also multiple local minima, which occur at a variety of centre of mass separations. For example, the PMF in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g002">Figure 2B</xref> has a restrained global minimum (labelled <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and two higher-energy local minima (labelled <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), which we refer to as restrained metastable states. By fitting quadratic curves to the minima in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g002">Figure 2B</xref> we calculated their locations as 3.26 nm, 3.62 nm and 4.07 nm for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, respectively.</p>
<p>The nature of the restrained global (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and local (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) minima is illustrated by the simulation snapshots shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g003">Figures 3A‚ÄìC</xref>. These snapshots were taken from the simulation windows used to calculate the PMF in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g002">Figure 2B</xref> for an orientational configuration of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The snapshot shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g003">Figure 3A</xref> is from the umbrella sampling window in which the proteins were restrained with a separation of 3.3 nm, which is closest to the minimum at 3.26 nm in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, labeled <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We see that there is one lipid molecule between the two proteins at this restrained global minimum. It should be noted that this is the only lipid in between the two proteins; there is no equivalent lipid on the extracellular side of the membrane (the view from the other side of the membrane is shown in Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003417.s002">Figure S1</xref>), so the restrained global minimum configuration for this orientation has space for one lipid on the periplasmic side of the membrane. A snapshot from the umbrella sampling window with the proteins restrained with a separation of 3.6 nm is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, which is the window closest to the minimum at 3.62 nm, labelled <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g002">Figure 2B</xref>. We can see that there are two lipid molecules between the two proteins in this snapshot. The snapshot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g003">Figure 3C</xref> is taken from the umbrella sampling window in which the proteins are restrained with a separation of 4.1 nm, which is the window closest to the minimum at 4.07 nm, labelled <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, in which we see that three lipid molecules can occupy the space between the two proteins. These observations suggest that the existence of these restrained metastable states is a result of protein-lipid-protein interactions in this orientationally-restrained system.</p>

<p>To investigate the suggestion that these restrained metastable states were the result of the lipid ordering between the proteins, we calculated the lipid distribution around a freely diffusing NanC in a POPE bilayer. The distribution for a specific coarse-grained particle in the tail of all of the lipid molecules is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, where distinct annuli are visible, indicating regions of preferred occupation. We calculated the lipid distribution in a direction that corresponds to the direction of the other protein for the orientational configuration <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, indicated by the region between the dashed lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g003">Figure 3D</xref>. The average lipid distribution across both leaflets and all coarse-grained lipid particles in this direction is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g003">Figure 3E</xref>, where again we can see there are preferred distances from the protein at which the lipids are observed. Further details of the averaging calculation are given in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section.</p>
<p>We can use this directional lipid distribution to predict the separations at which the region between two proteins would be optimally packed by the lipid molecules. The alignment process is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g003">Figures 3F‚ÄìG</xref> and explained in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section. For the minimum labelled <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the PMF in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, which occurs at a separation of 3.26 nm, we predict an optimal separation of 3.24 nm with one intervening lipid. For the first restrained metastable state labelled <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, which occurs at a separation of 3.62 nm, we predict a separation of 3.63 nm with two intervening lipids. For the second restrained metastable state labelled <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, which occurs at a separation of 4.07 nm, we predict a separation of 4.02 nm with three intervening lipids. Our predictions for the locations of the restrained metastable states are in close agreement with their location in the PMF. This supports our suggestion that the restrained metastable states observed in the PMFs are due to the protein-lipid-protein effects caused by the distribution of lipids between the two NanC proteins. For the other orientational configurations, the proteins have different faces facing the other protein and will therefore have a different optimal lipid distribution for each face. This may be one reason why the restrained local minima are better defined for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and occur at regular intervals.</p>
<p>Such features are not usually observed in PMFs calculated with proteins that are free to rotate (for example, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003417.s003">Figure S2</xref> for an orientationally-unrestrained PMF calculated for this coarse-grained NanC system). In the orientationally-unrestrained case the proteins would be able to rotate to alter the distance between their surfaces, provided they are not perfectly rotationally symmetric, so that the intervening region could be optimally packed with lipids without leaving any voids. However, for a system with rotationally restrained proteins, there is an optimal separation at which multiple lipid molecules can occupy the intervening space between the proteins.</p>
<p>Also observed in each of the PMFs is an energetic barrier, which occurs at an inter-protein separation of approximately 5.5 nm. Extending the arguments made above about the interaction of the two proteins individual lipid distributions, we can see that at distances greater than 2.5 nm in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g003">Figure 3E</xref> the fluctuations in lipid distribution have decayed to small oscillations around some constant average value, which indicates that these lipids are not as strongly influenced by the protein. From this argument we can think of this barrier as the point at which the lipids whose positions are strongly dependent on each protein begin to interact with one another, that is, there are lipids between the proteins that are affected by both of the proteins. We can think of this as the separation at which the annuli of lipids around each protein overlap with each other.</p>

<title>Analysing the lipid-inaccessible buried surface area</title>
<p>We wished to formally characterize the dependence of the PMF depth on the orientation of the proteins, which we suggested was related to the extent of protein contact. To do this we calculated the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of the two proteins as a function of the separation of their centres of mass. For proteins with an approximately elliptical cross-section, we would expect the orientations with greater contact between the proteins to have a larger buried surface area. However, given the significance of the lipid effects that we identified above, it is important to corroborate this. Any features of the combined surfaces of the two proteins that would allow room for a lipid could have a large effect on the free energy.</p>
<p>The SASA is calculated using a spherical probe whose size determines the level of detail in the surface calculated for a specific set of atoms/particles. We used a probe with a radius of 0.47 nm, which is twice the radius of the coarse grained particles (0.235 nm) and should be a reasonable measure for the size of a lipid. We chose this size probe because it is the lipids that are the ‚Äòsolvent‚Äô of interest when we bring two proteins together in a membrane. Further details are given in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section.</p>
<p>For each of the four orientational configurations, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g004">Figure 4</xref> shows the buried surface area as a function of distance from the minimum of their respective PMFs. We chose this measure since we wanted to remove the effect that the difference in protein radius has on the location of the minimum. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g004">Figure 4</xref> we see that there is a stratification of the buried surface areas in the region around the minima of the PMFs. As with the PMF depths in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g002">Figure 2</xref>, the buried surface areas can be divided into three categories. The buried surface area is largest for the orientations <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where the two wide protein faces are brought together. The next largest buried surface area around the minimum of the PMF is for the orientation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where one narrow face is brought into contact with one wide face. The smallest buried surface area around the minimum of the PMF is for the orientation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where two narrow faces are brought into contact. The correlation between the depth of the PMF and the buried surface area can be seen in the inset plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g004">Figure 4</xref>, in which these two quantities are plotted. We see that there is a negative correlation between the two quantities. For a protein orientation with a larger buried surface area, the minimum of the PMF is deeper.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have characterized the free energy landscape of a pair of NanC proteins in a phospholipid bilayer. An interesting feature of these restrained free energy calculations is that certain restrained metastable states, which would usually not be seen, are now resolved. These local minima are associated with the ability of lipids to occupy the space between the two proteins at a given separation. Niemel√§ et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Niemel1">[42]</xref> found that close to proteins, the lipids in a bilayer have reduced mobility, diffusing with the protein, and it is interactions involving these surrounding lipids upon protein association that we are observing here. Proteins' interactions with lipids have been shown to modulate local lipid formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Domaski1">[43]</xref>, further demonstrating the important role of interactions involving both proteins and lipids in determining structures observed in the bilayer. PMFs for the dimerization of TM helices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Janosi1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Sengupta1">[30]</xref> and for other more complex proteins, including rhodopsin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Periole2">[44]</xref> and OmpF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Casuso1">[6]</xref> have revealed similar features, suggesting that a role for lipids in the energetics of their interactions may be a general feature of membrane proteins. These features may not affect the kinetics of association, as we do not know if they present metastable barriers to association, but they will affect the dynamics of the system; the NanC proteins will need to negotiate the complex free energy landscape created by these protein-lipid-protein interactions if they are to reach an energetically stable state through oligomerization.</p>
<p>This result may also be compared with studies of membrane protein interactions using more approximate (and hence more general) models and DPD simulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-deMeyer1">[36]</xref>. For example, such studies have suggested that changes in lipids may result in the modulation of mismatch-driven interactions of membrane proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-deMeyer2">[45]</xref>.</p>
<p>We identified a correlation between of the depth of the well in the free energy of association with the buried surface area at the interface of the two proteins. More generally, it has been suggested that oligomer stability of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> membrane proteins such as glycophorin A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Doura1">[22]</xref> and bacteriorhodopsin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Faham1">[46]</xref> may be correlated with the buried surface area at the interface. However, studies of the dimeric outer membrane protein OMPLA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-EbbieTan1">[15]</xref> failed to reveal such a correlation. This may reflect the role of lipids in OMPLA dimerization, confirming the need for detailed energy landscape calculations such as those presented herein.</p>
<p>Features of the methodology used in this work mean that care should be taken when interpreting the results. The treatment of solvents in the coarse-grained model is only approximate, so entropic contributions to solvation and lipidation/delipidation may not be captured as reliably as with a fully atomistic model. The nature of the coarse-grained model also does not enable us to separate out the contributions to the PMF due to energy and entropy, as is sometimes done using atomistic calculations. However, the observations we make here relating to the behaviour of lipids is mostly phenomenological and any quantitative observations are limited to relative comparisons between simulations of the same system. Furthermore, in choosing to look at a highly restrained system where the relative positions and orientations are restrained, we are also looking at the change in free energy along a narrow slice through configuration space. Although this path may be tightly defined, it is only by using such a highly restrained system that we are able to identify some previously unobserved behaviour, specifically the effect of protein-lipid-protein interactions on the free energy of protein dimerization. Such effects would usually be lost when averaging over a larger range of configurations.</p>
<p>The results presented here highlight some of the effects that contribute to the free energy of association for a bacterial outer membrane protein that undergoes non-specific oligomerization in a POPE bilayer. These processes will play a role in many protein-protein interactions, even those with some specific oligomerization modes, although in the latter case the non-specific interactions will likely be masked at close range by the specific interactions. We would expect the protein-lipid-protein interactions to be present in many membrane protein systems, as they seem to be determined by the underlying lipid-protein interactions. The PMF for the association of two OmpF trimers calculated by Casuso et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Casuso1">[6]</xref> had a potential well that was approximately twice as deep as the ones we present here for NanC. However, the OmpF protein is much larger than NanC and the oligomerized proteins would therefore have a correspondingly larger buried surface compared to our NanC system.</p>
<p>Given the conclusions of this study, it will be of great interest to apply similar methods to those presented to calculate orientationally-dependent PMFs for a variety of other membrane proteins. Information obtained from PMFs, such as the orientational dependence of the free energy of association, are necessary for parameterizing yet coarser (i.e. more approximate) models (for example those of Yiannourakou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Yiannourakou1">[33]</xref>), in order to enable simulation studies of the emergent properties of large, crowded and complex membrane models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Goose1">[47]</xref>.</p>

<title>Using umbrella sampling to calculate PMFs</title>
<p>Umbrella sampling was used to obtain the PMF for each of the four orientational configurations while varying the inter-protein separation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Roux1">[32]</xref>. The umbrella sampling was performed using simulation windows in which one protein was restrained at relative positions with the desired inter-protein separation. We chose this measure as our reaction coordinate because it is a natural choice for characterizing the separation of two proteins and it would also enable the PMFs to be used to parameterize larger scale models, as done by Yiannourakou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Yiannourakou1">[33]</xref>.</p>
<p>To calculate the PMF from these individual biased simulation windows we employed the weighed histogram analysis method (WHAM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003417-Kumar1">[48]</xref>. For the WHAM method to produce a converged PMF, we need to ensure that all points along the reaction coordinate are sufficiently sampled. This means that the histograms from the sampling of the reaction coordinate in each simulation window need to overlap with adjacent simulation windows and that these histograms are smooth. The effect of enforcing these requirements is that all points along the reaction coordinate are thoroughly sampled in multiple simulation windows. It is these considerations that determined our positioning of the umbrella sampling windows and the strength of the biasing potentials used in each.</p>
<p>For each orientational configuration, umbrella sampling windows were distributed at positions with varying inter-protein separation along a line connecting the centres of mass of the two proteins. The umbrella potential was applied to the centre of mass of each protein's <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> particles, restraining them at relative positions with the desired centre of mass separation. The sampling windows were distributed at 0.1 nm intervals from an inter-protein separation of 2.8 nm to 8 nm. In each of these simulation windows we applied a harmonic umbrella potential with a force constant of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. To improve the overlap of the histograms from adjacent simulation windows in the region of the local minima, which improved the resolution, additional simulation windows were used. These additional simulation windows were distributed at 0.05 nm intervals from a inter-protein separation of 2.8 nm to 4.5 nm, where the proteins were in close proximity. These closely separated windows had a stronger harmonic force constant of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, in order that we could better resolve the barriers surrounding the restrained local minima.</p>
<p>The lipidation/delipidation of the protein-protein complex at close range is a slow process. It is important that we adequately sample both the lipidated and delipidated state. To do so, we also performed simulations in which that interface was manually delipidated, with the intervening lipids returned to the bulk of the bilayer, and the system re-equilibrated. Manually delipidated simulations were carried out for the orientational configurations <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, but were not required for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as no persistent lipidated state was observed. Delipidated simulation windows were distributed from an inter-protein separation of 2.8 nm to 3.7 nm for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and to 4.0 nm for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, separated by 0.5 nm in all cases and using the stronger position restraint of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003417.e089" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>

<title>Orientational restraints</title>
<p>To analyse the free energy of association for specific relative orientations of NanC we had to ensure that we restrained their orientations in each simulation window, as well as their relative positions.

<title>Molecular dynamics simulations</title>
<p>To calculate the PMF of association for two NanC proteins we employed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of a bilayer system. The system consisted of the two coarse-grained proteins embedded in a symmetric bilayer formed from 424 coarse-grained POPE lipid molecules. The bilayer was solvated and counter ions were added to neutralize the system.

<title>Predicting restrained metastable state locations from the lipid distribution around a single NanC</title>

This extended simulation consisted of a single coarse-grained NanC protein model (the same model used for the PMF calculations) embedded in a 25 nm square membrane constructed from coarse-grained POPE molecules. To analyse the lipid distribution around the single protein, we rotated each frame of the trajectory so that the NanC protein was aligned with its position at the start of the simulation. From this aligned trajectory we were able to calculate the position of the lipid particles in relation to the protein for the entire simulation. The particle density was calculated for a 6 nm square region around the NanC protein for each of the particles in the coarse-grained lipid molecules.</p>
<p>To calculate the protein density in a given direction, we calculated a linear projection of this two-dimensional density.

To evaluate the convergence of the rotationally-restrained PMFs presented in this paper we calculated two PMFs for each orientational configuration, each using half of the simulation data. The data used for each PMF constituted non-intersecting subsets of the total simulation data using to calculate the PMFs presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003417-g002">Figure 2</xref>. From these PMFs we can see that the two versions agree to a high degree. The depths of the two PMFs calculated for each orientational combination are approximately the same and the local minima are observed at the same locations. There are a few regions where they do not overlap precisely, but these discrepancies do not affect the conclusions of the paper.</p>
