<p>Due to its inhibition of the Abl kinase domain in the BCR-ABL fusion protein, imatinib is strikingly effective in the initial stage of chronic myeloid leukemia with more than 90% of the patients showing complete remission. However, as in the case of most targeted anti-cancer therapies, the emergence of drug resistance is a serious concern. Several drug-resistant mutations affecting the catalytic domain of Abl and other tyrosine kinases are now known. But, despite their importance and the adverse effect that they have on the prognosis of the cancer patients harboring them, the molecular mechanism of these mutations is still debated. Here by using long molecular dynamics simulations and large-scale free energy calculations complemented by <italic>in vitro</italic> mutagenesis and microcalorimetry experiments, we model the effect of several widespread drug-resistant mutations of Abl. By comparing the conformational free energy landscape of the mutants with those of the wild-type tyrosine kinases we clarify their mode of action. It involves significant and complex changes in the inactive-to-active dynamics and entropy/enthalpy balance of two functional elements: the activation-loop and the conserved DFG motif. What is more the T315I gatekeeper mutant has a significant impact on the binding mechanism itself and on the binding kinetics.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Imatinib remains the most important and studied anti-cancer drug for cancer therapy in its new paradigm. Due to its inhibition of the Abl kinase domain, imatinib is strikingly effective in the initial stage of chronic myeloid leukemia with more than 90% of the patients showing a complete remission. However, the emergence of drug resistance is a serious concern. Here, we investigate the molecular mechanism of drug-resistant mutations which, despite the importance and the adverse effect on cancer patients prognosis, is still debated. Our extensive molecular simulations and free energy calculations are consistent with an allosteric effect of the single-point drug-resistance-causing mutations on the conformational dynamics. Two partially independent conformational changes play a role. Our findings might help the design of anti-cancer therapies to overcome drug resistance and be used to predict the clinical relevance of new drug-resistant mutants found by genetic screenings of tumor samples.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The revolutionary discovery of the potent anticancer drug imatinib (Gleevec, 2001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref001">1</xref>] had a huge impact on cancer therapy. This drug has a striking efficacy in the early stages of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), with 90% of patients showing remission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref003">3</xref>]. Imatinib targets the Abl tyrosine kinase (TK), constitutively active in CML due to a chromosomal translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref004">4</xref>]. Unfortunately, most patients in an advanced stage of the disease suffer from relapse due to the onset of drug-resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref005">5</xref>]. Even if, next-generation kinase inhibitors (KIs) are available, or in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref006">6</xref>], their efficacy might also be affected by drug resistance responses. Among different mechanisms, the development of resistance-inducing mutations is the most relevant in tyrosine kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref006">6</xref>]. Mutations occur in highly conserved positions on the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref007">7</xref>], frequently shared by several kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref008">8</xref>], suggesting a conserved kinome-wide mechanism. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanism of mutation-mediated resistance are only partially understood. In the case of the widely studied “gatekeeper” mutant, found in several TKs (T315I in Abl) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref009">9</xref>], three mechanisms have been proposed. The <italic>direct</italic> one involves the abrogation of a crucial hydrogen bond formed by imatinib. A second hypothesis posits that the observed shift towards the active form, which was reported in Abl and several other TK bearing the gatekeeper mutation, would allow the natural substrate ATP to outcompete the inhibitors. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref013">13</xref>] Very recently, a third mechanism has been proposed for Abl T315I whereby the suppression of an induced fit effect involving the p-loop would be responsible for the decreased binding affinity of imatinib. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref014">14</xref>] It is probable that the gate-keeper mutations have a combined effect on the binding of inhibitors, changing their binding mode and affecting at the same time the conformational changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref011">11</xref>]. The importance of the conformational changes in the mode of action of drug-resistant mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref016">16</xref>] is also confirmed by the fact that many of them are far away from the binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004578.g001">Fig 1</xref>), and thus act allosterically by disfavoring the drug-binding conformation and favoring active form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref019">19</xref>]. The link between conformational changes and allosteric regulation in TKs is well established. For instance, in the case of Src (a close homologue of Abl) the gatekeeper mutation has been shown to allosterically affect remote regulatory motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref020">20</xref>].</p>

</fig>
<p>Indeed, TKs can exist in a dynamic equilibrium between multiple conformations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref023">23</xref>], differing by the conformation of the “activation loop” (A-loop), of the conserved DFG motif and of the <italic>α</italic>C-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004578.g001">Fig 1</xref>). While the features of the active, catalytically-competent, state are shared among different TKs, and include an A-loop in an extended (“open”) conformation, inactive conformations can be multiple and highly diverse, all sharing an (at least partially) “closed” A-loop. Type II inhibitors, as imatinib, target a particular inactive conformation, known as “DFG-out”, where the aspartate is flipped, taking the place of the phenylalanine and pointing out of the ATP binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref024">24</xref>] and opening an adjacent “allosteric” pocket. When both the DFG is in the ‘out’ conformation and the A-loop is not fully extended, the drug can enter the cavity and adopt a bridge position above the DFG, occupying both the catalytic site and the allosteric pocket [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref025">25</xref>]. The DFG-out conformation has been observed in many kinases but, despite a common binding mode, imatinib binds strongly only to some of them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref026">26</xref>]. In contrast to the induced-fit mechanism proposed for Abl, free energy calculations performed with different and independent approaches on several TKs are consistent with a conformational selection mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref028">28</xref>]. Indeed, the different affinity to Abl and Src can be explained by the thermodynamic penalty to adopt the drug-binding “DFG-out” conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref029">29</xref>]. Our simulations on Abl and Src also revealed a correlation between the flexibility of specific functionally-relevant structural elements and the DFG-out penalty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref029">29</xref>].</p>
<p>To investigate the molecular mechanism of drug-resistant mutations, and whether or not changes in the conformational landscape, have a role in it, here we performed enhanced-sampling atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and free energy calculations on a pool of wild-type (WT) TKs for which imatinib has various strengths (IC<sub>50</sub>), and several Abl Imatinib-resistant mutants. In most drug resistant mutants we find extensive changes in the conformational free energy landscapes associated with two functionally-important conformational changes: the DFG-flip and the closed to open A-loop switch. The changes between the relative free energies of the active (DFG-in, extended A-loop) and inactive (DFG-out, closed A-loop) states are in the main due to entropic contributions arising from the fast (sub-<italic>μ</italic>s) dynamics of proximal structural elements. It is thus not surprising that we find a correlation between the sub-<italic>μ</italic>s flexibility of specific structural elements in the active state and drug resistance. Indeed, altering the sub-<italic>μ</italic>s dynamics has an effect on the binding of Imatinib, as also shown by mutagenesis and calorimetry experiments. The gatekeeper mutant T315I is a notable exception, as it affects both the binding mechanism itself and the conformation of the A-loop equilibrium. To the best of our knowledge this is the most in-depth computational study addressing the molecular roots of resistant mutants of Abl.</p>

<p>The kinase structures were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB entries 2G1T, 2SRC, 1PKG, 3KMM, 2WGJ and 2ITW). Missing residues were added using the software Modeller [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref030">30</xref>], according to the respective Uniprot sequences. We used the Amber99SB*-ILDN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref032">32</xref>] force field, including backbone corrections by Hummer and Best [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref033">33</xref>], with explicit TIP3P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref034">34</xref>] water molecules. The unbiased MD simulations were carried out with the ACEMD program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref035">35</xref>] running on GPUs. The systems were minimized with 10000 steps of conjugated gradient and equilibrated in the isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble for 10 ns, using a Berendsen barostat at 1 atm. The temperature was kept at 305 K by a Langevin thermostat. A 400 ns production run was carried out for all the systems in the canonical (NVT) ensemble. The runs for Abl, Src and Kit were extended to a total length of 1 <italic>μ</italic>s in both the DFG-in and DFG-out conformations. The simulations of the five Abl mutants (G250E, E279K, H396P, E450K and T315I) were carried out with the same setup in both the DFG-in and DFG-out conformation, after mutating in-silico the respective residue in the Abl structure. To capture the sub-<italic>μ</italic>s dynamics, the RMSF of the <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>α</italic></sub> were averaged on 30ns non-overlapping windows after discarding the first 100ns of each run. We also compared the diffusion in the space described by the first two principal component analysis vectors (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004578.s009">S9 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the conformational changes of TKs take place on time scales longer than those accessible by standard MD simulations, here we used a combination of enhanced sampling approaches. Parallel Tempering—Well Tempered Metadynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref037">37</xref>] in the well tempered ensemble (WTE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref039">39</xref>] (PTmetaD) was chosen due to its proven ability to fully converge complex conformational free energy surfaces such as those relevant in kinases (including the DFG-flip). Indeed, the PTmetaD approach (both in the standard and WTE variants) has already successfully used to study the conformational dynamics and its associated free energy landscape in many kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref041">41</xref>] and other flexible proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref042">42</xref>]. PTmetaD was performed using the software Gromacs 4.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref043">43</xref>] and the PLUMED plugin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref044">44</xref>], using an integration step of 2 fs. The particle mesh Ewald algorithm was used for electrostatic interactions. Temperature coupling was done with the V-rescale algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref045">45</xref>]. The WTE allowed the use of a reduced number of replicas compared to standard PTMetaD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref039">39</xref>]. An average exchange probability of 24% was obtained using 5 replicas in the temperature range 305–400 K. We used the same four collective variables (CVs) that were used to reconstruct the free energy surface (FES) associated with the DFG flip in Src and Abl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref029">29</xref>].</p>
<p>They are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004578.s006">S6 Fig</xref> and defined in the following (SRC numbering): CV1 is the distance between the centre of mass of Asp<sub>404</sub> (DFG motif) and Lys<sub>295</sub>. CV2 is the distance between the centre of mass of Phe<sub>405</sub> and the C<sub><italic>β</italic></sub> of Ile<sub>293</sub>. CV3, is a function of 3 dihedral angles <italic>f</italic><italic>(</italic><italic>ϕ</italic><sub>404</sub>, <italic>ψ</italic><sub>405</sub>, <italic>ψ</italic><sub>408</sub><italic>)</italic> ranging from 3, when the three dihedral arguments correspond to the DFG-Asp-in position, to 0, when they are in the DFG-Asp-out conformation. CV4 is the distance between the centre of mass of residues Asn<sub>381</sub>, …, His<sub>384</sub> and residues Ala<sub>408</sub>, …, Ile<sub>411</sub> of the activation loop, known to form a <italic>β</italic>-sheet in the active conformation. The height of the Gaussians was set at 2.0 kJ/mol with a deposition rate of 1/2000 steps and a bias factor of 5. The Gaussian width used for the CVs was 0.1 for the dihedral similarity (CV3) and 0.3 Å for all the others.</p>
<p>A minimum of 400 ns of sampling per replica in the NVT ensemble were needed to reach full convergence of the free energy. In the case of G250E and T315I, as the convergence was slower than in the other cases, we performed more than 600 ns and 1200 ns of sampling per replica, respectively. The total sampling time amounted to more than 14 <italic>μ</italic>s across all mutants. The free energy surface reconstruction was obtained from the PT-metaD-WTE by reweighting the fixed potential energy bias and using two independent approaches: integrating the bias or using the time independent estimator of Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref046">46</xref>]. The convergence of the free energy reconstruction was monitored by integrating the cumulative added bias as a function of time (50 ns intervals) and comparing the reconstruction to that obtained by the time-independent estimator (as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004578.s011">S11</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004578.s014">S14</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004578.s018">S18</xref> Figs). Changes of all the CVs used were also monitored to guarantee that the system diffuses freely in the CV space and is able to visit all the basins several times (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004578.s012">S12 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The FES were also reprojected as a function of two other CVs describing the conformational change of the A-loop from open to closed. Two path collective variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref047">47</xref>] were built by using the open and closed crystallographic structures of Src (CV1) and Abl (CV2). The reweight was performed by using our python implementation of the approach of Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref046">46</xref>] (available on our homepage: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/chemistry/research/group_pages/prot_dynamics/">https://www.ucl.ac.uk/chemistry/research/group_pages/prot_dynamics/</ext-link>. The entropic contribution to the DFG-in DFG-out free energy difference was computed by linear fitting of the free energy differences as a function of temperature. It has been shown that this approach is more accurate than competing ones. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref048">48</xref>]. We also tested the robustness of the estimate with respect to the range of temperatures on both standard PT and WTE-PT (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004578.s008">S8 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The drug binding free energy surface was calculated using metadynamics with the same software described above. The General Amber Force Field (GAFF) was used for the ligand. The ligand charges were calculated at the HF level using a 631-G* basis set with the Gaussian03 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref049">49</xref>] package. QM-level torsional scans with a step of 10 degrees were carried out for the <italic>ca-ca-n-c</italic> and <italic>ca-ca-c3-n3</italic> dihedrals which appeared to have wrong torsional profiles. The profiles with the GAFF force field in vacuum were then fitted to the QM ones to refine the dihedral parameters. As customary in the case of ligand binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref051">51</xref>], we performed a preliminary metadynamics run using sub-optimal geometrical CV to obtain an initial pathway for the setup of the path collective variables (PCV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref047">47</xref>]. We selected 23 frames from the lowest free energy path obtained in the preliminary run and optimized this initial guess using the methodology described by Branduardi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref047">47</xref>]. To take into account possible rearrangements, we included the C<italic>α</italic> atoms of the A-loop and of the <italic>α</italic>C-helix in the definition of the PCVs. The 2 PCVs <italic>s</italic> and <italic>z</italic> were used to run a 300 ns metadynamics. The height of the Gaussians was set at 2.0 kJ/mol with a deposition rate of 1/2000 steps and a bias factor of 10. The Gaussian width used for the CVs was 0.1 for <italic>s</italic> and 0.003 for <italic>z</italic>. The free energy corresponding to the last leg of the unbinding mechanism (from the external binding pose to a fully solvated state) was computed again by using Well-tempered metadynamics following the approach of Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref052">52</xref>].</p>

<p>Src was expressed and purified following the procedure detailed in Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref053">53</xref>]. For the first two mutants, an auto-induction protocol was used to reach a good bacterial expression. Thermodynamic binding parameters for the association of imatinib to Src wild type and to the designed mutants were acquired using a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (MicroCal Inc.). The sample solution consisted of 2 ml 0.1 mM protein in MES buffer (pH 6.5) supplemented with 2% DMSO. The ligand solution consisted of 2 ml 1.6 mM imatinib in MES buffer (pH 6.5) with 2% DMSO.

<p>The aim is to assess if there is a correlation between the changes in sub-<italic>μ</italic>s dynamics of the TK structure (both in WT proteins and drug-resistant mutants) and the binding affinity of imatinib. We probed the changes in sub-<italic>μ</italic>s dynamics by comparing the root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) of the C<sub><italic>α</italic></sub> averaged over 30ns-long time windows. Among the most common drug-resistant Abl mutants found in relapsing leukemia patients, we selected the gatekeeper mutant (T315I) and four others far from the binding site (allosteric) having a strong impact on imatinib binding (higher IC<sub>50</sub> values, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004578.t001">Table 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref054">54</xref>]. Apart from the widely discussed gatekeeper mutant (T315I), the mechanism of resistance of the others is completely unknown.</p>
<p>In addition to Abl and its mutants, we selected a pool of homologous tyrosine kinases that, while sharing the same imatinib binding mode, are inhibited by it with varying strength (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004578.t001">Table 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref055">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref059">59</xref>].</p>
<p>The RMSFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004578.g002">Fig 2</xref>) show that all the Abl mutants and the imatinib weak-binders TKs (Src, Met and EGFR) are more rigid than WT Abl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref029">29</xref>]. The regions most affected are the functionally-relevant regions of the N-lobe (p-loop, <italic>α</italic>C-helix and the <italic>β</italic>3-<italic>α</italic>C loop), the A-loop and, to a lesser extent, the <italic>α</italic>G-helix, whose flexibility profiles are more “Src-like” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref029">29</xref>]. An analysis of the diffusion of the dynamics in the space defined by the first two principal component vectors of Abl is also consistent with the rigidification of the mutants (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004578.s009">S9 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>The DFG-out states, with the notable exception of G250E and T315I, are even more rigid, indicating a probable entropic penalty with respect to the DFG-in states (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004578.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). The <italic>β</italic>3-<italic>α</italic>C loop, which is known to play a role in the allosteric activation of Abl by the SH2 domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref060">60</xref>] is the most affected element.</p>
<p>The A-loop is more rigid in most mutants and in all the weak-binders group (Src, Met and EGFR), while it is comparatively more flexible in the strong imatinib binders (Abl, Kit and Lck). A-loop flexibility and IC<sub>50</sub> are anti-correlated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004578.t001">Table 1</xref>). Finally, the <italic>α</italic>G-helix, an hotspot for allosteric regulation in TKs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref061">61</xref>], is very flexible in the weak-binding group and in E279K resistant mutant (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004578.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) and can experience unique conformational changes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004578.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). The clinical drug-resistant mutants of Abl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref016">16</xref>] are prevalently located in regions of the structure whose flexibility varies across weak and strong-binding TKs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004578.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). This should not be surprising, as the observed flexibility changes affect regions that are either directly involved in the binding of type II inhibitors (the DFG-motif, A-loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref025">25</xref>] and p-loop. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref062">62</xref>], see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004578.s001">S1 Fig</xref>)) or allosterically connected to the former (<italic>α</italic>C-helix, <italic>α</italic>G-helix, <italic>β</italic>3-<italic>α</italic>C loop) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref040">40</xref>]. Thus, the change in the sub-<italic>μ</italic>s dynamics of these regions could affect the entropic contribution to the relative stability of the inactive and active states, in turn decreasing the binding affinity of imatinib and other type II inhibitors that bind to an inactive state.</p>

<title>Site-Directed Mutagenesis</title>
<p>To understand whether inducing a change in the flexibility of relevant structural motifs is sufficient to increase the drug sensitivity, we designed a number of Src KD mutants and measured the changes in K<sub>d</sub>.</p>
<p>We engineered mutations in four different locations, the P-loop (Q275), the <italic>β</italic>3-<italic>α</italic>C loop (P299) the A-loop (Q420) and the <italic>α</italic>G-helix (V461), to the equivalent residues in Abl and Lck. The residues to be substituted were chosen in the functionally-relevant regions showing a major variation in the sub-<italic>μ</italic>s dynamics, between the weak and strong imatinib binders. We first performed MD simulations and compared the flexibility of various mutants to that of Src WT. Based on the RMSF we choose three candidates for the experiments. The first bears Q275A, P299Q and Q420E substitutions (Src to Lck), the second Q275G, P299E and Q420A (Src to Abl) and a third one with Q275A, P299Q and V461S (Src to Abl).</p>
<p>The RMSF shows an increased flexibility in the N-lobe (p-loop, <italic>β</italic>3-<italic>α</italic>C loop and <italic>α</italic>C helix) compared to Src WT (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004578.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). For the mutant Q275G/P299E/Q420A, also an increase in A-loop flexibility was identified. In the Q275G/P299E/V461S mutant was introduced a mutation on the <italic>α</italic>G-helix, that has provoked a suppression of the fluctuations in this area, resembling the <italic>α</italic>G-helix of Abl. The K<sub>d</sub> appear to be anti-correlated with the RMSF of the A-loop (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004578.t002">Table 2</xref>). As a cross-validation, when a chimeric protein with the entire <italic>α</italic>C-helix of Abl was produced, we observed a general suppression of the dynamics and an increased K<sub>d</sub> of 14 <italic>μ</italic>M. At difference with previous studies reporting similar K<sub>d</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref026">26</xref>], the mutated residues are far from the binding site and do not interact with the drug.</p>

<title>Conformational Dynamics</title>
<p>If the correlation between changes in the sub-<italic>μ</italic>s dynamics and imatinib affinity observed in the MD simulations and validated by experiments is due to entropic effects it must be reflected in the conformational free energy landscape (and in the entropic contribution to the relative stabilities of the DFG-in and -out states). As discussed above, Imatinib binds to an inactive state in which both the conformation of the DFG motif and that of the A-loop are important. In non-phosphorylated TKs the active-like “open” state in which the A-loop is extended, is marginally populated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref063">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref064">64</xref>]. The DFG-out inactive state has a significant thermodynamic penalty and (according to the observed changes in the sub-<italic>μ</italic>s dynamics) is in most cases entropically disfavored. In both inactive states the delicate balance between entropic and enthalpic contributions are crucial in defining their stability with respect to the open, DFG-in active state. This balance can be easily upset by drug-resistant mutations either directly or through the allosteric network. Thus a mutation affecting the entropy / enthalpy balance of the active and inactive states could easily shift the kinase towards active state, decreasing the binding affinity of type II inhibitors. Indeed, the stabilization of the active (extended A-loop) conformation has been experimentally observed for many TK gatekeeper mutants (including Abl T315I) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref065">65</xref>].</p>
<p>To further investigate this issue, we performed large-scale multiple-replica PT-MetaD simulations and computed the fully converged conformational free energy landscape associated with the DFG-flip of the five drug-resistant mutants. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004578.g003">Fig 3</xref> we report the FES projected as a function of two collective variables (CVs) that distinguish the DFG-in from the DFG-out state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref029">29</xref>], namely the distance between the DFG Asp<sub>404</sub> and Lys<sub>295</sub> and between the DFG Phe<sub>405</sub> and Ile<sub>293</sub> (Src numbering). As expected, for all mutants the global minimum of the FES corresponds to the DFG-in state (basin “IN” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004578.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The mutants also explore the DFG-out state (basin “OUT”), which in most cases corresponds to a well-defined metastable minimum. All mutations alter significantly the conformational free energy landscape. The free energy penalty of the DFG-out state increases going from Abl WT and G250E (ΔG of 4 ± 0.5 kcal/mol) to E450K (6 kcal/mol), H396P and E279K (7 ± 0.5 and 8 ± 0.5 kcal/mol). The gatekeeper T315I and (to a lesser extent) G250E are significant exceptions as the ΔG associated to their DFG-flip is very close to that of the WT. The increased thermodynamic penalty is due to a net entropic loss of the DFG-out state, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004578.t003">Table 3</xref> (the DFG-in/-out free energy differences as a function of the temperature are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004578.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). Again T315I and G250E are special cases as there is an entropic gain for the DFG-out state. The entropic contributions to the DFG flip are in excellent agreement with the observed changes in the sub-<italic>μ</italic>s dynamics.</p>

<p>Indeed in H396P and E279K, where the A-loop is significantly more rigid, the flip has a larger free energy penalty. In the cases of G250E and the T315I gatekeeper mutant the penalty for the flip is comparable to that of the WT, and in agreement with the observed increased flexibility of the N-lobe and A-loop in the DFG-out state, there is an entropic gain associated with it. In both cases the DFG-out has a peculiar geometry where both Asp<sub>404</sub> and Phe<sub>405</sub> point outwards (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004578.s004">S4 Fig</xref>) and an open active-like extended A-loop conformation is observed.</p>
<p>To quantify this aspect, we analyzed how the population of the “open” state is altered by the mutations. We re-projected the free energy surfaces (FES) as a function of path variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref047">47</xref>] describing the opening of the A-loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004578.g004">Fig 4</xref>) with respect to Src (CV1) and Abl (CV2).</p>

<p>Abl, Src and E279K mainly populate semi-closed and closed conformations (basin B and C), while G250E, T315I and to a lesser extent E450K, H396P show a minimum in correspondence of the open A-loop (basin A, CV1 &lt; 6). The A-loop in these and other mutants tends to form a second helix turn as in Src (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004578.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). The residues involved are Asp<sub>391</sub> to Ala<sub>395</sub>, which in the case of H396P are right before the mutation. The formation of this helix has been shown to stabilize the extended A-loop active state in TKs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref010">10</xref>] and is also involved in the mechanism of oncogenic mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref012">12</xref>]. The stabilization of the active state is known to weaken the binding of ATP-competitive inhibitors to oncogenic mutants of EGFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref012">12</xref>] and in the phosphorylated form of Abl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref026">26</xref>]. In the case of T315I the observed stabilization of the active state is in agreement with multiple experimental observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref065">65</xref>].</p>
<p>Finally, we also observe a loss of structural integrity of the <italic>α</italic>C and <italic>α</italic>G helices in the DFG-out state of most mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004578.s004">S4 Fig</xref>) in agreement with previous proposals stating that conformational transitions in kinases are accompanied by local unfolding of secondary structural elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref066">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref067">67</xref>].</p>

<title>Binding Mechanism</title>
<p>Our results appear to be consistent with a significant impact of the resistant mutations on two different conformational changes: the DFG flip, disfavoring the drug-binding conformation (mainly mutants with rigidified A-loop and N-lobe), and the opening of the A-loop, possibly favoring the locking of the kinase in an active form. However, from the simulations on the unbound kinases, we cannot rule out an effect of the gatekeeper mutation on the proposed “induced-fit” mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref014">14</xref>]. Indeed, the predicted ΔG associated to the DFG-flip of T315I, which is very close to that of the WT, leaves two hypotheses open. Either the weaker binding of imatinib is due to the observed stabilization of the extended A-loop active state, or to the suppression of an induced fit effect, possibly acting on the p-loop conformation. To clarify this point and shed more light on the binding mechanism itself, we have computed the binding free energy of imatinib to Abl WT and Abl T315I along a physical association pathway. The use of such an approach, albeit it is significantly more expensive than an “end-point” free energy calculation (e.g. thermodynamic integration) has the advantage of reporting on free energy barriers and thus on the binding and unbinding kinetics. As expected, the crystallographic binding pose corresponds in both cases to the deepest minimum. Starting from that pose, the bidimensional (un-)binding free energy profiles show a substantial difference in imatinib’s mechanisms of binding to Abl WT and T315I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004578.g005">Fig 5</xref>). In the WT kinase the barrier to unbinding is lower (in agreement with the observed differences in unbinding kinetics) and there is one main exit path. It is also interesting to note that we find an “external binding pose” from which the inhibitor slides to its final crystallographic binding pose. In the external binding pose the DFG motif is already in the “out” position. In T315I we observe two different unbinding / binding pathways (B’ and E, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004578.g005">Fig 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004578.s010">S10 Fig</xref>) somewhat similar to previous proposals. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004578.ref068">68</xref>] In both of them the p-loop has a significant role. A pose similar to the external binding pose observed in the WT kinase is present (C’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004578.g005">Fig 5</xref>) but it is slightly shifted towards the <italic>α</italic>C helix and more stable than in the WT. Thus the gain in free energy from the external binding pose to the final (crystallographic) pose is lower, in agreement with the observed increase of the IC<sub>50</sub>. When the unbinding free energy from C to a fully solvated state is accounted for (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004578.s013">S13 Fig</xref>), the overall free energy difference from the unbound fully solvated state to the crystallographic pose is around 13 kcal ± 2 (the larger convergence error is due to the algorithms used). When the free energy penalty of the DFG flip (≃ 4 kcal) is subtracted, we get 9 kcal ± 2, in agreement with the calorimetric and IC<sub>50</sub> experimental data. It is thus clear that the effect of the T315I gatekeeper mutation is dual. It both affects the binding mechanism and stabilizes the active, extended A-loop conformation.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We have studied the interplay between sub-<italic>μ</italic>s dynamics and conformational dynamics in TKs, and how these are influenced by drug-resistant mutations impacting Type-II inhibitors binding. Overall, our simulations show that drug-resistant mutations have a significant effect on both the sub-<italic>μ</italic>s dynamics and the conformational free energy landscape. They affect the energy and the population of the DFG-out inactive state and of the open A-loop active-like state. Since type II inhibitors bind to the inactive kinase, a more accessible DFG-out state leads to a stronger binding of imatinib and other type II inhibitors. On the contrary, a more populated active-like state, in which the A-loop is elongated, increases the affinity towards ATP and disfavors type II inhibitors.</p>
<p>The selected drug-resistant mutants fall in two partially overlapping categories: those that have a significantly higher free energy penalty for the DFG-out state (E279K, H396P) and those (G250E, E450K, T315I) that populate the A-loop open active-like state. What is more the T315I gatekeeper mutant has a significant impact on the binding mechanism itself and on the binding kinetics.</p>
<p>The mutations affect the free energy differences associated to the conformational changes mainly by changing the sub-<italic>μ</italic>s dynamics and consequently the entropy / enthalpy balance of the different states. Thus, relative short MD simulations, by revealing changes in the sub-<italic>μ</italic>s dynamics, might be used to predict the impact of new mutations on Imatinib resistance.</p>
<p>The important role played by the entropic penalty of the DFG-out state must also be kept in mind when comparing low temperature and room temperature experiments. On the whole, we characterized the mechanism of action of several drug-resistant mutants of Abl. We have shown the link between fast and slow dynamics in these complex systems, providing a deeper understanding of the thermodynamics, kinetics and allosteric regulation of type II inhibitor binding TKs. In perspective, our results could help the design of fast and predictive computational approaches to predict the effect of yet unknown mutations of TKs.</p>
