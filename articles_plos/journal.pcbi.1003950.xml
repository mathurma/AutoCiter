<abstract>
<p>The link between genetic regulation and the definition of form and size during morphogenesis remains largely an open question in both plant and animal biology. This is partially due to the complexity of the process, involving extensive molecular networks, multiple feedbacks between different scales of organization and physical forces operating at multiple levels. Here we present a conceptual and modeling framework aimed at generating an integrated understanding of morphogenesis in plants. This framework is based on the biophysical properties of plant cells, which are under high internal turgor pressure, and are prevented from bursting because of the presence of a rigid cell wall. To control cell growth, the underlying molecular networks must interfere locally with the elastic and/or plastic extensibility of this cell wall. We present a model in the form of a three dimensional (3D) virtual tissue, where growth depends on the local modulation of wall mechanical properties and turgor pressure. The model shows how forces generated by turgor-pressure can act both cell autonomously and non-cell autonomously to drive growth in different directions. We use simulations to explore lateral organ formation at the shoot apical meristem. Although different scenarios lead to similar shape changes, they are not equivalent and lead to different, testable predictions regarding the mechanical and geometrical properties of the growing lateral organs. Using flower development as an example, we further show how a limited number of gene activities can explain the complex shape changes that accompany organ outgrowth.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>In recent years, much research in molecular and developmental biology has been devoted to unravelling the mechanisms that govern the development of living systems. This includes the identification of key molecular networks that control shape formation and their response to hormonal regulation. However, a key challenge now is to understand how these signals, which arise at cellular scale, are physically translated into growth at organ scale, and how these shape changes feed back into molecular regulation systems. To address this question, we developed a computational framework to model the mechanics of 3D tissues during growth at cellular resolution. In our approach, gene regulation is related to tissue mechanical properties through a constitutive tensorial growth equation. Our computational system makes it possible to integrate this equation in both space and time over the growing multicellular structure in close to interactive time. We demonstrate the interest of such a framework to study morphogenesis by constructing a model of flower development, showing how regulation of regional identities can, by dynamically modulating the mechanical properties of cells, lead to realistic shape development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The control of form and size is a central issue in developmental biology. It is commonly accepted that genetic regulation is at the basis of morphogenesis. However, while molecular genetics has provided an important number of actors required for morphogenetic events, the link between these regulators and global shape control remains largely an open question in both plant and animal biology. Furthermore, the contribution of multicellularity in shape changes and growth remains poorly explored. In fact, certain species exhibit complex shapes while being composed of only one giant and multinucleated cell (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003950.s001">S1 Fig.</xref>). This raises the question of the exact contribution of the presence of neighboring cells in the growth of a given cell, within a tissue. So far, this issue has mainly been addressed from a signaling point of view (e.g. diffusion of morphogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Jaeger1">[1]</xref>, mechanical feedbacks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Shraiman1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Hamant1">[3]</xref>), but the role of multicellularity in the biophysics of growth remains to be formalized.</p>
<p>Here we consider this issue in plants. Plant cells are under high internal turgor pressure and it is only the presence of a rigid exoskeleton that prevents them from bursting. This exoskeleton, the cell wall, is composed of a dense network of cellulose microfibrils that are cross-linked to each other by a network of polysaccharides. Sachs, as early as in 1882 (reviewed in e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Kutschera1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Hamant2">[5]</xref>) discovered that cell expansion can only take place as long as the cells are under pressure, which has led to the concept of turgor-driven cell growth. It is now widely accepted that this involves the irreversible (plastic) yielding of the cell wall to this pressure, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Cosgrove1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>Based on this general concept of wall yielding a now widely accepted general scenario was proposed by Lockhart to describe the growth of an isolated cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Lockhart1">[7]</xref>. This scenario can be summarized as follows. In a non-growing isolated cell, the internal pressure is counterbalanced by the tension in the cell wall. If this pressure further increases and reaches a certain threshold, the load bearing parts of the cell wall yield. Lockhart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Lockhart1">[7]</xref> proposed to model this viscoplastic process with a simple relationship between 2 key variables, the relative rate of growth of the cell volume <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003950.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and the cell turgor pressure <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003950.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>: if the pressure is greater than a fixed threshold <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003950.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the flow of water is not a limiting factor, then the cell yields and the rate of growth is proportional to the excess of turgor pressure:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003950.e004"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003950.e004" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003950.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denotes the extensibility of the cell, i.e. its ability to grow under a given pressure, the inverse of its viscosity. If the turgor pressure does not reach the yield threshold <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003950.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, no growth is achieved and the cell deformation is entirely elastic (reversible). Above <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003950.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the cell deformation becomes plastic (irreversible). The potential decrease in pressure due to cell growth is continuously compensated by further water uptake, thus keeping the wall under continuous tension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Kutschera1">[4]</xref>. In other words, in a single cell system, growth can be entirely described in terms of the variations of the internal turgor pressure and of the mechanical properties of the cell wall.</p>
<p>The initial formulation of Lockhart and subsequent models did not account for cell geometry and anisotropic properties of wall material. Recently, Dumais and coworkers applied Lockhart's model of cell growth to cell walls, and extended it to account for wall anisotropic properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Dumais1">[8]</xref>. They introduced a model of tip-growing cells (e.g. root hairs) that combines two key processes of cell growth, namely the deposition of material on cell walls and the mechanical deformation of the cell wall due to stresses resulting from the cell's inner turgor pressure. Interestingly, the authors show that the Lockhart growth equation can be simply extended in 3 dimensions to take into account wall anisotropy. This leads to 3 equations (instead of one) that express how the rate of deformation in the 3 directions of space are affected by mechanical anisotropy in the cell walls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Dumais1">[8]</xref>. With the help of this model, the authors could analyze the dynamics of a tip growing cell, and how the visco-elastic properties of cell walls may impact its shape in steady or non-steady regimes.</p>
<p>In a multicellular context, morphogenesis relies on differential growth across tissues. Each cell may feature specific values for the various parameters (turgor pressure, yielding threshold, extensibility…) used in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003950.e004">Eq.(1)</xref>. In principle, the regulation and coordination of these parameters is achieved through the action of the molecular regulatory networks that control the composition and mechanical properties of the cell wall, as described by the black arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g001">Fig. 1</xref>. For example, cell wall modifying enzymes such as expansins, xyloglucan endo-tranglycosylases or pectin modifying enzymes are known to be triggered by transcription factors such as APETALA2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Yant1">[9]</xref>, MONOPTEROS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Schlereth1">[10]</xref> and AGAMOUS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-GomezMena1">[11]</xref>. At the scale of the cell wall, actions of such enzymes have the potential to increase or decrease the viscosity and/or the rigidity of the wall. As a consequence, extensibility <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003950.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003950.e004">Eq.(1)</xref> may be modified and affect growth.</p>

<p>Although the general concepts described above are widely accepted, they do not explain how genetic determinants collectively generate an organism with a particular shape. The situation is made even more complex because morphogenetic events at the multicellular level can feed back on the cellular or molecular scale. Morphogen gradients, for example, are limited by the geometry of the tissue in which they diffuse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Jaeger1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Shraiman1">[2]</xref> and mechanical stresses generated by differences in growth rate within an organ can potentially feed back on cellular growth directions and rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Hamant1">[3]</xref>. It is therefore not self-evident to explain how a particular gene by interfering with local cell wall properties influences the overall shape of an organ. To proceed further and to explore hypotheses linking in an intricate way gene function to morphogenesis, a computational modeling framework is required (red bold arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
<p>In a seminal series of papers, Coen and colleagues have proposed such a framework for tissue growth, termed the Growing Polarized Tissue (GPT) framework, that can capture overall growth rates and directions of tissues in three dimensions while taking into account mechanical interactions between different regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Coen1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Kennaway1">[14]</xref>). With this method, the authors were able to propose hypotheses for the genetic regulation of organ formation in different species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Kennaway1">[14]</xref>. This framework was the first system able to simulate 3D organ development and shapes based on plausible genetic regulation hypotheses. However, in GPT gene functions are expressed in relatively abstract terms. This is mainly because it models events occurring at the scale of entire tissue regions. Recently, several attempts were made to develop other modeling frameworks at cellular resolution and to build mechanical models of morphogenesis for multicellular tissues. To reduce complexity, these models have been initially restricted to 2 dimensions either in the plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Dupuy1">[15]</xref> for algae, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Dupuy2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Merks1">[17]</xref> for leaves and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Dupuy2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Fozard1">[18]</xref> for roots), or on 2D surfaces in 3D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Hamant1">[3]</xref> for shoot apical meristems). However, new technologies to image and segment the complete volume of multicellular tissues in 3D at wall resolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Fernandez1">[19]</xref> and to measure cell mechanics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Peaucelle1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Milani1">[21]</xref> now lead to new questions regarding the interactions between cells in three dimensions. Addressing these questions, requires a new generation of models, able to account for the genetic regulation of biophysical processes in 3D multicellular systems. Here, we present such a modeling framework where cell growth results from the deformation of walls that are under tension in the tissue. A tensorial formalism is used to account for the anisotropic nature of cell wall material and to model wall deformation based on a generalized Lockhart viscoplastic law. An adapted finite element method has been designed to carry out efficient numerical simulations. This computational framework is then used to analyze the development of the early flower bud and test the effect of different regulation hypotheses.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Prior to describing our computational framework to model multicellular tissue growth, let us analyze the physical situation of a small region - a cell or a portion of a cell wall - in a growing tissue.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Multicellular growth involves both cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous forces</title>
<p>Similarly to isolated cells, cells in plant tissues are growing under the action of forces that stretch their wall and make it yield. However, for single isolated cells, the only significant forces able to trigger growth are the ones generated by its turgid cytoplasm pushing on the cell wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). In a multicellular context, the situation is somehow complicated by the fact that cells are rigidly connected to each other. The deformation of one cell generates physical constraints on its neighbors and vice versa. It has been recognized by Sachs as early as in 1882 (cited by Kutschera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Kutschera1">[4]</xref>) that epidermis cells in plant tissues are experiencing external forces due to the inner turgid cell layers pushing outwards against the surface cells, and inducing tension stresses in the epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). In a plant tissue, the mechanical stresses undergone by one cell wall are thus not only due to their own turgid cytoplasm, that we call <italic>cell autonomous stresses</italic>, but also comprise the physical constraints imposed by the neighboring cells, called the <italic>non-cell autonomous stresses</italic>.</p>

<title>Origin of forces driving growth in a multicellular tissue.</title>
<p>(A) In the single-cell case, the mechanical (elastic) stresses (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003950.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, dark blue double arrows) undergone by the cell wall are due to the inner pressure (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003950.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, light blue single arrows) of the cell. The mechanical equilibrium within this wall is regulated by the cell itself. (B) In a tissular case, (here a shoot apical meristem), mechanical stresses <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003950.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> within the outer cell walls of the L1 layer (light red cells), can be modulated by remote cells (here in light green). In this case the stem (light blue cells) plays the role of a base on which the inner cells rely in order to push the L1 layer upward. (C) Three main modalities of growth can be considered in a multicellular context (details on the stresses equilibrium within the outer cell wall are represented in the zooming views). From an initial state (C1) of the growing tissue three scenarios are considered: (C2) &amp; (C3) present cell-autonomous ways where growth of a given cell is triggered by an increase of its inner pressure or a modulation of its wall mechanical properties respectively. (C4) represents a non-cell-autonomous case in which growth of the studied cell is initiated by physical alteration of its neighbors. (C5) All three modifications result in the local outgrowth of the considered region.</p>

<p>Genes can regulate growth by controlling processes that modulate these stresses. Cell autonomous stresses can be modulated directly by the cell itself. This can be done in two ways: either by increasing the cell's own turgor pressure or by modulating the mechanical properties of its wall (e.g. by changing its elasticity or its yielding threshold). In contrast, non-cell autonomous stresses reflect distant mechanical interaction between cells where genes are being expressed and the ones where the consequences of this expression are observed.</p>
<p>Let us illustrate these different possibilities in the context of a primordium outgrowth on a growing meristematic dome, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>. As discussed above, any specific cell of the epidermis is suject to three types of stresses: <italic>i</italic>) the stress <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003950.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> induced by the cell's inner turgor pressure on the wall <italic>ii</italic>) the stress <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003950.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> resulting from the action of the rest of the tissue on the cell wall and <italic>iii</italic>) the stress <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003950.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> due to the cell wall elastic deformation in reaction to the other stresses.

<p>The situation is complex as, if one of these stress components is affected by some regulation mechanism, all the other stresses will in turn be affected. Moreover, in real plants several of these regulations may be triggered at the same time, leading to even more complex interactions between regulation and growth. Therefore, to understand the growth of multicellular tissues, one needs to model both cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous growth. How can this be achieved?</p>

<title>Computational framework to model local deformations in tissues</title>
<p>Both cell and non-cell autonomous growth rely on turgor-generated forces that are directly translated into mechanical stresses within the cell walls. Therefore considering a mechanical stress-based growth mechanism ensures that both types of growth are taken into consideration. Depending on their mechanical properties, the cell wall deform in response to the direction and intensity of these stresses. We assume that each small wall region of each cell in the tissue, at any time <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003950.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, has a rest shape, i.e. the shape that the region would have if isolated from the rest of the tissue. Under the effect of the tissue stresses due to turgor pressure and connection to other cells, each small region is elastically deformed with respect to its rest shape. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that the thickness of the wall is kept at a constant value during growth (we do not model the details of the wall remodeling process itself). We also assume that the thickness of the walls has no major mechanical effect at this scale of analysis and therefore can be integrated in the wall's in-plane properties. Then, if the region is chosen sufficiently small, the wall deformation can be assimilated to an affine transformation and represented by a matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003950.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> called the deformation gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g003">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic>-<italic>B</italic></xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Model</xref> section for mathematical details).

<title>Formalization of plastic growth of a small region of wall.</title>
<p>A tissue region is in general observed as a deformed object in a real tissue (A) due to local stresses internal to the tissue (light blue arrows). Taken outside its tissue context, without any stress on its borders, the region has a rest shape (B). Note that this rest shape is not actually observed. The transformation matrix to pass from the rest shape to the observed deformed shape is denoted <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003950.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Due to changes in stress distribution in time, at a subsequent date the stress configuration acting on the region changes (dark blue arrows) and induces a new deformation of the region (C). If the intensity of the elastic deformation between the former rest shape (B) and the new deformed object (C) is above a certain threshold, then plastic growth is triggered: the rest shape is remodeled by the cell by adding material to the wall (D) which reduces the elastic strain. This change is made according to a constitutive rule that describes the material plasticity (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Model</xref> section below). As a result, the transformation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003950.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from the old rest state (B) to the new deformed state has been decomposed as a product of a reversible term <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003950.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and an irreversible term <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003950.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> representing growth.</p>

<p>The forces that act on a region may vary throughout time, notably through either direct or indirect genetic regulation. Regions may be subject to new stress distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g003">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>), inducing new strains. In the spirit of Lockhart equation for cell volumes (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003950.e004">Eq. 1</xref>, we assume that if the strains get above some threshold, the walls start to yield and the cell to remodel them.

<p>The above equation describes the plastic deformation evolution of a small region of the tissue, typically a part of a wall, during a small amount of time. To compute the deformation of the whole tissue during development, we need to integrate these local deformations over the whole tissue and throughout time, so that all these elements are assembled in a symplastic manner in the deformed tissue. This computation is made by minimizing the global mechanical energy in the tissue (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Model</xref> section). The strain and stress configuration of each region will thus be chosen so that the mechanical energy is minimal among all possible combinations of local elastic deformations that preserve the integrity of the tissue and the adjacency of cell walls. By contrast, the rest configuration of each individual small region is not necessarily compatible with that of other regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Mandel1">[25]</xref>, i.e. there may not be physical continuity between rest configurations.

<title>A comparative analysis of the putative mechanisms behind organogenesis at the shoot apical meristem</title>
<p>We next used our modeling framework to analyze organogenesis at the shoot apical meristem (SAM). The SAM is a population of stem cells that continuously initiates new stem tissues and lateral organs, thus generating all the aerial parts of the plant. We first constructed a model of the SAM as a dome made up of polyhedra representing the 3-D cells and rigidly connected to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g004">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>).

<p>In this initial configuration, the turgor pressure induces a stress that puts all the cell walls under tension. If the plastic growth threshold <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003950.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is reached, the dome grows isotropically in all the directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g004">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). This plastic deformation is accompanied by a decrease of inner pressure in cells as their volume increases due to growth. <italic>In vivo</italic>, this would lead to a difference in water potential between the cells within the dome and surrounding tissues, drawing new water from below the dome inside the meristematic cells. It is generally assumed that water uptake is combined with osmolyte regulation to maintain turgor relatively constant in the cell during growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Kutschera1">[4]</xref>. As these processes are considered fast compared with growth, we simply assume in our model that, otherwise stated, the turgor pressure is continuously kept constant at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003950.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>A key feature of meristematic activity is the generation of cylindrical stems and roots. In principle there are several ways to generate axial structures, but there is overwhelming evidence that this is due to a switch from isotropic to anisotropic growth over several cell files. Indeed, when cells leave the meristematic dome, they start to generate cellulose microfibrils in highly ordered arrays, oriented along the circumference of the meristem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Hamant1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Baskin1">[26]</xref>. This microfibril organization creates a high circumferential rigidity that favors growth in the perpendicular axial direction. This mechanical anisotropy can be reproduced in the 3D model by imposing higher rigidity in circumferential direction using anisotropic <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003950.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> tensors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g004">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>). Interestingly, the ability of the microfibrils to create well formed axes depends on the amount of microtubule anisotropy in the dome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g004">Fig. 4<italic>D</italic></xref> dark gray). If too small, a bulge forms at the tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g004">Fig. 4<italic>D</italic></xref>). Intermediate shapes can be obtained by using a less sharp transition between isotropic and anisotropic regions, using e.g. a gradient of anisotropy between the bottom and the top of the dome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g004">Fig. 4<italic>E</italic></xref>).</p>
<p>Next, using this mechanical model of the SAM, we tested different scenarios for organ emergence. As discussed above, several processes can in principle account for this phenomenon, in a cell- or non-cell-autonomous way, including changes in turgor pressure, modifications in wall stiffness and modifications in the rate of wall synthesis.</p>
<p>Starting from the growing dome of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g004">Fig. 4<italic>E</italic></xref>, we first tested the possibility to grow an organ on the dome assuming cell autonomous regulation. For this, we lowered the outer periclinal wall rigidity in a small region close to the tip of the main dome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g004">Fig. 4<italic>F</italic></xref>). This created a bulging zone in the corresponding region of the tissue. We then tested the alternative possibility to create a primordium in a non-cell autonomous manner, by relaxing the wall rigidity up to 10-fold in a group of cells immediately below the previous surface region. No visible bulges could be obtained in this way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g004">Fig. 4<italic>G</italic></xref>–1; compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g004">Fig. 4<italic>G</italic></xref>–2 corresponding to a transversal cut obtained from the simulation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g004">Fig. 4<italic>F</italic></xref> middle that shows a much larger bump at the same stage of development). To further explore the ability of non-cell autonomous stresses to trigger bump outgrowth locally, we also tested the possibility to obtain a bulge by increasing (by up to a 3-fold factor) the turgor pressure in the same group of inner cells. Here again, no clear bulge could be obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g004">Fig. 4<italic>G</italic></xref>–3). In this latter case, we could observe in the transversal cut that the tissues were actually compressed internally. We concluded from this series of simulations that bumps can more easily be generated in the context of cell autonomous regulation.</p>
<p>In this context however, we could observe that the growing bumps were not clearly separated from the main dome (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g004">Fig. 4<italic>F</italic></xref>). We therefore constrained a ring of cells at the surface, around the bump location, to be very rigid. This resulted in a well formed bump growing on the top of the initial dome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g004">Fig. 4<italic>H</italic></xref>). A similar separation between the two organs can be obtained by stiffening the cells of the ring only in the circumferential direction. Interestingly, the cells of the ring are also supporting high stress but are left free to grow in the axial direction of the new bump (compare right images in H and I). A well marked bump can also be created by a less important decrease of the primordium zone rigidity compensated by a local increase of the cell growth rate in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g004">Fig. 4<italic>J</italic></xref>).</p>
<p>The simulations showed how simple scenarios can in principle explain important morphogenetic processes during plant development, including the formation of cylindrical stems and roots and the outgrowth of lateral organs at the SAM. Importantly, although these simulations can lead to comparable shapes, they make different predictions regarding the mechanical properties and resulting growth patterns.</p>

With such an initial configuration, a globular and symmetric dome emerges normal to the surface (<bold>J-K</bold>). Then by tuning the mechanical properties of the Ad/Ab regions we could obtain different asymmetric developments: increasing the rigidity of Ad cells (medium gray) resulted in a restricted development of the upper part of the primordium (<bold>L-M</bold>) while, by contrast, an increased rigidity of the Ab cells (medium gray) shifted the primordium development upwards (<bold>N-O</bold>) as expected.

<p>To address these questions we investigated with our mechanical model how to reproduce, at first qualitatively, the developmental pattern described above. Hereby we distinguished two phases: (a) the initial outgrowth of the bud and (b) the formation of the sepal primordia. For this purpose, we made a number of assumptions based on the literature and on the first set of models described above.</p>
<p>First, we simulated the outgrowth of the flower bud using the following itinerary through successive scenarios:</p>
<p><bold>i</bold> In the first scenario, we tested the possibility to initiate organ outgrowth by a combination of local wall softening in the incipient primordium and anisotropic wall stiffening in the organ boundaries. A number of experimental evidence supports such a scenario. The young primordium is characterized by relatively high concentrations of the plant hormone auxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Reinhardt1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-BarbierdeReuille1">[29]</xref>. There is evidence, that auxin influences cell wall loosening by the activation of specific enzymes. For instance, in the hypocotyl ABP1 (Auxin Binding Protein 1) controls the level of expression of glycosyl hydrolases known to modify hemicellulose within the cell wall, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Paque1">[30]</xref>. At the apex, atomic force microscopy measurements suggested that auxin accumulation leads to cell wall softening via a PMEI3-dependent pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Braybrook1">[31]</xref>. Finally, transcription factors such as AINTEGUMENTA and MONOPTEROS which are homogeneously expressed in the young outgrowing flower bud are thought to regulate the expression of expansins and xyloglucan modifying enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Yant1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Schlereth1">[10]</xref>. Organ boundaries are also characterized by specific gene expression patterns. In particular the CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON transcription factors are strongly expressed between the meristem and the primordium and genetic studies show that they repress growth in this region (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Aida1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Aida2">[33]</xref>). In addition, Hamant et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Hamant1">[3]</xref> found that in the same region, cells are likely to have highly anisotropic wall structure. Based on these observations and on preliminary simulations shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g004">Fig. 4<italic>I</italic></xref>, we assumed the existence of a band of anisotropic cells around the primordium's upper half. As a result, the model produced a bulge normal to the surface with a quasi symmetric shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g005">Fig. 5<italic>J</italic>-<italic>K</italic></xref>).</p>
<p><bold>ii</bold> The next morphologically significant step in organogenesis happens when differential growth behavior between the adaxial and the abaxial regions emerges. At stage 2 (or P2) cells of the abaxial side of the primordium start to expand faster in the meridional direction than the ones from the adaxial region, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g005">Fig. 5<italic>G</italic>-<italic>I</italic></xref>, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Long1">[34]</xref>). To account for that differential growth in our simulations, we assumed that mechanical properties are differentially regulated between the abaxial/adaxial regions. Although there is no strict evidence for differences in mechanical properties, both regions are characterized by specific gene expression patterns early on. For instance, transcription factors such as FIL, KANADI, YABBI or ARF3 and ARF4 are part of interlocking pathways necessary for organ polarity and proper development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Heisler1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Sawa1">[36]</xref>, for reviews see also e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-LaRota1">[27]</xref> and references therein. To account for the faster growth rate in the abaxial region, we first assumed that the abaxially expressed genes caused a lower rigidity in that region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g005">Fig. 5<italic>L</italic>-<italic>M</italic></xref>). This indeed resulted in a developmental abaxial-adaxial asymmetry. However, the organ tended to develop downwards, opposite to what is observed <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p><bold>iii</bold> To correct this behavior, we set rigidities in the primordium zone in the opposite way, i.e. with higher rigidity now in the abaxial region. The summit/adaxial region was now developing faster toward the upper direction but, contrary to observations in actual development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g005">Fig. 5<italic>G</italic>-<italic>I</italic></xref>), with little shape asymmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g005">Fig. 5<italic>N</italic>-<italic>O</italic></xref>). Indeed, <italic>in vivo</italic> observations carried out by e.g. Long et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Long1">[34]</xref> and Fernandez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Fernandez1">[19]</xref> were reporting anisotropic growth in the abaxial side of the floral primordium. The discrepancies in simulations of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g005">Fig. 5<italic>N</italic>-<italic>O</italic></xref> could finally be corrected by setting a high rigidity anisotropy in the abaxial cells. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g005">Fig. 5<italic>P</italic></xref>) The dome asymmetry was then correctly oriented upward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g005">Fig. 5<italic>Q</italic></xref>), with fast development of the abaxial region upwards as expected.</p>
<p>Following on the simulated flower bud growth, we next simulated the outgrowth of sepal primordia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g006">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic>-<italic>B</italic></xref>). To initialize the FEM simulations we constructed a triangle-mesh of the floral meristem at stage 2 based on the segmented image. The vertices of triangles coincide with the cell vertices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g006">Fig. 6<italic>C</italic></xref>). We then reused the mechanical setting of this model to grow the four sepal primordia on the outgrowing dome obtained in phase (a). <italic>In vivo</italic>, this stage is characterized by auxin accumulation at the four sites of sepal initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-vanMourik1">[37]</xref>, followed by the activation of genes that promote organ outgrowth - in particular AINTEGUMENTA - first in the abaxial and adaxial sepals, then in the lateral ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g006">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>). Simultaneously, organ boundary genes are activated at the flower meristem boundary and in between the primordia. As for the flower bud simulations presented above, we translated these gene expression domains into zones with different mechanical properties, i.e. wall loosening in the primordia and a anisotropic stiffening in the boundaries as described above. Again the rigidity in the abaxial regions was set higher than in the adaxial ones. We also assumed that the initiation of lateral sepals was slightly delayed with respect to the adaxial/abaxial pair. Based on initial geometric structures obtained from confocal microscopy, the resulting simulation was able to reproduce the developmental dynamics of a flower bud and its first lateral organs based on a spatio-temporal synchronization of the changes in mechanical properties of regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g006">Fig. 6<italic>D</italic></xref>).</p>

The respective development of the different zone is indicated by small bars at the meristem surface. This growth pattern is accompanied by a change in gene expression patterns. At stage one, the floral bud is characterized by adaxially (light blue) and abaxially (dark blue) expressed genes. Other genes such as LFY and ANT are first expressed throughout the young flower. When the sepals start to grow out abaxial and adaxial domains are again established in these young organs (resp. dark and light pink), characterized by specific expression patterns (e.g. REV or FIL). Other genes, such as ANT or AHP6 will finally remain active throughout the pink zones that will generate the sepals (dark and light pink). Boundary zones, characterized by genes like CUC (red) separate the primordia from the meristem proper, where genes like STM (green) are active.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Modeling strategies are increasingly used to help understanding the mechanisms behind shape changes and to make predictions. However, so far models have been either relatively abstract, by focusing on the instructing role of the gene network rather than on the physical constraints of cell growth, or well-defined biophysically but weakly connected to the gene network and its regulatory role. In addition, models able to simulate in a realistic way in 3 dimensions the development of organs on the basis of cellular regulation were missing.</p>
<p>Here we present such a conceptual and modeling framework that is able to integrate the genetic input and the mechanical determinants of the cell in a 3D multicellular context. Using this framework, we tested different scenarios relevant to shape changes and made a number of predictions for organogenesis at the shoot apical meristem. Importantly, our approach does not overlook the complexity that relates to multicellularity, but fully incorporates it by taking into account both cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous forces in 3D tissues.</p>
<p>In the past decade several modeling frameworks have been proposed that are aimed at providing insight at multiple levels of organization and regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Dumais1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Green1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Dupuy2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Fozard1">[18]</xref>. The framework we propose here presents three significant complements to these existing models. First, we explicitly formalize growth of plant cells in tissues taking into account our current knowledge on the mechanisms controlling growth at the cellular level. The resulting equation allows us to make precise prediction on the primary function of molecular regulators in terms of four local parameters i.e. turgor pressure, wall extensibility, wall elasticity, and yield threshold. Second, taking advantage of both the availability of increased computer power and novel computing techniques we were able to design a model tissue with cellular resolution in 3D. This integrates a new data structure to handle multicellular tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Pradal1">[38]</xref> used by other groups for tissue simulation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Fozard1">[18]</xref>) and the use of the modeling software platform SOFA for mechanical simulation in biology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Faure1">[39]</xref>. The platform makes it possible to express the mechanical, geometrical and simulation components in a completely modular way and optimizes the computational overhead during simulations by making use of efficient implicit integration solvers. As a result, simulation in 3D of flower development can be achieved in near interactive time. The model is able to handle several hundreds of cells, and can take into account both biochemical and physical properties of cells. Third, by fully accounting for the complexity behind multicellularity, this framework allows us to compare the contribution of cell autonomous forces and non cell autonomous forces in shape changes. Our conceptual framework notably integrates the mechanical outputs from the gene regulatory network in each individual cells and the secondary effects deriving from growth of neighboring cells. It also provides us new means to quantitatively investigate the contribution of geometrical, biochemical and mechanical interactions in growth regulation with cell wall resolution.</p>
<p>The simulations carried out on both synthetic and realistic templates pose a number of interesting questions that now have to be addressed experimentally. First, the plant seems to have the possibility to create similar shapes through different pathways. Growth rates in the organ boundaries, for example, can be restricted by modifying wall stiffness, wall anisotropy or combinations thereof. In parallel, organ outgrowth can be promoted by reducing wall stiffness and/or by increasing the rate of wall synthesis. Interestingly, the model may help us establish a hierarchy between developmental scenarios and organize the plausibility of developmental scenarios and to organize accordingly experimental investigations. For example, to create a realistic primordium on the meristem dome, simulations clearly indicated that the intuitive solution consisting of softening the abaxial zone is the least plausible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g005">Fig. 5<italic>L</italic>-<italic>M</italic></xref>). This forced us to explore other, less intuitive hypotheses consisting instead of loosening the adaxial zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003950-g005">Fig. 5<italic>N</italic>-<italic>Q</italic></xref>), and that appeared to be more realistic. Another interesting outcome concerns the number of different gene activities that are required to generate an organ primordium or a flower bud. Whereas gene expression studies have revealed a complex partitioning of the growing flower bud in different domains, the simulations carried out on realistic templates, suggest that only five domains (central zone, peripheral whorl, abaxial and adaxial domains and boundary) with specific wall modifying activities would be sufficient. These hypotheses should now be tested. This will include classical approaches such as gene expression studies and transgenic approach, but also more challenging techniques required for quantitative growth analysis. At this stage, the simulations already suggest a number of relatively straightforward experiments. Differences in wall stiffness between adaxial and abaxial domains can be measured, for example using atomic force microscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Milani1">[21]</xref>. Correlations between organ outgrowth and the expression of genes involved in wall modifications can also be made. Modifications in wall anisotropy at the abaxial side of the primordia -as suggested by the model - can even be monitored in vivo by direct observation of microtubule dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Hamant1">[3]</xref>. Metrics will also have to be developed to compare quantitatively results of mechanical simulations and the observed, actual geometry of developing organs. Based on the recent progresses in imaging protocols, cell segmentation and tracking softwares, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Fernandez1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-BarbierdeReuille2">[40]</xref>, it will now become possible to routinely compare the simulated development of particular cellular regions (e.g. central zone, primordium, abaxial/adaxial, frontier zone,…) with the observed ones based on a quantitative comparison of their principal direction of growth, rate of growth, and of various shape factors such as local curvature, degree of symmetry, compacity, <italic>etc</italic>. In turn, this opens the way to the development of inverse modeling techniques, where the estimation of some mechanical parameters that are difficult to measure, will be derived from minimizing the distance between simulated and observed developing shapes.</p>
<p>The current version of the model also has some limitations. In particular, it currently does not include cell division. Generic rules for cell division have been proposed in the literature, e.g. see recent works <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Sahlin1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Besson1">[42]</xref> and references therein. However, in the meristem, the validity of these rules has not been thoroughly assessed, and in particular, the way cells divide in the inner layers of meristem is still mostly unknown. Imposing specific rules here would add an extra level of assumptions whose effect on shape development would require specific analysis. In addition, the design of a robust algorithm for cell division on real 3D meshed tissues is a challenging issue in itself and would require the development of robust 3D algorithms. For these reasons, we restricted in this paper our analysis to time-lapses that are small enough to consider that deformations and mechanical forces are not markedly modified by cell division. We used simulation duration such that the deformations of cells were kept reasonably small (cell volumes increased by less than a 3-fold factor). A second limit of the current model is related to the use of 2D finite elements with no thickness for the representation wall parts. We considered that at least in a first approach neglecting the effect of the third dimension (thickness) of these elements and the associated flexural stiffness was a reasonable approximation. A further step would then consist of using more complex 3D shell elements in the numerical method to account for situations where these non in-plane stresses cannot be neglected. Finally, in further rounds of modeling, additional hypotheses and levels of regulation can be included as well. For instance, so far we did not take into account feedback effects between mechanical stress and wall structural anisotropy during development, as reported in different recent works in cells of the L1 layer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Hamant1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Heisler2">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Bozorg1">[45]</xref>. Although we did not address this level of complexity here, our mechanical model provides a natural framework to model such constitutive laws as the tensor representation of the material properties is naturally adapted to the modeling of local anisotropy.</p>
<p>The morphogenetic model presented in this paper investigates how plant axes and branching systems emerge from basic variables at cellular level (turgor pressure, wall deformation and genetic regulation). This model provides realistic multicellular 3D shape simulations that mainly relies on the presence of a stiff epidermis that is limiting for growth. Remarkably, this is in fact reminiscent of the way a cell wall is limiting the expansion of the protoplast. This similitude was already noticed by Kutschera: “The whole organ can […] be regarded as a single giant cell” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Kutschera1">[4]</xref>. Using realistic 3D mechanical simulations, our computational model supports the view of multicellular axial growth underlying this statement. It shows in addition how lateral organs can be produced by locally regulating the mechanical properties of the epidermis at the tip, while relying on both cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous patterns of tension. Together with Dumais's model on single cell growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003950-Dumais1">[8]</xref> also based on anisotropic growth, these models give further support for the existence of a deep self-similarity in the axial growth of plants. This self-similarity is strikingly illustrated by the similitude in the circumferential organization of cortical microtubules within the same tissue, i.e. in a single meristematic cell and in the whole meristem (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003950.s001">S1 <italic>A</italic>-<italic>B</italic> Fig.</xref>). It is also further supported by the existence of single cell organisms that have developed branching strategies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003950.s001">S1 <italic>C</italic>-<italic>D</italic> Fig.</xref>). Caulerpa for instance, a single cell system, exhibits complex tree-like shapes comparable to fern leaves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003950.s001">S1 <italic>E</italic>-<italic>F</italic> Fig.</xref>). Altogether, this suggests that plants have found ways through evolution to scale up axial growth in single cells to multicellular systems, using similar biophysical principles. Conversely, this rather supports the idea that growth in plants mainly relies on elongation. In this scenario, cell division in plants would mainly be a way to subdivide an increased volume, with little impact on growth. Such a unifying principle across scales likely reflects the existence of some common essential constraints behind growth. Identifying these core rules, and their exceptions, will be a major challenge for the future of development that only realistic mechanistic models based on the actual effectors of growth will be able to address.</p>
