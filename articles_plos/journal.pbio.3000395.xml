<abstract>
<p>The gastric pathogen <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> requires a noncanonical cytosolic chemoreceptor transducer-like protein D (TlpD) for efficient colonization of the mammalian stomach. Here, we reconstituted a complete chemotransduction signaling complex in vitro with TlpD and the chemotaxis (Che) proteins CheW and CheA, enabling quantitative assays for potential chemotaxis ligands. We found that TlpD is selectively sensitive at micromolar concentrations to bleach (hypochlorous acid, HOCl), a potent antimicrobial produced by neutrophil myeloperoxidase during inflammation. HOCl acts as a chemoattractant by reversibly oxidizing a conserved cysteine within a 3His/1Cys Zn-binding motif in TlpD that inactivates the chemotransduction signaling complex. We found that <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> is resistant to killing by millimolar concentrations of HOCl and responds to HOCl in the micromolar range by increasing its smooth-swimming behavior, leading to chemoattraction to HOCl sources. We show related protein domains from <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> possess similar reactivity toward HOCl. We propose that this family of proteins enables host-associated bacteria to sense sites of tissue inflammation, a strategy that <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> uses to aid in colonizing and persisting in inflamed gastric tissue.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> is a bacterial pathogen and persistent colonizer of the human stomach and can cause gastritis, ulcers, and stomach cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref001">1</xref>]. The health burden caused by <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> is particularly large because it infects about half the world’s population, with nearly 100% infection rates in some developing regions, and drug resistance to first-line antibiotics is increasing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref002">2</xref>]. Despite triggering a robust inflammation response and bursts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from immune cells, <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> avoids clearance and persists for many decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref003">3</xref>]. The chronic inflammation induced by <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> infection is thought to be a major factor in causing disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref004">4</xref>]. Not only is <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> not eradicated by inflammation, the pathogen, in fact, has been shown to navigate to sites of injury and may capitalize on tissue damage by using host iron extracted from blood hemoglobin and transferrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> utilizes chemotaxis to seek sites optimal for growth and colonization within the hostile environment of the stomach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref011">11</xref>](<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Bacterial chemotaxis involves a well-studied phospho-relay system prevalent across bacteria and archaea, and functions through a conserved mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref012">12</xref>]. Chemoreceptor proteins typically possess a periplasmic ligand-sensing domain to recognize small molecules and transduce signals across the inner membrane to a cytosolic coiled-coil region to regulate ATP-dependent autophosphorylation of the histidine kinase CheA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref013">13</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Typically, as the cellular pool of phosphorylated CheA (CheA-Pi) is increased, the flagella rotors frequently reverse and alter the swimming bacterium’s trajectory, leading to chemorepulsion; decreases in CheA-Pi result in smooth swimming and chemoattraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Chemoreceptors in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> and other bacteria oligomerize to form trimers-of-receptor dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) to build repeating hexagonal arrays that serve to amplify ligand-induced signals up to 50-fold, whereby a single activated receptor can initiate the signal transduction cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref015">15</xref>]. The minimal core unit for signaling is thought to contain two trimers-of-receptor dimers, a CheA dimer, and two CheW scaffold proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref017">17</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> inner-membrane–bound (yellow arc) chemoreceptors TlpA-C and cytosolic TlpD control the autophosphorylation of CheA to CheA-Pi, which then transfers the phosphate to CheY, and CheY-Pi can interact directly with the flagella rotor (pink) to cause a temporary reversal in flagellar rotation. Flagella reversals cause direction changes in swimming trajectory (dotted lines). Black arrows show signal transduction for a chemorepellent response. (B) Two sets of chemoreceptor trimers of homodimers (light and dark blue, denoted as Tlp) associate with the scaffold protein CheW (gray) and a CheA dimer (light and dark orange) to form the core signaling unit and modulate CheA autophosphorylation (illustrative model based on PDB code: 3ja6)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref016">16</xref>]. (C) A relatedness tree of TlpD protein sequences from <italic>Helicobacter</italic> (blue), Deferribacteraceae (purple), and other species. <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> TlpD (arrow) is nearly identical to species found in dolphins and cheetas (red dot). (D) A theoretical model of a <italic>Hp</italic>TlpD monomer constructed by i-Tasser with an N-terminal region of unknown structure (light green), the canonical coiled-coil domain of chemoreceptors that interfaces with CheW and CheA (light blue), and a CZB domain (dark blue). Sequence conservation among 459 TlpD homologues is mapped onto the model with 100% conservation highlighted in red and &gt;95% conservation in orange. Cys residues present in the SS1 strain of <italic>Hp</italic>TlpD are noted with green circles. See Zähringer and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref018">18</xref>] for a theoretical model of the TlpD dimer. (E) Conservation of each Cys residue in TlpD is shown with 2 Weblogo plots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref019">19</xref>]; the left shows conservation among all sequences of <italic>Hp</italic>TlpD (394 sequences, &gt;92% sequence coverage, &gt;98% sequence identity), and the right plot is conservation among nonpylori TlpD sequences (68 sequences, &gt;91% coverage, &gt;40% sequence identity). Only C340 is universally conserved among all TlpD homologues (noted with * in panels E and D).

<p><italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> chemotaxis is mediated by four chemoreceptors, transducer-like proteins (Tlps) A-D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Environmental chemicals that elicit a chemoresponse by <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> include acid as a chemorepellent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref020">20</xref>] and urea as a chemoattractant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref021">21</xref>], which both serve to direct <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> from the stomach lumen to the gastric epithelium. Tlp deletion mutants have implicated certain chemoreceptors in cellular sensing processes, but only two chemoeffectors have been confirmed in biochemical experiments to act through direct binding to a receptor: TlpB sensing of urea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref021">21</xref>] and TlpC sensing of lactate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref022">22</xref>], though the latter receptor is not conserved and apparently dispensable. Some progress has been made for understanding direct ligand sensing by TlpA, for which recent crystal structures suggest binding of a small hydrophobic ligand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref020">20</xref>]. Sensing of pH remains more complicated to understand, because genetic knockouts indicate signals are integrated from TlpA, B, and D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref020">20</xref>], and no direct sensing mechanism is known for TlpD.</p>
<p>Interestingly, previous work has shown that the cytosolic chemoreceptor TlpD is most highly expressed in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>, constituting about half of the total chemoreceptor pool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref020">20</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Such cytosolic or “soluble” chemoreceptors are widespread and common, accounting for approximately 15% of all bacterial and 45% of archaeal chemoreceptors, but their functions are mostly unknown, and to date only a few cytosolic chemoreceptors have been mapped to their ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref023">23</xref>]. Like membrane-bound homologues, cytosolic chemoreceptors form nanoarrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref024">24</xref>] and therefore represent an intriguing, fully soluble model system to better understand chemoreceptor function. No study has yet described the assembly of cytosolic signaling units in terms of the dissociation constants or reaction kinetics for a cytosolic receptor with CheW and CheA.</p>
<p>A clear consensus on the molecular function of TlpD has remained elusive. Single receptor knockout strains of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> show defects in colonization of the stomach antrum, a preferred niche for the bacterium and the region of highest inflammation, and of these, <italic>tlpD</italic> strains are by far the most impaired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref010">10</xref>]. The first molecular study of TlpD revealed the protein to possess a novel chemoreceptor zinc-binding (CZB) domain that is prevalent among chemoreceptors and diguanylate cyclases of numerous bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref025">25</xref>]. The domain uses a rare 3His/1Cys motif to coordinate the bound zinc with high affinity, and the zinc cannot be removed even by the strong zinc chelator N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridinylmethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine (TPEN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref025">25</xref>]. Crystal structures of a wild-type and Cys→Ala mutant CZB domain were solved for diguanylate cyclase Z (DgcZ) (previously called YdeH) from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Those authors suggested CZBs function as zinc sensors and showed for DgcZ that the zinc could be chelated out only by millimolar concentrations of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref018">18</xref>]. Additionally, studies using chemotaxis assays to monitor <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> swimming patterns have implicated TlpD as a redox sensor, suggesting it responds to extracellular sources of ROS. However, there are discrepancies in the literature regarding this point. Using the rate of swimming reversals as a metric for chemotaxis, recent work reported a TlpD-dependent increase in reversals from paraquat-generated superoxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref026">26</xref>]. A different study observed a decrease in reversals with superoxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref027">27</xref>]. Additionally, millimolar concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) were reported to increase reversal rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref026">26</xref>], whereas in vivo concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> are thought to rarely exceed the low micromolar range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref029">29</xref>]. TlpD sensing of ROS was also suggested to function as an “energy sensor” by responding to cytosolic oxidants produced through metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref030">30</xref>]. However, a molecular mechanism has yet to be proposed for how TlpD may function as a sensor.</p>
<p>Here, we have taken advantage of the solubility of TlpD to reconstitute the full (TlpD, CheW, CheA) chemotaxis signaling complex in vitro to directly assay equilibrium and kinetic parameters and to test the effects of putative ligands on receptor signaling. We show TlpD is active and promotes CheA autophosphorylation without the addition of any ligand. Our biochemical characterization of TlpD provides no evidence to support direct sensing of zinc, pH, hydrogen peroxide, or superoxide. Instead, we show that in vitro the strong oxidant hypochlorous acid (HOCl, bleach), the major oxidative product generated by neutrophilic inflammation, potently and reversibly inactivates the signaling complex through a universally conserved cysteine in the TlpD CZB to elicit a chemoattractant signaling response, and that reactivity toward HOCl is a conserved feature of CZB domains from other bacteria. We demonstrate a mechanism by which the cysteine forms a redox “Cys-Zn switch” that is tuned to be reactive toward HOCl and much less reactive toward H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and superoxide. Lastly, we perform in vivo assays that show <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> tolerates millimolar concentrations of HOCl and uses TlpD for chemoattraction responses to HOCl at physiologically relevant concentrations. We propose this mechanism has evolved to facilitate <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> chemoattraction to sites of inflammation and persistence in neutrophil-rich gastric glands.</p>

<title>TlpD homologues possess a universally conserved Zn-binding cysteine</title>
<p>To identify conserved regions important to TlpD function, we performed a protein sequence BLAST search to retrieve putative homologues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref031">31</xref>]. This search revealed that TlpD is almost exclusively found in the family Helicobacteraceae, with most homologues being from mammal-associated strains and a few TlpDs from reptile-associated strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). As expected, TlpD sequences from <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> were highly similar, with &gt;98% sequence identity across 394 isoforms in the nonredundant sequence database. To better understand sequence conservation on a structural level, the i-Tasser program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref032">32</xref>] was used to generate a homology model of the receptor monomer, because no experimental structure for TlpD is available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). This model predicts three general domains: an N-terminal region of low-sequence conservation and unknown function, the canonical chemoreceptor coiled-coil that interacts with CheW and CheA, and a C-terminal CZB domain. Mapping positions of high conservation onto the model reveals that the CheW/CheA interface (common to all chemoreceptors) is highly conserved, as are positions in the CZB domain near the Zn-binding residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> TlpD is unusual for a chemoreceptor, because it contains an abundance of Cys residues (4–5 depending on the strain): C35, C103, C117, C308, and C340 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Four of the Cys positions are conserved among <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> TlpDs, but only C340 within the CZB domain is conserved across all homologues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g001">Fig 1E</xref>).</p>

<title>Reconstituted chemoreceptor signaling complex retains function in vitro</title>
<p>Recombinant <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> TlpD, the scaffold protein CheW, and the histidine kinase CheA were expressed and purified for use in functional assays to directly test the effects of mutations and potential ligands using radio-ATP labeling to monitor autophosphorylation of CheA (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec014">Method</xref> details). In this assay, activation of CheA increases CheA autophosphorylation which promotes swimming reversals and chemorepulsion; decreasing CheA activity increases smooth swimming and chemoattraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Autophosphorylation kinetics of <italic>Hp</italic>CheA alone revealed a K<sub>M</sub> for ATP of 136 μM, similar to the approximately 300 μM K<sub>M</sub> reported for <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> CheA; however, the basal level of k<sub>cat</sub> was exceptionally slow at 8.25 × 10<sup>−3</sup> min<sup>−1</sup> (compared with 1.56 min<sup>−1</sup> for <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref033">33</xref>](<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). We next determined the concentration of TlpD required to achieve maximal dimerization, because the receptor dimer is the core building block for the chemotaxis signaling complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref017">17</xref>]. The dimer K<sub>D</sub> of our TlpD recombinant construct was found by analytical ultracentrifugation to be 188 nM, consistent with fluorescence anisotropy experiments that showed that at approximately 16 μM and above TlpD is mostly dimerized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g002">Fig 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Based on these results, assays with TlpD were generally run at concentrations of 20 μM or higher so that the properties of the physiologically relevant dimer were observed rather than the inactive monomer. Addition of stoichiometric concentrations of TlpD, CheW, and CheA resulted in synergistic activation of the chemotaxis complex; CheW was able to partially activate CheA alone, and activation was further increased with the addition of TlpD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).

<p>(A) Kinetics of <italic>Hp</italic>CheA with varying concentrations of ATP are shown. Experiments were conducted in triplicate with 4 μM CheA and varying amounts of ATP in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, and 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The average k<sub>obs</sub> for three replicate time courses are shown at various concentrations of ATP (black dots), error bars are the sample standard deviation, and these measurements are fit to the Michaelis-Menten curve (black line). (B) Representative analytical ultracentrifugation data (black axes) are shown for TlpD at 1 μM (black dotted black line) in PBS buffer (pH 7) with 1 mM TCEP. At this concentration, peaks corresponding to the TlpD monomer and dimer occur near 3.5 [S] and 5.2 [S], respectively. The average dimer K<sub>D</sub> for the recombinant TlpD construct calculated across various protein concentrations was found to be 188 nM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s027">S1 Table</xref>). Shown in red on secondary axes are fluorescence anisotropy data for a titration of TlpD under identical conditions with experiments run in triplicate.

(C) Shown on top are representative raw data from radio-ATP labeling experiments of 15-minute reactions with CheA alone (“A”) and additions of CheW (“AW”) and TlpD (“AWD”). Below are reactions of 1 mM ATP and 4 μM CheA (black circles), +8 μM CheW (blue triangles), and +8 μM CheW; 24 μM TlpD (red squares) run in triplicate and fit to a pseudo–first-order reaction curve (solid lines). (D) CheW was titrated against 4 μM CheA and resulting k<sub>obs</sub> measurements were fit to a binding isotherm to estimate a kinetically-defined K<sub>D</sub> of 14.6 μM for the CheA↔CheW interaction. (E) TlpD was titrated against 4 μM CheA and 40 μM CheW and fit to a binding isotherm as in panel C to approximate the thermodynamics of the CheA, CheW↔TlpD interaction to have a K<sub>D</sub> of 15.2 μM.

For CheA in the presence of saturating [CheW], a 2.7-fold activation occurs (blue line), and with saturating [CheW] and [TlpD], this is increased to a 14.6-fold activation (red line) over CheA alone (black line).

<p>We next leveraged this system to estimate kinetically defined dissociation constants for the components and to determine the required order of complex assembly using radio-ATP labeling. Titration of CheW against CheA revealed an estimated K<sub>D</sub> of 14.6 μM for formation of the CheW-CheA complex, similar to that of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> at 17 μM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref035">35</xref>], and maximal activation of 2.7-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Titration of TlpD against CheW-CheA showed an estimated K<sub>D</sub> of 15.2 μM and maximal 14.6-fold activation of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Previous work has shown for <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> that CheW is required for the receptor to activate CheA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref036">36</xref>], but a recent study suggested TlpD could activate CheA independently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref037">37</xref>]. However, that study used nonstoichiometric ratios for the chemotaxis components and only 2 μM TlpD; based on our measurements of the TlpD dimer K<sub>D</sub>, approximately 12% to 20% of the receptor could be in its inactive monomer form at this concentration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Direct activation of CheA by TlpD was tested with a titration of TlpD against CheA without CheW, but in our hands no activation occurred even at 200 μM receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). Instead, the data support a sequential activation of the complex whereby CheA and CheW first associate to achieve 18% activation, and then TlpD can bind and promote full 100% activation of the chemotaxis complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of dissociation constants and autophosphorylation rates of a cytosolic chemotaxis complex and indicates in this case that the chemoreceptor TlpD is “on” by default and able to activate CheA even without the addition of other ligands.

<title>TlpD is not directly sensitive to exogenous Zn<sup>++</sup>, pH, hydrogen peroxide, or superoxide</title>
<p>Two lines of evidence led us to hypothesize that the zinc atom bound to the CZB domain might be a cofactor in ligand sensing. First, due to its resistance to zinc chelation, TlpD was previously estimated to bind zinc with subfemtomolar affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref038">38</xref>], which seems inconsistent with a sensor that is activated by exogenous zinc, considering that ligand affinity in other bacterial chemoreceptors is typically in the micromolar range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref039">39</xref>]. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) mass spectrometry analysis of recombinantly-grown TlpD previously showed TlpD to be zinc-loaded following purification without addition of zinc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref025">25</xref>]. We verified that addition of 6 to 24 μM zinc (0.25× to 1× concentration relative to TlpD) to the functional assay did not substantially impact autophosphorylation rates, and higher concentrations, far beyond those considered to be physiologically relevant, caused the proteins to precipitate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). To further test the feasibility of a reversible zinc-sensing function, we attempted to remove zinc from TlpD by chelation with the fluorescent probe Zinpyr-1, which binds zinc with nanomolar affinity, but no chelation was observed, in support of earlier work by Draper and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref038">38</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s002">S2B Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s002">S2C Fig</xref>). We also heat-denatured TlpD, and only a submolar equivalent of zinc was released, even after 3 hours of incubation with Zinpyr-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s002">S2C Fig</xref>). Circular dichroism (CD) of the protein solution indicates that the lack of chelation is not due to the protein refolding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s002">S2D Fig</xref>), suggesting that even when the polypeptide is denatured, zinc is sufficiently buried to prevent removal. Given the absence of data demonstrating the reversibility of zinc binding or impact on complex signaling activity, TlpD may not directly detect exogenous Zn<sup>++</sup> as a chemotaxis ligand.</p>
<p>The crystal structure of the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> CZB, in which the cysteine residue equivalent to the conserved TlpD C340 was mutated to an alanine (Protein Data Bank [PDB] code: 4h54), provides a second line of evidence in favor of Zn as a cofactor in ligand sensing. In this structure, the zinc remained bound by the 3-His core in the absence of the Cys S<sub>γ</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref018">18</xref>], hinting that in the wild-type protein the Cys side chain might be released from the zinc in response to some molecular cue. The importance of C340 in promoting CheA autophosphorylation was demonstrated using our functional assay; compared with wild-type TlpD, the C340A mutant caused a 6.8-fold loss in CheA activation, suggesting that the Cys S<sub>γ</sub> is required for full activation by TlpD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g003">Fig 3A</xref>).</p>

<p>We also explored a potential role of the zinc-binding core of TlpD in direct pH sensing, because protonation of C340 could cause it to dissociate from the bound Zn. In vivo data show TlpD participates in both an acid chemorepulsion and chemoattraction to basic pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref009">9</xref>], and if this mechanism involved direct sensing by TlpD, we would expect this to be reflected in our in vitro functional assay as decreasing CheA activation as a function of increasing pH. However, functional assays across different pH did not replicate in vivo responses (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec014">Method</xref> details and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s002">S2E Fig</xref>). Activity was similar across pH 6.6 to 7.8, the normal range that TlpD would be expected to experience within the well-buffered cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref040">40</xref>]. Together, these data led us to conclude that, although TlpD is important for acid sensing in vivo, the receptor apparently does not directly sense pH.</p>
<p>Finally, we tested if C340 might directly sense the oxidants tested previously by Collins and colleagues and Behrens and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref027">27</xref>].

Functional assays using preoxidized TlpD show a similar decrease in CheA autophosphorylation as HOCl-treated complex, whereas HOCl treatment of CheW-CheA alone does not impair activity relative to untreated CheW-CheA, suggesting the source of inhibition of signaling complex activity is due to oxidation of TlpD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). A titration with HOCl revealed the concentration at which 50% of the kinase was inactivated, which we refer to as K<sub>1/2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref041">41</xref>], to be approximately 110 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g003">Fig 3D</xref>).

In these assays, no protein precipitation was observed, but because HOCl is known to oxidatively damage proteins and cause aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref042">42</xref>], HOCl-oxidized samples were tested for resurrection by the reductant TCEP, which was shown to effectively reactivate the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g003">Fig 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>These data suggest the mechanism of HOCl sensing involves oxidation of TlpD C340 to a cysteine sulfenate, an oxidation product commonly formed in redox systems that utilize a redox-active cysteine and that is readily reversible by small molecule and protein reductants such as the thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase system present in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref044">44</xref>]. Inspection of the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> CZB structure reveals a small channel that allows solvent to access the cysteine, which has not been previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). The C340 S<sub>γ</sub> is partially solvent exposed at the base of this cavity, reminiscent of an enzyme active site suitable for binding a small ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). In this site, two water molecules identified in the crystal structure could mimic the approximate positions for an oxygen and chloride of a hypochlorite molecule and are coordinated by the backbone NH of the following helical turn to be well positioned to react with the C340-S<sub>ɣ</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g004">Fig 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). To determine if C340 can react with HOCl and become oxidized to a cysteine sulfenate, we treated wild-type TlpD and C340A mutant protein with HOCl and monitored formation of cysteine sulfenate by dimedone adduction and western blotting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref045">45</xref>]. The results show potent formation of cysteine sulfenate for the wild-type protein but almost none for the C340A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g004">Fig 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). This indicates not only that HOCl can access and directly oxidize C340 in solution but also that C340 is tuned to be highly reactive with HOCl, as it is approximately 50-fold more readily oxidized than the four other TlpD Cys residues combined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g004">Fig 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). Titration data exhibit a sigmoidal response and are fit well with a Hill coefficient of n = 2, suggesting positive cooperativity occurs across the receptor homodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g004">Fig 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). As a secondary test of direct oxidation of C340 by HOCl, we performed mass spectrometry of reduced, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated, and HOCl-treated TlpD to look for the formation of oxygen adducts. The spectra indicated little oxidation of C340 occurred for the reduced and peroxide-treated samples, but spectra of HOCl-treated TlpD showed C340 to be completely oxidized to sulfinate and sulfonate forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g004">Fig 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s003">S3C–S3E Fig</xref>). Similar “overoxidation” in the absence of reductant in in vitro assays is seen to occur for other proteins with strongly redox-active Cys residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref047">47</xref>], but bacteria generally lack the capacity to reduce sulfinate and sulfonate forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref048">48</xref>], so we expect that cysteine sulfenate is the oxidation state of physiological relevance. Lastly, we tested two other representative CZBs, the CZB domain of the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> diguanylate cyclase DgcZ and the <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> chemoreceptor McpA. We found them to be similarly reactive toward HOCl as TlpD, suggesting HOCl sensing is a conserved function of CZB domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s004">S4 Fig</xref>.).</p>

<p>(A) The crystal structure of the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> CZB domain is shown, with the conserved residues of the Zn binding core and nearby W345 highlighted in gold (PDB code: 3t9o, numbering is for corresponding residues in <italic>Hp</italic>TlpD based on sequence alignment). (B) The molecular surface in the same view as in panel A (sulfur is yellow; nitrogen is blue; oxygen is red; carbons are white; zinc is green) showing C340 is accessible to solvent. Three waters in the experimental structure are shown as small red spheres. (C) A close-up view of the CZB crystal structure is shown in which 2 water molecules bind in the pocket near C340, mimicking the predicted position of hypochlorous acid (O and Cl labeled and shown as transparent sticks). 2fo-fc electron density is shown as blue mesh, contoured at 1.5 σ. (D) Oxidation of 20 μM WT TlpD (open circles) or C340A mutant (crosses) to form Cys-SOH is shown at various HOCl treatments and monitored using an anticysteine-sulfenate antibody. Experiments were run in triplicate, and representative raw data are shown in the inset, with the image length reduced by 50%. Fits of the WT data to the Hill equation using either a coefficient of 1 (gray line) or 2 (black line) are shown. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s003">S3 Fig</xref>.

(E) Data from MS/MS experiments show oxidation states of C340 following treatments of TlpD with 1 mM TCEP, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, or HOCl. The 14-mer peptide containing C340 (noted in bold) was identified and found to be modified either by cysteine alkylation (gray, SH, indicating no oxidation), oxidation to a cysteine sulfinate (peach, SO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>), or oxidation to a cysteine sulfonate (dark red, SO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>).

Without the Cys-Zn bond, the region containing C340 and W345 (orange) locally unfolds and becomes disordered and solvent exposed. This structural rearrangement also promotes an approximately 3 Å shift in its dimer partner (wild-type dark gray, Cys→Ala light gray) in the helix adjoining the coiled-coil that may propagate to the CheW/CheA interface to deactivate the signaling complex. (G) Intrinsic protein fluorescence data (excited at 295 nm) for a titration of HOCl against 20 μM TlpD is shown. Treatments were for 30 minutes with 20 μM TlpD in PBS (pH 7) with addition of 0 μM (black), 100 μM (dark blue), 250 μM (light blue), 500 μM (teal), 750 μM (green), 1 mM (lime green), 1.1 mM (yellow), 1.5 mM (light orange), 2 mM (orange), 5 mM (red), or 10 mM (dark red) HOCl. (H) Data from panel F is quantified with the normalized RFU at 340 nm at each [HOCl] concentration fit to the Hill equation with a coefficient of 1 (gray) or 2 (black). Representative equivalent experiments performed with C340A are shown as crosses.

<p>Comparison of the wild type and Cys→Ala CZB crystal structures shows that in the mutant a region containing 22 residues, including the position of the conserved cysteine, locally unfolds and becomes disordered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). We speculate that oxidation of C340 would promote a similar conformational change, leading to signal transduction by shifting the upstream coiled-coil region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). Fortuitously, TlpD contains a single conserved Trp residue (W345) located near C340 that should participate in this conformation change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g004">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). Therefore, fluorescence of W345 was used as a native probe to detect the receptor’s conformation change in response to C340 oxidation. Strong Trp fluorescence is observed in untreated TlpD samples but is effectively quenched by HOCl concentrations in the μM to mM range, supporting that oxidation induces a conformation change like that observed in the crystal structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g004">Fig 4G</xref>). Similar to the apparent cooperativity observed for oxidation of C340 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g004">Fig 4D</xref>), the conformation change exhibits a sigmoidal response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g004">Fig 4H</xref>). The C340A mutant is about 5-fold less sensitive to HOCl treatment than wild type, showing this conformation change is dependent on the presence of C340 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g004">Fig 4H</xref>). To ensure that loss of fluorescence was not due to protein denaturing, a similar titration was monitored by CD, which shows TlpD remains folded up to at least 10 mM HOCl and partially folded even at 100 mM HOCl (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). Trp fluorescence quenching time courses revealed HOCl reacts to completion within the sample mixing time (&lt;60 seconds), whereas quenching by hydrogen peroxide requires 6- to 7-fold higher concentrations and is very slow, with the reaction requiring approximately 20 minutes to reach completion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g004">Fig 4I</xref>). Quenched fluorescence of oxidized TlpD was recovered by reduction with TCEP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g004">Fig 4J</xref>). Together, these data support a model in which HOCl oxidation of TlpD C340 stimulates a conformational change in the receptor, although further analysis will be required to understand how these structural changes may regulate the distant CheA interface.</p>

The concentration of HOCl at which no motile bacteria were detected is noted with “n.d.” Error bars shown are the sample standard deviation. Experiments were performed in triplicate, with <italic>n</italic> &gt; 30 bacteria tracks (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec014">Method</xref> details). (B) Shown are representative western blots of WT and <italic>tlpD H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> cell lysate from cells treated with either PBS buffer (pH 7) or 1 mM HOCl in PBS buffer (pH 7). Cells from liquid cultures were treated for 30 seconds in the presence of dimedone, then quenched by methionine to inactivate residual HOCl. Blots of cell lysate were probed with α-Tlp primary antibody (pink), stripped and re-probed with α-cysteine-sulfenate primary antibody (green), and visualized with chemiluminescence. Bands appearing in the α-Tlp blot corresponding to the molecular weights of TlpA, TlpB, and TlpD monomer and disulfide-linked dimer are noted with red triangles. Five prominent bands in the α-cysteine-sulfenate blot of WT <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> are numbered, with bands 1 and 3 noted with circles that appear at the same molecular weight as the TlpD monomer and dimer bands.

Tracks are colored according to reversal rate on a spectrum of green (low) to red (high). In these figures, 1 pixel corresponds to 0.65 microns. Note that these images are intended to visualize the swimming behavior of the bacterial swarm but that individual reversals cannot be seen at this scale.

<p>Western blot experiments were performed to investigate if exogenous HOCl can enter <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> cells and oxidize cysteine thiols. Liquid cultures of wild-type <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> and a <italic>tlpD</italic> mutant (strain G27) were treated with either PBS buffer or 1 mM HOCl in buffer in the presence of dimedone, which is cell permeable, quenched with methionine, and then cell lysates were examined for the presence of cysteine sulfenate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g005">Fig 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s005">S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s006">S6</xref> Figs). Western blots of samples were probed with α-Tlp antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref026">26</xref>], then stripped and reprobed with α-cysteine-sulfenate. The HOCl-treated wild-type cells exhibit approximately five prominent bands corresponding to protein targets that are oxidized by HOCl to form cysteine sulfenate, suggesting that HOCl is sufficiently cell permeable to oxidize cytosolic thiols and that these targets are rather specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Interestingly, two of the five cysteine-sulfenate bands in the wild-type blot appear at approximately the same molecular weight as TlpD monomer and disulfide-linked TlpD dimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref027">27</xref>], and these bands are absent in the <italic>tlpD</italic> mutant blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g005">Fig 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s005">S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s006">S6</xref> Figs). These data suggest that TlpD is one of only a few protein targets of HOCl cysteine oxidation; however, detecting the oxidation of a single cysteine residue in vivo is technically challenging, and additional analyses are needed to establish the identities of these cysteine-sulfenate protein bands.</p>
<p>We next showed that <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> swimming reversal rates are altered by HOCl exposure. Chemorepellants such as acid stimulate a build-up in CheA-Pi that results in more frequent flagella reversals and an increased rate of direction changes that, here, we refer to as “reversals”; conversely, chemoattractants reduce cellular CheA-Pi to decrease swimming reversal rate and promote smooth swimming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref026">26</xref>]. We used automated particle tracking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref051">51</xref>] to track almost all motile bacteria from each experiment and characterize their trajectories according to a standard definition for swimming reversal, thereby eliminating observer bias and increasing statistical power over manual tracking methods (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec014">Method</xref> details and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s007">S7A Fig</xref>). Wild-type strain G27 <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> treated with PBS buffer showed a diverse range of reversal rates, with an average reversal rate of 1.77 s<sup>−1</sup> (<italic>n</italic> = 669; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g005">Fig 5C</xref> left, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s011">S1 Movie</xref>). Addition of 1 mM of the chemoattractant urea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref021">21</xref>] shifted the swimming behavior to be mostly smooth swimming, reducing the average reversal rate to 1.21 s<sup>−1</sup> (<italic>n</italic> = 1,263; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g005">Fig 5C</xref> center, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s012">S2 Movie</xref>). Addition of 1 mM HOCl similarly promoted smooth swimming and decreased the reversal rate to also be 1.21 s<sup>−1</sup>, consistent with chemoattraction behavior (<italic>n</italic> = 765; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g005">Fig 5C</xref> right, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s013">S3 Movie</xref>). In comparison, by our metrics, a chemotaxis-null <italic>cheA</italic> mutant exhibited a much lower reversal rate of 0.32 s<sup>−1</sup> and was unresponsive to HOCl (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s017">S7B Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s014">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s015">S5</xref> Movies).</p>
<p>Experiments conducted for three concentrations of HOCl in the range of 250 μM to 1 mM resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in reversal rate for wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Similar assays were performed with a <italic>tlpD</italic> mutant, which exhibited a very low baseline reversal rate, as observed previously by Collins and colleagues and Schweinitzer and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref030">30</xref>], and reversals were not further decreased by HOCl treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g005">Fig 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s016">S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s017">S7</xref> Movies). Despite its low reversal rate, previous work has shown <italic>tlpD</italic> mutants are not chemotaxis-null and retain chemoattraction to urea through TlpB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref009">9</xref>]; however, quantification of reversal rates is inherently poor at identifying further decreases when the baseline is already near zero. To further investigate if these decreases in reversal rates from HOCl treatments are TlpD-dependent, assays were performed with a <italic>tlpABC</italic> mutant, which possesses TlpD as its sole chemoreceptor, and this mutant showed dose-dependent decreases in reversal rates similar to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g005">Fig 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s018">S8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s019">S9</xref> Movies).

<title><italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> is attracted to hypochlorous acid</title>
<p>Although the measurement of swimming reversal rates in the presence of a chemoeffector provides useful insight into how bacterial swimming is altered, it is a proxy for the cellular levels of CheA-Pi and does not directly assay chemoattraction in terms of localization of bacteria toward a point source. HOCl degrades at room temperature and is reactive with a variety of organic molecules, so commonly used point-source chemotaxis experiments such as capillaries and soft agar plates were not feasible. Instead, we utilized an assay in which a highly calibrated micropipette can continuously deliver fresh treatment solution to establish a microgradient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref052">52</xref>].

<p>(A) Data from point-source chemotaxis experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref021">21</xref>] are shown for <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> strains PMSS1 (red) and G27 (blue) using a highly calibrated micropipette for chemoeffector delivery. Three-second motility traces are shown prior to treatment (0–3 seconds) and following 30 seconds of treatment (27–30 seconds) with buffer (500 mM sodium phosphate [pH 6.7]) or 10 mM HOCl (diluted into buffer [pH 6.7]). The position of the micropipette is highlighted in yellow in the treatment panels. (B) Data from panel A is quantified over time with the average percentage of bacteria in the field of view prior to treatment normalized to be 100%. Treatment with buffer (pluses) or 10 mM HOCl (circles linked by lines) begins at time zero, noted with the yellow micropipette. Each data point shown is the average over 2 seconds of video (60 frames). (C) Experiments performed as in panel A with HOCl for the <italic>tlpD</italic> G27 (gray, 3-second time traces) and <italic>tlpABC</italic> G27 (pink, 5-second time traces) mutants. (D) Quantified data for <italic>tlpD</italic> ± 10 mM HOCl. (E) Quantified data for <italic>tlpABC</italic> experiments ± 10 mM HOCl. For panels D through E, each data point shown is the normalized bacteria count per frame. See supplementary materials for videos of these experiments and statistical analysis. (F) Shown is a synthesis of the data from this work as the basis for a new model for how TlpD functions to sense HOCl as a chemoattractant. By default, TlpD is active and promotes swimming reversals (blue circle) by stimulating CheA autophosphorylation (gray arrows). TlpD is deactivated by HOCl sensing, leading to smooth swimming and chemoattraction (green arrows). The inflammation product HOCl oxidizes a specially tuned C340 to form a cysteine sulfenate (panel 1). Oxidation of C340 causes the Cys to detach from the Zn-binding core, and a large conformational change occurs in the receptor (panel 2). This structural rearrangement deactivates the receptor so that it no longer stimulates CheA autophosphorylation in the chemotaxis signaling complex (panel 3). Decreasing the cellular pool of CheA-Pi leads to increased smooth swimming and chemoattraction to the HOCl source.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We report the unexpected discovery that the prevalent gastric pathogen <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>, a causative agent of stomach cancer, is attracted to sources of HOCl by virtue of its cytosolic chemoreceptor TlpD. By reconstituting the chemotaxis complex in vitro, we determined TlpD contains a conserved C340 required for promoting the autophosphorylation of CheA (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g003">3</xref>). Biochemical analyses revealed that, in TlpD, C340 is tuned to be highly and preferentially reactive toward HOCl and that oxidation of C340 by HOCl stimulates a conformational change in the receptor that presumably inhibits CheA activity, leading to a decrease in the cellular pool of CheA-Pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g004">Fig 4</xref>). TlpD regulation of CheA activity in vitro shows half-maximal inhibition at 110 μM HOCl, and our data suggest this sensing is cooperative at the level of the TlpD homodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g004">Fig 4</xref>). HOCl treatment of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> seems to oxidize only a select number of protein thiols, including TlpD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). We surmise that through signal amplification by the formation of TlpD-CheW-CheA sensory arrays, oxidation of just a few TlpD receptors in vivo can inactivate much of the available CheA kinase and thus the cytosol need not reach HOCl concentrations high enough to oxidize all of the TlpD pool to elicit an attraction response. In chemotaxis experiments, <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> exposed to HOCl decrease their rates of swimming reversals to that observed with the well-characterized chemoattractant urea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g005">Fig 5D</xref>), they respond to concentrations as low as 250 μM HOCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g005">Fig 5D–5F</xref>), and they rapidly localize toward a point source of HOCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g006">Fig 6</xref>). HOCl attraction was TlpD-dependent and retained in two <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> strains isolated from distant geographic locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g006">Fig 6</xref>).</p>

<title>Cys340 participates in a Cys-Zn switch with exquisite sensitivity and specificity for HOCl</title>
<p>The molecular basis for TlpD’s specific responsiveness to HOCl is the preferential reactivity of Cys340 with HOCl versus the chemically similar H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Such specificity can be understood based on differences between the reactivity of these species with protein residues. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the micromolar range almost exclusively reacts with cysteine, and to a lesser extent with methionine, whereas the targets of HOCl are broader and exhibit extremely fast reaction rates; a detailed kinetic analysis measured the reaction rate of HOCl with Cys to be 3.0 × 10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> and 3.8 × 10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> for Met [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref053">53</xref>]. That same study showed cysteines bound to zinc are by far the most reactive protein residue with HOCl, achieving a near diffusion-limited rate of 9.3 × 10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, almost 3 orders of magnitude greater than cysteine alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref053">53</xref>], and in fact also exhibit decreased reactivity with hydrogen peroxide and oxygen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref054">54</xref>]. Previous work has identified numerous other proteins containing zinc-bound cysteines that are targets for HOCl oxidation including Hsp33 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref053">53</xref>] and alcohol dehydrogenase, which is 3,000-fold more reactive with HOCl than peroxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref055">55</xref>]. The example we found to be most similar to TlpD is the activation of human neutrophil collagenase that occurs by HOCl oxidation of a single zinc-bound Cys, a mechanism coined as a “Cys-Zn switch” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref056">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref057">57</xref>]. Together, our data indicate the molecular function of TlpD is modulated by reaction of HOCl with C340 to switch between 2 conformations: (1) a “reduced” and Cys-zinc-bound state that is fully folded and activates CheA, and (2) an “oxidized” cysteine-sulfenate state with a partially unfolded CZB domain that does not activate CheA and that can be reduced and resurrected by cellular reductants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g006">Fig 6F</xref>).</p>

<title>HOCl is a prevalent host-produced oxidant encountered by <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic></title>
<p>HOCl, which is produced by the granulocyte-specific enzyme myeloperoxidase from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and chloride anion, reaches levels of up to 5 mM at sites of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref059">59</xref>]. In contrast, maximal gastric concentrations of extracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> are thought to be 1 to 15 μM and perhaps rarely reach approximately 100 μM in the presence of oxidants from dietary sources such as coffee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref029">29</xref>]. The concentration of superoxide is approximately 2 μM, and it decomposes rapidly, with a half-life on the order of milliseconds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref060">60</xref>]. Previous analyses of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> oxidant sensing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref027">27</xref>] used concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and superoxide at a much higher concentration than what occurs in vivo. Additionally, although triggered human neutrophils produce several ROS during inflammation, including H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and superoxide, it seems these are all funneled into the production of HOCl as the major product, because quantitative analyses show essentially all H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generated is converted to HOCl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref061">61</xref>].</p>
<p>HOCl is a potent disinfectant that can kill bacteria at micromolar concentrations but is also sufficiently cell permeable to oxidize intracellular thiols at sublethal doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref059">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref062">62</xref>]. In addition to examples of cytosolic proteins that are targets for HOCl oxidiation discussed above, such as Hsp33 and alcohol dehydrogenase, the bacterial transcription factor NemR within the cytosol uses a reactive Cys residue to selectively sense HOCl to trigger expression of antioxidant enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref063">63</xref>]. We showed that <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> is exceptionally resistant to HOCl, likely due to its strong antioxidant defenses including three peroxiredoxins, and high expression of its catalase, KatA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref064">64</xref>]. KatA in particular has been shown to be key for <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> to survive ROS bursts from triggered immune cells, and evidence indicates this resilience leads to the chronic release of ROS that damages gastric tissue and results in disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref003">3</xref>]. Our finding that <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> is attracted to sources of HOCl by TlpD suggests that <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> does not just tolerate but can actively seek out sources of HOCl, which would be produced by neutrophils at sites of inflammation. Neutrophils are a hallmark of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> infection and are actively recruited in response to <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> induction of interleukin-8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref065">65</xref>]. Neutrophils concentrate near the stem precursor and cell zones of the gastric gland epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref066">66</xref>], which undergoes proliferation in response to <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> gastric gland colonization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref067">67</xref>]. <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> colonization of the gastric glands is an important strategy for the bacteria’s persistent infection of the stomach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref068">68</xref>] and requires chemotaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref052">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref069">69</xref>], and therefore chemoattraction to HOCl may constitute a strategy <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> uses to persist in neutrophil-infiltrated gastric glands.</p>
<p>This behavior is consistent with other proinflammatory strategies of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>, such as its degradation of host-secreted extracellular antioxidant glutathione [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref070">70</xref>], and the fact that its colonization levels are reduced in mice treated with the ROS scavenger ursodeoxycholic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref071">71</xref>] or sulforaphane, which stimulates host antioxidant protein production through Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref072">72</xref>]. In this regard, <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> belongs to a growing list of bacterial pathogens and pathobionts that can promote and benefit from host inflammation, thereby setting up positive feedback loops that can drive chronic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref073">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref074">74</xref>]. For example, <italic>Salmonella</italic>-induced inflammation increases the concentrations of colonic tetrathionate and nitrate, which it recognizes as chemoattractants, and it can use these inflammation products as electron acceptors in anaerobic respiration to outcompete fermentation-restricted members of the native microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref075">75</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref078">78</xref>]. Additionally, other molecular oxidants not tested in this study could be sensed as chemoeffectors by TlpD through a similar mechanism, such as aldehydes and quinones, which are also known to be reactive toward zinc-bound cysteines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref079">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref080">80</xref>], and might provide an explanation for the reported role of TlpD in energy taxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref081">81</xref>].</p>

<title>Interpreting conflicting data of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> responses to ROS</title>
<p>In contrast to our finding of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>’s TlpD-dependent chemoattraction to HOCl, previous studies have proposed that TlpD senses ROS as chemorepellents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref081">81</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref083">83</xref>]. Differences both in experimental methodologies and interpretations of results likely contribute to these divergent conclusions. First, we note that measuring <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> chemotaxis can be challenging and often relies on indirect measurements of swimming behavior, such as reversal rates in a uniform chemical solution. Our data indicates that reversal rates are highly variable within a single population of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g005">Fig 5C–5F</xref>), which could contribute to inconsistent results using this assay (e.g., opposite reported responses of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> to paraquat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref026">26</xref>]). We found that greater than 100 tracks were required for the mean reversal rate to be well defined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s007">S7C Fig</xref>). To better understand <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> responses to ROS, we have focused on ROS species at concentrations reported in the gastric environment. We confirmed our findings of TlpD-dependent, HOCl-induced smooth swimming with a point-source chemotaxis assay that demonstrated localization of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> toward HOCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g006">Fig 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s008">S8</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s010">S10</xref> Figs, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s021">S11</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s024">S14</xref> Movies).</p>
<p>Secondly, we note the challenges of making inferences about a gene’s function based on the pleiotropic phenotypes of mutant bacteria lacking that gene. <italic>tlpD</italic>-deficient strains have reported colonization defects in mice and gerbils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref081">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref082">82</xref>], defective chemotactic responses to pH and ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref027">27</xref>], and growth defects in the presence of ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref081">81</xref>]. The mechanistic basis for the colonization defects could thus be due to any combination of the mutant strain’s altered chemotaxis to multiple chemicals in the host environment and its increased sensitivity to ROS. For example, the finding that <italic>tlpD</italic>-mutant strains colonize wild-type mice and gerbils poorly could be alternatively interpreted as evidence of the mutant’s failure to avoid toxic ROS, its failure to establish persistent infection of HOCl-rich gastric glands, or its inherent sensitivity to ROS.</p>

<title><italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> integrates multiple chemical cues to persist in the gastric environment it shapes</title>
<p><italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> is a notoriously persistent colonizer, often retained for an individual’s lifetime, and previous work highlights the bacteria’s ability to adaptively modify the stomach environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref084">84</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref087">87</xref>]. Interestingly, some of the chemoeffectors sensed by <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>’s limited chemoreceptor repertoire reflect the environment of the <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>-infected, as opposed to a naïve stomach, such as low concentrations of urea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref021">21</xref>] and presence of autoinducer-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref088">88</xref>]. Now, we add to this picture chemoattraction to HOCl produced by <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>-induced neutrophil infiltration, a hallmark of the <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>-infected stomach. TlpD seems to be especially important for colonizing the stomach antrum, which has been described in some work as the area of highest inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref010">10</xref>]. Decreasing host epithelial hydrogen peroxide and immune cell superoxide, which are both precursors for HOCl production, shifts the wild-type <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> infection away from the antrum toward the corpus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref083">83</xref>], which could reflect the loss of HOCl as a chemoattractant for locating inflamed regions of the stomach. Clearly, additional studies are needed to elucidate the importance of HOCl sensing for <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> biology and infection. More generally, CZB domain containing proteins are encoded by the genomes of numerous host-associated bacterial species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref025">25</xref>], suggesting the broad utility of HOCl sensing for bacteria living together with animals that produce HOCl as an antimicrobial response.</p>

<p>The full-length protein sequence of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> TlpD from strain SS1 (Uniprot entry A0A1U9IUC7) was used for BLAST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref031">31</xref>] searches of the nonredundant sequence database using default threshold values. We performed one search for only <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> sequences and a second search excluding <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> sequences. We manually curated these sequences to retain only those that were chemoreceptors and also contained a C-terminal CZB domain. Of these, some sequences lacked the N-terminal region corresponding to approximately the first 120 residues; because we were interested in analyzing the conservation of TlpD cysteine positions, and three of those positions were contained in the N-terminal region, we imposed an additional restriction that we only included sequences in the analysis that lacked no more than the first 30 N-terminal residues. This resulted in a total of 459 putative TlpD homologues. We performed a multisequence alignment of this subset using Clustal Omega [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref090">90</xref>] and generated a relatedness tree using PhyML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref091">91</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>To create the homology model of the TlpD monomer, we submitted the <italic>Hp</italic>TlpD (SS1 strain) sequence to the i-Tasser server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref032">32</xref>] as two separate pieces corresponding to the N-terminal region (residues 1–120) and the coiled-coil and CZB domain (residues 121–433), and the subsequent predicted models were manually joined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Although generation of the model could be guided by crystal structures of the chemoreceptor coiled-coil region and a CZB domain from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> DgcZ, the TlpD N-terminal region is unlike any experimentally determined structure, and so the fold of this region remains highly speculative. We performed a sequence conservation analysis at the five cysteine positions found in <italic>Hp</italic>TlpD (C35, C103, C117, C308, and C340) for <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> sequences and <italic>nonpylori</italic> sequences using the WebLogo server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref019">19</xref>] and mapped these onto the i-Tasser homology model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>).</p>

<title>Purification of recombinant proteins</title>
<p>pBH plasmids with ampicillin resistance and a T7 promotor system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref020">20</xref>] were ordered from GeneScript that contained the sequences for <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> TlpD (SS1 strain, Uniprot: A0A1U9IUC7) and C340A mutant, CheW (SS1 strain, Uniprot: A0A1U9ITT8), CheA (G27 strain, Uniprot: B5Z859), and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>enterica</italic> typhimurium McpA (LT2 strain, Uniprot: Q8ZM22) each with the N-terminal His tag: MGHHHHHHDYDIPTTENLYFQGS. For these constructs, ArcticExpress DE3 competent <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells (Agilent) were transformed with plasmids by heat shock and plated on +ampicillin LB agar plates. After overnight growth at 37°C, single colonies were selected for growth and large scale protein expression. Briefly, individual colonies were used to inoculate 25 ml LB/+AMP cultures and grown overnight shaking at 37°C. The following morning, 5 ml of overnight culture was added to 4 × 1 L cultures of LB/+Amp and allowed to grow shaking at 37°C to O.D. 0.6 to 0.8. Cultures were then transferred to a temperature-controlled incubator and allowed to grow shaking for 30 minutes at 10°C, prior to induction with 1 mM IPTG and growth overnight at 10°C. After approximately 16 hours, cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm at 4°C. Similar protocols were used for expression of the CZB domain of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> DgcZ (DgcZ-CZB in strain K12), which was supplied as a gift from Dr. Tilman Schirmer of University of Basel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref018">18</xref>], using expression with Rosetta cells and a pet19b vector.</p>
<p>For protein purification, cells were diluted into ice-cold lysis buffer containing 10 mM imidazole, 50 mM HEPES, 10% glycerol, 300 mM NaCl, and 0.5 mM TCEP (pH 7.9). Cells were kept on ice and lysed by sonication and then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm to separate out the insoluble fraction. The soluble portion was retained and applied to a prepacked gravity column of Ni-NTA agarose beads (Qiagen) equilibrated with lysis buffer. Lysate was incubated with the beads for 30 to 60 minutes and allowed to flow through the column over the beads twice. The column was then washed with lysis buffer to remove contaminates until no further protein was observed in the flow through, as monitored using a Bradford assay. Protein was eluted by the addition of lysis buffer containing 300 mM imidazole. To obtain TlpD lacking the N-terminal His tag, TlpD(-His), the eluted protein fractions were dialyzed into lysis buffer and then incubated with 1 mg TEV protease per 20 ml elution volume overnight (New England Biolabs) and repurified. Elution fractions were judged for purity by SDS-PAGE and pooled before further purification by gel filtration on an Akta FPLC. All proteins were obtained in high yields on the order of 40 to 100 mg per prep, and fractions containing pure protein were dialyzed into appropriate buffers and concentrated; TlpD, TlpD(-His), TlpD-C340A, and CheA were found to be highly soluble and stable up to 300 μM, but CheW could only be concentrated to approximately 150 μM without precipitation. Attempts at removing the N-terminal His tag of CheW were unsuccessful and caused the protein to precipitate. Proteins were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.</p>

<title>Preparation of bleach solutions</title>
<p>High grade sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) was obtained as a 10% to 15% solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Precise concentration of NaOCl was assayed directly using the extinction coefficient of 350 M<sup>−1</sup> cm<sup>−1</sup> measured at 293 nm in water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref092">92</xref>]. NaOCl stock was kept cold and in the dark until needed, and bleach solutions for assays were made fresh. Concentrated solutions of NaOCl are extremely basic, and so in all cases, the preparation of NaOCl stock solutions (1–100 mM) was measured and adjusted by addition of HCl to pH 7 and kept in PBS buffer (pH 7) prior to experiments. The solution pH was monitored by a Mettler Toledo pH probe (ThermoScientific, Eugene, OR) and use of pH indicator strips (Millipore, St. Loius, MO). The pKa of HOCl is 7.53, and so the experiments performed in this study contain a mixture of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and hypochlorite (<sup>−</sup>OCl) in solution, but for simplicity, we refer to these solutions simply as HOCl.</p>

<title>ATP radio-labeling and functional assays of reconstituted chemotaxis signaling complex</title>
<p>Most functional assays were performed at 20°C in a standard kinase buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, and 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, with typical reactions containing purified chemotaxis proteins in approximately stoichiometric concentrations: 4 μM CheA, 8 μM CheW, and 24 μM TlpD dialyzed into kinase buffer. ATP solutions were prepared with a 500:1 ratio of cold ATP (Thermofisher, Eugene, OR) to hot ATP [ɣ-32P] (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) diluted into kinase buffer. Time courses were carried out in a 96-well clear bottom plate (Corning) with reactions started by the addition of ATP. At each time point, 3 to 10 μl samples were extracted and immediately quenched in a solution of 190 to 197 μL of 75 mM H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> and 1 M NaCl. Subsequently, samples were added to a Whatman Minifold 96-well slot blotter and drawn through a HyBond PVDF nitrocellulose membrane by vacuum. Three additional washes with 200 μL quenching solution were performed to remove excess ATP. The nitrocellulose was dried and then imaged using a phosphoimaging cassette (Molecular Dynamics, Berkeley, CA) with a 30 to 60 minute exposure and then scanned using a Storm 825 imager (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL). Data were quantified by densitometry using Image Studio. Identically sized circles were used for all measurements, and raw values from experimental samples were normalized against “time zero” samples that contained only ATP and no kinase.</p>
<p>For testing putative chemoeffectors, treatments of HOCl, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, paraquat, TCEP, and zinc acetate were added to proteins 1 hour prior to the start of the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g003">Fig 3B and 3D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s002">S2C Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s002">S2F Fig</xref>). Preoxidized TlpD was prepared by treatment of TlpD alone with 250 μM HOCl for 30 minutes, then quenched with 1 mM methionine prior to addition of CheW, CheA, and ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). We performed similar experiments using wild-type TlpD, CheW, and CheA across a variety of pHs to test whether TlpD may be involved in directly sensing pH. TlpD has been implicated to be involved in chemorepulsion from acid and chemoattraction to alkaline pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref009">9</xref>], and if this sensing was direct, we expect in the reconstituted chemotaxis complex assay this would be reflected as higher CheA activity at more acidic pH, leading to more swimming reversals and chemorepulsion and less CheA activity at basic pH. Our results actually found the opposite to be true, because CheA autophosphorylation activity increased at more alkaline pH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s002">S2E Fig</xref>). This has been previously reported for studies with <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> CheA alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref093">93</xref>], suggesting the increase in activity may be due to the CheA autophosphorylation reaction being more favored at alkaline pH, although further work is needed to confirm this.</p>

<title>Detection of cysteine sulfenic acid by western blotting</title>
<p>Experiments measuring CZB oxidation were prepared with either 20 μM TlpD, TlpD-C340A, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> DgcZ-CZB, or <italic>Salmonella</italic> McpA in PBS buffer (pH 7) with 10 mM freshly prepared dimedone (Sigma). The proteins were treated with various concentrations of HOCl for 1 hour, and then 5 μl of sample was quenched into 195 μl of quenching buffer (see above) and drawn through a HyBond PVDF nitrocellulose membrane by vacuum. The membrane was washed 3 times with quenching buffer and then once with TBST buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20). Rabbit α-cysteine sulfenic acid primary antibody (Kerafast, Boston, MA) was used to detect dimedone-modified cysteines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref045">45</xref>] using a 1:4,000 dilution in a blocking buffer of 5% milk in TBST.

The following day, the membrane was washed three times with 20 ml of TBST for 15 minutes, followed by incubation with α-rabbit-HRP secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at a 1:4,000 dilution in blocking buffer for 1 hour. The membrane was again washed three times with 20 ml of TBST for 15 minutes, and then a Pierce ECL detection kit was used to visualize the blot using chemiluminescence.</p>

<title>Mass spectrometry</title>
<p>20 μM of pure recombinant TlpD in PBS buffer (pH 7) was prepared for analysis by treatment with 1 mM TCEP, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, or HOCl for 1 hour. Subsequently, the samples were alkylated by the addition of 5 mM iodoacetamide and allowed to react for 30 minutes at room temperature sheltered from light. The sample was then buffer-exchanged with fresh buffer three times by centrifugation using a 10 kDa cutoff and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to analysis. Mass spectrometric analysis of TlpD was performed as a service by Dr. Larry David at Oregon Health and Science University’s (OHSU) Proteomics Shared Resource Facility. As per their request, we include the following statement: “Mass spectrometric analysis was performed by the OHSU Proteomics Shared Resource with partial support from NIH core grants P30EY010572, P30CA069533, and S10OD012246.” Protein samples were subjected to digestion with LysC, and 3 μg of digest was analyzed on a Q-Exactive HF instrument using a 75 μm × 250 mm nanospray C18 column. MS/MS data were searched with Sequest against an <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> database supplemented with the TlpD protein sequence. False discovery was controlled using a reversed sequence database and only q-scores below 0.05 were accepted. C340 was located within the peptide NCRLGKWYYEGAGK (567.94415 Da), and carbamidomethylated (+57.02146 Da), sulfinate (+31.98983 Da), and sulfonate (+47.98474 Da) forms were detected.

<title>Fluorescence, CD spectroscopy, and analytical ultracentrifugation</title>
<p>For Zn-chelation assays, we used the fluorescent probe Zinpyr-1 (Abcam, Eugene, OR) with excitation at 492 nm and maximum emission near 527 nm; 5 mM stock solutions of Zinpyr-1 were prepared in DMSO and diluted to 50 μM final concentration for experiments with zinc controls and TlpD in a buffer of 100 mM Tris (pH 7) and 300 mM NaCl. Samples were loaded into a 2 × 2 mm quartz cuvette (Starna Cells Inc. Atascadero, CA) and fluorescence was monitored at 20°C using a FluoroMax-3 Spectrofluorometer (HORIBA Scientific, Austin, TX). For time courses, fluorescence was measured every 60 seconds over the course of 3 hours. Identical samples containing only buffer were used as blanks, and final spectra shown are blank-subtracted spectra, but these were minimally different (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>For intrinsic protein fluorescence assays with TlpD and the C340A mutant, we used an excitation wavelength of 295 nm, to optimize signal from the single Trp345, and monitored emission in the 300 to 400 nm range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g004">Fig 4G</xref>). Samples were prepared in a buffer of 25 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris (pH 7), and experiments were conducted at 20°C. Samples were pretreated for 1 hour prior to measuring fluorescence for endpoint fluorescence spectra of TlpD HOCl treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g004">Fig 4G–4I</xref>), or subsequently treated with TCEP for 30 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g004">Fig 4J</xref>). Fluorescence anisotropy experiments for recombinant TlpD in PBS buffer (pH 7) and 1 mM TCEP were collected with excitation at 295 nm and monitoring emission at 340 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Intrinsic fluorescence was too weak at low protein concentrations to be reliably detected, and so a K<sub>D</sub> value could not be calculated from these data but were still useful to indicate that the protein is maximally oligomerized by approximately 16 μM, consistent with monomer/dimer ratios predicted from AUC experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g002">Fig 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s001">S1 Fig</xref>)</p>
<p>Protein CD was performed for TlpD with a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter using a 1 mm path length quartz cuvette. All spectra for fluorescence and CD experiments were corrected for background by subtracting signal from buffer-only samples. To obtain a melting and cooling curve, 50 μM TlpD in a buffer of 150 mM NaCl and 17.5 mM sodium citrate (pH 7) was heated from 25°C to 95°C in 0.5°C increments per 5 minutes and then cooled back to 25°C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s002">S2D Fig</xref>). For HOCl titration and unfolding experiments, 5 μM TlpD was treated with various concentrations of HOCl for 10 minutes in a buffer of PBS (pH 7), then desalted with a Micro Bio-Spin Column (Bio-Rad) into a buffer of 150 mM NaCl and 17.5 mM sodium citrate (pH 7), and then analyzed by CD at 20°C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s003">S3B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were performed for recombinant TlpD and TlpD(-His) using a Beckman Proteome Lab XL-I centrifuge and a 60 Ti 4-cell rotor.

Videos of swimming bacteria were captured at 30 frames per second on a Zeiss Axiovert-35 inverted microscope with a 40× objective and experiment temperature was kept stable at 37°C with a heated stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g006">Fig 6A–6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s008">S8</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s010">S10</xref> Figs, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s020">S10</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000395.s025">S15</xref> Movies). For each experiment, a baseline for the number of bacteria in the field of view was established pretreatment, and then the micropipette was lowered into the swarm, and a gentle flow of treatment solution was initiated.

For Michaelis-Menten assays using CheA and varying [ATP], the data were fit assuming the second-order reaction proceeds as CheA + ATP ↔ CheA-Pi + ADP so that the radioactivity measured is directly proportional to [CheA-Pi], and [CheA] and [ATP] can be deduced for any time point by knowing initial concentrations.

where it is assumed binding occurs as A+B↔AB, [AB] is the concentration of the bound complex, B<sub>T</sub> is the total added titrated component, and K<sub>D</sub> is the thermodynamic dissociation constant. Using this method, we estimated the K<sub>D</sub> of complex formation of CheA+CheW↔CheA-CheW to be 14.6 μM. In the case of the titration of TlpD against CheA and CheW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g002">Fig 2E</xref>), we were unable to use a saturating amount of CheW due to the limits of the protein binding capacity of the nitrocellulose membrane. Instead, we used 4 μM CheA and 40 μM CheW and approximated the concentration of the CheA-CheW complex to be 2 μM, based on our previous titration of CheW and CheA, although this equilibrium could be shifted by TlpD addition. However, data were well-fit using this estimate, producing a K<sub>D</sub> for TlpD to CheA-CheW of 15.2 μM, and test fits using values between 2 and 4 μM CheA-CheW complex only subtly changed the calculated K<sub>D</sub> by approximately 1 μM. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pbio.3000395.e006">Eq 6</xref> was also used to fit quantified data from fluorescence and western blot experiments using Hill coefficients of 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g004">Fig 4D and 4H</xref>).</p>

<title>Tracking of bacterial swimming</title>
<p>We used in-house MATLAB-based automated particle tracking software from the laboratory of Dr. Raghuveer Pathasarathy (University of Oregon) to track bacteria swimming paths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref051">51</xref>].

Videos of bacteria were first converted to a series of tif files using ImageJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000395.ref095">95</xref>], inverted so that bacteria appeared as bright spots on a dark background, and then input into the tracking software. A set of standard threshold values specific to the particle tracking software were applied to all video data as follows: “Objects” were identified using bpfilter 3, nsize 13, gradob 0, applying a std. threshold of 3.99; nearest objects between frames within 5 pixels were joined to create tracks of the moving particles. To separate swimming bacteria tracks from other particles, tracks were only retained that were at least 1 second long (monitored over a minimum of 25 frames) and moved greater than 2 std above the mean deviation in position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000395.g005">Fig 5</xref>).</p>

(C–E) Shown are MS/MS ion extractions for the TlpD C340-containing peptide NCRLGKWYYEGAGK from samples treated with 1 mM TCEP (C), hydrogen peroxide (D), or HOCl (E). For each sample, ion extractions for +3 charged peptides containing modifications corresponding to alkylation are shown on top (C340-SONH<sub>2</sub>, unreacted cysteine thiols modified by iodoacetamide), oxidation of C340 to a cysteine sulfinate (C340-SO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>) are shown in the middle, and oxidation of C340 to a cysteine sulfonate (C340-SO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>) are shown on the bottom on a fixed scale. Integrations values for peaks are noted with “AA.” The experiment and analysis are described further in the Method details. CD, circular dichroism; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; TCEP, Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine; TlpD, transducer-like protein D.</p>
