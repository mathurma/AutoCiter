<article-title>Assembly and stoichiometry of the core structure of the bacterial flagellar type III export gate complex</article-title>
</related-article>
<abstract>
<p>Many bacteria move using a complex, self-assembling nanomachine, the bacterial flagellum. Biosynthesis of the flagellum depends on a flagellar-specific type III secretion system (T3SS), a protein export machine homologous to the export machinery of the virulence-associated injectisome. Six cytoplasmic (FliH/I/J/G/M/N) and seven integral-membrane proteins (FlhA/B FliF/O/P/Q/R) form the flagellar basal body and are involved in the transport of flagellar building blocks across the inner membrane in a proton motive force-dependent manner. However, how the large, multi-component transmembrane export gate complex assembles in a coordinated manner remains enigmatic. Specific for most flagellar T3SSs is the presence of FliO, a small bitopic membrane protein with a large cytoplasmic domain. The function of FliO is unknown, but homologs of FliO are found in &gt;80% of all flagellated bacteria. Here, we demonstrate that FliO protects FliP from proteolytic degradation and promotes the formation of a stable FliP–FliR complex required for the assembly of a functional core export apparatus. We further reveal the subcellular localization of FliO by super-resolution microscopy and show that FliO is not part of the assembled flagellar basal body. In summary, our results suggest that FliO functions as a novel, flagellar T3SS-specific chaperone, which facilitates quality control and productive assembly of the core T3SS export machinery.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Many bacteria use the bacterial flagellum for directed movement in various environments. The assembly and function of the bacterial flagellum and the related virulence-associated injectisome relies on protein export via a conserved type III secretion system (T3SS). The multicomponent transmembrane core export apparatus of the flagellar T3SS consists of FlhA/B and FliP/Q/R and must assemble in a highly coordinated manner. In the present study, we determined the role of the transmembrane protein FliO in the maturation of the flagellar core protein export apparatus. We show that FliO functions as a flagellum-specific chaperone during the initial step of export apparatus assembly. FliO facilitates the efficient formation of a stable FliP–FliR core complex and is thus required for quality management and productive assembly of the flagellar export apparatus. Our results suggest a coordinated assembly process of the flagellar core export apparatus that nucleates with the FliO-dependent formation of a FliP–FliR complex. Subsequent incorporation of FliQ, FlhB, and FlhA leads to the assembly of a secretion-competent flagellar T3SS.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The ability of many bacteria to move on surfaces and swim through liquid environments depends on the function of a rotating nanomachine, the bacterial flagellum. The flagellum is highly conserved among bacterial species and is best characterized in <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium. The structure of the flagellum can be divided into 3 main parts: a basal body, a flexible hook, and a long rigid filament [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref002">2</xref>]. The basal body itself is composed of several substructures located in the cytosol or spanning the bacterial cell envelope. The inner membrane MS ring, the periplasmic P ring, and the outer membrane L ring assemble using the Sec-pathway. The self-assembly of all other axial parts of the flagellum is dependent on protein export through the flagellar-specific type III secretion system (fT3SS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref003">3</xref>]. The core integral-membrane components of the flagellar export apparatus (FlhA/B and FliP/Q/R) are closely related to the virulence-associated T3SS (vT3SS) of the injectisome device used by many gram-negative bacteria to inject toxins into host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref004">4</xref>]. Protein export via both fT3SS and vT3SS is primarily dependent on the proton motive force (pmf) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref009">9</xref>]. How the bacterial cell coordinates the self-assembly of the multicomponent export apparatus complex in the inner membrane remains elusive.</p>
<p>Six cytoplasmic and seven membrane proteins are essential for the export of the majority of the extra-cytoplasmic building blocks of the flagellum. The MS ring is made of 26 subunits of FliF and likely assembles after the completion of the core integral membrane export apparatus, similar to the injectisome system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref013">13</xref>]. Tightly associated with the MS ring is a cytoplasmic ring (C ring) made of FliG/M/N. The C ring functions as a rotor/switch complex and serves also as a docking platform for cargo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref014">14</xref>] and the FliH/I/J ATPase complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref016">16</xref>], which facilitates export via ATP hydrolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref017">17</xref>]. Within the MS ring, the integral membrane proteins FlhB/A and FliO/P/Q/R are thought to form the export gate. FlhA was reported to form a nonameric ring and presumably energizes export using the pmf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref020">20</xref>]. FlhB is involved in the switch of secretion specificity between late and early substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref021">21</xref>]. FliO (17.5 kDa), FliP (25 kDa), FliQ (9 kDa), and FliR (26 kDa) are integral membrane proteins and essential for the export of flagellar substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref022">22</xref>]. FliP/Q/R are highly conserved in all fT3SS and have homologs in the vT3SS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref023">23</xref>]. Interestingly, FliO homologs are apparently absent in the vT3SS, suggesting an important fT3SS-specific role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref024">24</xref>]. FliO is a bitopic membrane protein with a large cytosolic C-terminal domain. While FliO is required for flagella formation and motility under physiological conditions, upregulation of flagellar secretion substrates and a secondary-site suppressor mutation in FliP restored partial motility of a Δ<italic>fliO</italic> strain, indicating a functional link between FliO and FliP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref027">27</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we determined the molecular function of FliO in maturation of the flagellar type III secretion system (T3SS). We propose that FliO functions as a flagellum-specific, integral membrane chaperone that stabilizes FliP protein and facilitates the formation of a stable FliP–FliR core complex, which is essential for the productive assembly of a functional flagellar basal body.</p>

<title>Phylogenetic distribution of FliO reveals widespread conservation</title>
<p>Homologs of FliO are absent in vT3SS of the injectisome and were also thought to be absent in many flagellated species. However, Pallen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref028">28</xref>] suggested that FliO homologs are misannotated as FliZ in some bacterial species and identified several potential FliO homologs through PSI-BLAST searches: Cj0352 in <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic>, LA2612 in <italic>Leptospira interrogans</italic>, RB9276 in <italic>Rhodopirellula baltica</italic>, and TP0719 in <italic>Treponema pallidum</italic>.</p>
<p>This suggested that FliO homologs are more widespread than previously thought, and we thus performed a detailed phylogenetic analysis of the distribution of FliO proteins across different bacterial phyla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002267.g001">Fig 1</xref>). We retrieved the full collection of representative genomes from the <italic>refseq</italic> NCBI repository (<italic>n</italic> = 4771) and queried the genomes for the presence of flagellin, FliO, FliP, FliQ, and FliR homologs using regular annotations. We found that FliO homologs in particular were poorly annotated and in fact sometimes misannotated as FliZ, as previously noted by Pallen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref028">28</xref>]. This suggested that a large proportion of FliO homologs are missed by the automated annotation algorithms.</p>

<title>FliO protects FliP from proteolytic degradation</title>
<p>The gene encoding for FliP is frequently encoded in an operon with <italic>fliO</italic>, and a previous study suggested a functional link between FliO and FliP based on genetic evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref026">26</xref>]. FliP is strongly conserved in both fT3SS and vT3SS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002267.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) and essential for protein export [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref022">22</xref>]. Accordingly, we hypothesized that the flagellum-specific protein FliO evolved to facilitate efficient production or assembly of FliP, a core component of the fT3SS. In an attempt to validate the presumed functional link between FliO and FliP, we analyzed the effect of excess FliP and FliO in wild-type (WT) and Δ<italic>fliO</italic> backgrounds. In the WT background, neither expression of FliP nor FliO increased motility compared to the empty vector control (VC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002267.g002">Fig 2</xref> + <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002267.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).

<p>The dispensability of FliO upon FliP overexpression led us to speculate that FliO was involved in maintaining FliP stability. To follow this idea, we monitored FliP protein levels after the arrest of de novo protein synthesis. We replaced the native <italic>fliP</italic> gene with epitope-tagged FliP variants to facilitate the detection of FliP protein. The 3×hemagglutinin (HA)- or 3×FLAG-tagged FliP proteins were expressed from the physiological <italic>fliP</italic> locus and retained WT function in a swimming plate motility assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002267.s005">S5 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>In a WT background, FliP remained stable after synthesis inhibition during the duration of the experiment. In a Δ<italic>fliO</italic> mutant, however, FliP protein levels degraded rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002267.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). This suggested that FliO was involved in stabilizing FliP protein. To exclude polar effects of the <italic>fliO</italic> deletion, we monitored protein stability of episomally expressed FliP in Δ<italic>fliP</italic> and Δ<italic>fliOP</italic> mutant backgrounds and observed a similar degradation pattern of FliP in the absence of FliO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002267.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).

<p>As mentioned above, FliP harbors a signal peptide of the Sec-system, and this raised the possibility that FliO participated in efficient cotranslational membrane integration of FliP. We thus assessed the effects of a <italic>fliO</italic> deletion in respect to the level of membrane-integrated FliP. Crude membranes were collected by ultracentrifugation and washed with urea to discriminate properly integrated proteins from aggregated proteins associated with the cytoplasmic membrane. FliP protein levels were determined in both the presence and absence of FliO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002267.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). As expected for a polytopic integral membrane protein, we detected FliP only in the membrane fractions but not in the cytosol. FliP steady-state protein levels were comparable in the presence and absence of FliO, indicating that FliO did not influence FliP incorporation into the inner membrane.</p>
<p>In order to understand the mechanisms underlying FliO stabilization of FliP, we aimed to identify the protease responsible for FliP degradation. We first analyzed the contribution of the integral membrane protease FtsH, which is involved in quality control of membrane protein complexes, such as the SecYEG translocase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref029">29</xref>]. As a deletion of FtsH is lethal, we monitored FliP protein stability under conditions overproducing an inhibitor of FtsH, STM1085 (YccA in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref031">31</xref>]. YccA has been shown to limit the suicidal degradation of jammed Sec-translocon complexes by inhibiting FtsH activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref031">31</xref>]. LamB-LacZ hybrids are commonly used to study jammed Sec-translocons. In order to verify the functionality of our YccA expression construct, we thus monitored bacterial growth after jamming of the Sec-translocon using a LamB-LacZ hybrid in the presence or absence of excess YccA. Expression of YccA from a medium-copy plasmid rescued the lethal growth defect after induction of the LamB-LacZ hybrid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002267.s008">S8A Fig</xref>). We next analyzed FliP protein stability in the absence of FliO in the presence or absence of YccA, the inhibitor of FtsH. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002267.s008">S8B Fig</xref>, the FliP degradation pattern did not change, which suggested that FtsH might not be primarily responsible for the observed proteolytic degradation of FliP in the absence of FliO. We therefore analyzed FliP stability in the absence of FliO in mutants defective for the cytoplasmic ClpP and Lon proteases. In the Δ<italic>clpXP</italic> mutant, the presence of FliO was required to maintain FliP stability. In the Δ<italic>lon</italic> mutant, however, FliP was also significantly more stable in the absence of FliO, suggesting that Lon is the primary protease responsible for FliP degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002267.g003">Fig 3C</xref>).</p>

<title>FliO is not located in the basal body of the flagellum</title>
<p>Previous studies suggested that FliO, FliP, FliQ, and FliR were integral parts of the basal body complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref032">32</xref>]. However, the subcellular localization of the fT3SS components has only been experimentally determined for FliP and FliR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref023">23</xref>]. As we demonstrated above, overproduction of FliP readily bypassed the requirement of FliO for the formation of functional flagella, which suggested that FliO might not be part of the completed fT3SS. To determine the subcellular localization of FliO, we performed single-molecule super-resolution microscopy of FliO-HaloTag and FliN-HaloTag protein fusions using structured illumination microscopy (SIM) and direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref033">33</xref>]. The chromosomal HaloTag fusions to FliO and FliN did not impair the protein export function of the fT3SS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002267.s009">S9 Fig</xref>), and the FliN-HaloTag construct has previously been shown to display normal flagellation patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref027">27</xref>]. The C ring protein FliN was localized in clusters corresponding to the C rings of flagellar basal bodies, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref034">34</xref>], but not in the absence of the MS ring needed for C ring assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002267.g004">Fig 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002267.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). FliO, however, was evenly distributed in smaller clusters in the cytoplasmic membrane, and the observed FliO-HaloTag clusters were not affected in mutant strains defective in MS-ring or fT3SS assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002267.g004">Fig 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002267.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Single-molecule tracking (SMT) revealed that FliN remained stably attached in the cell envelope with an apparent diffusion coefficient of 0.03 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>. FliO followed long trajectories in the cell envelope with a 6-fold higher apparent diffusion coefficient of 0.2 μm<sup>2</sup>∙s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002267.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>), which is consistent with previous reports ranging from 0.02 to 0.2 μm<sup>2</sup>∙s<sup>−1</sup> for freely diffusing inner-membrane proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref036">36</xref>]. We next performed colocalization studies of FliO-HaloTag and the C ring protein FliM-mEos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002267.s010">S10 Fig</xref>) and FliO-HaloTag or FliN-HaloTag with the flagellar hook (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002267.s010">S10 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002267.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). The hook-basal-body (HBB) components FliM, FliN, and epitope-tagged hook protein FlgE localized in discrete spots similar to FliN-HaloTag as described above, and, consistently, FliN-HaloTag complexes were readily identified in the vicinity of extracellular hook structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002267.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). In contrast, we did not observe colocalization of FliO-HaloTag with HBB components (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002267.s010">S10 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002267.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). These results indicated that FliO is not part of the final assembled fT3SS within the basal body complex.

<title>FliO is required for FliP complex formation and basal body assembly</title>
<p>In order to study the effect of the absence of FliO on core fT3SS export apparatus formation and basal body assembly, we performed blue native PAGE (BN-PAGE) on crude membrane extracts solubilized in n-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002267.g006">Fig 6</xref>). In a WT background, we detected 3×FLAG epitope–tagged FliP expressed from its native chromosomal locus in several low, intermediate, and high-molecular-weight complexes. We additionally performed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of selected bands corresponding to FliP-containing complexes, as detected by BN-PAGE Western blotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002267.s011">S11 Fig</xref>). According to the BN-PAGE migration pattern and mass spectrometry analysis, FliP is present in several complexes in the WT: in a high-molecular-weight complex (complex 1), which presumably corresponds to finished, completed HBB complexes; in a minor (less abundant), intermediate molecular weight precursor complex (complex 3); and in a major (more abundant), intermediate molecular weight precursor complex (complex 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002267.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). LC-MS/MS analysis of the intermediate-molecular-weight FliP-containing complexes 3 and 4 further suggested the presence of FliO (in complex 3 and 4) and FliR (in complex 4). We note that we did not detect FliP in complex 4 by LC-MS/MS analysis, which is likely explained by well-known difficulties in detecting hydrophobic membrane proteins by LC-MS/MS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002267.s011">S11A Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>In a mutant strain deficient for FliO, however, we neither detected FliP in complex 1 corresponding to the completed HBB, nor at the molecular weight of the intermediate-molecular-weight FliP precursor complexes 3 and 4. However, monomeric FliP was substantially more abundant in the Δ<italic>fliO</italic> mutant than in the WT. We also observed the formation of another FliP-containing high-molecular-weight complex in the Δ<italic>fliO</italic> mutant, which apparently migrated slightly below the completed basal body complexes of the WT and could correspond to aggregated FliP subassemblies (complex 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002267.g006">Fig 6A</xref>).</p>
<p>We next analyzed the assembly of FliP complexes in a mutant strain defective in MS-ring assembly (Δ<italic>fliF</italic>).

This suggested that complex 2 corresponds to aggregated FliP and demonstrates that the complex 2 is not related to the completed basal body complex observed in the WT (complex 1). In summary, these results suggested a sequence of assembly of the flagellar core export apparatus, which nucleates with the formation of a FliP-containing subcomplex, followed by subsequent assembly of additional transmembrane export apparatus components, and concluded by the assembly of the MS ring. Similar to the assembly of FliP, the formation of a FlhA-containing high-molecular-weight complex, which presumably corresponds to the finished HBB, was dependent on the presence of FliO and FliF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002267.s012">S12 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We next performed BN-PAGE of crude membrane extracts of a strain encoding for a functional FliO–FLAG fusion protein to corroborate the mass spectrometry and subcellular localization results. FliO showed a very heterogeneous size distribution in the BN-PAGE analysis, indicating complexes of different compositions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002267.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). The presence of FliO in intermediate-molecular-weight FliP-containing complexes—but not in completed HBB complexes—was also supported by LC-MS/MS analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002267.s011">S11A Fig</xref>) and is consistent with the super-resolution subcellular localization studies of FliO-HaloTag described above.</p>
<p>To validate the presence of FliO in FliP precursor complexes, we performed a FLAG-pull down of chromosomally encoded FliP-3×FLAG in a rod<sup>−</sup> background (Δ<italic>flgBC</italic>) under native conditions, followed by BN-PAGE protein separation and LC-MS/MS analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002267.s011">S11B Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002267.s013">S13A Fig</xref>). A rod<sup>−</sup> background was used to facilitate access of the 3×FLAG–tag located in the periplasmic domain of FliP. We observed several high-molecular-weight complexes, which corresponded to different FliP-containing subassemblies of the export gate and the basal body. Mass spectrometry analysis of the FliP-containing complexes suggested the presence of basal body components (FliF, FliG, FlhA) in the high-molecular-weight complexes A and B, and of FlhA, FliO, and FliR in the intermediate-molecular-weight complexes C and D that copurified with FliP. In support, a pull down of chromosomally encoded FliO-3×FLAG using crude membrane extracts of a rod<sup>−</sup> background copurified chromosomally encoded FliP-3×HA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002267.s013">S13B Fig</xref>). We further expressed a plasmid-based FliO His<sub>6</sub>-FliP construct in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and performed His<sub>6</sub>-FliP affinity purification followed by size exclusion chromatography. High molecular weight, pore-like FliP-containing complexes copurified with FliO, suggesting a direct or indirect interaction between these proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002267.s013">S13C Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We next followed up on the presumed presence of the core integral membrane fT3SS component FliR in FliP-containing intermediate-molecular-weight complexes. We purified crude membrane extracts of rod<sup>−</sup> strains expressing FliP-3×FLAG and FliR-3×FLAG constructs from their native chromosomal locus and performed 2D BN-PAGE analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002267.g007">Fig 7</xref>). In the WT, we detected FliP and FliR in a high-molecular-weight complex corresponding to the flagellar basal body and in similar intermediate-molecular-weight complexes, which presumably corresponded to FliP–FliR subassemblies. Consistent with the 1D BN-PAGE results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002267.g006">Fig 6</xref>, the formation of FliP- and FliR-containing basal body complexes, but not the assembly of the intermediate-molecular-weight FliP–FliR complex (complex 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002267.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), was dependent on the MS-ring protein FliF. We also note that the formation of stable FliP–FliR subassemblies is reminiscent to the previously observed SpaP–SpaR complex of the vT3SS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref037">37</xref>].</p>

<p>Our results, presented above, suggested that the observed major, intermediate-molecular-weight FliP precursor complex (complex 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002267.g006">Fig 6A</xref>) contained FliR and that the formation of a stable FliP–FliR complex was dependent on FliO.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002267.g008">Fig 8</xref>, the assembly of stable FliP-containing subassemblies was dependent on the presence of FliO and FliR but not on FliQ or FliF.

Right: Model of the coordinated assembly of the core flagellar export apparatus. Upon initiation of flagellum assembly, the flagellar type III secretion system (T3SS)-specific chaperone FliO facilitates formation of an oligomeric complex containing FliP and FliR. FliO then presumably dissociates from the stable FliP–FliR core complex. The FliP–FliR core complex forms the nucleus for the assembly of FliQ, FlhB, and FlhA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref011">11</xref>], followed by MS-ring (FliF) polymerization and formation of the completed protein export-competent flagellar T3SS.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In <italic>Salmonella</italic> and other gram-negative bacteria, the flagellum and virulence-associated injectisome complexes play a crucial role during the infection process. The injectisome is believed to have evolved from the flagellum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref039">39</xref>], and both nanomachines share many structural and functional similarities. In particular, the proteins forming the core T3SS protein export apparatus are highly conserved. One of the most striking differences is the absence of a FliO homolog in the injectisome vT3SS. Assembly of the flagellum and bacterial motility is dramatically impaired in the absence of FliO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref026">26</xref>]; however, the molecular function of FliO remained elusive. Mutations in <italic>fliP</italic> have been shown to partially restore motility of a Δ<italic>fliO</italic> strain, and overexpression of FliO increased FliP expression, suggesting a functional relationship between these 2 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref026">26</xref>]. Here, we show that the nonmotile phenotype of a <italic>fliO</italic> deletion mutant was readily bypassed by moderate overproduction of FliP, which indicated that FliO was involved in FliP stability or complex assembly. To test this hypothesis, we monitored FliP protein stability after arrest of de novo protein synthesis and showed that the presence of FliO prevented FliP degradation. We demonstrate that Lon is the primary protease responsible for FliP degradation. The degradation of FliP as an integral membrane protein by a cytosolic protease is surprising, but LonB of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> is membrane-localized, and in yeast, the respective Lon homolog has been shown to degrade proteins of the mitochondrial membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref041">41</xref>]. This result suggests that Lon is able to tightly interact with the cytoplasmic membrane in order degrade misassembled FliP.</p>
<p>It has been thought that FliO was part of the fT3SS within the basal body complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref032">32</xref>], and we performed super-resolution microscopy analyses to determine the subcellular localization of FliO. FliO did not colocalize with components of the basal body, and single-molecule analysis revealed that FliO complexes are evenly distributed and freely diffusing in the cytoplasmic membrane. We thus hypothesized that FliO is not part of the fT3SS in the assembled basal body and does not actively participate in the export process but rather has a function as an accessory protein during assembly of the core export apparatus.</p>
<p>We tested this hypothesis by performing 1D and 2D BN-PAGE and LC-MS/MS analyses of crude membrane extracts to determine the composition of the basal body complex under native conditions. We did not detect FliO in completed basal body complexes, but FliO was associated with FliP and FliR-containing subcomplexes. The formation of stable FliP–FliR subassemblies required the presence of FliO, but not the MS-ring protein FliF. These observations indicate that precursors of the flagellar export gate assemble prior and independently from the MS ring, as previously shown for vT3SS assembly of the injectisome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref042">42</xref>]. Finally, FliP monomers detected using BN-PAGE analysis were strikingly more abundant in the absence of FliO, which was consistent with the absence of FliP-containing higher-molecular-weight complexes in the <italic>fliO</italic> mutant.</p>
<p>In summary, we propose that FliO functions as a flagellum-specific chaperone required for productive assembly of the core flagellar export apparatus. We suggest that assembly of the flagellar core T3SS initiates with the formation of FliP–FliR oligomers, which is facilitated by FliO. Upon assembly of a stable FliP–FliR core complex, FliO is released and possibly replaced with other export gate components. The FliP–FliR core complex might subsequently serve as platform for the recruitment of FliQ, FlhB, and the FlhA nonamer, resulting in the formation of a secretion-competent export apparatus needed for flagellar assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002267.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Both the bacterial flagellum and the homologous vT3SS of the injectisome device are important virulence factors of many pathogenic bacteria. Thus, understanding the principles and molecular mechanisms of the assembly of large, multicomponent transmembrane protein complexes might have important implications for the rational design of novel anti-infectives that interfere with the assembly and function of these nanomachines.</p>

<title>Phylogenetic analysis and de novo prediction of FliO, FliP, FliQ, FliR, and flagellin homologs</title>
<p>In order to characterize the distribution of FliO, FliP, FliQ, FliR, and flagellin proteins across different bacterial phyla, proteomes (.faa files) of representative genomes were downloaded from <italic>refseq</italic> NCBI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/about/prokaryotes/" xlink:type="simple">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/about/prokaryotes/</ext-link>.</p>
<p>A total of 4,771 genomes (date: 01.05.2017) were retrieved, and the proteomes were queried based on regular NCBI annotations for the presence of FliO, FliP, FliQ, FliR, and flagellin proteins. For the de novo prediction of homologs of FliO, FliP, FliQ, FliR, and flagellin proteins, HMMs were generated using the curated Pfam database models for FliO (PF04347), FliP (PF00813), FliQ (PF01313), FliR (PF01311), and flagellin (PF00669+PF00700), and all representative genomes were screened using the <italic>hmmsearch</italic> function in HMMER3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref046">46</xref>] with the default Pfam database gathering cutoff (GA) per domain.

The majority of novel FliO proteins corresponded to hypothetical genes. Results from the annotated FliO, FliP, FliQ, FliR, and flagellin proteins and the de novo prediction were integrated using custom Python scripts.

Cells were resuspended in 15 ml of buffer K (50 mM TEA, 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) and supplemented with cOmplete mini EDTA free protease inhibitors cocktail, 10 μg ml<sup>−1</sup> DNase, 10 μg ml<sup>−1</sup> lysozyme, and 1 mM EDTA. After 30-min incubation, cells were lysed using a French Press at 18,000 psi. After lysis, 1-mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> was added, and lysates were centrifuged at 24,000 × g for 20 min to eliminate cell debris. Crude membranes were pelleted at 200,000 × g for 50 min, resuspended in 500 μl of buffer M (1×), and homogenized in a 1-ml dounce homogenizer. Membranes were then stored on ice before separation on sucrose gradient or pull down.</p>

<title>1D and 2D BN-PAGE</title>
<p>Crude membranes or pull-down elations were prepared as described above. An aliquot of solubilized membranes (45 μl) were collected and mixed to 5 μl of 5% coomassie G (Serva) in 250-mM n-amino-caproic-acid, 50% glycerol and 25 μl were loaded on a 3%–12% NativePAGE (Thermo Fisher scientific) and run for 50 min at 130 V. The cathode buffer was exchanged and the gel was run for an additional 1 h 30 min at 250 V at 4°C. Electrotransfer onto a PVDF membrane was performed at 30 V for 2 h. As previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002267.ref013">13</xref>], 2D BN/SDS PAGE of crude membranes was carried out.</p>

<title>Sucrose gradient</title>
<p>Previously homogenized crude membrane extracts were carefully deposed at the surface of a 30%−55% sucrose gradient and were centrifuged for 14 h at 150,000 g. All steps were performed at 4°C. Eight fractions of 1 ml were collected and diluted 1:3 with buffer M (50 mM TEA, 1 mM EDTA at pH 7.5) and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the membranes were resuspended in 200-μl buffer L (50 mM TEA, 250 mM sucrose at pH 7.5). After SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis, the purest fractions were pooled together. Protein concentration was measured using Bradford protein assay (BioRad), and the concentration of each sample was adjusted to 3.0 mg ml<sup>−1</sup>. Membranes were then solubilized with 1% DDM for 1 h under gentle shaking and centrifuged 20 min at 20,000 × g to eliminate nonsolubilized membranes. The supernatant was collected, and a 25-μl sample was loaded on a 3%–12% BN-PAGE as described below.</p>

<title>FliO/FliP-3×FLAG pull down</title>
<p>A strain lacking the rod proteins (Δ<italic>flgBC</italic>) was used to ensure that the FLAG tag was accessible from the periplasm. Crude membranes were prepared as described above from a 1-L culture. Membranes were solubilized for 1 h with 0.5% DDM and centrifuged at 20,000 for 20 min to eliminate cell debris. Solubilized membranes were then incubated for 4 h with 25-μl anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) at 4°C in PBS with 0.1% DDM, washed with 4 column volumes, and eluted by addition of FLAG peptide.

The peptide mixtures were injected onto the column in HPLC solvent A (0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 500 nl min<sup>−1</sup> and subsequently eluted with a 57-min gradient of 5-33-50-90% HPLC solvent B (80% ACN in 0.1% formic acid). During peptide elution, the flow rate was kept constant at 200 nl min<sup>−1</sup>. The 10 most intense precursor ions were sequentially fragmented in each scan cycle using collision-induced dissociation (CID). In all measurements, sequenced precursor masses were excluded from further selection for 90 s.

In a database search, full specificity was required for trypsin. Cleavage specificity C-terminal of phenylalanine, tryptophan, tyrosine, leucine, and methionine was set for chymotrypsin, and up to 5 missed cleavages were allowed. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as fixed modification, protein N-terminal acetylation, and oxidation of methionine were set as variable modifications. Initial precursor mass tolerance was set to 4.5 parts per million (ppm) and at the fragment ion level 0.5 dalton (Da) was set for CID fragmentation.
