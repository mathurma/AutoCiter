<abstract>
<p>LeuT-like fold Na-dependent secondary active transporters form a large family of integral membrane proteins that transport various substrates against their concentration gradient across lipid membranes, using the free energy stored in the downhill concentration gradient of sodium ions. These transporters play an active role in synaptic transmission, the delivery of key nutrients, and the maintenance of osmotic pressure inside the cell. It is generally believed that binding of an ion and/or a substrate drives the conformational dynamics of the transporter. However, the exact mechanism for converting ion binding into useful work has yet to be established. Using a multi-dimensional path sampling (string-method) followed by all-atom free energy simulations, we established the principal thermodynamic and kinetic components governing the ion-dependent conformational dynamics of a LeuT-like fold transporter, the sodium/benzyl-hydantoin symporter Mhp1, for an entire conformational cycle. We found that inward-facing and outward-facing states of Mhp1 display nearly the same free energies with an ion absent from the Na2 site conserved across the LeuT-like fold transporters. The barrier separating an apo-state from inward-facing or outward-facing states of the transporter is very low, suggesting stochastic gating in the absence of ion/substrate bound. In contrast, the binding of a Na2 ion shifts the free energy stabilizing the outward-facing state and promoting substrate binding. Our results indicate that ion binding to the Na2 site may also play a key role in the intracellular thin gate dynamics modulation by altering its interactions with the transmembrane helix 5 (TM5). The Potential of Mean Force (PMF) computations for a substrate entrance displays two energy minima that correspond to the locations of the main binding site S1 and proposed allosteric S2 binding site. However, it was found that substrate's binds to the site S1 ∼5 kcal/mol more favorable than that to the site S2 for all studied bound combinations of ions and a substrate.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>This study provides direct insights of how ion-dependent secondary transporters couples ion gradients to transport of a substrate. We conclude that the apo-form of a protein samples multiple conformational states separated by only small barriers. Binding of a single ion is sufficient to shift this conformational equilibrium towards one of the conformational states. Our work provides atomic detail for an ion-dependent gating that is at the heart of transport across membrane and present in many kingdoms of life.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ion-coupled secondary-active transporters are integral membrane proteins involved in the cellular uptake and release of various substrates across cell membranes. These transporters transport the main substrate uphill against its concentration gradient by coupling with the favorable downhill transport of ion(s). Examples of their substrates include neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, and epinephrine), sugars, amino acids, and nucleobases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Forrest1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Abramson1">[3]</xref>. The malfunction of secondary transporters is implicated in various neurological, skin, cardiovascular, and renal diseases in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Abramson1">[3]</xref>. As a result, ion-coupled secondary transporters are important targets for drugs in the treatment of psychotic states, schizophrenia, clinical depression, diabetes, and obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Krishnamurthy1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Abramson1">[3]</xref>. For example, several sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are being developed as a new class of drugs to treat type 2 diabetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-AbdulGhani1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Chao1">[5]</xref>, while transporters from the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter (NSS) family are common targets for anti-depressants (tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) and drug of abuse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Zhou1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Rudnick1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>The generally accepted mechanism for secondary-active transport is the alternating access model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Jardetzky1">[10]</xref> in which the transporter changes between outward-facing and inward-facing conformations, allowing the main substrate and coupled ion(s) to bind to one side and be released from the other side. The progress in structural studies of secondary transporters led to identification of several structure folds including a so-called “LeuT-like” fold. The LeuT-like fold secondary transporters share common structural features, including two-fold symmetric inverted repeats that involve 5+5 essential helices and a break in the TM helices that forms the substrate binding pocket(s) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Forrest1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Abramson1">[3]</xref>. Recently, the sodium/hydantoin symporter Mhp1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Shimamura1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Weyand1">[12]</xref>, the sodium/leucine symporter LeuT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Krishnamurthy2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Yamashita1">[14]</xref>, and the sodium/betaine symporter BetP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Ressl1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Perez1">[16]</xref> were crystallized in both outward-facing and inward-facing conformational states, providing detailed molecular insight into the atomic structures of the key protein states involved in the transport of a substrate. Structurally, Mhp1 has the same “LeuT-like fold” as LeuT, vSGLT, BetP and several other transporters despite belonging to a different gene family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Weyand1">[12]</xref> and thus represents an ideal target for understanding of basic principles that governs mechanism of secondary transport in LeuT-like fold transporters.</p>
<p>Mhp1 belongs to the nucleobase-cation-symport-1 gene family (NCS1). Similarly to LeuT, Mhp1 is Na<sup>+</sup> dependent. Mhp1 has a transport stoichiometry of 1 Na<sup>+</sup>: 1 substrate, differing from the 2 Na<sup>+</sup>:1 substrate ratio in LeuT. Despite the different stoichiometry, the sodium-binding site in Mhp1, corresponding to the Na2 site in LeuT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Yamashita1">[14]</xref>, is conserved in LeuT-like fold Na-dependent secondary transporters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Abramson1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Zhao1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Gouaux1">[18]</xref>. Thus, a detailed molecular-level understanding of the transport mechanism of Mhp1 may offer a chance to generalize the coupling mechanism for this large group of LeuT-like fold Na-dependent secondary transporters. The crystal structures for Mhp1 were captured in the following states: outward-facing open state with a bound sodium ion (<italic>O_i</italic>), outward-facing occluded state with a bound substrate and a sodium ion (<italic>O_si</italic>), and apo inward-facing open (<italic>I_apo</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Shimamura1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Weyand1">[12]</xref>. Several tentative mechanisms were proposed recently by Shimamura <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Shimamura1">[11]</xref> with the use of a dynamical-importance sampling study for the transitions and Adelman <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Adelman1">[19]</xref> extending a weighted ensemble path-sampling study with coarse-grained model. Although these studies offered a potential scheme for the conformational dynamics in Mhp1, the studies also have serious limitations. Most importantly, the transported Na<sup>+</sup> and the benzyl hydantoin substrate, despite playing an essential role in the transport cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Zhao1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Zhao2">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Li1">[24]</xref>, were not included explicitly in the path sampling computations. Therefore one of the key questions in the mechanism of secondary transport remained untouched. In particular, how does the binding of a sodium ion stabilize different conformational states of the system? To aid the understanding of the role of the sodium ion in conformational transitions, we performed atomistic simulations for the whole transport cycle of <italic>O_i</italic>→<italic>O_si</italic>→<italic>I_apo</italic>→<italic>O_i</italic> with explicit membrane, water environment, and the transported ion and substrate. To elucidate a reaction path for this transition, we used the swarm-of-trajectories method of Pan <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Gan1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Pan1">[26]</xref>. The resulting minimum-energy reaction path was used then for detailed exploration of the energetics of the protein conformational transition as a function of ion/substrate binding with free energy simulations. Specifically, we report multiple 2-dimensional-potential of mean force (2D- PMF) profiles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Allen1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Torrie1">[29]</xref> along the gating reaction coordinate and discuss role of ion/ligand binding in stabilization of different conformational states of the system. These profiles help to elucidate the thermodynamic contributions governing the ion/ligand translocation and transporter conformational changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Lau1">[30]</xref>.</p>

<title>Defining the order parameters</title>
<p>One of the key challenges in characterizing the free energy landscapes of conformational transitions in proteins is a definition of a set of variables (reaction coordinates) connecting the multiple conformational states of the system. Often, such choices are based on a preconceived notion about tentative mechanism of the process. Several models that explain the mechanics for the transporter sliding from state to state have been proposed. The two most popular models are the rocking bundle model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Forrest2">[31]</xref> and the flexing helices model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Krishnamurthy2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Yamashita1">[14]</xref>. In the rocking bundle model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Forrest2">[31]</xref>, the rocking of a 4-helix “bundle” formed by TMs 1, 2, 6, and 7 against the “scaffold” formed by the rest of the essential TMs (TMs 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10) allows the transporter to alternatively open to either side of the membrane. In the flexing helices model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Krishnamurthy2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Yamashita1">[14]</xref>, flections in the two helices with a helix-break-helix motif in the middle (TM1 and TM6) of the TM section are proposed to be the major trigger for the conformational changes that allow alternating access. These two models are not necessarily mutually exclusive. The mechanics described in these models may work together to achieve the functions of Na-dependent secondary-active transporters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Krishnamurthy2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Perez1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Watanabe1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Forrest3">[33]</xref>. In a number of available crystal structures, the features of both models seem to be present, albeit to a different degree. For example, the flexing helices model is highly featured in LeuT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Krishnamurthy2">[13]</xref> while the rocking bundle model is associated with apparent symmetry between different states of Mhp1 transporters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Shimamura1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Krishnamurthy2">[13]</xref>, and a mixture of both modes of transport was proposed to be essential for BetP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Perez1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>Regardless of the gating model, natural reaction coordinate for ion-dependent conformational dynamics relevant to the process can be reduced to the distance between the groups of residues forming the conserved Na<sup>+</sup> site (Na2 of LeuT) from the two TMs (TM1 and TM8). This conserved Na<sup>+</sup> site sits between the interface of the “bundle” and “scaffold” of the rocking bundle model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Forrest2">[31]</xref>. This site is also directly beneath the break in the TM1 helix that was shown to be critical in the flexing helix model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Krishnamurthy2">[13]</xref>. Thus, following Shimamura <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Shimamura1">[11]</xref> suggestion, we use the Na2 site distance, defined as the distance between the center of mass (COM) of the Na<sup>+</sup>-coordinating residues in TM1 (Ala38, Ile41) and TM8 (Ala309, Ser312, and Thr313), as an order parameter to indicate the conformation of the transporter protein. Na2 ion binding has been strongly associated with the gating of the so-called “thick gate” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Yamashita1">[14]</xref>: ∼20 Å thick of compactly packed protein blocking the accessing path to the intracellular side for the substrate when it is closed. For clarity, we use r(thick_gate) to describe the order parameter. A r(thick_gate) of ∼5.5 Å indicates outward-facing state, whereas a r(thick_gate) of approximately 10 Å corresponds to inward-facing state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003296-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

The order parameter is defined by the Center of Mass (COM) distance between the Na<sup>+</sup> coordinating residues from TM1 (A38, I41) and TM8 (A309, S312, T313). The r(thick_gate) is at ∼5.5 Å in outward-facing states (<italic>O</italic>_<italic>i</italic>, <italic>O_si</italic>), comparing to ∼10.4 Å in the inward-facing open state (<italic>I_apo</italic>). (B) Schematic illustration of a transport cycle of the Mhp1 transporter. The transport cycle was simplified by 4 sequential conformational states: <italic>O_apo</italic>→<italic>O_i</italic>→<italic>O_si</italic>→<italic>I_apo</italic>. For each conformational state, the “bundle” and “hash motif” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Shimamura1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Forrest2">[31]</xref> helices are represented in blue and orange shapes respectively. EC and IC thin gates are omitted for clarity. Na<sup>+</sup> and the substrate are represented as a magenta circle and a purple oval respectively. Typical values of the order parameters for each state are listed beside its illustration.</p>

<p>In addition to the “thick” gate, an extracellular thin gate and an intracellular thin gate have been proposed for Mhp1 to explain the alternating access mechanism in a “modified” rocking bundle model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Shimamura1">[11]</xref>. In this model, Mhp1 changes orientation through the rocking of the “bundle” helices formed by TMs 1, 2, 6, and 7 relative to a reduced “scaffold”, or the so-called “hash motif” (helices of TMs 3, 4, 8, and 9) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003296.s002">Figure S1</xref>). When the protein faces outward, TM10 could serve as an extracellular thin gate and bend to block the EC vestibule. In contrast, when the protein faces inward, the proposed IC thin gate TM5 bends and opens the IC vestibule. To account for the movement of the EC thin gate, an additional reaction coordinate r(EC_thin_gate) is defined by the COM distance of the mobile TM9/TM10 loop residues (Asn360, Thr361, and Phe362) and the stationary TM1 residues (Ile47, Ala48, and Ala49) following ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Shimamura1">[11]</xref>. The dynamics of the IC thin gate has been shown to nearly synchronize with those of the thick gate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Shimamura1">[11]</xref> and thus is redundant for describing the reaction coordinate. The order parameters (Sz(Na<sup>+</sup>) and Sz(substrate) describing binding/release of Na<sup>+</sup> and the benzyl hydantoin substrate are defined as vertical (Cartesian z-direction of the simulation system) positions relative to their respective binding sites. Thus, Sz around 0 Å corresponds to a location of the binding site, while a large positive and negative Sz value indicates that the ion/substrate is at the EC and IC side respectively. The exact definitions of the order parameters are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003296.s010">Table S1</xref>.

<p>Next we examined the free energy landscape underlying Na<sup>+</sup> release from the transporter by calculating the 2D PMF for reaction coordinates that describe vertical (across the lipid bilayer) displacement of an ion relative to its binding site (Sz(Na<sup>+</sup>)) and the state of the thick gate (r(thick_gate)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003296-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The computed PMF shows that the initial stage of the Na<sup>+</sup> release and the inward-facing opening of the thick gate, is a concerted process. 2D PMF for an ion release process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003296-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) shows a meta-stable Na<sup>+</sup> binding site, denotes Na2', near [5.5 Å, −3.0 Å]. The relative difference in stability between the main binding site and the meta-stable site is ∼5 k<sub>B</sub>T. In the meta-stable site, Na<sup>+</sup> is still coordinated by Ile38 of TM1 and Ser312 and Thr313 of TM8 but breaks away from A41 of TM1 and Ala309 of TM8 to coordinate to Asn168 of TM5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003296-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, center panel, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003296.s004">Figure S3</xref>).

<title>Binding of Na<sup>+</sup> promotes the stabilization of outward-facing state</title>
<p>The PMF maps collected in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003296-g003">Figure 3A</xref> (left panel) show essentially a flat energy surface with Na<sup>+</sup> fully dissociated from the transporter (Sz(Na<sup>+</sup>) at −32 Å to −28 Å). There is only a small difference (&lt;2 k<sub>B</sub>T) in the PMF values between the outward-facing states (r(thick_gate) at ∼5.5 Å) and the inward-facing states (r(thick_gate) at ∼10 Å). This result suggests that energy of a thermal bath is sufficient for stochastic shuttling of empty transporter between outward-facing and inward-facing states. In contrast, the binding of Na<sup>+</sup> helps to stabilize the outward-facing state of the transporter, indicated by a favorable minima at a r(thick_gate) of ∼5.5 Å relative to a shallow well at ∼10 Å (inward-facing states of the system).</p>
<p>To highlight the coupling between ion binding and energetics of gating process we computed 1D PMF slice from 2D PMF map for the r(thick_gate) dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003296-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, right panel). These 1D PMF profiles provide a measure for the relative stability of the outward-facing and inward-facing states. When a Na<sup>+</sup> is bound, the outward-facing states (r(thick_gate) ∼5.5 Å) are ∼16 k<sub>B</sub>T more favorable than the inward-facing states (r(thick_gate) ∼10 Å). In contrast, when the Na<sup>+</sup> is released, the PMF difference between the outward-facing and inward-facing states is within 2–3 k<sub>B</sub>T. To show that the stabilization of the outward-facing conformations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003296-g003">Figure 3A</xref> is mainly caused by the binding of Na<sup>+</sup> but not the substrate, we computed 2D PMF maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003296-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, left panel) for the transition from the inward-facing open (<italic>I_apo</italic>) state to the outward-facing state with a Na<sup>+</sup> bound (<italic>O_i</italic>), for which a substrate is not involved. Similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003296-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, the 2D PMF also shows that a bound Na<sup>+</sup> leads to significant stabilization of outward-facing conformations. In addition, without a bound Na<sup>+</sup>, the PMF profile was essentially flat for the transition between the inward-facing (r(thick_gate) ∼10 Å) to the outward-facing (r(thick_gate) ∼5.5 Å) states with a barriers of ∼4 k<sub>B</sub>T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003296-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, upper right panel).</p>
<p>The small barrier between the inward-facing and outward-facing states when the Na<sup>+</sup> is unbound suggests that the transition between these states is likely and can be driven by a thermal energy of the bath. This mode of gating is not uncommon in secondary transporters. For example, in an experimental study of LeuT gating using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer methods, outward-facing and inward-facing states were shown to be in equilibrium without Na<sup>+</sup> binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Zhao3">[22]</xref>.

<p>A second minimum (S2') is found at the Sz(substrate) position of ∼7 Å, approximately 8–9 Å above the S1 substrate binding site. In addition to residues from TMs 1 and 3 (Gln42, Ile47, Phe120, and Gln121), this site also involves residues from TM10 (Leu363), consistent with the putative S2 sites proposed for LeuT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Zhao3">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Shi2">[39]</xref> and DAT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Shan1">[40]</xref>. This suggests that S2 may be involved in a substrate entrance providing a low-affinity binding site. However, we note that this second free energy minimum (S2) for substrate is less favorable than in S1, with relative difference in stabilization of about 10 k<sub>B</sub>T. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003296-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, the optimal sequence for the transition from the <italic>O_i</italic> state to the <italic>O_si</italic> state is as follows. The substrate binds to the substrate binding site (S1) from the EC bulk, potentially through the putative S2' site during the transition. The EC thin gate then closes to occlude the substrate from the EC bulk. However, the EC thin gate displays significant conformational flexibility for this state as reflected by the flat PMF landscape for the opening/closure of the EC thin gate. Overall, the binding of a substrate to the S1 site for an <italic>O_i</italic> state transporter is an energetically favorable process. The PMF map shows a PMF drop of ∼16 k<sub>B</sub>T for the substrate binding to S1 relative to be in the bulk, suggesting mM affinity.</p>
<p>The data collected is insufficient to provide a definitive answer whenever S2 plays any role in conformational dynamics of the transporter. Shi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Zhao3">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Shi2">[39]</xref> proposed a mechanism in which allosteric regulation mechanism of LeuT gating requires an existence of optimal conformational state (for S2 binding) at which substrate in S2 can lead to conformational switching and it is one of many possible combinations of ion/substrate loads. Therefore complete evaluation of conformational switching due to substrate binding to S1 and S2 would require full evaluation of multiple energy surfaces as function of substrate and ion loads for every stable minima of the system and is computational unfeasible at the moment.</p>

<title>Coupling between Na<sup>+</sup> and the substrate: Substrate binding restricts the release of Na<sup>+</sup> back to extracellular bulk</title>
<p>Our results highlight the role of Na<sup>+</sup> in the transport cycle: the binding of Na<sup>+</sup> promotes the outward-facing conformation, and the release of Na<sup>+</sup> allows the transition to an inward-facing conformation. Therefore, the binding of Na<sup>+</sup> is coupled to the binding of the substrate by preparing more Mhp1 protein in the outward-facing conformation, to which the substrate can readily bind. On the other hand, the binding of the substrate was also shown to promote Na<sup>+</sup> binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Shimamura1">[11]</xref>. Our free energy profiles for the transport of Na<sup>+</sup> and substrate provide the molecular underpinning of this coupling mechanism.</p>
<p>In particular, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003296-g003">Figure 3B</xref> shows that binding of Na<sup>+</sup> to an apo-state of Mhp1 in the absence of substrate is energetically unfavorable. The dehydration of a Na<sup>+</sup> ion upon transfer from the extracellular milieu to a binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003296-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) in the <italic>O_i</italic> state is marginally unfavorable for the equi-molar IC/EC solutions used for the PMF computations. However, the small barrier for an ion to escape to the extra-cellular milieu suggests rapid ion exchanges with the bulk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003296-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). At the same time, the binding of the substrate to the <italic>O_i</italic> state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003296-g004">Figure 4A</xref>.) is an energetically favorable process that aids the stabilization of a protein in the <italic>O_si</italic> state. The presence of a bound substrate obstructs the unbinding and escape of Na<sup>+</sup> to the extracellular milieu. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003296-g005">Figure 5</xref> suggests that the bound substrate serves as a plug to restrict the release of Na<sup>+</sup> to the extracellular bulk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Shimamura1">[11]</xref>.

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In review, the free energy landscapes collected from over 4 µs of all-atom MD simulations predict that Na<sup>+</sup> binding drives the cycle by promoting outward-facing states of Mhp1, thus preparing conformations for the subsequent substrate binding. In contrast, the substrate mainly improves the apparent binding affinity of Na<sup>+</sup> by restricting the release of Na<sup>+</sup> back to the EC bulk. These computational results explain the experimental results on coupling between Na<sup>+</sup> and benzyl-hydantoin binding to Mhp1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Weyand1">[12]</xref>. Our results also indicate that Asn168 of TM5 plays an important role in Na<sup>+</sup> release to the IC bulk, reminiscent of the role assigned to Asp189 in vSGLT transporters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Li1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Watanabe1">[32]</xref> and Glu192 in LeuT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Shaikh1">[37]</xref>. This result supports the findings reported for LeuT and ApcT transporters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Shi1">[23]</xref> where Na2 ion was proposed to be essential for modulation of the IC thin gate. It was found that barriers separating an inward-facing apo and an outward-facing apo states are very low (2–4 k<sub>B</sub>T only). This result is consistent with experimental study of LeuT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Zhao3">[22]</xref> and the proposed stochastic shuttling for the Na-dependent secondary transporter glutamate transporter Glt<sub>ph</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Reyes1">[38]</xref>. Therefore, the low-barrier shuttling of empty proteins appears to be general feature in many secondary transporter systems.</p>

To match the state of <italic>O_si</italic>, A substrate was placed in the extracellular vestibule (∼13 Å above the substrate binding site) to the <italic>O_i</italic> state and a substrate and a Na<sup>+</sup> were placed in the intracellular vestibule (∼26 Å below the substrate binding site) to the <italic>I_apo</italic> state. As the EC and IC vestibules in those respective states are open to the EC and IC bulk, the substrate and Na<sup>+</sup> can diffuse to the bulk easily, i.e., they are in a relatively flat free energy surface. Thus, the exact placement of the missing substrate and Na<sup>+</sup> to <italic>O_i</italic> and <italic>I_apo</italic> states shall not affect the optimal transition paths. For each transition, the initial state was slowly pulled to the targeted state by applying a harmonic restraint to reduce the RMSD between the two states. The selection of atoms for which the RMSD constraint is applied includes the protein heavy atoms, and the ligand Na<sup>+</sup> and the 5′ carbon (Dataset S1) of the hydantoin group in the substrate. The speed for RMSD constraint evolution was set at 0.00005 Å/step. The simulation was terminated when the system was within a RMSD difference of 0.02 Å to the target.</p>

<title>Transition path sampling using the string method with swarm of trajectories</title>
<p>Large-scale conformational changes in biomolecules, such as those involved in the transport cycle of Mhp1, are complex processes taking place on timescales that can be well beyond the limit of brute force molecular dynamics simulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Pan1">[26]</xref>. In this work, we applied the recently developed and emerging string method with swarm of trajectories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Gan1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Pan1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Weinan1">[51]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Ovchinnikov1">[54]</xref> to obtain optimal paths connecting the structurally available conformational states of the Mhp1 transporter. The string method aims to find the minimum free energy path (MFEP) in the subspace of a large but finite set of coordinates, <bold>z</bold>, referred to as “collective variables” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Maragliano1">[52]</xref>. A path is ordered as a chain of <italic>M</italic> states or “images”, connecting two stable conformations. In this work, we explore the transition paths between the Mhp1 conformational states of <italic>O_i</italic>, <italic>O_si</italic>, and <italic>I_apo</italic>. These paths complete the transport cycle. To study the conformational transitions of the transporter and the translocation of the substrate and Na<sup>+</sup>, the collective variables include the Cartesian coordinates of the transporter backbone atoms, Na<sup>+</sup>, and 5′ carbon of 5-benzyl hydantoin (C5). We only included one atom (C5) in the collective variables for the substrate in order to avoid an orientational bias to the substrate. The initial paths were obtained from targeted molecular dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Schlitter1">[50]</xref> as described above. There are 9, 70, and 55 intermediate states, or images, for the path connecting <italic>O_i</italic> to <italic>O_si</italic>, <italic>O_si</italic> to <italic>I_apo</italic>, and <italic>I_apo</italic> to <italic>O_i</italic> respectively. The numbers of intermediate states were chosen so that the average RMSD of the collective variables between adjacent images is less than 0.2 Å. For each image, the simulation system has 59775 atoms, including the Mhp1 protein, the substrate, the Na<sup>+</sup>, lipid molecules, water, and Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>−</sup> counter ions. Therefore, the effect of lipid bilayers and water were taken into account explicitly.</p>
<p>The iteration of the string method generally followed the procedures by Gan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Gan1">[25]</xref> using NAMD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Kumar1">[55]</xref> and VMD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Humphrey1">[56]</xref>. Each iteration consists of 4 steps: generation of the swarm of trajectories, evolution of the image, run of constraint MD, and re-parameterization. First, for each image, 100 2-ps-long MD simulations were carried out. Second, the coordinates of the collective variables for the 100 trajectories were averaged. Third, 50 ps of MD simulations were then carried out with a strong harmonic constraint (40 kcal/mol Å) on the collective variables to evolve the collective variables to the average drift and relax the rest of the system other than the collective variables. Finally, the images are re-parametrized to ensure that they are evenly distributed in terms of collective variables along the new path, which, in our case, means the RMSD difference of the atoms in the set of collective variables between adjacent images are roughly equal. This final step ensures that the images are not trapped in local minima.</p>
<p>Following Ovchinnikov <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Ovchinnikov1">[54]</xref>, convergence of the string to the optimal path is evaluated each iteration by monitoring the average RMSD each image has moved from its initial conformation (solid red line in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003296.s007">Figure S6</xref>). In addition, we also monitored the average RMSD each image has moved from the same image 4 iterations before (dotted blue line, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003296.s006">Figure S5</xref>). Convergence is assumed when both lines reach a plateau. The transition paths are converged for <italic>O_i</italic> to <italic>O_si</italic>, <italic>O_si</italic> to <italic>I_apo</italic>, and <italic>I_apo</italic> to <italic>O_i</italic> after 30, 48, and 22 iterations. The three paths complete a transport cycle for Mhp1 and provide 137 energetically-relaxed images for the entire transport cycle. Structures from the path were chosen as appropriate starting structures for umbrella sampling simulations.</p>

<title>Umbrella sampling and WHAM analysis</title>
<p>Umbrella sampling simulations were carried out using the NAMD program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Kumar1">[55]</xref>. Harmonic constraints were applied to the order parameters using the collective variable module (colvars). Multiple windows were applied to cover the regions of interest. The window size for order parameter r(thick_gate) was 0.25 Å, while the order parameter r(EC_thin_gate), Sz(Na<sup>+</sup>), and Sz(substrate) were mapped with a window size of 0.5 Å (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003296.s010">Table S1</xref>). The force constants were chosen to be 5 kcal/mol to ensure overlapping of the sampling of windows. Each window was sampled for 560 ps of MD simulation, and the last 500 ps of data were used for weighted histogram analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Roux1">[28]</xref>. Thus, each 2D-PMF was produced from a total simulation time of 0.8–2 µs. WHAM program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Grossfield1">[57]</xref> was used to obtain the 2D PMF profiles from the umbrella sampling data. The bin size was set at 0.25 Å, and the convergence tolerance was set at 0.001 kcal/mol. The 1D-PMF's were integrated from interested regions of the 2D-PMF's following a method used by Allen <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Allen1">[27]</xref>. The statistical uncertainties were estimated by blocking the data into three blocks.</p>
<p>Proper starting conformation for each window subject to umbrella sampling is essential for efficient computation of the PMF's. In the Mhp1 transport cycle, the conformational changes are too large for the allowance of a single starting conformation, because very long simulations are required to relax the protein structure to a specific window of the order parameters. For example, while the biased potential applied in umbrella sampling could force r(thick_gate) to a value around 8.0, from either outward-facing (r(thick_gate) ∼5.5 Å)) or inward-facing (r(thick_gate) ∼10 Å) structure, extremely long simulation time may be required to relax the rest of the protein. To avoid excessive long relaxation time, targeted molecular dynamics has been applied to obtain intermediate structures for use as starting structures for umbrella sampling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003296-Louet1">[58]</xref>. In this study, we use the string method with swarm of trajectories to further relax the path from TMD simulations. To get a starting configuration for a specific window, we pick from the string-method path an intermediate configuration that has similar order parameter values for that specific window. When only one of two order parameters can be matched, priority was put on the one that usually needs more time to relax. For example, when no intermediate image has both order parameters close enough to a window centered at (r(thick_gate) = 8.0 Å, Sz(Na<sup>+</sup>) = −1 Å), we'd pick a intermediate image with r(thick_gate) around 8 Å, and let the harmonic constraint in umbrella sampling move Sz(Na<sup>+</sup>) to its designated value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003296-g006">Figure 6</xref>). For instance, in our computation for the 2D-PMF shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003296-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, we used image 32 of from the transition path obtained from swarm-of-trajectories for this window (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003296.s008">Figure S7</xref>). The absence of Na+ contamination for constructed apo-states was confirmed for each window of the umbrella simulations by running minimal contact distance analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003296.s009">Figure S8</xref>).</p>
