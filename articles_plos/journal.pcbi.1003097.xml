<abstract>
<p>A fundamental issue in locomotion is to understand how muscle forcing produces apparently complex deformation kinematics leading to movement of animals like undulatory swimmers. The question of whether complicated muscle forcing is required to create the observed deformation kinematics is central to the understanding of how animals control movement. In this work, a forced damped oscillation framework is applied to a chain-link model for undulatory swimming to understand how forcing leads to deformation and movement. A unified understanding of swimming, caused by muscle contractions (“active” swimming) or by forces imparted by the surrounding fluid (“passive” swimming), is obtained. We show that the forcing triggers the first few deformation modes of the body, which in turn cause the translational motion. We show that relatively simple forcing patterns can trigger seemingly complex deformation kinematics that lead to movement. For given muscle activation, the forcing frequency relative to the natural frequency of the damped oscillator is important for the emergent deformation characteristics of the body. The proposed approach also leads to a qualitative understanding of optimal deformation kinematics for fast swimming. These results, based on a chain-link model of swimming, are confirmed by fully resolved computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Prior results from the literature on the optimal value of stiffness for maximum speed are explained.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The damped harmonic oscillator framework has been applied to interrogate numerous engineering systems like the tuned mass damper used in power transmission, automobiles, and buildings to reduce vibrations. We apply the same framework to undulatory swimming to understand the emergence of movement due to muscular and/or environmental forcing. It helps elucidate why flexible bodies can indeed be propelled forward by not only the internal muscular forcing but also by external fluid forces as reported earlier in which dead trout were found to swim in the wake of cylinder. We show how forcing triggers the first few deformation modes of the swimmer similar to how the appropriate forcing triggers the fundamental deformation modes on a guitar string. We show how the lower deformation modes produce the best forward propulsion of the body. This insight reveals that swimming is viable for small enough frequencies of neuromuscular activation relative to the natural frequencies of the body and for sufficiently stiff elastic properties. Thus, these results identify the key mechanistic parameters that would have been crucial to the evolutionary emergence of swimming animals. The proposed framework can help understand neural control of movement in swimming as well as control of underwater vehicles.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The movement of animals like undulatory swimmers is an emergent behavior that starts from muscle activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Tytell1">[1]</xref>. There are two primary issues in undulatory swimming. The first issue is to understand how muscle activation leads to the observed deformation kinematics. The second issue is to understand how deformation kinematics produce movement of the body as a whole, e.g., forward translational motion.</p>
<p>Muscle activation, body mass, elastic properties, and interactions with the environment cause the observed deformation of undulatory swimmers. The deformation kinematics of undulatory swimmers can be complex in general. The question of whether precise and complicated activation of muscles is essential to generate specific deformation kinematics is important to understand how these swimmers control their movement. The deformation of the body has been regarded to have two components. The part that is caused by active muscle forcing is the “active” component, whereas the part that results due to fluid forcing is the “passive” component <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Fish1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Lauder1">[3]</xref>. The active and passive components are strongly coupled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Fish1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Lauder1">[3]</xref>. For example, Liao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Liao1">[4]</xref> carried out experiments on a dead trout in the wake of a cylinder and observed its swimming motion. Such swimming caused solely by surrounding fluid forces is referred to as “passive swimming”. They found that the “passive swimming” gait was similar to the “active swimming” gait of the trout. Here, swimming caused by muscle activation is referred to as “active swimming.” It is challenging, in general, to separate the similar looking active and passive components of the deformation. According to the active-passive decomposition framework, passive swimming has only passive component of deformation. However, active swimming has both active and passive deformation components because muscle activation as well as external fluid forces are present. A detailed mathematical description of passive motion induced by external vorticies can be found in Alben <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Alben1">[5]</xref>. Work by Tanabe and Kaneko <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Tanabe1">[6]</xref> on a falling paper shows that fluttering and rotation of the falling paper can be periodic or chaotic depending upon the external forcing from the fluid. Active swimming can be due to muscle forcing in a swimming animal or due to active motor torques in a robotic swimmer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Ding1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Li2">[12]</xref>. The observed body deformations are a response to the combined internal (muscle/motor) and external (fluid) forcing which dictates the swimming behavior of a system.</p>
<p>The question of how deformation kinematics lead to forward translational motion is crucial to understand optimal conditions for movement. Some swimming gaits are optimal for fast swimming (during prey capture or predator escape), some are optimal for conserving energy (keeping a fixed station), whereas some optimal gaits combine both these objectives (traveling long distances). Several studies on optimal swimming motion in the noninertial regime have been done in the past <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Eloy1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Raz1">[17]</xref>. For example, Spagnollie and Lauga <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Spagnolie2">[18]</xref> showed that the helical shape for an infinitely long flagellum leads to the fastest swimming motion. Pironneau and Katz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Pironneau1">[19]</xref> studied the optimal flagellar undulations that lead to minimal energy expenditure. Avron et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Avron1">[20]</xref> used conformal mapping techniques to find optimal two-dimensional microswimmers. Optimized artifical microswimmers have been studied by Dreyfus et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Dreyfus1">[21]</xref>. Wilkening and Hosoi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Wilkening1">[22]</xref> analyzed optimal shapes of a swimming sheet at low Reynolds number using analytical and numerical techniques. A comprehensive review of swimming at low Reynolds number and optimal conditions in the noninertial regime can be found in Lauga and Powers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Lauga2">[23]</xref>. In comparison, an understanding of optimal conditions for swimming in the inertial regime is much less developed.</p>
<p>There are some key differences in swimming in the noninertial and inertial regimes. For example, in the noninertial regime, the power required to generate body deformations at each instant is fully dissipated into the surrounding fluid. However, in the inertial regime some part of the power is required to accelerate the body. Analysis of optimal swimming motion in the inertial regime is further complicated by nonlinear effects. Kern and Koumoutsakos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Kern1">[24]</xref> used fully resolved CFD techniques based upon unstructured grids to obtain the optimized kinematics of a two- and three-dimensional eel for fast and efficient swimming. Tytell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Tytell1">[1]</xref> used an immersed body technique to understand the effect of body stiffness and inertia on the motion of an undulatory swimmer. McMillen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-McMillen1">[25]</xref> used a calcium dynamics model for muscle contractions to understand the swimming motion of an anguilliform swimmer in the inertial regime. In spite of this progress, complicated interactions between muscle forcing, hydrodynamic forces, inertia, and elastic properties of a swimmer make it difficult to identify the key control parameters that lead to optimal swimming.</p>
<p>In this work a chain-link model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-McMillen1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-McMillen2">[28]</xref> of undulatory swimming is used as a model system to interrogate the emergence of deformation and movement in response to forcing. We consider swimming to be a forced damped oscillation problem. Deformations due to muscles and due to interaction with the environment (fluid) are not differentiated. The system is forced by muscles (active swimming), the surrounding fluid (passive swimming), or both, among various possibilities. It is shown that a body has fundamental modes of deformation with corresponding natural frequencies. Forcing triggers the first few deformation modes of the body. An understanding emerges of how the deformation in turn generates forward translational motion of the body. Relatively simple forcing patterns can trigger complex deformation kinematics that lead to movement. For a given muscle activation, the forcing frequency relative to the natural frequency of the damped oscillator is important for the emergent deformation characteristics of the body. We quantitatively show how the power generated from muscle work is used in creating body deformations and then it is dissipated into the surrounding fluid. A closed form expression for swimming velocity is derived by a leading-order analysis of the equations of motion. Optimal kinematics for fast swimming motion are obtained from the closed form expression. This helps identify the key parameters controlling the optimal conditions for fast swimming. The kinematics obtained for fast swimming, even faster than those identified in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Kern1">[24]</xref>, are verified by performing fully resolved CFD simulations in the nonlinear regime. This approach also leads to an understanding of optimal body stiffness and forcing frequencies of muscle activation.</p>
<p>In the following sections, the forced damped oscillation formulation is presented first. It is then used to elucidate how swimming motion is generated. Examples of active and passive swimming that arise because of different types of forcing of the system are presented including a discussion on why typical swimming motions involves lower deformation modes. The pathway of power transfer during the swimming cycle is discussed thereafter. Optimal deformation kinematics for fast swimming are discussed next, followed by optimal parameters for fast swimming.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>We present the nonlinear equations of motion, based on drag models, for a generic undulatory swimmer based upon chain-link configuration. We refer to this as a reduced-order model. Leading-order equations of motion are derived thereafter, which unifies the dynamics of an undulatory swimmer in various scenarios (internal muscle activation or external force). A comparison between the leading-order and nonlinear equations of motion is presented for completeness.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>2.1 A reduced-order model for undulatory swimming</title>
<p>We model the body of an undulatory swimmer as a planar chain of interconnected rigid links (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003097-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) and use a resistive drag model to account for the hydrodynamic forces acting on the body. The rigid links forming the body follow constraint dynamics, i.e., the endpoints of the two adjacent links are forced to lie on top of each other at the common joint. To solve the equations of motion, the forces at the link joints, needed to maintain this constraint, can be eliminated from the equations, and the remaining equations can be solved for the independent variables (velocities of each link). This approach is followed by McMillen et al. in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-McMillen1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-McMillen2">[28]</xref>. In our present analysis, we implement this constraint by connecting the links by stiff springs at the joints. We will refer to this approach as the <italic>penalty method</italic> (PM). The stiff springs penalize the system if two links at a common joint try to separate from each other. This approach has been used in the fully resolved immersed body (IB) method of simulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Tytell1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Peskin1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Griffith2">[32]</xref>. Implementing the constraint via stiff springs will help us obtain the leading-order equations of motion (section 2.4). When we are using the resistive drag model (section 2.2) with nonlinear equations of motion, we refer to the model as the nonlinear resistive chain-link PM model. When we are using the resistive drag model with leading-order equations of motion, we will refer to it as the leading-order resistive chain-link PM model.</p>

<p>To derive the nonlinear equations of motion, we isolate a single link which is assumed to be cylindrical in shape of length <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and radius <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

For the purposes of this work, we use the resistive drag model. This is because while the resistive lateral forces might lag behind the actual lateral forces as shown by Tytell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Tytell1">[1]</xref>, it is the force balance in the axial direction that determines the axial swimming velocity. Even if the reactive force model is used for the thrust component of the axial motion, it should be equated to the resistive drag force in the axial direction according to the theory by Lighthill <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Lighthill2">[35]</xref>. In addition, in the average sense, both the reactive and the resistive force models have similar nonlinear characteristics. Finally, as will be shown in this paper, the results obtained from the resistive model are qualitatively consistent with our fully resolved CFD calculations.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003097.e120">Eq. (24)</xref> indicates that there must be anistropy in drag for the body to swim. This is in agreement with the previous studies on swimming at low Reynolds number <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Cohen1">[36]</xref>. It also shows that the swimming velocity depends upon the time-average of the product of the lateral velocity and the angular position of the body. This term primarily depends on the deformation kinematics. If a nonzero time-averaged lateral velocity and angular position can be provided to the body, then it is able to propel itself forward. The body can swim even if there is no active muscle forcing. For example, if the surrounding fluid can provide the body with appropriate lateral and angular velocities, then it can lead to swimming. This has been observed in the case of a “dead” trout swimming in the wake of a cylinder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Liao1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Beal1">[37]</xref>. Thus, the leading-order equations indicate that the dynamics of swimming are a response to the forcing that goes into the system irrespective of whether the forcing is internal (muscle) or external (surrounding fluid). As will be shown later, the swimming system has fundamental modes of deformation, just like a forced damped oscillator. This is referred to as a unified forced damped oscillation framework for undulatory swimming in this work.</p>

<title>3.1 Passive swimming</title>
<p>The term passive swimming is used here to imply swimming generated by some external forcing, but with no active muscle forcing. The forced damped oscillation formulation, discussed above, shows that as long as there is forcing of the system that leads to appropriate lateral and angular movement (i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e131" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is nonzero), there is swimming. Any type of swimming would fall within this unified framework. To ensure that this is the case we show, in this section, that passive swimming is indeed resolved in this unified framework. Some fundamental scenarios are discussed below.</p>

<p>We take a uniform cross sectional body of length 20 cm and radius 1 cm. The body is discretized into 40 links of equal length.

<title>3.2 Active swimming</title>
<p>The term active swimming is used here to imply swimming generated by internal forcing such as muscle activation. The goal in this section is to show that active swimming is resolved within the unified framework of a forced damped oscillation formulation. To that end, we consider various aspects of muscle activated swimming. We first discuss how momentum and power is transferred during undulatory swimming. The response of the body to muscle activation in terms of its fundamental deformation modes is discussed thereafter.</p>
<sec id="s3b1">
<title>3.2.1 Momentum and power transfer during undulatory swimming</title>
<p>It can be seen from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003097.e106">equations (18)</xref>–<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003097.e108">(20)</xref> that the lateral and rotational momentum equations provide a source term to the translational momentum. The rotational and transverse momentum equations, which can be viewed as equations that define the deformations of the body (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e184" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e185" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), are coupled to each other, and are driven by the muscle forcing term <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e186" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Thus, the muscle forcing creates the body deformations, which then leads to forward translation motion. This explains the momentum transfer into the translational mode.</p>
<p>To analyze the power transfer during steady swimming, time-averaged kinetic energy equations are derived from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003097.e010">Eqs. (1)</xref>–<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003097.e012">(3)</xref>. The time-averaged rotational kinetic energy equation is derived by multiplying <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003097.e010">Eq. (1)</xref> by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e187" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, summing it over all links (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e188" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in total), and taking a time-average of the resulting equation. This is written as<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003097.e189"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e189" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(46)</label></disp-formula>Over a steady swimming cycle, the left-hand side of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003097.e189">Eq.

This implies that muscle power <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e190" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is converted to elastic power <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e191" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the springs. Time-averaged transverse and axial kinetic energy equations are similarly derived:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003097.e192"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e192" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(47)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula id="pcbi.1003097.e193"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e193" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(48)</label></disp-formula>The left-hand sides of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003097.e192">Eqs. (47)</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003097.e193">(48)</xref> vanish over a steady swimming cycle. Therefore, the elastic power in the springs in the transverse and the axial directions, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e194" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e195" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, respectively (which comes from rotational kinetic energy equation through <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e196" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> term) is dissipated by the viscous drag acting over the body in the transverse and the axial directions, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e197" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e198" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, respectively. To provide a quantitative verification of the analytic expression for power transfer during free swimming, simulations were done using the nonlinear resistive chain-link PM model as described in section 2.3 (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e199" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> cm) for various values of the Young's modulus (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e200" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). The time-averaged rotational, transverse, and axial kinetic energy equations show that the power generated by the muscles is transferred into the elastic power of the body, which is then dissipated into the fluid through the viscous drag acting on the body over a swimming cycle. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003097-t003">Table 3</xref> shows the mean power carried by various terms during a steady swimming cycle. Note that most of the power is input into the transverse mode. Eventually, this power is dissipated by the drag forces <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e201" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. A key conclusion from this result is that, most of the power dissipation happens due to the movement in the transverse direction <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e202" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and not due to the movement in the axial direction, as is generally assumed in the efficiency measures for swimming. Thus, new efficiency metrics must take this into account while estimating the power dissipated during a swimming cycle.</p>

For the parameters considered here (section 2.5), the first 47 modes are underdamped and have a natural frequency of oscillation, i.e., the corresponding eigenvalues are complex (there are 47 complex conjugate pairs). Lower deformation modes have lower natural frequencies. Mode numbers 48 to 103 are the overdamped deformation modes, i.e., there is no natural frequency of oscillation. The elastic parameters and the stiffness coefficients are taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-McMillen2">[28]</xref>, which were obtained based on real fish material properties. Thus, it is expected that the chosen material properties will yield realistic eigenvalues for the system.

Each of the fundamental deformation modes is driven by a component of the oscillatory muscle forcing term. This is the forced damped oscillation formulation of muscle activated swimming.</p>
<p>The amplitude or “weight” of the emergent deformation is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003097-g007">Fig. 7(b)</xref> for each of the fundamental deformation modes. It is seen that the emergent deformation is dominantly composed of only the lower fundamental deformation modes. This is because the natural frequencies of the body corresponding to the fundamental deformation modes are higher than the muscle moment forcing frequencies. The first few deformation modes have the lowest natural frequencies (e.g. 1435.01 Hz for the first and 3889.01 Hz for the second deformation mode), whereas the physiologically relevant traveling wave frequency of muscle forcing is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e245" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> Hz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Mller1">[38]</xref>. This is similar to a spring-mass-damper system where the modes with natural frequencies closest to the forcing frequencies are dominantly observed.</p>
<p>The conclusion above, that lower deformation modes will be typically observed, is based on a lower-order model for swimming. It helps to explain why the lower deformation modes are observed. The applicability of this conclusion is not limited to a lower-order model. In a general nonlinear problem of swimming at high Reynolds number, the eigenvalues of the system are dynamic and they change with time. This is because the coefficients of the damping matrix of the system change with time. Despite this difficulty, the conclusion above can be conceptually verified. A practically useful way to analyze such a system is to decompose the deformation of the body into the fundamental deformation modes of the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation. By superposing these modes, one can construct the shape of an undulatory swimmer at any instant as a post-processing step. To demonstrate that the conclusion above is valid even in nonlinear swimming, a case with Reynolds number of about 8000 (based on the traveling wave velocity) is simulated by using a nonlinear resistive chain-link model (same parameters of section 2.3). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003097-g008">Fig. 8</xref> shows the amplitude of the first few deformation modes for the undulatory swimmer at high <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e246" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. It is confirmed that only the first few deformation modes contribute most to the emergent deformation kinematics.</p>

<title>3.3 Optimal parameters for fast swimming</title>
<p>Parameters like muscle frequency, reference curvature, and muscle stiffness affect swimming motion. In this section we use results from the previous sections to interrogate questions related to optimal conditions that lead to fast swimming.</p>
<sec id="s3c1">
<title>3.3.1 What should be the frequency of the muscle activation wave?</title>
<p>In the above discussion it was argued that the value of the forcing or the traveling wave frequency <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e247" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> relative to the natural frequency of the damped oscillator is important for the emergent deformation characteristics of the body. Thus, it implies that as the forcing frequency is increased higher deformation modes should also be observed. To verify this, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003097-g009">Fig. 9</xref> shows a plot of wave efficiency (swimming velocity normalized by the wave velocity <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e248" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; in which <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e249" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the body length) as a function of the forcing frequency. All cases were solved by using the nonlinear resistive chain-link PM model. All physical parameters were taken from section 2.3 except for the forcing frequency which was varied. It is seen that at higher frequencies, higher deformation modes are triggered which is consistent with the discussion above (see insets of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003097-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). Higher deformation modes do not represent the best kinematics to push the fluid back and thus propel the body forward. Hence, the normalized swimming velocities are increasingly lower as the forcing frequency is increased.</p>

A stiffer body has a higher value of the Young's modulus, which helps the body to match its preferred curvature <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e335" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Thus, the swimming speed depends on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e336" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the bending stiffness of the body represented by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e337" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003097.e034">Eq. (6)</xref>).</p>
<p>If the body is very stiff then the observed kinematics closely follow <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e338" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This will be shown below. In this case, optimality for fast swimming is achieved if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e339" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> corresponds to the optimal kinematics found, for example, in the previous section for fast swimming.</p>
<p>Tytell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Tytell1">[1]</xref> reported optimal body stiffness that led to maximum swimming velocity. Their results were based on simulations that used fully resolved fluid-elastic body interactions. Here, those results are qualitatively reproduced and explained using the reduced-order model. All cases were solved using the nonlinear resistive chain-link model. All physical parameters were the same as those in section 2.3 except for the Young's modulus <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e340" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which was varied. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003097-g011">Fig. 11</xref> shows a plot of the swimming velocity as a function of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e341" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (or body stiffness <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e342" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). As reported by Tytell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Tytell1">[1]</xref>, there is an optimal stiffness at which the swimming velocity is maximized. It is shown below that the preferred curvature of the body <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e343" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that results from muscle activation is important to explain this trend.</p>
<p>At low stiffness, the natural frequencies of the body are lower. Hence, a given forcing frequency triggers higher deformation modes of a less stiff body (see insets <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003097-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). In other words, the body appears floppy and is not able to efficiently propel itself forward due to the presence of higher deformation modes. At high stiffness, the observed deformation kinematics are nearly the same of those due to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e344" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. If the imposed <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e345" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> does not represent the best deformation kinematics for fast swimming, then at high stiffness the swimming velocity is lower than optimal. At intermediate stiffness the body kinematics are optimal for fast swimming, leading to the trend shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003097-g012">Fig. 12(a)</xref>. It is also noted that the swimming velocity is practically unchanged with any further increase in body stiffness beyond a certain value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003097-g012">Fig. 12(a)</xref>). This can be explained by noting that the body kinematics remain the same as those imposed by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e346" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> beyond a certain body stiffness. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003097-g012">Fig. 12(a)</xref> also shows a plot of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e347" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as function of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e348" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. It is seen that the trend in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e349" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is consistent with the trend of the swimming velocity. As seen earlier <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e350" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> directly correlates with the deformation kinematics. Thus, the observed trend in swimming velocity in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003097-g012">Fig. 12(a)</xref> is a consequence of the deformation kinematics that the body acquires as a function of its stiffness.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work our primary thesis is that the deformation is a result of some forcing which can be caused by muscles or the surrounding fluid or both. We have used a forced damped oscillation framework to formulate the problem of swimming. This is in the same spirit as the damped harmonic oscillator framework that has been applied in the past to analyze numerous engineering systems such as the tuned mass damper used in power transmission, automobiles, and buildings to reduce vibrations.</p>
<p>The results presented above validate several hypotheses that show the utility of the forced damped oscillation framework. These examples (points 1–4, below), which provide new insights, are discussed below.</p>
<p>1. Our hypothesis was that the forced damped oscillation framework would provide unified insights into how the body deformation emerges and subsequently how the body deformation leads to swimming movement. First, the problem formulation and the results discussed earlier validate this hypothesis where it is seen that body deformations emerge as a superposition of various deformation modes in response to some forcing. This is similar in principle to how various deformation modes emerge on a guitar string or a fluttering flag. Second, insights into how body deformations lead to forward swimming movement is represented by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003097.e120">Eq. (24)</xref>. As hypothesized, this equation provides a unified insight into how forward swimming momentum is obtained, no matter how the system is forced. Thus, active and passive swimming scenarios are understood in a unified way. It is to be noted that although <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003097.e120">Eq. (24)</xref> was based on a simplified model, the results were verified from fully resolved computational fluid dynamic simulations of optimal gaits for fast swimming.</p>
<p>2. Our hypothesis was that the forced damped oscillation framework will provide insights into why relatively simple forcing patterns can trigger seemingly complex deformation kinematics that lead to movement. This was validated from our results where we show how forcing triggers different deformation modes of the body. The presence of multiple deformation modes makes the body deformation appear complex.</p>
<p>3. We hypothesized that the proposed framework will explain why lower deformation modes (i.e., fewer number of waves on the body) are typically observed in undulatory swimming in nature. This was resolved by our results where we show how the value of the forcing frequency relative to the natural frequencies of the body is important to trigger the various deformation modes of the body (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003097-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). Typical forcing frequencies in nature are lower than the typical resonance frequencies of the damped oscillator (i.e., the fish body). Hence, it is not surprising that lower deformation modes are observed in nature. In anguilliform swimmers, the body is long and slender. As a result the first few deformation modes would be triggered in these swimmers. However, carangiform, sub-carangifrom, and thunniform swimmers have relatively short and stiff bodies. In such swimmers, the body deformations are predominant in the caudal fin region indicating lower deformation modes compared to anguilliform swimmers, as expected from our results.</p>
<p>4. The proposed framework helped identify parameters for which swimming is viable. The specific parameters that were identified include appropriate frequencies for swimming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003097-g009">Fig. 9</xref>), appropriate body stiffness for swimming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003097-g012">Figs. 12(a) and 12(b)</xref>), and appropriate gaits for fast swimming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003097-g010">Figs. 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003097-g011">11</xref>). The forced damped oscillation framework was crucial to obtain key insights into each of these parameters. For example, the forcing frequencies at which swimming would be viable are those that do not trigger the higher deformation modes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003097-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). Thus, high frequencies relative to the natural frequencies are not appropriate for swimming. Similarly, for a given forcing frequency the body should be stiff enough for swimming to be possible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003097-g012">Figs. 12(a) and 12(b)</xref>). This is because higher stiffness leads to higher natural frequencies compared to the forcing frequency which in turn would not trigger the higher deformation modes that are not desirable for swimming. Finally, the gaits that maximize the forward momentum transfer according to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003097.e120">Eq. (24)</xref> are most appropriate for fast swimming. It was found that higher deformation modes do not work well according to this metric. These results were confirmed from fully resolved simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003097-g010">Fig. 10</xref>).</p>
<p>The results in point 4, above, are practically the most important since they have biological as well as engineering relevance. The practical utility of the above results in engineering is apparent if one considers the design of a biomimetic underwater robotic vehicle. The above analysis helps identify material properties as well as viable frequencies of an undulator that would drive the vehicle.</p>
<p>The above results may also provide useful insights in evolutionary biology. In particular consider the issues pertaining to the evolutionary emergence of certain species. To that end consider the evolution of aquatic animals that use the undulatory mode for propulsion. Assume that only those undulatory animals that can swim effectively would have survived. If so, then it is of interest to know if specific parameters such as body stiffness and activation frequency of the muscles are crucial for survival. Based on the results above, one could hypothesize that only those species with appropriate muscle activation frequency (low; e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003097-g009">Fig. 9</xref>) and body stiffness (high; e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003097-g012">Fig. 12(b)</xref>) would survive and evolve. Thus, this analysis helps identify the key mechanistic parameters that would have been crucial to the evolutionary emergence of undulatory swimmers. While our study certainly does not directly consider evolution, it points to the ways to combine analyses such as ours with evolutionary biology to explore what impact the mechanics of movement may have played on the emergence of certain animals.</p>
<p>Similarly, these results could be potentially used to gain insights into the ability to adapt through evolution. As an example, consider a hypothetical scenario where the ability to move is dependent on having a very specific deformation of the body which in turn is very sensitive to the muscle activation pattern. In such a scenario, any change in the parameters would seriously hamper the ability of that animal to move. Such an animal would not be very robust in its ability to move in a changing environment. In addition, it is very likely that any small changes to physical characteristics from one generation to next (and through evolution) would have a detrimental effect on the survival of that species. Our results suggest that in reality the above scenario may not occur. We find that the ability to swim, while dependent on the mechanistic parameters, may not be very sensitive to it. For example, results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003097-g012">Fig. 12(b)</xref> indicate that as long as the body stiffness is above a certain value, the ability to swim fast is insensitive to the value of stiffness. Similarly, as long as the frequency is below certain value (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003097.e373" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>30 Hz for the parameters used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003097-g009">Fig. 9</xref>), the wave efficiency is not significantly affected, once again suggesting some degree of robustness to changes in the parameters. Finally, the result that simple forcing patterns can lead to swimming movement is also suggestive of robustness in the sense that it is not essential to have a very specific and complex forcing pattern to make swimming viable. One may therefore hypothesize that the relative insensitivity to parameters, and the noncomplexity of the feasible forcing patterns would be beneficial for adaptation through evolution. Although we do not directly interrogate this issue of adaptation, such hypotheses motivated by the mechanics of movement warrant further investigation.</p>
<p>The proposed framework leads to an understanding of many key parameters that are critical to movement. In turn, it has the potential to provide further insights into how movement can be controlled in biomimetic underwater vehicles and analogously to decipher how neuronal control of movement might function in animals.</p>
<p>In this work we also quantified the pathway of power transfer from muscles to forward swimming. It is shown that over a steady swimming cycle, the net power generated by the muscles is transferred into the elastic power of the body which is then dissipated into the fluid while undulating the body (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003097-t003">Table 3</xref>). Identifying this pathway is crucial to obtain a measure for useful work during swimming. This in turn can be used to estimate useful measures for swimming efficiency. This result is important because the efficiency of undulatory swimmers is conventionally defined as the ratio of power spent in overcoming hydrodynamic drag in the direction of swimming to the total muscle power produced. “Gray's paradox” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Gray1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003097-Webb1">[46]</xref> was based on this definition of efficiency where it was paradoxically found that the drag power was greater than the muscle power. Although the paradox is now considered resolved, our results suggest that the assumption, underlying Gray's result, that the useful power is the one spent to overcome drag in the swimming direction may not be appropriate. The useful power is in fact the one spent to undulate the body. Thus, “Gray's paradox” should be revisited in the context of our results on the pathway of power transfer.</p>
<p>In summary, we applied the forced damped oscillation framework to undulatory swimming to understand the emergence of movement due to muscular and/or environmental forcing.</p>
