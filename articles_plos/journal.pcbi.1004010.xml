<abstract>
<p>Cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidases (C<italic>c</italic>oxs) are the terminal enzymes of the respiratory chain in mitochondria and most bacteria. These enzymes couple dioxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) reduction to the generation of a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient. Despite decades of research and the availability of a large amount of structural and biochemical data available for the A-type C<italic>c</italic>ox family, little is known about the channel(s) used by O<sub>2</sub> to travel from the solvent/membrane to the heme <italic>a<sub>3</sub></italic>-Cu<sub>B</sub> binuclear center (BNC). Moreover, the identification of all possible O<sub>2</sub> channels as well as the atomic details of O<sub>2</sub> diffusion is essential for the understanding of the working mechanisms of the A-type C<italic>c</italic>ox. In this work, we determined the O<sub>2</sub> distribution within C<italic>c</italic>ox from <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic>, in the fully reduced state, in order to identify and characterize all the putative O<sub>2</sub> channels leading towards the BNC. For that, we use an integrated strategy combining atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (with and without explicit O<sub>2</sub> molecules) and implicit ligand sampling (ILS) calculations. Based on the 3D free energy map for O<sub>2</sub> inside C<italic>c</italic>ox, three channels were identified, all starting in the membrane hydrophobic region and connecting the surface of the protein to the BNC. One of these channels corresponds to the pathway inferred from the X-ray data available, whereas the other two are alternative routes for O<sub>2</sub> to reach the BNC. Both alternative O<sub>2</sub> channels start in the membrane spanning region and terminate close to Y288<sub>I</sub>. These channels are a combination of multiple transiently interconnected hydrophobic cavities, whose opening and closure is regulated by the thermal fluctuations of the lining residues. Furthermore, our results show that, in this C<italic>c</italic>ox, the most likely (energetically preferred) routes for O<sub>2</sub> to reach the BNC are the alternative channels, rather than the X-ray inferred pathway.</p>

<p>Cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidases (C<italic>c</italic>oxs), the terminal enzymes of the respiratory electron transport chain in eukaryotes and many prokaryotes, are key enzymes in aerobic respiration. These proteins couple the reduction of molecular dioxygen to water with the creation of a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient. Over the last decades, most of the C<italic>c</italic>oxs research focused on the mechanisms and energetics of reduction and/or proton pumping, and little emphasis has been given to the pathways used by dioxygen to reach the binuclear center, where dioxygen reduction takes place. In particular, the existence and the characteristics of the channel(s) used by O<sub>2</sub> to travel from the solvent/membrane to the binuclear site are still unclear. In this work, we combine all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and implicit ligand sampling calculations in order to identify and characterize the O<sub>2</sub> delivery channels in the C<italic>c</italic>ox from <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic>. Altogether, our results suggest that, in this C<italic>c</italic>ox, O<sub>2</sub> can diffuse via three well-defined channels that start in membrane region (where O<sub>2</sub> solubility is higher than in the water). One of these channels corresponds to the pathway inferred from the X-ray data available, whereas the other two are alternative routes for O<sub>2</sub> to reach the binuclear center.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidases (C<italic>c</italic>oxs) are the terminal enzymes of the respiratory chain in eukaryotes and in aerobic prokaryotes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Siletsky1">[1]</xref>). These integral membrane proteins belong to the heme-copper oxidases superfamily and couple dioxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) reduction to the translocation of protons across the membrane. C<italic>c</italic>ox takes up four electrons from cytochrome <italic>c</italic> (<italic>cyt c</italic>) in the positively charged side of the membrane (the inter-membrane space in mitochondria or the periplasm in bacteria) and eight protons from the negatively charged side (eq. 1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Wikstrom1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Brzezinski1">[3]</xref>:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1004010.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004010.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where the subscripts P and N refer to the positive and negative sides of the membrane, respectively.</p>
<p>Four of the eight protons reported in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004010.e001">equation 1</xref> are used to reduce one O<sub>2</sub> molecule and form two water molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Wikstrom1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Brzezinski1">[3]</xref>, whereas the remaining protons are pumped from the negative to the positive side of the membrane. This overall process contributes to the generation and maintenance of a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient, which can be further utilized for several energy-requiring processes, such as ATP synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-FergusonMiller1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>Based on structural and phylogenetic analysis, the heme-copper oxidases superfamily is currently divided into three major subfamilies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Sousa1">[5]</xref>: A, B and C. The main differences between the three families are the pathways and mechanisms of proton transfer/pumping. The A-type C<italic>c</italic>oxs, which are the subject of this work, are widespread through all kingdoms of life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Sousa1">[5]</xref> and among them are the most thoroughly explored C<italic>c</italic>oxs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Brzezinski1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Yoshikawa1">[6]</xref>, such as the bovine heart mitochondria, the <italic>Paracoccus</italic> (<italic>P.</italic>) <italic>denitrificans</italic> and the <italic>Rhodobacter (R.) sphaeroides</italic> enzymes. These C<italic>c</italic>oxs contain, in the catalytic subunit (subunit I), a low spin heme <italic>a</italic> and a heterodinuclear center named binuclear center, BNC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004010-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). The BNC is deeply buried in the core of the protein and it is formed by a high-spin heme <italic>a<sub>3</sub></italic> and a copper ion (Cu<sub>B</sub>). In subunit II, these C<italic>c</italic>oxs contain only one redox center, a binuclear copper center named Cu<sub>A</sub>, which accepts electrons from the soluble cyt <italic>c</italic> and then transfers them to the BNC via heme <italic>a</italic>.</p>

<p>It is believed that protons (both chemical and pumped) are transported from the N-side of the membrane to the BNC via two special proton conducting pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Brzezinski1">[3]</xref>: the D- and K-pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004010-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). A third putative proton-conducting pathway, the H-pathway, was proposed for the mammalian C<italic>c</italic>ox only <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Yoshikawa1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Tsukihara1">[7]</xref>, and it was suggested to be exclusively used for the transfer of the pumped protons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Shimokata1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>Several high-resolution crystallographic structures of the A-type family are nowadays available in the literature (e.g. mammalian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Tsukihara1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Yoshikawa2">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Muramoto1">[11]</xref> and bacterial C<italic>c</italic>oxs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Iwata1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Qin1">[15]</xref>) and, based on these structures, it is known that all A-type members share a remarkable structural similarity of the core functional unit formed by subunits I and II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004010-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Subunit I consists of twelve transmembrane α-helices and contains the BNC and the heme <italic>a</italic> center. Subunit II is formed by a solvent exposed globular β-sheet domain (which functions as a docking surface for cyt <italic>c</italic>) and two transmembrane α-helices. It contains only one redox center, the binuclear copper center (Cu<sub>A</sub>). Moreover, at the interface between subunits I and II, C<italic>c</italic>ox has one Mg<sup>+2</sup> ion whose function is still not well understood, but it was suggested to be part of the exit pathway for the pumped protons and for water formed in the BNC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Sharpe1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Sugitani1">[17]</xref>. Subunit III, although not considered to be part of the core functional unit, is also highly conserved among the A-type subfamily. Nevertheless, its absence significantly increases the probability of suicide inactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Bratton1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Mills1">[19]</xref> and thereby reduces the catalytic lifespan of C<italic>c</italic>ox (in 600-fold or more) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Mills1">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>Based in the X-ray data available (eg. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Tsukihara1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Iwata1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-SvenssonEk1">[13]</xref>), a putative O<sub>2</sub> channel for the A-type family was proposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004010-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Iwata and co-workers, after pressurizing <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> C<italic>c</italic>ox crystals with xenon, were able to identify a continuous hydrophobic channel that starts in the membrane region of subunit I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-SvenssonEk1">[13]</xref>. This putative O<sub>2</sub> channel has two possible entrances that merge together in a region close to the proton-gating residue, E286<sub>I</sub> (the residues are numbered according to the <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> C<italic>c</italic>ox sequence and the subscript indicates the subunit number). This pathway presents a constriction point which does not allow the access of O<sub>2</sub> to the BNC, at least without the occurrence of some conformational change in the protein. Unfortunately, until now, none of the mutagenesis and biochemical studies performed in this channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Riistama1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Salomonsson1">[22]</xref> was able to clearly demonstrate that it serves as an O<sub>2</sub> route into the BNC. All the tested mutations were located too close to the BNC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Riistama1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Riistama2">[21]</xref>, which made the interpretation of the results difficult and did not allow to unambiguously distinguish between the structural obstruction of the O<sub>2</sub> channel and the perturbation of the BNC binding kinetics. However, and contrary to the A-type family, in the B-type family the channel used by O<sub>2</sub> to reach the BNC is nowadays considered to be well established. The crystallographic studies (with xenon pressurization) performed in the <italic>Thermus</italic> (<italic>T.</italic>) <italic>thermophilus ba<sub>3</sub></italic> enzyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Luna1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-McDonald1">[25]</xref>, lead to the identification of a “Y-shaped” hydrophobic channel that runs from the membrane region towards the BNC. This channel, although located roughly at the same position of the putative O<sub>2</sub> channel in the A-type C<italic>c</italic>ox, does not possess a constriction point close to the BNC. In the A-type C<italic>c</italic>oxs, the narrowing of the O<sub>2</sub> channel is mainly caused by two conserved bulky residues (W172<sub>I</sub> and F282<sub>I</sub> in <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-SvenssonEk1">[13]</xref>), whereas in the B-type C<italic>c</italic>ox, smaller residues occupy these positions (Y133<sub>I</sub> and T231<sub>I</sub> in <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Luna1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Luna2">[24]</xref>). The differences between the A- and B-type regarding the O<sub>2</sub> channel are thought to reflect the different functional environments of each type of C<italic>c</italic>ox.</p>
<p>Although the static crystal structures have been a valuable tool for providing insights into the O<sub>2</sub> diffusion and for identifying potential O<sub>2</sub> channels in C<italic>c</italic>ox, the elucidation of the molecular basis of O<sub>2</sub> diffusion requires the knowledge of the C<italic>c</italic>ox conformational dynamics. Transiently formed cavities and openings inside the protein (frequently regulated by side chain rotation or by water movements) are not visible in the static X-ray structures, but have already been shown to be very relevant for ligand diffusion (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Cohen1">[26]</xref>). In this context, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation techniques (with sufficient simulation time and conformational sampling) appear as an alternative for studying the dynamic behavior of proteins and to determine their ligand occupation probabilities inside the protein. In the last decade, computational methods have been widely used to study gas migration in a number of proteins and MD simulations have successfully allowed the identification of several alternative routes for ligand diffusion (e.g. hydrogenase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Cohen1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Baltazar1">[28]</xref>, myoglobins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Cohen2">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Cohen3">[30]</xref>, oxidases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Hofacker1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Porrini1">[32]</xref> and laccases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Damas1">[33]</xref>). Moreover, the combination of MD simulations with Implicit Ligand Sampling (ILS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Cohen2">[29]</xref> calculations allows the calculation of the energy cost of transferring any small, apolar molecule (like O<sub>2</sub> or H<sub>2</sub>) from the solvent to the protein and consequently to compute a 3D free-energy landscape for that specific ligand molecule (e.g <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Cohen2">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Damas1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Saam1">[34]</xref>).</p>
<p>Over the last decades, most of the C<italic>c</italic>ox research using computational methods focused on the mechanisms and energetics of reduction and/or proton pumping (e.g <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Sugitani1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Pomes1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Goyal1">[56]</xref>). In the A-type C<italic>c</italic>ox, little emphasis has been given to the identification of the routes used by O<sub>2</sub> to move from the solvent towards the BNC, a question only addressed, to our knowledge, by Hofacker and Schulten <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Hofacker1">[31]</xref> and by Farantos and co-workers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Hofacker1">[31]</xref>. In the first work, Hofacker and Schulten <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Hofacker1">[31]</xref> used MD simulations to study O<sub>2</sub> diffusion in the vicinity of the BNC in a bacterial C<italic>c</italic>ox from <italic>P. denitrificans</italic> and in the bovine CcOx enzyme. Their simulations revealed a unique, well-defined O<sub>2</sub> diffusion channel starting in the membrane-spanning surface of subunit I, close to the interface with subunit III. More recently, Farantos and co-workers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Porrini1">[32]</xref> have applied the ILS method in order to study the binding of several small gas molecules around the BNC region in the A-type C<italic>c</italic>ox from <italic>P. denitrificans</italic> and in the B-type C<italic>co</italic>x enzyme from <italic>T thermophilus</italic>. From these calculations, the authors were able to identify several cavities around the heme <italic>a<sub>3</sub></italic> region that are conserved in both the A-type and B-type enzymes. This study is however limited to the BNC region, not including other parts of the protein and, consequently, not allowing the analysis of the whole O<sub>2</sub> permeation process.</p>
<p>The main objective of this work is to identify the O<sub>2</sub> channels in the fully reduced C<italic>c</italic>ox from <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Qin1">[15]</xref> using a combination of MD simulations (with and without explicit O<sub>2</sub>) and ILS calculations. Our results revealed the existence of three putative O<sub>2</sub> diffusion channels. One of channels correlates very well with the channel inferred from the X-ray data available, whereas the other two are alternative routes for O<sub>2</sub> to reach the BNC, and were not observed in the X-ray structures pressurized with xenon. Both alternative channels start in the membrane phase and terminate close to Y288<sub>I</sub>.</p>

<title>Results/Discussion</title>
<p>In this work, we investigate the diffusion of O<sub>2</sub> molecules from the solvent to C<italic>c</italic>ox using MD simulations. We started our study by performing simulations with the enzyme (in the fully reduced state) with explicit O<sub>2</sub> molecules, as described in detail in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>. Although all O<sub>2</sub> molecules were initially placed randomly in the solvent, as time progresses, the gas enters the membrane and concentrates in the lipid tails region (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004010.s001">S8 Figure in Text S1</xref>), similarly to what has been described experimentally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Lissi1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Dzikovski1">[58]</xref>. After 100 ns of simulation, 46 O<sub>2</sub> molecules were internalized in the membrane, which corresponds to more than 50% of the O<sub>2</sub> placed originally inside the simulation box.</p>
<p>Furthermore, during the simulation time, some O<sub>2</sub> molecules move from the membrane into the protein. The number of O<sub>2</sub> inside C<italic>co</italic>x increased slowly during the first 30 ns of simulation until it stabilizes at ∼8 molecules on average (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004010.s001">S9 Figure in S1 Text</xref>). In general, before entering C<italic>c</italic>ox, the O<sub>2</sub> molecules explore the protein's surface and bind briefly to the cavities and niches formed mainly by hydrophobic residues. However, after 100 ns, none of the internalized O<sub>2</sub> molecules was able to reach the BNC in any replicate. Nonetheless, and in order to determine which regions of the protein are more populated by the O<sub>2</sub> molecules during our simulations, we calculated the O<sub>2</sub> probability density maps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Victor1">[59]</xref> over the 100 ns (for all five replicates) and the results are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004010-g002">Fig. 2</xref>.</p>

<p>As it can be seen, most of the high-affinity regions are located in the membrane phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004010-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) and some of them show a good correlation with the putative O<sub>2</sub> channel inferred from the X-ray data pressurized with xenon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-SvenssonEk1">[13]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004010-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). This channel starts at the membrane spanning region in direct contact with the hydrophobic tails of the lipids and it is formed predominately by uncharged and aromatic residues. It has a Y shape with the two entrances located between helices 5 and 8 and helices 11 and 13 in subunit I. The side chains of I104<sub>I</sub>, L105<sub>I</sub>, A153<sub>I</sub>, L157<sub>I</sub>, F108<sub>I</sub>, L174<sub>I</sub>, V194<sub>I</sub>, L246<sub>I</sub>, and I250<sub>I</sub> contribute to form this channel. The two possible entrances merge together into a constriction point located close to E286<sub>I</sub>. This reduction in the diameter of the channel is caused by the phenyl ring of F282<sub>I</sub> and the indole ring of W172<sub>I</sub> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004010-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). It has been suggested that during the O<sub>2</sub> reduction cycle, some protein rearrangement or side chain rotation (of F282<sub>I</sub> and/or W172<sub>I</sub>) is required in order to open the constriction point and allow O<sub>2</sub> access to the BNC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Tsukihara1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Luna1">[23]</xref>. In our O<sub>2</sub> simulations, the side chains of F282<sub>I</sub> and W172<sub>I</sub>, although showing some flexibility and being able to slightly change their conformation, did not open an entrance point large enough to allow the passage of O<sub>2</sub> into the BNC. For this reason, it was impossible to directly observe O<sub>2</sub> diffusion towards the catalytic site.</p>
<p>Recent computational studies have suggested that the hydration level of the internal hydrophobic cavity located after the constriction point (formed by F282<sub>I</sub>, W172<sub>I</sub> and E286<sub>I</sub>) could be important for the regulation of proton transfer in C<italic>c</italic>oxs (e.g <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Woelke1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Goyal1">[56]</xref>). It was also suggested that the water distribution inside this cavity is modulated by the protonation of the heme <italic>a<sub>3</sub></italic> D-propionate and that these hydration changes strongly affect the E286<sub>I</sub> proton affinity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Goyal1">[56]</xref>. This hydrophobic cavity bridges between the end of the D-pathway and the BNC region and it has been predicted to contain several water molecules, at least transiently (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Zheng1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Riistama3">[60]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Kaila2">[62]</xref>). However, in our simulations, no water molecules were observed in this region and no.direct and visible connection between E286<sub>I</sub> and the BNC was identified.</p>
<p>Since the simulations with explicit O<sub>2</sub> were not able to properly sample the diffusion events (probably due to the simulation timescales), and in order to identify possible alternative O<sub>2</sub> diffusion channels in fully reduced C<italic>c</italic>ox, the ILS method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Cohen2">[29]</xref> was used. This method uses the protein conformations obtained from a ligand-free MD trajectory and calculates, for all the positions inside the protein, the potential of mean force for placing a small, apolar, low-interacting molecule at that point. The 3D energy map generated in this case represents the Gibbs free energy of moving a O<sub>2</sub> molecule from water into any place inside the protein (Δ<italic>G</italic><sub>wat→prot</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)) and it can be used to infer about the energetically favourable diffusion paths inside a given protein. In these maps, the regions where Δ<italic>G</italic><sub>wat→prot</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>) is low represent the positions where O<sub>2</sub> has a high probability of residing, meaning that the O<sub>2</sub> affinity in that position is high. The ILS method reduces significantly the sampling problems and it takes into account the dynamic conformational changes of the protein and all the transiently formed cavities, which can be combined to form transitory diffusion pathways.</p>
<p>From the 3D affinity map for C<italic>c</italic>ox obtained from the ILS calculations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004010-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>), we can see that C<italic>c</italic>ox possesses a complex free energy landscape with several possible O<sub>2</sub> binding cavities, most of them located at the protein surface and that do not directly connect to the BNC. Moreover, the calculated affinity map from ILS not only correlates well with some of the high probability regions found in the explicit O<sub>2</sub> simulations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004010-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>) but also provides a more complete description of the free energy landscape for O<sub>2</sub> inside C<italic>c</italic>ox due to the sampling of lower affinity zones, not sufficiently sampled by the normal MD simulations. Indeed, the ILS approach allowed us to identified three major routes (named channel 1, channel 2 and channel 3) with high probability of O<sub>2</sub> occupancy, interconnecting the protein surface to the BNC. Two of the channels (channel 1 and channel 2) approach the BNC from the subunit I side whereas the third one (channel 3) approaches the BNC from the subunit II side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004010-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Interestingly all three channels start in the membrane spanning region where the O<sub>2</sub> concentration is higher than in aqueous phase, which makes physical sense.</p>

The diameter of the pathways scales linearly with the free energy and thus with the oxygen affinity (thinner radius represent high free energies and low oxygen affinity). The free energy at the minima and along the pathways follows the same color scale.

<p>Furthermore and in order to identify the energetically preferred routes for O<sub>2</sub> to access the BNC, we extracted, from the ILS affinity map, the lowest free energy pathways connecting the exterior with the O<sub>2</sub> high affinity sites (basins in the O<sub>2</sub> free energy landscape) inside C<italic>c</italic>ox, using the same methodology as Damas <italic>et al</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Damas1">[33]</xref> (for details, see the Data Analysis section of <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). From the analysis of the O<sub>2</sub> free energy landscape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004010-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>), we observe that there are many energy minima and low free energy pathways connecting the solvent/membrane region to the interior of the protein. Nonetheless, all these low free energy entrance channels converge into three distinct pathways as we approach the BNC.</p>
<p>The O<sub>2</sub> channel 1 approaches the BNC from the subunit I side and corresponds to the channel inferred from the X-ray data (for <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-SvenssonEk1">[13]</xref> or for bovine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Tsukihara1">[7]</xref>). This pathway has two entry points that are fused together in a free energy minimum located in the constriction point just before the BNC (M<sub>10</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004010-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). The free energy profile for this pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004010-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) is characterized by a very high permeation free energy barrier in the constriction point (associated to the bulky side chain of W172<sub>I</sub>) and three deep local minima (M<sub>8</sub>, M<sub>9</sub> and M<sub>10</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004010-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) located between W172<sub>I</sub>, F282<sub>I</sub> and E286<sub>I</sub> for M<sub>10</sub>, L243<sub>I</sub>, F282<sub>I</sub> and L283<sub>I</sub> for M<sub>8</sub>, and I250<sub>I</sub>, V194<sub>I</sub> and F108<sub>I</sub> for M<sub>9</sub>. The local minima observed just below the C<italic>c</italic>ox surface (M<sub>1</sub> and M<sub>6</sub>) can probably act as scavengers for the O<sub>2</sub> freely diffusing in the membrane and help to create an O<sub>2</sub> reservoir inside the protein. In this pathway, W172<sub>I</sub> and E286<sub>I</sub> seem to act as the gateway residues that control O<sub>2</sub> access to the catalytic site. Nevertheless, the passage from the constriction point to the BNC (moving from M<sub>10</sub> to M<sub>11</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004010-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) implies the overcoming of a very high free energy barrier of 39.5 kJ·mol<sup>−1</sup> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004010-g004">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004010-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>), which makes O<sub>2</sub> diffusion via this pathway very slow and difficult.</p>

<p>Over the last 20 years, several biochemical studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Riistama1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Salomonsson1">[22]</xref> have tried to demonstrate that this pathway is the one used for O<sub>2</sub> diffusion in the A-type C<italic>c</italic>oxs, but, until now, no direct measurement proved this unequivocally. All the tested mutations (e.g V287<sub>I</sub>I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Riistama1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Riistama2">[21]</xref> and G283<sub>I</sub>V <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Salomonsson1">[22]</xref>) were located too close to the two metals (Fe in heme <italic>a<sub>3</sub></italic> and Cu in Cu<sub>B</sub>) in the BNC, which made the interpretation of the results very difficult. It was impossible to unambiguously distinguish between the steric hindrance of the O<sub>2</sub> channel (introduced by the mutations) and the perturbation in the structure and local binding kinetics at the BNC. Moreover, until now, only one X-ray structure of the A-type C<italic>c</italic>oxs has been pressurized with xenon (considered to be an O<sub>2</sub> analog) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-SvenssonEk1">[13]</xref>. In this structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-SvenssonEk1">[13]</xref>, two hydrophobic xenon binding sites were identified, none of them located beyond the constriction point of channel 1. One xenon was observed at the entrance of the X-ray inferred channel while the other was close to E286<sub>I</sub>. Since no xenon was observed after the constriction region, there is still no consensus whether this pathway is indeed a functional channel for O<sub>2</sub> diffusion in these C<italic>c</italic>oxs. Additionally, Hofacker and Schulten <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Hofacker1">[31]</xref>, with the objective of studying O<sub>2</sub> diffusion towards the BNC, performed several MD simulations of C<italic>c</italic>oxs with several explicit O<sub>2</sub> molecules. The authors used the locally enhanced sampling (LES) technique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Elber1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Roitberg1">[64]</xref> to identify the pathway used by O<sub>2</sub> both in a bacterial (<italic>P. denitrificans</italic>) and in the bovine C<italic>c</italic>ox enzyme. In their simulations, some of the O<sub>2</sub> molecules reached the BNC via a unique and well-defined channel located in the same region as the X-ray inferred channel from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-SvenssonEk1">[13]</xref>. Given the very short duration of their simulations (picoseconds), the observation of such events was only possible due to the lowered free energy barriers experienced by the O<sub>2</sub> molecules when using the LES technique. Nevertheless, a single protein trajectory is still effectively employed in the LES approach, making the protein conformational sampling of that study more limited than the one in the present study. Finally, Farantos <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Porrini1">[32]</xref> by performing ILS calculations in the A-type C<italic>c</italic>ox from <italic>P. denitrificans</italic> and in the B-type C<italic>c</italic>ox enzyme from <italic>T thermophilus</italic>, were able to calculate the free energy surfaces for the interaction of several small polar (CO, NO) and apolar (O<sub>2</sub> and Xe) around the BNC region. Regarding the X-ray inferred channel, their results correlate very well with the ones reported in the present study and the high affinity cavity Xe<sub>1</sub> observed by the authors in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Porrini1">[32]</xref> coincides with minima M<sub>11</sub> in the O<sub>2</sub> channel 1.</p>
<p>The channel 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004010-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004010-g004">Fig. 4C and 4D</xref>) also starts at the membrane region and has only one possible entrance point located between the transmembrane helices 13 and 16 of subunit I, around residues V234<sub>I</sub>, L238<sub>I</sub> and V325<sub>I</sub>. Moreover, this channel terminates close to Y288<sub>I</sub>, a tyrosine residue covalently bonded to H284<sub>I</sub>, one of the Cu<sub>B</sub>-coordinating histidines. Y288<sub>I</sub> is located in the end of the K proton-conducting pathway and it has been suggested to be an essential residue for the catalytic mechanism, supplying the proton used in the cleavage of the O-O bond (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Siletsky2">[65]</xref> for a review). The energy profile for this alternative channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004010-g004">Fig. 4C and 4D</xref>) is characterized by one very low local free energy minimum (M<sub>19</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004010-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>) located between Y288<sub>I</sub> and T359<sub>I</sub> and by a high free energy minimum (M<sub>13</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004010-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>) around L292<sub>I</sub> and I323<sub>I</sub>. The highest energy barriers for this small pathway are 20.4 kJ·mol<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004010-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>), which are substantially smaller than the energy barrier in the constriction point of the O<sub>2</sub> channel 1 (39.5 kJ·mol<sup>−1</sup>). However, the high energy minimum M<sub>13</sub> located in the middle of the channel (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004010-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>) may hinder O<sub>2</sub> diffusion via this pathway.</p>
<p>Lastly, the O<sub>2</sub> channel 3 approaches the BNC from the subunit II side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004010-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004010-g004">Fig. 4C and 4D</xref>) and its entrance is located between the transmembrane helices 28 and 30 of subunit II, around residues F71<sub>II</sub> and V167<sub>II</sub>. This channel runs parallel to the heme <italic>a<sub>3</sub></italic> hydroxylethylfarnesyl tail and also terminates just bellow Y288<sub>I</sub>. It is generally formed by hydrophobic and aromatic residues, such as I363<sub>I</sub>, F391<sub>I</sub> and V272<sub>II</sub> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004010-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). The energy profile for this alternative channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004010-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>) is characterized by only one deep local energy minimum (M<sub>19</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004010-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>) located between Y288<sub>I</sub> and T359<sub>I</sub> and by several smaller (in comparison with the O<sub>2</sub> channel 1) energy barriers, which suggest a higher probability of O<sub>2</sub> passage. In this pathway, the largest energy barriers (19.9–22.3 kJ·mol<sup>−1</sup> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004010-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>) are related with the zone of the hydroxylethylfarnesyl tail of heme <italic>a<sub>3</sub></italic> and the side chains of I363<sub>I</sub> and F391<sub>I</sub>. This alternative O<sub>2</sub> channel was firstly suggested by Tsukihara <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Tsukihara1">[7]</xref>, based on the X-ray structure of the bovine heart C<italic>co</italic>x, as one of the three possible O<sub>2</sub> entrance points in the A-type oxidases. More recently, Farantos <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Porrini1">[32]</xref> were also able to observe the final part of this channel (located close to heme <italic>a<sub>3</sub></italic>) in the A-type C<italic>c</italic>ox from <italic>P. denitrificans</italic>.</p>
<p>Even though only subunits I and II were considered in this work, the entry points for all the channels described above are not obstructed by the missing subunits.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is also interesting to notice that all O<sub>2</sub> channels overlap in space with canonical proton pathways. The O<sub>2</sub> channel 1, which corresponds to the X-ray inferred channel, overlies with the end of the D-pathway, whereas the two alternative channels (O<sub>2</sub> channel 2 and channel 3), which end close to Y288<sub>I</sub>, overlap with the final part of the K-pathway.</p>
<p>For the two alternative channels identified here, the O<sub>2</sub> pathway is not permanently open and by this reason escaped detection when the static X-ray structures were inspected (e.g <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Tsukihara1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Iwata1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-SvenssonEk1">[13]</xref>). These channels resemble a chain of separate, multiple and transiently formed hydrophobic cavities that are interconnected with each other via the fluctuations of the residues lining the pathway. During the diffusion process, O<sub>2</sub> enters the protein and probably due to the thermal fluctuations of the heme <italic>a<sub>3</sub></italic> tail and residues lining the pathways, it is allowed to diffuse further into the protein core until it reaches the BNC.</p>
<p>Deciphering the actual role of these O<sub>2</sub> channels will require further mutational and biochemical analysis. Several mutations sites can be suggested (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1004010-t001">Table 1</xref>), on the three O<sub>2</sub> channels, in order to clarify the role of each pathway in O<sub>2</sub> diffusion towards the BNC in the A-type C<italic>c</italic>oxs.</p>

<p>For the X-ray inferred channel, it is clear that alternative mutation sites, located farther away from the metal ions in the BNC, need to be constructed and studied in order to clarify the actual role of this pathway in O<sub>2</sub> diffusion. W156<sub>I</sub> and F282<sub>I</sub> are excellent candidates for mutation experiments and their mutation for less bulkier residues, such as tyrosine and threonine (similar to what is observed in the <italic>T. thermophilus ba<sub>3</sub></italic> enzyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Luna1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-McDonald1">[25]</xref>) would give important insights into how O<sub>2</sub> diffusion occurs via this channel. Furthermore, for the alternative channels, the residues lining both pathways are also good candidates for mutational studies, because longer and/or bulkier side-chains could, in principle, obstruct the alternative channels and thus clarify the question of whether these channel are, indeed, used to supply O<sub>2</sub> to the BNC in the A-type C<italic>c</italic>oxs. Nevertheless, until new experimental data is available, we cannot rule out the hypothesis that all three channels may be working under physiological conditions.</p>

<title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p>Although A-type C<italic>c</italic>oxs have been widely studied during the last four decades, the details of the O<sub>2</sub> diffusion mechanism are still very incomplete. In particular, the existence and the characteristics of the channel(s) used by O<sub>2</sub> to travel from the solvent/membrane to the BNC are still unclear. In this study, we have used an integrated strategy of all-atom MD simulations (with and without explicit O<sub>2</sub> molecules) and ILS calculations, designed to examine and characterize the O<sub>2</sub> delivery channels in fully reduced C<italic>c</italic>ox from <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic>. Altogether, our results suggest that O<sub>2</sub> does not diffuse unspecifically inside this protein and instead, uses three well-defined channels running from the interior of the membrane (where O<sub>2</sub> solubility is higher than in the aqueous phase) towards the C<italic>c</italic>ox core. The first pathway has two entrance points, located between helices 5 and 8 and helices 11 and 13 of subunit I, which converges into the constriction point just before the BNC. This channel correlates very well with the channel inferred from the available X-ray structures. The second pathway has only one entry located between the transmembrane helices 13 and 16 of subunit I and it terminates close to Y288<sub>I</sub>. The third identified pathway approaches the BNC from the subunit II side. This channel runs parallel to the heme <italic>a<sub>3</sub></italic> hydroxylethylfarnesyl tail and also terminates just below Y288<sub>I</sub>. According to our observations, the hydrophobic channel detected in the X-ray structures does not constitute the most likely (energetically preferred) entrance point for the O<sub>2</sub> molecules in this C<italic>c</italic>ox. From the O<sub>2</sub> affinity map, O<sub>2</sub> accesses the BNC via the alternative dynamic channels formed by transient hydrophobic cavities, whose opening and closure is regulated by the thermal fluctuations of the protein. This may be the reason why these channels were not visible in the static X-ray structures.</p>
<p>In summary, our results suggest that the original hypothesis (based on static X-ray structures and mutational studies on A-type C<italic>c</italic>ox) that proposed, that O<sub>2</sub> permeation occurs via a unique, continuous and permanently open channel, is indeed a simplification. Our current work does not rule out the role of the X-ray inferred channel, but suggests other alternative routes to the BNC. Furthermore, it emphasizes the need to take into account the dynamic behavior of the protein in order to obtain a more complete description of the O<sub>2</sub> putative channels and a more detailed picture of the mechanisms underlying O<sub>2</sub> diffusion in these C<italic>c</italic>oxs.</p>

<title>MD simulations of C<italic>c</italic>ox inserted in a lipid membrane</title>
<p>All MD simulations were performed using the software package GROMACS 4.0.4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Hess1">[80]</xref> together with the united atom GROMOS 54A7 force-field <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Schmid1">[68]</xref> for the protein and lipids and the previously described atomic partial charges and parameters for the redox centers. The simple point charge (SPC) water model was used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Hermans1">[79]</xref>. Periodic boundary conditions were applied to all simulations. Non-bonded interactions were calculated using a twin range method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-vanGunsteren1">[81]</xref> with short and long-range cut-offs of 8 and 14 Å, respectively. A reaction field correction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Barker1">[82]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Tironi1">[83]</xref> was applied for the truncated electrostatic interactions, considering a dielectric constant of 62 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Poger1">[84]</xref>. The SETTLE algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Miyamoto1">[85]</xref> was used to constraint the bond lengths and angle in water molecules, while the LINCS algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Hess2">[86]</xref> was used to keep all remaining bonds constrained. The time step for integrating the equations of motion was 0.002 ps and the neighbor list was updated every 5 steps. The simulations were performed at the constant temperature of 310 K, which is above the phase transition temperature for the DMPC lipids (T<sub>m</sub> = 296–297 K) in order to ensure that the membrane is in the liquid crystalline state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Koyama1">[87]</xref>. A Berendsen heat bath <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Berendsen1">[88]</xref> was used, with separate couplings for the protein, membrane and solvent, using a relaxation time constant of 0.1 ps. The pressure was coupled semi-isotropically (coupling constant of 5.0 ps and isothermal compressibility of 4.6×10<sup>−5</sup> bar<sup>−1</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Poger1">[84]</xref>), resulting in an independent coupling of the lateral (P<sub>x+y</sub>) and perpendicular (P<sub>z</sub>) pressures. For all simulations, the x+y and z pressure components were kept at 1 atm and no surface tension was applied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Poger1">[84]</xref>. These simulation conditions were shown by Poger <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Poger1">[84]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Poger2">[89]</xref> to correctly reproduce several experimental measurements for this type of membranes.</p>
<p>The system was energy minimized with the steepest-descent method in order to remove excessive strain by performing 5000 steps of steepest-descent minimization with harmonic restraints applied to all non-hydrogen atoms (protein and lipids), followed by further 5000 steps restraining the non-hydrogen atoms of the protein, ending with 5000 steps with restraints applied to the Cα atoms only. After the minimization procedure, and in order to allow proper repacking of the lipids around the protein, a 20 ns MD relaxation was executed in three steps. First, a 0.5 ns simulation was performed with position restraints to all non-hydrogen atoms of the protein and solvent, at constant temperature and pressure. Afterwards, an additional 0.5 ns simulation was performed, with position restraints applied to the non-hydrogen atoms of the protein only. Finally, only the C<sub>α</sub> atoms were restrained for a period of 19 ns. A force constant of 1000 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup>nm<sup>−2</sup> was used for all the steps that included harmonic position restraints. The unrestrained simulations started after these 20 ns of restrained simulation.</p>
<p>In order to reduce the well known sampling problems in membrane-protein simulations, five MD simulations, 100 ns each, were performed, resulting in 0.5 µs of total simulation time. All replicates were initiated with different sets of random velocities. These simulations will be hereafter designated as O<sub>2</sub>-free simulations.</p>

<title>MD simulations of C<italic>c</italic>ox inserted in a lipid membrane with explicit O<sub>2</sub></title>
<p>After 20 ns of restrained simulations, we randomly added 84 molecules of dioxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) in the solvent zone of each system. No O<sub>2</sub> was placed inside the protein nor inside the hydrophobic core of the membrane (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004010.s001">S4 Figure in S1 Text</xref>). This new set of simulations will be, hereafter, designated as O<sub>2</sub> simulations. The water molecules within a 2 Å distance from the O<sub>2</sub> molecules were deleted, similarly to the procedure described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Damas1">[33]</xref>.</p>
<p>In order to allow the solvent to adapt to the newly added O<sub>2</sub> molecules, a 0.5 ns MD simulation with position restraints on all non-hydrogen atoms (force constant of 1000 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup>nm<sup>−2</sup>) was performed. After this initialization procedure, unrestrained MD simulations were carried out and the simulation conditions and parameters were similar to the ones described previously for the MD simulations without O<sub>2</sub>, except for the temperature coupling groups used. In this set of simulations, the O<sub>2</sub> molecules were included in the same group as the protein. 5 MD simulations, 100 ns each, were performed. The parameters for the O<sub>2</sub> molecules were taken from the previously published work of Victor <italic>et al</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Victor2">[90]</xref>.</p>
<p>The 84 O<sub>2</sub> molecules added to the system corresponds to an O<sub>2</sub> concentration of ∼0.235 M, which is higher than the experimental solubility of this gas in water. However, this high O<sub>2</sub> concentration does not affect the structural properties of the protein as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004010.s001">S5 Figure in S1 Text</xref>.</p>
<p>Moreover, the use of this high number of O<sub>2</sub> molecules is necessary to obtain reliable statistics within a reasonable simulation time.</p>

<p>In our case, the O<sub>2</sub> free energy map was constructed using the last 50 ns (for each replicate) of the O<sub>2</sub>-free simulations. For the calculations, all 50005 conformations (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004010.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>  = 10001 conformations x 5 replicates in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004010.e002">equation 2</xref>) were fitted to the X-ray structure using the C<sub>α</sub> atoms. A grid of 51×55×87 dimensions was used with a grid spacing of 1 Å and 400 O<sub>2</sub> insertions were performed per grid point (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004010.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>  = 400 in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004010.e002">equation 2</xref>). All calculations were carried out using a version of GROMACS 4.0.4 Widom TPI algorithm, modified almost in the same way as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Damas1">[33]</xref>. The only difference is that the ligand insertions here were made within the whole space of the grid cube (the grid cube is centered at the insertion point and with edge length equal to the grid spacing), while in the previous work (described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Damas1">[33]</xref>) the insertions were only possible within the inscribed sphere on the grid cube.</p>
<p>The 3D free energy map obtained describes the Gibbs free energy of moving an O<sub>2</sub> molecule from vacuum to a given position in the system, Δ<italic>G</italic><sub>vac→prot</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>). This map was then converted into the Δ<italic>G</italic><sub>wat→prot</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>) map of interest using a Δ<italic>G</italic><sub>wat→prot</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>) calculated as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Damas1">[33]</xref>.</p>

<p>The secondary structure assignment was performed with the program DSSP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Kabsch1">[91]</xref>. To determine the percentage of secondary structure loss relative to the X-ray structure, the secondary structure classes considered were: α-helix, 3<sub>10</sub>-helix, 5-helix, β-sheet and β-bridge.</p>
<p>For the energy landscape analysis, we used the method described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004010-Damas1">[33]</xref>. In short, this method classifies the energy landscape into energy basins through a steepest-descent tessellation and, afterwards, identifies the lowest-energy point within the boundaries between each pair of neighboring basins, i.e. the saddle point between those basins. After this procedure, a network of paths between all energy minima of the landscape can be constructed using the steepest-descent paths from the saddle points to the minima. A cutoff of 20 kJ·mol<sup>−1</sup> was used for the network construction.</p>
<p>The errors of the free energy profiles were calculated using two blocks: the first block corresponds to the frames ranging from 50 ns to 75 ns (for all five replicates) whereas the second block contains all the frames ranging from 75 ns to 100 ns. The errors were determined as half the difference of the energies observed between the two blocks for each minina and for each transition. The method used for error calculation assumes that similar minima and pathways can be identified in the two blocks. However, for the O<sub>2</sub> channel 1, the pathways connecting M<sub>6</sub> to M<sub>8</sub> and M<sub>10</sub> to M<sub>11</sub> were not visible in one of the blocks and by this reason their associated errors could not be calculated.</p>
