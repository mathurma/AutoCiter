<abstract>
<p>Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion channels are nonselective cation channels, essential for visual and olfactory sensory transduction. Although the channels include voltage-sensor domains (VSDs), their conductance is thought to be independent of the membrane potential, and their gating regulated by cytosolic cyclic nucleotide–binding domains. Mutations in these channels result in severe, degenerative retinal diseases, which remain untreatable. The lack of structural information on CNG channels has prevented mechanistic understanding of disease-causing mutations, precluded structure-based drug design, and hampered <italic>in silico</italic> investigation of the gating mechanism. To address this, we built a 3D model of the cone tetrameric CNG channel, based on homology to two distinct templates with known structures: the transmembrane (TM) domain of a bacterial channel, and the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain of the mouse HCN2 channel. Since the TM-domain template had low sequence-similarity to the TM domains of the CNG channels, and to reconcile conflicts between the two templates, we developed a novel, hybrid approach, combining homology modeling with evolutionary coupling constraints. Next, we used elastic network analysis of the model structure to investigate global motions of the channel and to elucidate its gating mechanism. We found the following: (i) In the main mode of motion, the TM and cytosolic domains counter-rotated around the membrane normal. We related this motion to gating, a proposition that is supported by previous experimental data, and by comparison to the known gating mechanism of the bacterial KirBac channel. (ii) The VSDs could facilitate gating (supplementing the pore gate), explaining their presence in such ‘voltage-insensitive’ channels. (iii) Our elastic network model analysis of the CNGA3 channel supports a modular model of allosteric gating, according to which protein domains are quasi-independent: they can move independently, but are coupled to each other allosterically.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels mediate the passage of cations through the cytoplasmic membrane. They are involved in sensory transduction and cellular development in the rod and cone photoreceptors, as well as in brain, kidney, heart and other cells, and are linked to achromatopsia and other rare genetic diseases. We used a hybrid modeling approach, combining comparative modeling and estimates of evolutionary conservation and couplings, to model the structure of a human cone CNG channel. The channel comprises a membrane domain that allows ion passage, and a regulatory cytosolic domain that binds cyclic nucleotides. The structure of each domain was modeled by homology on the basis of a suitable template. Our hybrid approach allowed us to evaluate the model structure, as well as to determine the conformations of regions where the templates overlapped and presented conflicting structural evidence. We then conducted normal mode analysis to reveal global motions of the channel. We suggest that the main mode of motion, counter-rotation of the membrane and cytosolic domains around the membrane normal, is associated with channel gating. Such rotational motion induces minimal perturbation to the lipid membrane, which could explain why the motion is observed in other types of channels.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion channels are nonselective cation channels, essential for visual and olfactory sensory transduction in vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Matulef1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Wang1">[4]</xref>. Like other members of the voltage-gated-like ion channel superfamily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Yu1">[2]</xref>, the CNG channels are composed of four (identical or similar) monomers, each containing six transmembrane (TM) helices (referred to as S1–S6) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Matulef1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Biel1">[3]</xref>. The first four TM helices in each monomer (S1–S4) form a voltage-sensor domain (VSD); the last two helices (S5 and S6, connected by the P-loop) of the four subunits assemble jointly to form the central pore. In spite of the presence of the VSD, CNG channels display very little voltage-dependent activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Matulef1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Wang1">[4]</xref>. Rather, the channel is gated by cyclic nucleotide binding to a cytosolic cyclic nucleotide–binding domain (CNBD), connected by a so-called C-linker to the C-terminus of the S6 helix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Matulef1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Wang1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>In vertebrates, the six known members of the CNG channel family, classified into A and B subtypes, can coassemble in several combinations to produce functional heterotetrameric channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Matulef1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Kaupp1">[6]</xref>. In cone photoreceptors, functional tetrameric CNG channels are composed of two CNGA3 and two CNGB3 subunits, with alike subunits positioned next to each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Peng1">[7]</xref> (see also a recent work by Ding and colleagues suggesting a composition of three CNGA3 subunits and one CNGB3 subunit in a cone channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Ding1">[8]</xref>). Binding of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) to CNBD controls the activity of the cone channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Matulef1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Biel1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Kaupp1">[6]</xref>. The cone system confers color vision; about 70 mutations in the CNGA3 and CNGB3 have been associated with achromatopsia, characterized by color blindness, photophobia, nystagmus and impaired visual acuity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Biel1">[3]</xref>. However, most of these mutations have been observed only in isolated cases, and even among the more commonly-observed mutations the precise mechanisms causing diseases are unknown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003976.s013">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003976.s014">S2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Biel1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Reuter1">[9]</xref>, thus hindering drug-discovery efforts. These challenges are further complicated by the poor understanding of the gating mechanism of the CNG channel, despite the available structural information on the membrane domain of a bacterial homolog <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Clayton1">[10]</xref> and on the regulatory cytosolic domain of both CNG and closely related hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels from various organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Clayton2">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Lolicato1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>Several different models have been proposed to describe the gating process of CNG channels (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Craven1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Cukkemane1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Karpen1">[23]</xref>). The models differ from one another in the minimum number of bound nucleotides required for activation, the cooperativity among the binding sites, and the number of open and closed states. The simplest model, known as the sequential model, suggests that three ligand molecules bind to the closed channel, and that the binding of a fourth molecule causes the transition to the open state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Karpen2">[24]</xref>. The sequential model does not account for the experimentally confirmed opening of unliganded or partially-liganded CNG channels and is therefore insufficient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Tibbs1">[25]</xref>. The classical Monod, Wyman, and Changeux (MWC) model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Monod1">[26]</xref>, initially aimed at describing cooperative properties of bacterial regulatory enzymes and hemoglobin, postulates that the channel can open with any number of bound ligands, i.e., 0 to 4; the higher the number of bound ligands, the more favorable the transition from the closed to the open state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Craven1">[5]</xref>. Although the MWC model accurately describes some features of CNG channels, it does not account for the existence of sub-conductance states, allowing only one open state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Richards1">[22]</xref>. A third model describes the tetramer as a dimer of dimers; each dimer acts as an MWC unit, and the monomers within the dimer display cooperativity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Liu1">[27]</xref>. In order for the channel to open, both dimers must be activated independently (no cooperativity between the dimers). The last model, the modular gating model, defines modules within the channel: the VSD, the pore, the C-linker and the CNBD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Craven3">[28]</xref>. Each module can independently switch between two possible conformations: the VSD and the C-linker can be either resting or activated; the pore can be closed or open; and the CNBD can be ligand-free (apo) or –bound (holo). Yet, the modules are coupled to each other, so that the state of each module can affect the states of other modules.</p>
<p>In order to elucidate the channel gating mechanism, we built 3D models of the tetrameric CNG channel in its resting state, with the CNBDs in apo- and holo-conformations. We built the homology model from two distinct templates—one corresponding to the TM domain and the other corresponding to the cytosolic domain—and evaluated the model structure on the basis of its evolutionary conservation profile <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Kalman1">[29]</xref>. However, because the modeling process was complicated by the use of two distinct templates, as well as by low sequence similarity between the queries and the template for the TM domain, we also evaluated the model structure using EVcouplings, a recently-developed methodology that identifies evolutionarily coupled residues from sequence variation data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Hopf1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Marks1">[31]</xref>. As evolutionarily coupled residues often interact physically in the 3D space of a protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Morcos1">[32]</xref>, this and similar methods (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Marks2">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Taylor1">[34]</xref>) have been successfully applied to predict structures of membrane and soluble proteins, as well as to detect residues participating in conformational changes and protein-protein interactions. Here we used evolutionary couplings (i) to evaluate our model structure of the cone channel and (ii) to select the best conformations in ambiguous regions of the model and in regions in which the two templates yielded overlapping, conflicting predictions.</p>
<p>To analyze the channel dynamics, we used coarse-grained elastic network models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Haliloglu1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Bahar2">[37]</xref>. In the channel's slowest, dominant mode of motion, the TM and cytosolic domains rotate around the membrane normal in opposite directions. We related this mode of motion to gating, a proposition supported by experimental evidence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Giorgetti1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Flynn2">[39]</xref>, as well as by comparison to the gating mechanism of the bacterial KirBac channel. KirBac channels resemble CNG channels in the architecture of the pore domain and in the function of the cytoplasmic domain. Additionally, investigation of the next-slowest modes of motion revealed that the TM and the cytosolic domains fluctuate alternatively in each mode, with cooperativity between the mobile and immobile domains. This observation is consistent with the modular gating model of the cone channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Craven3">[28]</xref>.</p>

<title>The model structure displays typical conservation and hydrophobicity profiles and is compatible with experimental results in the homologous CNGA1 protein</title>
<p>We modeled by homology the 3D structure of the cone CNG channel using two distinct templates: the TM region structure of the bacterial channel MlotiK1, and the cytosolic domain structure of the mouse HCN2 channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003976-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). We projected ConSurf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Ashkenazy1">[40]</xref> conservation scores of the CNGA3 and CNGB3 subunits, composing the cone channel, onto the resultant model to evaluate it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003976-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). The evolutionary conservation profile has previously been demonstrated to be a valuable tool for assessing the quality of model structures; the assessment approach is based on the observation that the protein core is typically conserved, whereas residues that face the surroundings, either lipids or water, are variable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Kalman1">[29]</xref>. Our model structure was compatible with the anticipated evolutionary profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003976-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). The model structure of the TM domain was also compatible with the expected hydrophobicity profile: hydrophobic residues were exposed to the lipid, and charged and polar amino acids were buried in the protein core or located in the loop regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003976.s002">Figure S1</xref>). The model correlates well with the experimental data available for the closely homologous bovine channel CNGA1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003976.s001">Text S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003976.s003">Figures S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003976.s004">S3</xref>).

<title>The model structure is mostly compatible with predicted evolutionary couplings</title>
<p>We further evaluated the predicted model structure of the CNGA3 monomer and tetramer using evolutionary couplings calculated separately for the TM domain and for the cytosolic domain. To this end, we used the EVcouplings algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Hopf1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Marks1">[31]</xref>. For each domain we carried out the comparison using the 2L/3 residues with the greatest coupling strength, where L is the sequence length; L = 240 in the TM region and L = 197 in the cytoplasmic region; see Methods. In both domains the overlay of the calculated evolutionary couplings and the contacts derived from the model structure was remarkable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003976-g003">Fig. 3</xref>): among the residue pairs used in the evaluations of the TM and cytosolic domains, 75% and 92%, respectively, were in contact. A control calculation using the templates revealed similar ratios of contacting evolutionary couplings in the two domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003976.s006">Figure S5</xref>). A more detailed analysis of the couplings detected between residues that were not in contact according to the model structure (or the templates) suggested that most of these are related to flexibility in the loop regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003976.s001">Text S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Evolutionary couplings support the model structure in regions with conflicting structural data</title>
<p>Overall, our model structure was compatible with the anticipated hydrophobicity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003976.s002">Figure S1</xref>) and evolutionary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003976-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) patterns, as well as with mappings of evolutionary couplings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003976-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). However, we considered alternative conformations for two specific regions in the model, i.e., helix S1 of the TM domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003976.s007">Figure S6</xref>) and the S6-C-linker interface of the cytosolic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003976-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). First, secondary structure prediction methods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003976.s007">Figures S6A and S6B</xref>), in addition to the hydrophobicity profile of the homologs in the region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003976.s007">Figure S6D</xref>), pointed to two main alternatives for the boundaries of helix S1: 170–186, used in the original model, vs. 174–190 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003976.s007">Figure S6D</xref>). Second, for the region connecting helix S6 and the C-linker, either of the two templates could have been used (i.e., either the TM domain of bacterial MlotiK1 channel or the cytosolic domain of the mouse HCN2 channel), and we based our model structure on the mammalian template. However, we considered an alternative model structure, in which the conformation of this region was based on the bacterial template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003976-g001">Figs. 1A and 1B</xref>). Overall, we constructed two alternative model structures of the CNG channel (in addition to the original): one with different boundaries for the S1 helix, and another one with a different conformation of the S6-C-linker interface. We correlated the overlay of the contacts in these models with the evolutionary couplings and concluded that the original model agrees with the data better than either alternative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003976-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, the insets).</p>

<title>Equilibrium dynamics of the CNGA3 channel</title>
<p>We used coarse-grained elastic network models to investigate global motions of the cone channel. We chose this methodology because it is insensitive to the atomic details of the (imprecise) model structure and is capable of exploring large-scale motions, related to channel gating and inactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Bahar2">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Bahar3">[41]</xref>. For simplicity and to facilitate more convenient representation of the data, we focused on a symmetric tetrameric channel composed of four identical CNGA3 subunits. The results obtained for the structure, modeled based on CNBD templates in their apo- and holo-states, were, in essence, identical, and thus we only describe the results obtained for the apo-state.</p>
<p>A complete description of the results is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003976.s001">Text S1</xref>. Briefly, the channel dynamics are dominated by three types of motion. In motion I the channel is divided into two dynamic units: the TM domain and the cytosolic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003976-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). The two domains rotate around the membrane normal in opposite directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003976-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). In motion II the VSDs are swinging, while the pore domain, as well as the C-linkers and the CNBDs, are essentially stationary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003976-g004">Fig. 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003976.s008">Figure S7B</xref>). The fluctuations of the VSDs are positively correlated with those of the C-linker and the CNBD of the same subunit, and with those of the pore region of the adjacent subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003976-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). In motion III the pairs of diagonal CNBDs alternately move towards and away from each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003976-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>). The fluctuations of the VSDs are positively correlated with those of the CNBD, C-linker and pore region of the adjacent subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003976-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>).</p>

<title>The three principal motions.</title>
<p>The cross-correlations between the residues in each motion type are shown on the left panels (A, C, E); the channel is colored according to the correlation of the VSD of chain A with the other residues. The corresponding motions are presented on the right panels (B, D, F). Snapshots are colored according to the direction of motion, ranging from green to red. (A, C, E) In each panel, chain A represents an arbitrary CNGA3 chain (the channel comprises four identical chains). The magnitude of positive and negative correlations between the fluctuations of the residues is color-coded according to the blue-to-red scale at the bottom of the picture. Positive correlation indicates motion of two residues in the same direction, while negative correlation indicates motion in opposite directions. In panel A, the arrows indicate the location of the pivot points of the rotational motion at the termini of the S6 helices, i.e., the border between the dynamics units (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>). The CNBDs in panel D and the TM domain in panel F are omitted for clarity.</p>

<p>The analysis also shows that, in essence, all the motions, except motion I, can be categorized into modes in which only the TM domain is fluctuating (as in motion II) or modes in which only the cytosolic domain fluctuates (as in motion III). Thus, each domain is mobile individually. However, there is cooperativity between the domains, which suggests that they affect each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003976-g004">Figs. 4C and 4E</xref>). This observation corroborates the modular gating model of the CNG channels, which postulates that the domains (modules) can undergo conformational changes individually, but that the state of each module affects the states of other modules, i.e., quasi-independent dynamic units <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Craven3">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>In order to examine the effect of the VSDs on channel dynamics, we performed elastic networks analysis of a variant of the channel in which the VSDs were removed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003976.s009">Figure S8</xref>). The dynamics remained, in essence, the same, aside from the motions that directly involve the VSDs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We presented a model structure of a human CNG channel, built using a unique computational protocol that includes homology modeling, as well as evolutionary data from conservation and couplings analysis. The model correlates well with mutagenesis and clinical data. Elastic network analyses of the model-structure enable us to provide concrete suggestions concerning the gating mechanism.</p>

<title>Rotational motion and gating</title>
<p>Motion I of the CNGA3 channel is a rotational, iris-like opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003976-g004">Figs. 4A and 4B</xref>). This motion is unique in that it is associated with the only (non-degenerate) slow mode that manifests cooperativity among all subunits and allows symmetry-preserving conformational transition. Here we compare this motion with the gating motion in KirBac channels, prokaryotic homologs of mammalian inwardly rectifying potassium channels. KirBac channels share the architecture of the pore domain with other members of the voltage-gated-like ion channel superfamily, but they lack the VSD. Similarly to CNG channels, KirBac channels feature a cytoplasmic regulatory domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Hibino1">[42]</xref>. Recent crystal structures of the KirBac3.1 channel in the open and closed states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003976-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>) revealed its gating mechanism: upon activation, the TM and cytoplasmic domains of KirBac3.1 rotate in opposite directions around the membrane normal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Bavro1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Clarke1">[44]</xref>. For comparison, we performed elastic network analysis of the KirBac3.1 channel in its closed state.</p>

<p>The slowest mode of motion of the KirBac3.1 channel displayed rotational movement of the TM and cytoplasmic domains, which resembled the shift between the open and closed states captured in the crystal structures, i.e., the conformational change that occurs upon gating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003976-g005">Figs. 5A and 5B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Bavro1">[43]</xref>. Because of the analogy between this motion and motion I of the CNG channel, we associate the latter motion with gating as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003976-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Indeed, calculations using the edge conformations of the motion and the HOLE software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Smart1">[45]</xref> show that the counter-clockwise rotation of the TM domain (and the joint clockwise rotation of the cytoplasmic domain) leads to pore opening (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003976.s010">Figure S9</xref>).</p>
<p>The idea of a rotational motion related to the gating of CNG channels is not new <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Giorgetti1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Flynn2">[39]</xref>. Based on existing experimental evidence, Flynn and colleagues have associated a clockwise rotation of the C-linkers with channel gating (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Flynn2">[39]</xref>). The authors also indicated that a rotational gating motion requires definition of a ‘pivot point’, the residues on the two sides of which rotate in opposite directions. They proposed that in CNG channels the pivot point is located at the top of the S6 helices. Indeed, our elastic network analysis shows clockwise rotation of the cytosolic domain, which is coupled to counterclockwise rotation of the TM domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003976-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>), an observation compatible with their proposition and with the gating mechanism of the KirBac channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Bavro1">[43]</xref>. However, our analysis indicates that the pivot point is located at the C-termini (rather than the top) of the S6 helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003976-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>); it corresponds to the hinge in motion I around residues 401–407 ().</p>
<p>Although CNG and KirBac channels display similar rotational motion upon gating, there is an important difference between the two channels. KirBac channels contain two activation gates: one in the center of the S6 helix (near the P-loop) and one at the C-termini of the S6 helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003976-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Bavro1">[43]</xref>. In contrast, CNG channels contain only a single gate, which is located in the pore region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Cukkemane1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Flynn2">[39]</xref>. We propose that in the absence of a second gate in the CNG channels, the VSD provides an additional means of gating regulation. Our conclusion derives from a close investigation of rotational motion I of the CNGA3 channel in the presence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003976-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>) and absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003976-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>) of the VSDs. In the presence of the VSDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003976-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>), the fluctuations of the N-termini of the S6 helices are smaller in magnitude than they are in the absence of these domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003976-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). In other words, the VSD stiffens the pore region, so that the fluctuations in the gate region are limited. This could explain why KirBac channels, lacking the VSD, have an extra gate at the C-termini of the S6 helices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Bavro1">[43]</xref>, whereas CNG channels, which do contain the VSD, have only one gate.</p>
<p>The idea that rotational motion can facilitate gating has been proposed for other ion channels from various families, both voltage-dependent and -independent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Swartz1">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Yeheskel1">[52]</xref>. This motion appears to have minimal effect on the channel-membrane interface, and causes minimal perturbation of the lipid membrane. Thus, it is possible that many more ion channels share a similar rotational gating mechanism.</p>

<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>The approach used to predict the structure of the cone channel has certain drawbacks. First, the TM region was derived from the structure of a distant homolog, with ∼10% sequence identity between query and template. This may have led to inaccuracies in the model structure due to errors in the alignment of the query and template sequences, as well as structural changes along the course of evolution. However, the compatibility of the model structure with the expected evolutionary and hydrophobicity patterns, evolutionary couplings and the available experimental data is encouraging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003976-g002">Figs. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003976-g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003976.s002">Figures S1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003976.s004">S3</xref>). Second, our model structure of the cone channel was derived from two distinct templates. Therefore, the interface connecting these templates in the model, i.e., the S6-C-linker region, might be inaccurate. However, we have explored alternative conformations of the region, and the evolutionary couplings agreed best with our model structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003976-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Third, the loop regions in any model structure are expected to be imprecise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Schushan1">[53]</xref>. Reassuringly, the exact loop conformation that was chosen had little effect on the results of our elastic network analysis. The fact that the results are insensitive to minor structural changes suggests that other channels of the CNG family might share dynamics similar to those of CNGA3. Lastly, the fact that the cytosolic domain was modeled on the basis of the crystal structure of the corresponding domain of an HCN channel could also be problematic, as the resemblance of the CNG and the HCN channels in this region has previously been called into question, owing to conflicting experimental evidence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Mazzolini1">[54]</xref>. That the evolutionary couplings in the cytosolic domain of the human CNGA3 channel and mouse HCN2 channel displayed similar patterns suggests that they do share the same conformation in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003976-g003">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003976.s006">Figure S5B</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the weaknesses of the presented model structure, it is quite natural to study the channel dynamics using elastic network analysis, an approach that relies on a simplified representation of the channel structure, comprising α-carbons connected by Hookean springs of identical force constant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Haliloglu1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Atilgan1">[55]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Emekli1">[57]</xref>. That is, the network models do not depend on the identity of the amino acids and the specificity of interactions between them. Moreover, the coarse-grained network models do not depend on the atomic details of the structure and can tolerate some variations in topology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Bahar2">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Bahar3">[41]</xref>. In addition, elastic network models are capable of capturing large-scale conformational changes, including changes that are dependent on external stimuli, such as voltage or ligand binding. This is because the intrinsic modes of motion of a protein are determined by its architecture only, and the elastic network models can predict these modes solely from the structure, regardless of the environment (water or membrane) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Bahar2">[37]</xref>. Whereas the environment can have an impact on the magnitude of the global motions and on local interactions, it does not usually determine their direction and nature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Bahar2">[37]</xref>. Indeed, in previous studies, slow modes of motion have been shown to describe functional conformational changes in proteins, including membrane channels and transporters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Haliloglu1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Bahar2">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Bahar3">[41]</xref>. Finally, the strongest support for the suitability of elastic network models as an approach for detecting functionally important motions in CNG channels comes from calculations we conducted with the KirBac3.1 channel: The dominant motions we detected for the CNG channels were very similar to motions calculated for the KirBac3.1 channel, inferred to correspond to gating motions, according to the known crystal structures of the channel in the open and closed states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003976-g005">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>
<p>Evolutionary couplings have been successfully used to predict the structures of membrane and soluble proteins (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Marks2">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Taylor1">[34]</xref>), but our preliminary attempt to predict the structure of the CNG channel using evolutionary couplings alone was unsuccessful. This is perhaps because of the large number of inter-subunit contacts in the unique architecture of the tetrameric CNG channel; it is difficult to discriminate between couplings associated with the intra- and inter-subunit contacts. Instead, we used homology modeling to derive our model structure, and relied on evolutionary couplings to validate the model and to distinguish between possible conformations in regions of conflicting structural evidence. This is somewhat related to the approach used in reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Sadowski1">[58]</xref>.</p>
<p>In some cases, evolutionary couplings may reflect protein conformational changes, as demonstrated for several TM transporters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Hopf1">[30]</xref>. However, our evolutionary couplings map provided no clues as to the channel's conformational changes. We suggest that the reason is that, in contrast to the major conformational changes observed in transporters, conformational changes in channels, including the rotational motion described above, are minor and have little effect on residue contacts.</p>
<p>While this paper was in review, a homology model of the TM domain of the canine CNGA3 channel was published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Tanaka1">[59]</xref>. The model, obtained based on a chimeric Kv1.2/2.1 structural template, corresponds to an open state of the channel, while our model structure represents a closed conformation. The models are based on different templates, and they also differ from each other in the boundaries of the TM helices (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003976.s007">Figure S6A</xref>); most differences could perhaps be attributed to the conformational changes upon channel opening/closure.</p>

<p>The presence of the VSD in the voltage-insensitive CNG channels is a long-standing conundrum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Clayton1">[10]</xref>. Recently, it was shown that the domain affects trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Faillace1">[60]</xref>, but one could argue that from a parsimonious point of view it seems unlikely that a whole domain would be preserved in evolution in a case where a short peptide would do. Locations of high-frequency disease-associated mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003976.s001">Text S1</xref> “Mapping disease-causing mutations on the model structure”) and normal mode calculations together suggest that the VSDs may also play a role in gating, supplementing the pore gate.</p>

<title>Modeling of the CNGA3 and CNGB3 subunits</title>
<p>A CNG channel subunit consists of a TM domain and a cytosolic domain comprising a CNBD and a C-linker. In the absence of a high-resolution structure of an intact subunit, we modeled the cone channel on the basis of existing structures corresponding to the individual domains. CNG and HCN channels are closely related in structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Craven1">[5]</xref>; thus, HCN structures can serve as templates for modeling CNGs. A variety of high-resolution structures of mammalian cytosolic domains from HCN channels are available <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Zagotta1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Lolicato1">[20]</xref>. As a template for the apo-state, we used the mouse HCN2 channel (Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 3FFQ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Taraska1">[18]</xref>), the only available structure of a mammal cytosolic domain in an apo-state. As a template for the holo-state, we used the mouse HCN2 channel (PDB entry 1Q3E <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Zagotta1">[15]</xref>), the only available structure of the cytosolic domain in complex with cGMP. Pairwise alignments between the queries and templates were needed for the modeling. The CNBD of the mouse HCN2 channel shares sequence identities of 33% and 29% with the cytosolic domains of CNGA3 and of CNGB3, respectively. When a query and a template display sequence identity of 30% or more, a model structure can be constructed on the basis of a simple pairwise alignment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Schushan1">[53]</xref>. Still, extraction of the pairwise alignment from a multiple-sequence alignment can improve the model accuracy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Schushan1">[53]</xref>. We searched for the homologs of the mouse HCN2 channel in the CleanUniProt database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Goldenberg1">[61]</xref> and aligned their sequences using the MUSCLE program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Edgar1">[62]</xref>. Both subunits, CNGA3 and CNGB3, were detected as homologs, and their alignments with the sequence of the mouse HCN2 channel were extracted from the multiple sequence alignment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003976.s011">Figure S10</xref>).</p>
<p>The crystal structure of the bacterial MlotiK1 channel in its closed state (PDB entry 3BEH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Clayton1">[10]</xref>) served as a template for modeling the TM domains of CNGA3 and CNGB3. The sequence identities between the TM domain of MlotK1 and those of CNGA3 and CNGB3 were only 10% and 12.5%, respectively. Thus, aligning both queries to the template was challenging. In cases of such low query-template similarity it is recommended to use a variety of tools in order to produce a reliable pairwise alignment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Schushan1">[53]</xref>. We exploited the secondary structure prediction algorithm PsiPred <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Jones1">[63]</xref>, several methods for the identification of TM segments, namely MEMSAT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Nugent1">[64]</xref> and HMMTOP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Tusnady1">[65]</xref>, a methodology for profile-to-profile alignment HHpred <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Hildebrand1">[66]</xref>, and the FFAS03 server <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Jaroszewski1">[67]</xref> for both profile-to-profile alignment and fold-recognition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003976.s007">Figure S6</xref>). Additionally, we created a multiple sequence alignment of 101 homologs that included the sequences of the queries and the template. To this end, we searched for MlotK1 homologs in the SwissProt database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Boeckmann1">[68]</xref> using CS-BLAST <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Biegert1">[69]</xref>; 3 iterations were performed with maximal e-value of 10<sup>-5</sup>. The collected homologs were aligned using the MUSCLE program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Edgar1">[62]</xref>. The final alignment between the queries and template took into account the outputs of all methodologies used (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003976.s007">Figure S6</xref>). For the most part, in spite of the high sequence diversity, there was consensus in the hydrophobicity profiles of the homologs in the TM helices (e.g., <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003976.s007">Figure S6E</xref>), excluding S1. Because of the observed deviations in the predicted boundaries of the S1 segment, as well as the diversity of the hydrophobicity profiles of the homologs in the region, we considered also an alternative location of S1 in the sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003976.s007">Figure S6</xref>). Compared with this alternative, the final model was in better agreement with the evolutionary and hydrophobicity profiles, and with the evolutionary couplings. Nevertheless, our confidence regarding the boundaries of the S1 segment is lower compared with the other TM segments.</p>
<p>The templates for the TM (PDB entry 3BEH) and cytosolic domains (PDB entry 1Q3E) contain overlapping regions i.e., regions corresponding to the same amino acid segment in the queries: residues 217–223 of PDB entry 3BEH and residues 443–449 of PDB entry 1Q3E, corresponding to residues 407–413 in CNGA3 and residues 449–455 in CNGB3. This region corresponds to the interface between the S6 helix in the TM domain and the C-linker, and its orientation differs greatly between the templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003976-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). As bacterial cytosolic domains do not include C-linkers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Clayton2">[11]</xref>, we chose to model the region of conflict according to the template of mammalian origin, i.e., PDB entry 1Q3E, covering the cytosolic domain. The initial 3D models of the CNGA3 and CNGB3 subunits were constructed using version v9.10 of the MODELLER software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Eswar1">[70]</xref>.</p>
<p>Long loops, i.e., the loops connecting S1–S2, S2–S3 and S5-P-loop, were refined with the Rosetta loop modeling application <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Wang2">[71]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Canutescu1">[72]</xref>. Rosetta created 1,000 decoys for each loop. The decoys were then evaluated using the ConQuass method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Kalman1">[29]</xref>. ConQuass is based on the anticipation that evolutionarily conserved amino acids are buried in the protein and that variable residues are exposed to the environment, and assigns scores to the decoys based on the degree to which they adhere to this pattern. In each of the three refined loops the decoy with the best ConQuass score was chosen for the final model. Evolutionary conservation profiles were calculated as described below.</p>
<p>For comparison, we also constructed a model structure of the CNG channel in which the S6-C-linker interface was modeled according to the bacterial template, i.e., PDB entry 3BEH, covering the TM domain. Overall, we constructed two alternative model structures of the CNG channel (in addition to the original): one with different boundaries of the S1 helix, and another one with a different conformation of the S6-C-linker interface.</p>

<title>Calculation of evolutionary couplings</title>
<p>A reliable calculation of evolutionary couplings requires a particularly large collection of homologous sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Marks2">[33]</xref>. We failed to find a sufficient number of CNGA3 homologs that included both the TM and CNB domains, and conducted evolutionary couplings calculations for each domain separately. Namely, we built a multiple sequence alignment for the TM domain, i.e., residues 161–410, and another alignment for the C-linker with the CNBD, i.e., residues 410–610. To this effect, we used the JackHMMer software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Eddy1">[73]</xref> (5 iterations) to search for similar sequences against the Uniprot database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-TheUniProt1">[74]</xref> using the range 10<sup>−15</sup>–10<sup>−20</sup> of e-values. These e-values yielded the largest numbers of aligned sequences while maintaining coverage of the input sequence. The final alignments covering the TM and cytosolic domains contained 6,439 and 7,203 sequences, respectively. Although proteins from families such as voltage-gated potassium channels can be aligned to the CNG channels at a high e-value threshold, these families were excluded, as they introduced many insertions and deletions. Importantly, this means that strong evolutionary couplings deduced from alignment of the VSD domain are not a consequence of inclusion of these known voltage-gated channels. Redundant (&gt;90% sequence identity) and fragmented sequences were discarded. Evolutionary couplings were then calculated using the EVcouplings webserver (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.evfold.org" xlink:type="simple">www.evfold.org</ext-link>) as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Marks1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Marks2">[33]</xref>; covariation information was inferred using the plmDCA algorithm (pseudolikelihood maximization for Potts models with direct coupling analysis) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Ekeberg1">[75]</xref>. All columns in the alignments containing gaps of less than 80% were considered informative for the calculation. The evolutionary couplings were ranked according to their coupling strength; for each domain, we took the top 2/3 L strongest evolutionary couplings (L = sequence length; L = 240 in the TM domain and L = 197 in the cytoplasmic domain) and correlated them to the contacts in the CNGA3 model structure.</p>
<p>For comparison, we also calculated evolutionary couplings for the template sequences of the bacterial MlotiK1 and mouse HCN2 using the same protocol. We compared the results to the contact maps deduced from the crystal structures using distance cutoffs between 10 and 15 Å; residue pairs with α-carbons below the cutoff were considered in contact. The results were qualitatively the same for all cutoff points selected. In our analysis of the model structure, we used the results based on a distance cutoff of 12 Å, reproducing over 95% of the detected evolutionary couplings.</p>

<title>Elastic network models</title>
<p>We analyzed the model structure of the homotetrameric CNGA3 channel using two elastic network models, namely, the Gaussian network model (GNM) and the anisotropic network model (ANM). We focused on the homotetrameric channel for simplicity. The methodology of both elastic network models has been described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Haliloglu1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Atilgan1">[55]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Emekli1">[57]</xref>; here we give a short summary.</p>
<p>GNM calculations use a simplified representation of the protein, in which the structure is reduced to α-carbon atoms and is treated as an elastic network of nodes connected by hookean springs of uniform force constant <italic>γ</italic>. Two nodes <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> are assumed to display Gaussian fluctuations around their equilibrium positions if the distance between them is below the (commonly used) cutoff of 10 Å. The inter-node contacts are then defined by an <italic>N</italic>×<italic>N</italic> Kirchhoff matrix <bold><italic>Γ</italic></bold>, where <italic>N</italic> is the number of amino acids in the protein. The correlation between the fluctuations of two nodes <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic>, Δ<bold>R</bold><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> and Δ<bold>R</bold><italic><sub>j</sub></italic>, respectively, are calculated as follows:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003976.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003976.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <bold>u</bold><italic><sub>k</sub></italic> and <italic>λ<sub>k</sub></italic> are, respectively, the <italic>k</italic>-th eigenvector and <italic>k</italic>-th eigenvalue of <bold><italic>Γ</italic></bold>, <italic>k<sub>B</sub></italic> is the Boltzmann constant, and <italic>T</italic> is the absolute temperature; <italic>k<sub>B</sub>T</italic>/<italic>γ</italic> was taken as 1 Å<sup>2</sup>. The summation is performed over all (<italic>k</italic> = 1 to <italic>N</italic>-1) non-zero eigenvalues. Overall, Eq. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003976.e001">1</xref> predicts the mean-square displacement of each residue (node) when <italic>i</italic> = <italic>j</italic>, and when <italic>i</italic> ≠ <italic>j</italic> it predicts the correlations between the fluctuations of residues <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> as a superimposition of <italic>N</italic>-1 eigenmodes. <italic>λ<sub>k</sub></italic> is proportional to the <italic>k</italic>-th mode frequency, the inverse of which gives the relative contribution of this mode to the protein's overall structural motion. The minima in the obtained fluctuation profile for a given mode suggest possible hinge points that coordinate the cooperative motions between mobile structural elements in this mode.</p>
<p>In contrast to isotropic GNM, ANM determines the direction of fluctuations. Here <bold><italic>Γ</italic></bold> is replaced by the 3<italic>N</italic>×3<italic>N</italic> Hessian matrix <bold><italic>H</italic></bold>, the elements of which are the second derivatives of the inter-node potential described by Eq. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003976.e001">1</xref>, with a (commonly used) cutoff of 15 Å. The first 6 modes are zero eigenmodes, corresponding to the rigid-body rotations and translations of the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Bahar2">[37]</xref>, and the correlation between Δ<bold>R</bold><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> and Δ<bold>R</bold><italic><sub>j</sub></italic> is decomposed into 3<italic>N</italic>-6 modes and calculated as follows:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003976.e002"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003976.e002" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>where tr[H<sup>-1</sup>]<italic><sub>ij</sub></italic> is the trace of the <italic>ij</italic>-th submatrix [<bold>H</bold><sup>−1</sup>]<italic><sub>ij</sub></italic> of <bold>H</bold><sup>−1</sup>. The summation is performed over all (<italic>k</italic> = 1 to 3<italic>N</italic> - 6) non-zero eigenvalues. The eigenvectors allow us to identify alternative conformations sampled by the individual modes, simply by adding/subtracting the eigenvectors to/from the equilibrium position in the respective modes. Thus, being an anisotropic model, ANM provides information on the directions of the motions in 3D, while GNM is more realistic with respect to the mean-square fluctuations and the correlations between fluctuations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Bahar2">[37]</xref>.</p>
<p>Several studies have demonstrated that the first few slowest GNM modes are implicated in protein function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Bahar1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003976-Bahar2">[37]</xref>. Therefore, we focused on the six GNM modes identified as slowest on the basis of the distribution of the eigenvalues; these modes were responsible for approximately 40% of the overall motion of the channel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003976.s012">Figure S11</xref>). The superimposition of the residues' mean-square displacement predicted by GNM and ANM revealed the correspondence between the two elastic network models. Thus, using ANM, we were able to determine the direction of fluctuations characterized by GNM.</p>
