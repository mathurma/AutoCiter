<abstract>
<p>The primary mechanism of action of the antibiotic dihydrostreptomycin is binding to and modifying the function of the bacterial ribosome, thus leading to decreased and aberrant translation of proteins; however, the routes by which it enters the bacterial cell are largely unknown. The mechanosensitive channel of large conductance, MscL, is found in the vast majority of bacterial species, where it serves as an emergency release valve rescuing the cell from sudden decreases in external osmolarity. While it is known that MscL expression increases the potency of dihydrostreptomycin, it has remained unclear if this effect is due to a direct interaction. Here, we use a combination of genetic screening, MD simulations, and biochemical and mutational approaches to determine if dihydrostreptomycin directly interacts with MscL. Our data strongly suggest that dihydrostreptomycin binds to a specific site on MscL and modifies its conformation, thus allowing the passage of K<sup>+</sup> and glutamate out of, and dihydrostreptomycin into, the cell.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Streptomycin is one of the original and best studied antibiotics. Its primary mechanism of action is the interference with protein synthesis by binding to and modifying the function of the bacterial ribosome. However, the antibiotic is quite large, bulky, and is charged, so the mechanisms by which it accesses the inside of the bacterial cell have remained largely unknown. Previously, we have found that the expression of a bacterial mechanosensitive channel, MscL, increases the potency of a variant of this antibiotic, dihydrostreptomycin. Here, we define the dihydrostreptomycin binding site on the MscL channel. We also show how this antibiotic modifies the channel and opens the pore, allowing the diffusion of solutes, such as potassium and glutamate, from the cytoplasm of the cell out to the medium. Finally, we provide evidence that dihydrostreptomycin can pass through MscL and that the channel is thus one pathway by which the drug accesses the inside of the bacterial cell.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Streptomycin is a member of the aminoglycoside family of antibiotics, with bactericidal properties. The mechanism of action has been extensively studied since its discovery in 1944. Ultimately, it binds to the S12 protein of the 30S subunit on the ribosome and inhibits translation and can cause misreading of mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref001">1</xref>]. However, it is not clear how streptomycin, or its more potent derivative, dihydrostreptomycin (DHS), gets into the cell. With a diameter of about 10 Å and a net charge of 3<sup>+</sup>, DHS is not an obvious candidate for easily crossing a biological membrane. Interestingly, upon treatment with the drug, an outward flux of K<sup>+</sup> from the cell has been observed prior to any decrease in cell viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref002">2</xref>], suggesting either the opening of a channel or some sort of loss of cell membrane integrity.</p>
<p>MscL is a bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance that responds directly to tension in the membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref006">6</xref>]. It serves as a biological “emergency release valve” that allows a rapid loss of solutes and osmoprotectants, including K<sup>+</sup> and glutamate, in response to a sudden decrease in osmolality in the bacterial environment, thus protecting the cell from lysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref007">7</xref>]. Under very special conditions and mutagenesis, small ions have also been shown to be able to pass through the channel into the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref008">8</xref>]. The crystal structure for the MscL homolog from <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mt-MscL) has been solved by the Rees group revealing a homopentameric channel with each subunit having two transmembrane domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref010">10</xref>]. The first transmembrane domain (TM1) forms the pore and is linked to the second transmembrane domain (TM2), which is in contact with the lipid bilayer, via a periplasmic loop that is not as conserved as the rest of the protein. The N-terminal domain is a helix that runs parallel to the cytoplasmic membrane; the C-terminal forms a cytoplasmic helical bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002473.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Biochemical, structural-functional, and molecular dynamics (MD) studies have all been used to study the channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref006">6</xref>]. In sum, much of the data has suggested that TM1 must undergo a large clockwise (&gt;100°) rotation with both transmembranes tilting into the lipid bilayer to open the large 30 Å pore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref011">11</xref>] in the channel. The inappropriate opening of such a large pore would be predicted to have negative physiological consequences; indeed, genetic analysis has shown that mutations in key areas of the MscL protein, including the pore, can lead to a MscL channel that gates more easily and, when expressed in vivo, is detrimental to bacterial growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref013">13</xref>].</p>

<p>In a previous study, we used a high-throughput screen in search of compounds that would target the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> MscL (Ec-MscL), increase its activity, and thus inhibit bacterial growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref014">14</xref>]. Surprisingly, one of the positive hits was DHS. Subsequent studies demonstrated that Ec-MscL, as well as MscL orthologues from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, when expressed in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, increased the potency of DHS relative to cells that were null for the protein. In addition, we found that MscL expression was required for the DHS-dependent K<sup>+</sup> flux observed prior to decreased cell viability. However, from the data, it remained unclear if MscL directly or indirectly influenced MscL function, if DHS uses the large MscL pore as a pathway to enter the cell, and if DHS can modify the MscL channel in streptomycin-resistant cells.</p>
<p>MD simulations of biomolecules provide a detailed view of structure and dynamics that complement experiments. Increased conformational sampling, enabled by new algorithms and growth in computer power, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref016">16</xref>] now allows a much broader range of events to be observed, providing critical insights, largely inaccessible to experiments. MD simulation of MscL has been used to investigate how the lipid composition affects the structures and dynamics of Mt-MscL, particularly the charge-rich segment RKKEEP located several amino acid distal to the end of TM2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref017">17</xref>]. The gating mechanisms have been extensively studied by MD simulations for both Mt-MscL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref019">19</xref>] and Ec-MscL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref020">20</xref>]. All of the MD studies suggest that the interplay between membrane and protein plays a key role in the opening and closing events of the MscL channel. However, because of a lack of specific agonists and antagonists, MD simulations have not before been used to determine how small biomolecules influence the MscL structure or determine if or how they can pass through the MscL channel.</p>
<p>Here, we use a combination of genetic screening, biochemical and mutational approaches, computational analyses, MD simulations, and in vivo assays to determine if DHS’ effects on the MscL channel are direct. Our data strongly suggest that DHS directly binds to a specific location in the channel pore and modifies the channel conformation in such a way as to allow the passage of K<sup>+</sup> and glutamate out of, and DHS into, the cell.</p>

<title>A Cysteine Library Screen Reveals a Possible Binding Area for DHS</title>
<p>Under the hypothesis that mutations in MscL that disrupt DHS binding to the channel could lead to increased bacterial growth in the presence of DHS, we designed a 96-well plate screen utilizing a cysteine-scan library previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref022">22</xref>]. Briefly, we screened mutations S2C-E107C, omitting strong gain of function (GOF) mutations because of their slowed growth phenotype, and loss of function (LOF) mutations because of their inability to gate upon normal stimuli. The concentration of DHS used, 6.25 μM, was optimized to be just subthreshold for bacteria expressing the wild type Ec-MscL in order to enhance the sensitivity of the assay. At this concentration, growth of cultures expressing the wild type MscL channel was inhibited, on average, by 50%. Positive results were defined as yielding at least a 50% increased growth over cultures expressing wild type MscL in three independent experiments. Only two cysteine mutants were consistently positive by these criteria in all three experiments: L19C and I25C. When highlighted on a model for the structure of the Ec-MscL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref023">23</xref>], which is based on the Mt-MscL crystal structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref010">10</xref>], these residues lie in the constriction point of the pore of the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002473.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Although these residues are not adjacent, one must appreciate that different residues can be exposed because of the twisting of TM1 upon channel opening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref024">24</xref>], and asymmetry has been predicted by several experiments in the opening of the channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref026">26</xref>]; thus, these residues may contribute to not just a single but perhaps an evolving binding pocket for a large chemical such as DHS. Previous studies have demonstrated that mutations and post-translational changes in this region can influence channel sensitivity to membrane tension; hydrophilic substitutions and charges within this region make the channel easier to gate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref021">21</xref>]. Hence, it is conceivable that the multicharged (3<sup>+</sup>) DHS, when bound within the pore, could also increase MscL sensitivity.</p>

<title>MTS-PEG5000 Competition Experiments Support the Cysteine Library Screen Results</title>
<p>Although the screening data, above, are suggestive that these residues participate in DHS binding and mode of action, we sought additional biochemical support. Because cysteine residues can react with sulfhydryl reagents, they can be modified by methanosulfonate (MTS) reagents. MTS-PEG5000 potentially gives us the ability to have site-directed PEGylation of any of our cysteine library residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref027">27</xref>]. If the cysteine mutation lies within the DHS binding site but does not fundamentally alter it, then high concentrations of this antibiotic should compete for MTS-PEG5000 binding. Because of its large size, the PEGylated proteins can then be separated from non-PEGylated ones by SDS-PAGE; any potential inhibition of this PEG modification by DHS competition can easily be assessed. Thus, we performed such an experiment on purified L19C and I25C Ec-MscL mutated channels. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002473.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, in both instances, DHS at concentrations greater than 500 μM appeared to compete with MTS-PEG5000. In contrast, a MscL channel with a cysteine mutation in the periplasmic loop region of the protein, L47C, an area that is not expected to interact with DHS, still showed a gel shift due to PEGylation, but this shift was not inhibited by DHS even at high concentrations (1 mM). (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002473.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Finally, wild type MscL, which contains no endogenous cysteines, showed no apparent increase of mass attributed to PEGylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002473.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). This competition was specific to DHS since another aminoglycoside antibiotic, spectinomycin, at concentrations up to 10 mM showed no decrease in the PEGylation band (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002473.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). Thus, it appears that higher concentrations of DHS, but not spectinomycin, can block the binding of MTS-PEG5000 to the cysteines located at L19 and I25 within the Ec-MscL.</p>

<title>Variation between Ec-MscL, a MscL Orthologue, and Appropriate Substitutions in Each, Further Support the Hypothesis That L19 Contributes to DHS Binding and Mechanism of Action</title>
<p>If L19 and I25 contribute to DHS binding and mode of action, then one might expect that variations at these sites between orthologues could lead to differences in DHS sensitivity. Both of these residues are highly conserved. In assessing the cases in which differences in residues are seen at these sites, we noted that for the analogous L19 site, the vast majority of orthologues contained the canonical L, with only a small minority containing an M at this location. The <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> orthologue (Hi-MscL), which has been functionally characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref028">28</xref>], was one orthologue within this minority. <italic>H</italic>. <italic>influenzae</italic> is, like <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, gram-negative, and Hi-MscL is very homologous to the Ec-MscL channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002473.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Growth for Ec-MscL, Hi-MscL, and mutated channels was measured in the presence and absence of 6.25 μM DHS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002473.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Interestingly, while cells expressing Ec-MscL, which contains the L at position 19, showed a 30% decrease in growth due to DHS, cells expressing wild type Hi-MscL, which has an M at this position, showed only a 16% decrease. If L19 truly contributes to DHS binding and action, then mutating it to an M in Ec-MscL should decrease the DHS sensitivity of cells expressing this mutated channel. Indeed, L19M Ec-MscL expressing cells showed only a 6% decrease in growth in the presence of DHS. Even more significant was the observation that when M19 of Hi-MscL is changed to L, a “super sensitive” channel is formed; cells expressing this mutated channel show a substantial 51% decrease in cell growth.</p>

<p>One trivial explanation for these data could be that the orthologues and mutated channels had different sensitivities to membrane tension and thus were more or less likely to be modified by DHS. Hence, these mutated and WT Hi-MscL channels were assayed by both patch clamp and in an in vivo hypo-osmotic down shock assay to assess their function. If the higher sensitivity of Ec-MscL to DHS was due to increased channel sensitivity to membrane tension, then one would expect it to be more sensitive than Hi-MscL; however, the opposite was observed in patch clamp, and no differences were noted between the wild type channels and their respective mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002473.s003">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>). In addition, all channels were shown to be functional in vivo (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002473.s003">S2C Fig</xref>), increasing the viability of osmotically fragile cells from osmotic lysis (survival close to 80%, although at 74%, the L19M Ec-MscL-expressing cells were close to, but statistically less than, the 80% for wild-type Ec-MscL; LOF mutants are usually defined as a 50% decrease in viability compared to wild type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>Presumably, these data translate to the concentration at which DHS modifies the channel. To more directly test this, we used MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref030">30</xref>]. In initial experiments using this approach, we found the affinity for the wild type Ec-MscL was relatively weak (Kd = 9.81 mM). On the assumption that large conformational changes are affecting the signal, and wild-type MscL may be somewhat resistant to such large changes when solubilized, we used the more sensitive mutant K55T, which has a sensitivity identical to that of the Hi-MscL M19L mutant (in these mechanosensitivity experiments, MscS is used as an internal standard and thresholds measured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref032">32</xref>]; MscL/MscS threshold ratios of 1.11 ± 0.05 where <italic>n</italic> = 5 and 1.10 ± 0.04, where <italic>n</italic> = 10 were determined for Ec-MscL K55T and Hi-MscL M19L, respectively). Indeed, using MTS, the K55T Ec-MscL gave a better apparent affinity, relative to the wild type channel, of 680 μM. Note that this binding affinity to DHS, which was performed on solubilized protein, is in the approximate range of those observed in our MTS-PEG5000 inhibition assays, which have also been performed on solubilized channels. Consistent with our interpretation that lower concentrations of DHS effect significant changes on the M19L Hi-MscL, this channel gave an even better apparent affinity of 50 μM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002473.s004">S3 Fig</xref>). As expected, no affinity could be measured for the unrelated compound isoniazid, which was used as a negative control.</p>
<p>Together, these data derived from the Hi- and Ec-MscL orthologues, and complementary mutations, strongly support the notion that L19 contributes to DHS binding and modulation of the MscL protein.</p>

<title>MD Simulations of Ec-MscL</title>
<p>To determine the conformational changes in MscL that may occur upon interactions with DHS, we performed MD simulations. The starting structure for all MD simulations is a homology model based on the crystal structure of Mt-MscL resolved at 3.5 Å. The details on homology modeling, system setup, molecular docking, and MD simulation protocols are provided in the Materials and Methods. First, 240 nanoseconds MD simulation was carried out for the homology model in a simulation box consisting of 230 POPC lipids, 95 KCl and 32368 water molecules. The overall root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) of α-carbon, about 3.6 Å compared to the crystal structure, are quite reasonable (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and Methods</xref>). The last snapshot of the MD trajectory was selected as a representative conformation for the following DHS molecular docking study.</p>
<p>The first step of a molecular docking study is to identify possible binding sites. Three possible binding sites were discovered by the SiteID module of SYBYL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref033">33</xref>] and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002473.g003">Fig 3A</xref>. GLIDE (Grid-based Ligand Docking with Energetics) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref034">34</xref>] docking was then performed for DHS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002473.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) at each binding site. The best docking score, −7.46 kcal/mol, was achieved for the magenta pocket formed by ten amino acid residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002473.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). No meaningful docking pose was discovered at the cyan and green binding pockets.</p>

<title>Docking studies representing how DHS binds to the closed conformation of Ec-MscL.</title>
<p>(A) Three binding sites identified by SiteID using the last snapshot of the ligand-free MD simulation. The green binding site is located inside of the channel formed by 19 C-terminal helical residues from monomer 1: L122, I125, L129, Q132, N133; monomer 2: L258 (L122), L265 (L129); monomer 3: L401 (L129), Q404 (Q132), N405 (N133); monomer 4: L530 (L122), I533 (I125), L536 (L128), Q540 (Q132); monomer 5: L666 (L122), I669 (I125), L672 (L128), L673 (L129), Q676(Q132)). If a binding site residue does not belong to the first monomer, then the corresponding residue ID of the first monomer is provided in the followed parenthesis. The magenta binding site has a smooth deep pocket formed by residues from monomer 2: V153 (V17), V157 (V21); monomer 3: D290 (D18), V293 (V21), G294 (G22), I297 (I25); monomer 4: A497 (A89), I500 (I92), F501 (F93), and K505 (K97). The cyan binding pocket is the smallest in term of volume of the cavity and formed by Residues from monomer 1: F10; monomer 2: D154 (D18), G158 (G22), I161 (I25); monomer 3: A361 (A89), I364 (I92), F365 (F93), I368 (I96), and K369 (K97).

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002473.g003">Fig 3D</xref>, two hydrogen bonds are formed between DHS and the surrounding residues. One guanidinium functional group of DHS forms a salt bridge with monomer 3: D290 (D18). Also, monomer 3: I297 (I25) is a magenta binding pocket residue, and monomer 3 L291 (L19), in magenta ball and stick representation, has a very close contact with DHS and several binding pockets residues, even though itself is not recognized by SiteID as binding pocket residue. These latter findings are consistent with the experimental finding that DHS is a competitor of binding MTSPEG5000 to cysteine at L19C and I25C.</p>
<p>We previously speculated that DHS could pass through the MscL channel if the channel partially or fully opened [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref014">14</xref>]. We therefore tested if DHS could be seen to pass through the channel using MD simulations. First, DHS was manually placed in the center of the Ec-MscL pore with ten different orientations. For each docking orientation, 50 nanosecond MD simulation was first performed with the secondary structure domains (TM1, TM2, S1 and C-terminal helix) and lipids strongly restrained followed by another 100 nanosecond regular MD simulation without any restraint.</p>
<p>In order to observe the passages of DHS through the Ec-MscL channel within a short timeframe for MD simulations, an external electric field (EEF) was applied to DHS to accelerate the process. Indeed, a previous study has found that increased membrane potentials in vivo increase the potency of DHS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref035">35</xref>]. Note that the experiment was designed so that only the DHS molecule felt this field. Only the best docking orientation, which was recognized according to both the global and ensemble conformational energies sampled by the 100-nanosecond MD simulations, was selected for the subsequent MD simulations with EEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002473.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). With the EEF strength being set to 0.2 volt/Å along the Z-axis, we observed the complete procedure of the passing-through event within 12 nanoseconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002473.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). These data have been repeated a total of five times (twice where the Cl<sup>-</sup> molecules were set to balance the positive charges), all with consistent results with the passage of DHS through the MscL channel. The modified pore is more than accommodating for DHS, which does not have to dehydrate for passage; in fact, DHS is surrounded by tens to hundreds of water molecules when it passes through the channel. A video of the passing-through event is provided as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002473.s017">S1 Video</xref>.</p>

<p>We defined a parameter, ΔZ, the Z-coordinate difference of two geometric centers formed by DHS and five LYS residues located at the end of TM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002473.g004">Fig 4</xref>), to describe the passing through event. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002473.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, DHS passed through Ec-EscL four times, and the last three took a much shorter time since the channel had already changed conformation. It is also clear that there is a long time period (about 8 nanoseconds) that DHS stayed in an intermediate state with a characteristic ΔZ value of 25 Å.</p>
<p>We further characterized the passing-through event by calculating the MM-PB energies of all the collected MD snapshots. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002473.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, the intermediate state has favorable MM-PB energies consistent with the fact that DHS stays in the middle of the channel for about half of the time of the simulation. The methods and computational details on PB calculations are presented in the Materials and Methods. Moreover, we calculated the displacements of K<sup>+</sup> during the passing-through event. The average displacements along Z-axis of 95 K<sup>+</sup>, about 6 Å towards the outside of the membrane was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002473.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). This means that the channel is more open and, although there is no electric field on the ion, it begins to migrate in the direction it would need to flow for efflux from the cell. This finding is consistent with the observation of K<sup>+</sup> efflux in in vivo experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>The whole procedure can be roughly divided into five stages according to the residence time and the MM-PB energies: (I) initial stage (0.72 nanoseconds), (II) fast transition stage (0.4 nanoseconds), (III) transition stage (8.8 nanoseconds), (IV) pre-exiting stage (0.76 nanoseconds), and (V) exiting stage (0.36 nanoseconds). The representative conformations of the five stages are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002473.g004">Fig 4E</xref>. From Stage I to V, DHS moved from the MscL pore to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane progressively. How each secondary structure units (transmembrane domains TM1 and TM2, N-terminal S1 and C-terminal helix) fluctuate along the MD simulation trajectory is discussed further in the Materials and Methods. Interestingly, the RMSDs of the two transmembrane domains and S1 increased slowly from the initial stage to the intermediate state stage and then the final stages; on the contrary, the C-terminal domain has a dramatic RMSDs surge at the final stages (Stages VI and V) to accommodate DHS exiting from the channel.</p>
<p>The RMSDs of the five representative conformations are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002473.s015">S1 Table</xref>. Moreover, we also quantitatively characterized the helical rotation during the MscL channel gating induced by the DHS passing-through event. The axis angles calculated from rotational matrices of least-squares fittings were listed in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002473.s016">S2 Table</xref> for the five representative conformations; they are divided by the S1 helices (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002473.s016">S2A Table</xref>), TM1 helices (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002473.s016">S2B Table</xref>), TM2 helices (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002473.s016">S2C Table</xref>), and C-terminal helices (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002473.s016">S2D Table</xref>). Compared to the closed conformation, the first TM1 helix rotates in a corkscrew manner (clockwise as seen from the periplasm) from 10.5° in Stage I to 16.3° in Stage III and 27.5° in Stage V. Large movements also were observed for the C-terminal helical bundle, which largely moved as a unit: the rotational axis angles increased about 10 to 15° for four of the five helices from Stage I to Stage V, although the final exiting stage contributes the most changes.</p>
<p>Key residues that directly interact with DHS were identified for representative conformations of the five stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002473.g005">Fig 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002473.s005">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002473.s006">S5</xref> Figs). The conformations of DHS in the five stages are similar, particularly for Stages I-III. DHS adopts a prolonged conformation to facilitate its exit from the channel in Stages IV and V (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002473.s007">S6 Fig</xref>). We then characterized the MscL channel by calculating the pore radii along the channel coordinate. The “W” shape plot in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002473.s008">S7 Fig</xref> suggests that there are two bottlenecks (around -50 and -10 Å) and the latter is narrower and needs more time for opening. This result is consistent with our MD result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002473.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). This plot also suggests that the passage of small molecule like DHS does not lead to a fully open Ec-MscL channel.</p>

<title>MD Snapshots Predict Additional Sites for DHS Binding and Interactions</title>
<p>The MD simulation experiments have made predictions of points of interaction between DHS and the MscL protein. Using both the magenta binding site from SiteID as well as several representative snapshots selected from the MD simulation of DHS passing through Ec-MscL channel, ten residues in MscL were predicted to participate in this interaction: V16, V17, D18C, L19, A20, A114, P115, T116, K117, and E118 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002473.g005">Fig 5</xref>).

We chose two residues reflecting the two distinct domains proposed to interact with DHS (A20C, and E118C) As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002473.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, each is positive, as predicted, suggesting they are indeed involved in DHS binding and interactions; the remaining eight residues were also found to be positive and are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002473.s009">S8 Fig</xref>.</p>

<p>In addition, we have tested five residues in the area predicted NOT to interact with DHS, N103, K105, K106, A110, and D127. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002473.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, we show two of the more distant residues, K105C and D127C, and neither showed inhibition of the PEGylation in the presence of DHS. Shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002473.s009">S8 Fig</xref> are the additional mutated channels; K106C and A110C were negative as predicted, but N103C was positive. This latter finding may be explained by a previously defined conformational change of the protein that makes this site inaccessible as the channel opens; we found that this residue becomes buried within the lipid bilayer upon gating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref036">36</xref>]. The evidence that N103 becomes buried within lipids includes phenotypes, including channel sensitivities, obtained after residue modifications designed to embed the residue in the membrane or stabilize it at the membrane interface. In addition, the residue was mutated to tryptophan, and the amount of fluorescence quenching by brominated lipids was measured upon channel gating. All of the data supported a model in which this site becomes buried within the lipids in an early transition state as the channel opens. Assuming this to be the case, it is therefore not surprising that the site is not PEGylated when in the presence of DHS; the DHS is opening the channel and thus burying the 103 site and preventing modification. Given this background, we decided to evaluate the contact numbers for N103 interacting with lipid hydrophobic sites within the MD simulations. The average contact numbers for N103 are 2.52, 4.03, 3.38, 3.30, and 2.42 for the five conformational stages defined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002473.g004">Fig 4</xref>. In contrast, the average contact number is only 0.01 for the closed conformation. It is noted that the fast transition stage and the transition state stage have the largest and the second largest contact numbers, and the contact numbers decrease gradually once DHS begins passing through the channel. This MD result suggests that N103 can regulate Ec-MscL gating by increasing or decreasing the lipid exposure; these data are entirely consistent with previous experimental data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref036">36</xref>]. It therefore seems likely that upon interacting with DHS, the channel undergoes a conformational change that buries this residue within a hydrophobic pocket making it inaccessible for MTS-PEG5000 modification.</p>

<title>DHS Modifies the MscL Channel Even in DHS-Resistant Strains: MscL-Dependent Glutamate Fluxes in DHS-Resistant Cell Lines</title>
<p>We previously demonstrated that MscL expression changes the potency of DHS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref014">14</xref>]. The finding that increasing the concentration of DHS still leads to decreased viability in sensitive cells suggested MscL is not the only pathway into the cytoplasm, thus explaining why the <italic>mscL</italic> gene has never been identified in streptomycin suppressor assays. In addition, there is no obvious slowed-growth or decreased-viability phenotype for DHS-resistant strains when in the presence of DHS, demonstrating, not surprisingly, that MscL is not the primary mode of action of the drug. However, we have previously shown that upon treatment with DHS, there is a MscL-dependent flux of both K<sup>+</sup> and glutamate in bacteria that were sensitive to streptomycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref014">14</xref>], strongly suggesting that the DHS-dependent flux of these osmolytes is due to MscL activation. This begs the question: can we measure subtler MscL- and DHS-dependent physiological phenotypes in DHS-resistant cells using flux assays? Thus far, we have not seen a K<sup>+</sup> flux in DHS-resistant <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strains. There may be two explanations for this. First, there may be other factors playing a role in the perceived K<sup>+</sup> flux; indeed, one interpretation of a previous study was that misfolded and truncated transmembrane proteins may intercalate into the bilayer and compromise membrane integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref037">37</xref>]. It is possible that this compromising of the membrane is not direct, but in fact the aberrant proteins add tension in the membrane and increase MscL sensitivity to DHS. Under this scenario, MscL-dependent fluxes would only be seen in DHS-sensitive cells. However, a second explanation is that the many high-affinity K<sup>+</sup> pumps largely compensate for fluxes in DHS-resistant cells, which are presumably healthier than DHS-sensitive cells upon DHS treatment. Note that these two explanations are not mutually exclusive and both may play a role. To avoid the latter complication of compensatory mechanisms, we assayed for glutamate, which is accumulated largely through synthesis rather than being pumped into the cell by high-affinity pumps; i.e., fluxed glutamate should not be rapidly taken back into the cell. We used two independent DHS-resistant cell lines from different parental strains that are MscL deficient: MJF367 and PB104 from Frag 1 and AW405 parental strains, respectively. As expected, upon DHS treatment there was no significant loss of glutamate from cells expressing empty plasmid in either of the cell lines (98.1% of the glutamate remained in the cells for MJF367 and 99.2% for PB104’s; <italic>t</italic> test <italic>p</italic>-values &gt;0.1 and <italic>n</italic> = 3 for both). However, the amount of glutamate remaining in the MJF367 cell line expressing MscL was 78.5%, and PB104’s was 83.7%. Both of these values, while not as great as the 52% loss seen in streptomycin-sensitive cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref014">14</xref>], were significantly different from empty plasmid (<italic>p</italic>-values &lt;0.005 for MJF367 and &lt; .05 for PB104’s; <italic>n</italic> = 3 for each). Viability experiments were also performed in conjunction with the glutamate experiments, and no significant loss in viability was seen for any strain under any condition. Thus, a modest but statistically significant DHS- and MscL-dependent glutamate flux can be measured in DHS-resistant cells independent of a decreased viability, strongly suggesting that DHS can influence MscL gating independent of DHS toxicity.</p>
<p>Together, the data support the direct binding of DHS to a specific site within the MscL channel and its ability to modify MscL such that DHS can pass through the channel into the cytoplasm of the cell. These changes apparently occur in both streptomycin-sensitive as well as streptomycin-resistant cells but may be amplified in the latter due to a previously suggested increase of abnormal membrane proteins adding tension in the membrane and thus increasing the sensitivity of MscL.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Early in the study of the MscL channel, a forward genetics study found that mutations in the channel could lead to cell slowed growth or even death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref013">13</xref>]. Briefly, the channel was randomly mutagenized, placed under transcriptional control of the inducible LacUV5 promoter, plated, then replica plated onto plates containing IPTG, which induced expression. Colonies that grew less or failed to grow on the IPTG-containing plates were further studied. In sum, the data demonstrated that mutations at several locations, including what is now known to be the pore constriction site, led to channels that were more sensitive to membrane tension as assayed by patch clamp and, when expressed, lead to the decreased growth or viability observed.</p>
<p>On the assumption that small chemical compounds may also be able to make the channel more sensitive, and thus may lead to the development of channel agonists and potential antimicrobial agents, we developed a high-throughput screen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref014">14</xref>]. Because MscL senses membrane tension, any compound that intercalates into the membrane could lead to a more sensitive channel; indeed, amphipaths have previously been shown to gate mechanosensitive channels including MscL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref039">39</xref>]. Hence, in the secondary screen we tested the compounds on cells expressing only <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> MscS, a member of an unrelated second family of bacterial tension-sensing mechanosensitive channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref007">7</xref>]. Surprisingly, four known antibiotics were identified in the screen: DHS, spectinomycin, viomycin, and nifuroxazide. Of the four, DHS appeared to be the most specific and potent and therefore further characterized. We found that MscL expression was required for the DHS-dependent K<sup>+</sup> efflux observed prior to a decrease in cell viability. Further, we demonstrated that a DHS-dependent flux of another, larger osmoprotectant fluxed by MscL, glutamate, was also observed on the same time scale and also found to be MscL dependent; here, we demonstrate that some glutamate flux can even be measured in DHS-resistant cells in a MscL-dependent manner. Moreover, MscL channel activity increased in response to DHS as assayed by patch clamp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref014">14</xref>]. This latter finding was originally generated using the mutated channel used in the initial screen; not surprisingly, this finding holds true for the wild type <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> MscL channel using an electrode back-fill approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref040">40</xref>], as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002473.s010">S9 Fig</xref>. However, obvious questions remained: Was DHS directly binding to and modifying the MscL channel? If so, where is this binding site located? And is MscL one conduit for passage of the large bulky DHS molecule into the cell cytoplasm? Here, we present several lines of evidence that DHS binds to the MscL pore, including an in vivo screen of over 90 mutated channels, a MTS-PEG5000 competition assay, analysis of an orthologue with variability within the predicted binding site (including mutagenesis of the site), and MD simulations. The latter showed DHS modifying the channel and passing through it. Finally, the MD simulations made predictions of residues that interact with DHS upon this modification and passage; these predictions were tested by the MTS-PEG5000 competition assay and shown to be true. The most likely binding site using the channel-closed conformation (predicted by SideID, which is in magenta in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002473.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) is relatively stable during DHS passing through the Ec-MscL channel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002473.s011">S10 Fig</xref>) as well as the binding cavity volumes predicted by the SiteID software. How DHS binding to this site affects the passage of DHS through the channel is an interesting topic and will be pursued in future study.</p>
<p>Current models for the open structure of the channel suggest that TM1 corkscrews early in the gating process about 110° in the membrane in a clockwise direction when viewed from the periplasm, then the transmembranes tilt in the membrane and separate like the iris of a camera, opening a large pore approximately 30Å in diameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref006">6</xref>]. Many of the initial structural changes have been supported by recent crystal structures of the archaeal MscL homolog from <italic>Methanosarcina acetivorans</italic> trapped in both the closed and closed-expanded intermediate states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref041">41</xref>]. The MD simulations of MscL in the presence of DHS do not show full channel opening. Perhaps it is the short time scale of the simulations, but it may also be that additional in vivo environmental factors including ambient membrane tension resulting from the predicted high cell turgor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref042">42</xref>], or the electric field, predicted to be about −140 mV across the bacterial membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref044">44</xref>], play a role in the sensitivity of the channel to DHS modulation. Regardless, many of the changes observed in our simulations are consistent with an opening channel. For example, the corkscrewing (up to 27.5°) of TM1 is observed in the simulations, as well as a separation of the helices around the pore/vestibule. Potassium, an osmoprotectant that normally can flux through the open channel, even though not under an electrochemical gradient, is observed to move into the channel vestibule; this is also consistent with the DHS-dependent K<sup>+</sup> flux observed prior to decreased cell viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref014">14</xref>]. The observation that the C-terminal helical bundle moves as a unit, remains intact, and the DHS passes asymmetrically through the linkers between TM2 and the C-terminal helical bundle is also expected, because several studies suggest that the bundle is quite stable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref046">46</xref>] and remains intact upon gating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref047">47</xref>]. Finally, the cytoplasmic residue N103 has been predicted to insert into, then out of, the membrane in a piston-like fashion upon gating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref036">36</xref>]; this is also observed in the MD simulations and is a likely explanation of why this residue gives an apparently false positive in the MTS-PEG5000 competition assay. In sum, although a full opening of the MscL channel is not observed, many of the conformational changes observed are consistent with the initial movements toward a fully open channel.</p>
<p>The finding that DHS binds the pore vestibule is, in hindsight, not surprising. The random mutagenesis study discussed above found that many mutations within this region leads to increased channel sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref013">13</xref>]. In addition, it appeared that increasing hydrophilicity or adding charges in the pore/vestibule domain leads to inappropriate channel activity and compromised cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref024">24</xref>]. These findings, in conjunction with the crystal structure of the Mt-MscL, led us to propose the “hydrophobic lock” hypothesis, which states that it is the transient exposure of hydrophobic residues within the pore to an aqueous environment that is the major energy barrier for channel opening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref048">48</xref>]. Interestingly, DHS interactions appear to be at the interface of two subunits within the pore vestibule. This is reminiscent of the acetylcholine binding site of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref050">50</xref>]; presumably, changes in protein—protein interactions at subunit interface induced by ligand binding can more easily lead to changes in global conformation, and thus channel gating. Indeed, part of the MscL binding pocket is predicted to contain residues from a neighboring TM2 domain. We have previously studied this region of the protein, both the S1 domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref051">51</xref>], as well as the cytoplasmic portion of TM2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref052">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref053">53</xref>], and even the changes in interactions that occur between these domains upon channel gating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref054">54</xref>]. These previous studies have found this region to be highly dynamic and undergo large conformational changes upon gating. In sum, the data indicate that DHS binds to and modifies what could be referred to as the gate of the channel, i.e., the subunit interface at the most constricted portion of the pore, thus leading to a conformational change that allows the efflux of osmoprotectants and the passage of DHS into the cytoplasm.</p>

Samples were then vortexed, spun down, and incubated again for 10 min in a 22°C PCR block. Reactions were stopped by adding 20 μl of nonreducing sample buffer with 10 mM Iodoacidamide for a final concentration of 5 mM. Samples were immediately loaded and ran on a 4%–20%, or any KD, Criterion 18-well gel. Standard western blot was performed with the primary antibody Penta.His (Qiagen) diluted to 1:4,000 in blocking buffer. The secondary antibody goat anti-mouse HRP (Bio-Rad) was used at 1:70,000 diluted in blocking buffer. Blots were developed with Immobilon HRP substrate (Millipore) and exposed to film. Experiments were repeated at least three times for each construct.</p>

<title>MD simulations</title>
<p>All MD simulations were performed with periodic boundary condition to produce isothermal-isobaric ensembles using the modified PMEMD.CUDA program in AMBER 12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref063">63</xref>]. The Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref067">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref069">69</xref>] was used to calculate the full electrostatic energy of a unit cell in a macroscopic lattice of repeating images. All bonds were constrained using the SHAKE algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref070">70</xref>] in MD simulations. Temperature was regulated using the Langevin dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref071">71</xref>] with the collision frequency of 5 ps<sup>-1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref072">72</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref074">74</xref>]. Pressure was regulated using the isotropic position scaling algorithm with the pressure relaxation time set to 1.0 picosecond. The integration of the equations of motion was conducted at a time step of 1 femtosecond for the relaxation and equilibrium phases and 2 femtoseconds for the sampling phases.</p>
<p>Prior to MD simulations, the systems were relaxed to remove any possible steric crashes by a set of 10 thousand-step minimizations with the main chain atoms restrained. The harmonic restraint force constants decreased from 20 to 10, 5, and 1 kcal/mol/ Å<sup>2</sup>, progressively. At last, the systems were further relaxed by a 10,000-step minimization without any constraint or restraint.</p>
<p>There are three phases in a typical MD simulation, namely, the relaxation phase, the equilibrium phase, and the sampling phase. In the relaxation phase, the main chain atoms were gradually relaxed by applying a series of restraints, and the force constants decreased progressively: from 20 to 15, 10, 5, 2 and 1 kcal/mol/Å<sup>2</sup>. For each force constant, the position-restrained MD simulation was run for 1 nanosecond. In the following equilibrium phase, the system was further equilibrated for 6 nanoseconds without any restraint and constraint. In the sampling phase, snapshots were saved at an interval of 4 picoseconds for postanalysis. The postanalysis was conducted using the PTRAJ module of AMBER12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref063">63</xref>]. Special cases are presented below.</p>
<p>In order to study how DHS passes through the Ec-MscL channel, we first performed manual docking to get the starting points for MD simulation. For each docking orientation, a 50 nanoseconds, MD simulation was performed with secondary structure domains (TM1, TM2, S1, and C-terminal helix) and lipids restrained with a high harmonic force (force constant = 50 kcal/mol/Å<sup>2</sup>). Then, a 100 nanosecond MD simulation was carried out without any constraint or restraint.</p>
<p>In order to observe the DHS passing thought Ec-MscL event in a short time scale MD simulation, an EEF was applied to the DHS. Different EEF strengths, from 0.01 to 0.2 volt/Å were tested. With the EEF strength being set to 0.2 volt/Å along the Z-axis, we observed the complete procedure of the pass-through event within 10 nanoseconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002473.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). However, we couldn’t observe the whole passing through procedure even at 300 nanoseconds when the EEF strength was reduced to 0.1 volt/Å.</p>
<p>The stability of MD trajectories was demonstrated with the plots of backbone RMSD along the simulation trajectories. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002473.s014">S13 Fig</xref>, the MD trajectories of both ligand-free Ec-MscL and Ec-MscL/DHS are stable after a short period of equilibration. The residues participating least-squares fitting include two transmembrane domains (TM1 and TM2), the N-terminal cytoplasmic helix (S1), and the C-terminal cytoplasmic helix.</p>
<p>To exclude the possibility of DHS passing through the Ec-MscL channel by chance, we repeated the passing-through simulations five times using different random seeds to assign the initial velocities of atoms. We found that all the five simulations are extraordinarily consistent.</p>

<title>MM-PB energy calculation</title>
<p>For an Ec-MscL/DHS complex structure, the MM energy (E<sub>MM</sub>), and the polar part of the solvation-free energy was calculated without any minimization. All energy terms, including the bonded terms, were included in the MM calculations. The polar part of the solvation-free energy, E<sub>PB</sub>, was calculated by solving the finite-difference Possion-Boltzmann equation using AMBER12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref063">63</xref>]. The total MM-PB energy is the sum of E<sub>MM</sub> and E<sub>PB</sub>.</p>
<p>As MscL is a membrane protein, two external dielectric constants, 80 for water and 4 for the membrane were used. The membrane thickness was simply set to 18Å as the average value of 4,000 snapshots was 18.1 ± 0.2 Å. Since the geometric center is not necessarily the center of the membrane, an offset along the Z-axis was applied to shift the center of the finite difference grids. This offset, called mctrdz in AMBER, was calculated for every individual conformation. The nonpolar part of the solvation energy, which is usually called the surface area (SA) term, was not calculated in this study due to the fact the available surface tension parameters were developed mainly for the nonmembrane systems.</p>

<title>Binding site identification</title>
<p>The possible binding sites of DHS to Ec-MscL was identified using the SiteID package implemented in Sybyl-X2.1.1. Only those having cavity volumes larger than 50 Å<sup>3</sup> were kept. Three binding sites satisfy the above criterion for the last snapshot of the ligand-free MD simulation.</p>

<title>Docking protocols</title>
<p>Two types of docking were performed in this study. First of all, we manually placed DHS into the center of the open pore of Ec-MscL. Ten docking poses, which represent ten different orientations of DHS, were prepared for the following MD simulations without EEF. The conformation with the best energy was selected to study the passing-through event.</p>
<p>In the second type of docking, GLIDE of Schrodinger LLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002473.ref034">34</xref>] was applied to dock DHS to the three binding pockets identified by SiteID. The default parameters were used except for the scaling factor of <italic>van der Waals</italic> radii changed from 0.8 to 0.76 in order to slightly weaken the strong unfavorable repulsion between the ligand and receptor. Meaningful GLIDE scores were obtained only for the magenta binding site in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002473.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, and the best GLIDE score is −7.46 kcal/mol. No meaningful docking score was resulted for the cyan and green docking poses.</p>

<title>Contact number calculation</title>
<p>To understand the role of N103 in the MscL gating, we measured the numbers of lipid hydrophobic residues that have close contact with N103 and its counterparts in other monomers, i.e., N239, N375, N511, and N647. Each POPC lipid consists of three residues, which are PA, PC, and OL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002473.s013">S12 Fig</xref>). PA and OL are hydrophobic residues. A PA or OL residue is recognized to contact with N103 or its counterparts only when the distance of the geometric centers of the lipid residue and N103 or its counterparts are equal to or smaller than a threshold. We have tried several thresholds, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5 and 8.5 Å. The results are similar and only those obtained with the threshold of 6.5 Å were reported.</p>

<title>Competition experiments at additional residues predicted by MD snapshots to interact with DHS.</title>
<p><italic>(A)</italic> Western blot analysis after a competition experiment on the purified protein for residues predicted to interact with DHS, using the cysteine mutations indicated. The absence (−) or presence (+) of 50 μM MTS-PEG5000 (MTS-PEG), as well as the absence (−) or concentration of DHS used, is indicated in the table at the bottom. There is a reduction in upper bands seen in the two higher concentrations of DHS (500 μM and 1 mM), indicating PEG modifications. Note that the upper band of the doublet seen in A114C, T116C, and K117C, which appears to be due to dimer formation of the protein and varies according to proximity of the residues within the complex, can be seen in all samples including mock lanes containing no MTS-PEG5000. <italic>(B)</italic> Western blot analysis after a competition experiment with the purified protein of K106C and A110C, which are predicted to be negative. Upper bands, above the PEG-modified MscL, can be seen for all concentrations of DHS (250 μm–1 mM), indicating a slight dimerization. <italic>(C)</italic> N103C, predicted not to interact with DHS, gives a positive result in this assay. However, as discussed in text, this residue (103) has been shown to become buried within the hydrophobic lipids upon channel gating; thus, this positive result may actually be from an inaccessibility due to a conformational change leading to its burial in a hydrophobic environment, not because it is involved in the binding site.</p>

<title>DHS increases Ec- MscL channel activity as assayed by patch clamp in native membranes.</title>
<p>The activity of Ec-MscL channels was studied in patch clamp experiments using giant spheroplast preparations from the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strain MJF 612, which is null for four mayor bacterial MS channels. (A) Representative traces of a single Ec-MscL patch before (left panel) and after treatment with 100 μM DHS (right panel). For these experiments, a backfilled pipette technique was used, where the tip contains buffer without compound and the rest of the electrode contains buffer with compound. This technique allows the patch to see the drug from the extracellular side only after diffusion of the compound from the electrode to the tip (which normally takes 10 to 20 min). Upper traces show the current with upward deflections reflecting the channel openings; the negative pressures at which the patch was held is shown in the lower portion of the traces. Before and after traces belong to the same patch after incubation for a minimum of 30 min to allow for the diffusion of DHS to the pipette tip. (B) Graphs comparing the NP<sub>o</sub> of Ec-MscL channels at time zero and after at least 30 min in control conditions (no DHS, left panel) or with 100 μM DHS in the pipette (right panel).</p>

<p>(A) ligand-free MD simulation, the reference structure for RMSD calculation is the crystal structure of Mt-MscL (PDB Code 2OAR). (B) MD simulation of DHS passing through the MscL channel without EEF applied. Red curve represents the RMSDs with the crystal structure of Mt-MscL as the reference, while black curve represents the RMSDs with the last snapshot of the ligand-free MD simulation as the reference.

Least-squares fitting with the last snapshot of the ligand-free MD simulation of Ec-MscL as the reference structure was first performed for all the α-carbons of Ec-MscL, and then the RMSDs of secondary structure domains (TM1, TM2, TM1+TM2, S1, and C-terminal helix) were calculated directly without fitting. (D) Similar to (c) except that the reference structure in least-squares fitting is the last snapshot of Ec-MscL/DHS MD simulation without EEF being applied.</p>
