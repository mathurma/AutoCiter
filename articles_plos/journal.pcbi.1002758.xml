      <abstract>
        <p>Genome-scale metabolic networks provide a comprehensive structural framework for modeling genotype-phenotype relationships through flux simulations. The solution space for the metabolic flux state of the cell is typically very large and optimization-based approaches are often necessary for predicting the active metabolic state under specific environmental conditions. The objective function to be used in such optimization algorithms is directly linked with the biological hypothesis underlying the model and therefore it is one of the most relevant parameters for successful modeling. Although linear combination of selected fluxes is widely used for formulating metabolic objective functions, we show that the resulting optimization problem is sensitive towards stoichiometry representation of the metabolic network. This undesirable sensitivity leads to different simulation results when using numerically different but biochemically equivalent stoichiometry representations and thereby makes biological interpretation intrinsically subjective and ambiguous. We hereby propose a new method, Minimization of Metabolites Balance (MiMBl), which decouples the artifacts of stoichiometry representation from the formulation of the desired objective functions, by casting objective functions using metabolite turnovers rather than fluxes. By simulating perturbed metabolic networks, we demonstrate that the use of stoichiometry representation independent algorithms is fundamental for unambiguously linking modeling results with biological interpretation. For example, MiMBl allowed us to expand the scope of metabolic modeling in elucidating the mechanistic basis of several genetic interactions in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>One of the challenging tasks in systems biology is to quantitatively predict the metabolic behavior of the cell under given genetic and environmental constraints. To this end, genome-scale metabolic reconstructions and simulation tools are indispensable. The choice of the objective function to be used for simulating genome-scale metabolic models is dependent on the biological context and one of the most relevant parameters for successful modeling. Formulation of the intended objective function often requires the use of multiple fluxes, e.g. the sum of fluxes through ATP-producing reactions. We demonstrate that the existing tools confound biological interpretation of the simulations due to undesired dependence on the representation of stoichiometry and propose a new tool – Minimization of Metabolites Balance (MiMBl). MiMBl allows casting of the desired biological objective functions into linear optimization models and gives consistent simulation results when using numerically different but biochemically equivalent stoichiometry representations. We demonstrate relevance of MiMBl for addressing biological questions through improved predictions of genetic interactions within the yeast metabolic network. Genetic interactions imply functional relationship between the genes and therefore allow assessing different hypotheses for the underlying biological principles. MiMBl explains several of the genetic interactions as outcome of flux re-routing for minimal metabolite turnover adjustments.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The fundamental role of metabolism within a living cell has become a focal point of study in many disciplines, such as cell biology, physiology, medicine and synthetic biology. The assembly of all reactions and metabolites into a genome-scale metabolic network provides a comprehensive structural framework for integrative data analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002758-Zelezniak1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002758-Szappanos1">[2]</xref>, as well as for quantitative modeling of cellular metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002758-Kmmel1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002758-Osterlund1">[6]</xref>. As the solution space for the metabolic flux state of the cell is typically very large, constraint based optimization approaches are often applied for simulating metabolic fluxes. In essence, these approaches search for an optimal flux distribution that maximizes or minimizes an appropriate biological objective function while satisfying the mass balance and metabolite exchange constraints. Among these, Flux Balance Analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002758-Varma1">[7]</xref> is a widely used simulation tool that utilizes a linear programming formulation for maximization of growth (synthesis of biomass constituents) as biological objective function. FBA has been applied with various degrees of success, albeit mostly for “wild-type” or unperturbed metabolic networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002758-Ibarra1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002758-Famili1">[9]</xref>. In addition to FBA, various other objective functions are frequently used, including minimization of overall intracellular flux and maximization of ATP yield, among others. An overview of various commonly used objective functions and their evaluation against experimental data for <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> can be found in Schuetz <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002758-Schuetz1">[10]</xref>. In case of genetically or environmentally perturbed networks, Minimization of Metabolic Adjustment algorithm - MoMA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002758-Segr1">[11]</xref> - has been reported to better represent the biological observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002758-Segr1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002758-Brochado1">[14]</xref>. The hypothesis underlying MoMA is that fluxes in a perturbed cell (<italic>e.g.</italic> a mutant) will be redistributed so as to be as similar as possible to the wild-type.</p>
      <p>The biological principles exemplified by simulation tools for both wild-type and perturbed networks are undeniably fascinating, which is confirmed by their numerous applications – including prediction of genetic interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002758-Szappanos1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002758-Suthers1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002758-Snitkin1">[16]</xref>, metabolic engineering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002758-Asadollahi1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002758-Brochado1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002758-Alper1">[17]</xref>, microbial community modeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002758-Zomorrodi1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002758-Wintermute1">[19]</xref> and search for evolutionary constraints in relation to different objective functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002758-Schuetz2">[20]</xref>. Several of the objective functions commonly used in these and other applications rely on the use of linear combination of fluxes, e.g., MoMA or minimization of overall intracellular flux (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002758-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). We found that the mathematical formulation of this class of problems (<italic>i.e.</italic> where linear combination of fluxes is part of the objective function) is sensitive to the representation of the reaction stoichiometry, with results strongly dependent on the adopted scaling of the stoichiometric coefficients. Such dependency confounds the biological interpretation of simulation results, as biochemically equivalent alternative representations of the same network can lead to contradictory predictions upon a given genetic or environmental perturbation. For example, the status of a given gene may change from non-essential to essential while using biochemically equivalent representations of the stoichiometry of the metabolic network (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002758.s012">Table S1</xref></bold>). As the stoichiometric representation of any reaction is subjective (often scaled to have coefficient of 1 for one of the reactants/products) and a typical genome-scale modeling problem involves hundreds of reactions, there are infinitely many biochemically equivalent ways to represent a given metabolic network. Any simulation algorithm should therefore be independent of the stoichiometry representation.</p>

As intended, MiMBl shows robust predictions independently of the stoichiometry representation. We demonstrate the biological relevance of the new formulation with increased power for predicting genetic interactions in the metabolic network of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. In a recent study reporting a large genetic interactions dataset covering the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> metabolic network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002758-Szappanos1">[2]</xref>, FBA was found to have limited capability for predicting the experimentally observed interactions, partially due to the lack of regulatory information. Within this study we successfully challenged MiMBl to accomplish the task of extending the range of genetic interactions that can be predicted. By combining the results from MiMBl and FBA, we probe the operating mechanisms underlying genetic interactions within metabolic networks.</p>

      <p>Several of the biological objective functions widely used in metabolic modeling are currently formulated as linear (or quadratic) combination of fluxes. Minimization of sum of intracellular fluxes and minimization of metabolic adjustment belong to this class and are herein used as case studies of biological principles that can be robustly formulated by using MiMBl.

However, in this case, scaling of a single reaction (RPI1) results in diverting the carbon flow from glycolysis to pentose phosphate pathway, which is one of the most important metabolic branch points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002758-g001"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>).

        <p>In order to provide insight into the nature of the problem leading to the susceptibility of the solution towards alternative representation of the stoichiometric matrix, we use a toy-model depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002758-g002"><bold>Fig. 2a</bold></xref>. As a case study, minimization of metabolic adjustment was chosen as biological principle and formulated as minimization of Manhattan distance (a commonly used formulation of MoMA, termed lMoMA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002758-BeckerS1">[25]</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002758-g002"><bold>Fig. 2</bold></xref> also illustrates the representation dependency of the Euclidean distance formulation of MoMA (quadratic MoMA, as originally proposed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002758-Segr1">[11]</xref>). In order to provide an intuitive insight, the following discussion is centered on lMoMA. Similar explanation holds true in quadratic space in the case of quadratic MoMA. In the wild-type toy-model, flux goes from <italic>A</italic> to <italic>D</italic> via <italic>R5</italic>. The goal is to predict flux distribution in the mutant lacking <italic>R5</italic>. The biological principle of minimization of metabolic adjustment dictates rewiring of the flux through <italic>R6</italic>. However, lMoMA found contradictory optimal solutions, <italic>i.e.</italic> solutions that re-route the flux via <italic>R2–R3–R4</italic> or <italic>R6</italic>, depending on the stoichiometric representation of <italic>R6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002758-g002"><bold>Fig. 2b</bold></xref>). Insight into the cause of this behavior can be gained by analyzing the optimal objective function values, <italic>i.e.</italic> distances, as function of θ<italic><sub>R6</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002758-g002"><bold>Fig. 2d</bold></xref>). Smaller θ<italic><sub>R6</sub></italic> implies higher numerical value of the flux through <italic>R6</italic>, hence higher contribution of <italic>R6</italic> to the distance. Consequently, after a certain value of θ<italic><sub>R6</sub></italic>, the activation of the longer <italic>R2–R3–R4</italic> pathway more than compensates the use of <italic>R6</italic>. The two solutions are not alternative optima, as the objective function value neither remains constant nor linearly scales with θ<italic><sub>R6</sub></italic>. Such non-linear dependency of the objective function value on the scalar θ<italic><sub>R6</sub></italic> violates the requirement of a correct problem formulation. Indeed, we analytically demonstrate that the optimality condition for the linear programming problem after scaling is not guaranteed to be satisfied in the case of using sum of fluxes as part of the objective function (<bold><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref></bold>). Notably, widely used FBA-like problems (max/minimization of a single flux) are perfectly robust concerning the scaling of the stoichiometric coefficients. As a single flux is used in the objective function, the relative values of all the remaining fluxes (which depend on the stoichiometry representation) does not influence the optimal solution to be found (for a theoretical proof, see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002758.s017">Text S2</xref></bold>).</p>

        <p>The mathematical caveat illustrated above means that the contribution of the desired biological objective function towards the obtained solution is inseparable from that of the artifacts of stoichiometry representation. Importantly, in large metabolic networks the effects of stoichiometric representation of reactions are cumulative. As we herein show, this problem can be solved by proper normalization of the objective function variables with respect to stoichiometric representation of the reactions. To achieve such normalization, we devised two approaches, normalized lMoMA (normlMoMA) and Minimization of Metabolites Balance (MiMBl). In normlMoMA, each variable in the objective function is normalized by its value in the wild-type flux distribution. Albeit being simple, this normalization method has three major drawbacks: i) many reactions often have null fluxes in the wild-type, thus posing a problem for normalization (<bold><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002758.s017">Text S2</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002758.s003">Fig. S3</xref></bold>); ii) it requires a reference flux distribution to obtain the normalization factors, making it inappropriate to formulate objective functions such as minimization of overall intracellular flux; and iii) the influence of each flux on the metabolic adjustment would be exclusively due to its fold change, not taking into account that reactions carrying higher fluxes could have a stronger impact on the predicted flux distribution, as implied in the original concept of minimization of metabolic adjustment.</p>

        <title>Minimization of Metabolites Balance - MiMBl</title>
        <p>To obtain a biological meaningful and mathematically robust normalization, we propose Minimization of Metabolites Balance (MiMBl) as a new method for metabolic modeling. The objective function in MiMBl is formulated as a linear combination of metabolite turnovers (t<sub>M</sub>). The turnover of a metabolite is the sum of all fluxes producing (or consuming) it, multiplied by the corresponding stoichiometric coefficients (<bold><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref></bold>). The objective function for minimization of metabolic adjustment is reformulated to include metabolite turnovers instead of fluxes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002758-g002"><bold>Fig. 2c</bold></xref>). Because the stoichiometric coefficients are taken into account while calculating t<sub>M</sub>, MiMBl is robust to the linear scaling of the stoichiometric matrix, analytical proof of which is presented in the <bold><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref></bold> section. In case of the toy-model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002758-g002"><bold>Fig. 2a, d</bold></xref>), this robustness is illustrated by the invariant nature of the objective function as well as the flux distribution. Note that the flux through R6 linearly scales with θ<italic><sub>R6</sub></italic>, while the turnover of all metabolites is conserved. The normalization implied in MiMBl formulation is suitable for addressing a variety of biological questions involving different objective functions, such as minimization of overall intracellular flux (by using a null vector for wild-type flux distribution) or maximization of ATP yield (by maximizing the ATP turnover for a given substrate uptake rate), among others (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002758-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>).</p>
        <p>While mapping the flux space into the metabolite space for the objective function formulation, as we do for MiMBl, it is possible that, for a few cases, alternative flux distributions are found around a given metabolite. We therefore introduce a second optimization step that reinforces the proximity to the reference flux distribution. This is achieved by using a normlMoMA routine where the optimal objective function value found in the first MiMBl optimization step is used as an additional constraint (<bold><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref></bold>). Nevertheless, highly connected metabolites ensure a degree of network connectivity, which is sufficient for decreasing the number of situations where alternative flux distributions around the same metabolite are picked by MiMBl. Indeed, we did not find any case in the simulations performed for this study where growth prediction was altered in the second optimization step. An example case where the second optimization step will be more relevant is simulations involving export of metabolites, where the choice of a particular transporter (as in the reference flux distribution) among several alternative options is desired. A more thorough analysis of MiMBl alternative optima in a genome-scale network is presented below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002758-g003"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>).</p>

        <title>Lack of stoichiometric normalization confounds biological interpretation</title>
        <p>In order to estimate the extent to which the lack of normalization of stoichiometric coefficients within the objective function influences the biological interpretation of simulation results, we used lMoMA for simulating gene knockouts in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome-scale metabolic model <italic>i</italic>FF708 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002758-Frster1">[21]</xref>. In case of single gene knockout, three genes were found to change their status from non-essential to essential while using two biochemically equivalent matrix representations (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002758.s012">Table S1</xref></bold>). For instance, the mutant lacking <italic>YCR012W</italic>, coding for a 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (pPGK1), was predicted to be viable when using the <italic>as-published</italic> representation of the stoichiometric matrix S<sub>0</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002758-Frster1">[21]</xref>, and non-viable while using the biochemically equivalent matrix S<sub>1</sub> (<bold><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref></bold>). Based on such contradictory results, conclusions cannot be taken on whether <italic>YCR012W</italic> is predicted to be essential or not. As the number of deleted genes (or other network perturbations) increases, cumulative phenotypic effects related to the functional interactions between the genes are expected to take place and examples as the one mentioned above become even more striking. For triple gene knockouts, more than 200,000 triplets were found such that their predicted phenotype switched from lethal to non-lethal (or vice-versa) for the two biochemically equivalent matrix representations (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002758.s012">Table S1</xref></bold>). From a biotechnological perspective, predictions from genome-scale modeling have direct influence on the choice of gene targets selected for metabolic engineering. By using lMoMA, we identified metabolic engineering strategies (by simulating all possible combinations of knockouts of up to three genes, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002758.s016">Text S1</xref></bold>) for production of two different compounds in yeast: succinate – a native product, and vanillin-glucoside – a heterologous product. Not only a significant fraction of mutants had divergent predictions for product yield when using two biochemically equivalent stoichiometric matrices, but also several highly ranked strategies in one case were low priority targets in the other (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002758.s004">Figs.

        <title>Alternative optima and sensitivity towards reference flux distribution</title>
        <p>The above analysis proved the robustness of MiMBl towards stoichiometric representation of metabolic reactions. However, some degree of uncertainty in the simulation results might still exist, as we shall show here, essentially arising from two main sources (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002758.s008">Fig. S8a</xref></bold>): i) sensitivity of the results towards the initial wild-type flux distribution used as input for minimizing the metabolic distance; and ii) potential non-uniqueness of the linear programming solution while simulating the mutant phenotype, <italic>i.e.</italic> existence of alternative optima. The sensitivity analysis for MiMBl towards both sources of uncertainty was performed using <italic>i</italic>AZ900 reconstruction of the yeast metabolic network, as the same reconstruction is subsequently used to study genetic interactions within the yeast metabolism. Both sources of variability also have impact on lMoMA simulation results (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002758.s009">Fig. S9</xref></bold>).</p>
        <p>Firstly, we analyzed the sensitivity towards the wild-type (or reference) flux distribution used as input for minimization of metabolic adjustment. Using an accurate reference flux distribution is crucial for obtaining biologically meaningful simulation results. While some metabolite exchange rates are commonly available as experimentally derived constraints for the wild-type, they are usually not sufficient to uniquely estimate the corresponding intracellular fluxes, <italic>e.g.</italic> by using FBA (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002758.s008">Figs. S8a and S1</xref></bold>). It has been previously shown that the use of alternative optima within the reference flux distribution obtained with FBA can affect the prediction of growth upon gene deletions using quadratic MoMA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002758-Segr1">[11]</xref>. We herein performed a similar analysis by using MiMBl. The growth of single gene deletion mutants was simulated with MiMBl while using alternative optimal FBA flux distributions as reference (<bold><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref></bold>). Similarly to what was previously observed for quadratic MoMA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002758-Segr1">[11]</xref>, cases were found where the use of alternative FBA flux distributions, as input to MiMBl, influences the growth prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002758-g003"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>). 70% of the predictions of single gene deletion phenotypes were consistent across all FBA-alternative-optima used, while the remaining 30% showed dependence on the input reference flux distribution. Use of additional experimentally determined constraints, for instance as obtained with <sup>13</sup>C flux analysis, will be useful for reducing the uncertainty in the input flux distribution and thereby in obtaining more robust predictions.</p>
        <p>In order to assess the variability due to potential non-uniqueness of the optimal solution obtained with MiMBl (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002758.s008">Fig. S8a</xref></bold>), we performed a flux variability analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002758-Mahadevan1">[26]</xref>. Biologically, the alternative optima correspond to the existence of alternative pathways that result in equivalent mutant phenotypes with regards to the required metabolic adjustment. For a fixed reference flux distribution, we calculated the range of variability of intracellular fluxes upon constraining the metabolic adjustment (<italic>i.e.</italic> sum of metabolite turnover distance) to its optimal value (<bold><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref></bold>). All of the tested fluxes were observed to have very low or no variability (v<sub>i</sub><sup>min</sup>/v<sub>i</sub><sup>max</sup>&gt;0.99) across all single gene deletion phenotypes. Utility of the second step of MiMBl was seen in case of the flux through <italic>PGM1</italic> upon deletion of <italic>YOR128C</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002758.s008">Fig. S8b</xref></bold>). Nevertheless, existence of a unique solution is problem dependent and it should be verified whether the possibility of alternative optima affects the prediction of fluxes of interest. Therefore, we performed an exhaustive analysis of variability of growth prediction across all single gene deletions, as well as all double gene deletions included in the genetic interactions case study. Growth was uniquely predicted in all these cases (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002758.s008">Fig. S8c</xref></bold>).</p>

        <title>Predicting genetic interactions by using MiMBl</title>
        <p>To what extent MiMBl contributes for increasing biological understandings gained from the application of optimization-based metabolic modeling? To address this question, we used one of the most recent and comprehensive <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> models, <italic>i</italic>AZ900 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002758-Zomorrodi2">[22]</xref>, to run simulations for single and double gene knockouts and challenged MiMBl to predict the epistasis scores of all significantly interacting non-essential gene pairs reported by Szappanos <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002758-Szappanos1">[2]</xref>. Genetic interaction networks are valuable resources towards deciphering the complex genotype-phenotype relationships. A genetic interaction between two genes occurs when the phenotype displayed by a double deletion mutant is different than the one expected based on the phenotypes of the single mutants. Accordingly, two genes can display positive, negative or no interaction. In order to capture most of the biological information contained in the experimental dataset, we used two different objective functions, maximization of growth (FBA) and minimization of metabolic adjustment (MiMBl). FBA is expected to cover situations where maximization of growth is the cellular objective, while MiMBl will account for regulatory effects inherent to the wild-type flux distribution, in the sense that the flux distribution in the perturbed network is kept as close as possible to that of the wild-type. This principle of proximity to the wild-type (or the reference) should partially reflect principles of flux reorganization in genetically perturbed networks. Although, both FBA and MiMBl performed equally well concerning gene essentiality predictions (∼60% sensitivity, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002758.s016">Text S1</xref></bold>), the benefit of using MiMBl as a biological objective function became apparent while predicting genetic interactions. This implies that the biological regulatory principle underlying MiMBl is manifested in yeast (under the investigated conditions) at larger network perturbations or less drastic phenotypes than essentiality. When applied for studying genetic interactions, FBA is a conservative method compared to MiMBl, since the parameter used to define and measure genetic interactions is also the objective of optimization, <italic>i.e.</italic>, growth. Within the metabolic network, the existence of several optimal solutions theoretically satisfying maximum biomass formation is often observed. In case of a single/double gene deletion mutant where an alternative optimal pathway exists, FBA will always find such an alternative solution, even though it may not be biologically plausible due to regulatory constraints, and, thereby may miss potential genetic interactions. On the other hand, MiMBl will help in capturing more refined regulatory effects where the loss of growth is a side effect of minimizing the flux rerouting relative to the wild-type.</p>
        <p>The subset of experimental genetic interactions involving non-essential genes from the yeast metabolic model contains 2745 interactions (939 positive and 1806 negative) connecting 520 genes (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002758.s016">Text S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002758.s015">Table S4</xref></bold>). In order to assess the performance of the different algorithms, we carried out a sensitivity <italic>versus</italic> precision analysis. Precision was calculated as the fraction of experimentally validated interactions among all predicted interactions, while the sensitivity represents the fraction of the experimentally validated interactions captured by the predictions (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002758.s016">Text S1</xref></bold>). A computational epistasis score cutoff (ε<sub>cutoff</sub>) was used to call a particular gene pair to be positively interacting (ε&gt;ε<sub>cutoff</sub>), negatively interacting (ε&lt;−ε<sub>cutoff</sub>) or non-interacting (|ε|&lt;ε<sub>cutoff</sub>) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002758.s016">Text S1</xref></bold>). The performance of all algorithms (MiMBl, FBA, lMoMA and quadratic MoMA) is summarized as ROC (partial receiver operating characteristic) curves for both, positive and negative epistasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002758-g004"><bold>Fig. 4</bold></xref><bold> a, b and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002758.s010">Fig. S10</xref></bold>). The sensitivity and precision of the FBA predictions obtained in this study are within the same range as previously reported by Szappanos <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002758-Szappanos1">[2]</xref>. MiMBl shows less precision than FBA in case of both positive (∼20% and ∼30%, respectively) and negative interactions (∼50% and ∼60%, respectively), but its sensitivity is considerably higher in both cases (∼9% <italic>vs</italic> ∼4% for positive, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002758-g004"><bold>Fig. 4a</bold></xref>; ∼5% <italic>vs</italic> ∼3% for negative, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002758-g004"><bold>Fig. 4b</bold></xref>), which reflects the conservative nature of FBA in predicting genetic interactions. Notably, for the entire range of genetic interaction cutoffs, MiMBl sensitivity and precision are considerably higher than those of lMoMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002758-g004"><bold>Fig. 4a, b</bold></xref>). The same trend was verified when the originally proposed quadratic MoMA formulation was used (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002758.s010">Fig. S10</xref></bold>). As previously reported by Szappanos and co-workers, lMoMA does not improve FBA predictions.

        <p>We chose a strict interaction cutoff (|ε<sub>cutoff</sub>| = 0.013) for further analysis of the predicted interactions (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002758.s011">Fig. S11</xref></bold>). For this cutoff, the correctly predicted genetic interactions map contains 142 interactions (73 positive and 69 negative) connecting 86 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002758-g004"><bold>Fig. 4f</bold></xref>). MiMBl not only captures all interactions, except one, predicted by FBA, but also contributes with 48 additional interactions (∼34% of all accurate predictions). MiMBl predictions thus span almost all of those from FBA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002758-g004"><bold>Fig. 4c</bold></xref>), which we attribute to the fact that many metabolites within the metabolic model are directly contributing to the biomass formation. Consequently, if the turnover of most metabolites is kept constant upon gene deletions, the biomass turnover (growth) will also remain constant. On the other hand, FBA is not able to capture many genetic interactions found by MiMBl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002758-g004"><bold>Fig. 4c</bold></xref>). These will involve mutants where the loss of fitness upon gene deletion is caused by the change from an <italic>in vivo</italic> well-tuned pathway to an alternative pathway containing different metabolites or enzymes. For many of such cases, there are alternative pathways that sustain the same growth as the reference and FBA finds such solutions, regardless of the magnitude of the turnover adjustment that is required for the cell. Because of this feature, MiMBl is capable of capturing a part of the regulatory constraints on the operation of cellular metabolism, which lMoMA failed to capture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002758-g004"><bold>Fig. 4c</bold></xref>).</p>
        <p>The regulatory constraints imposed by MiMBl assume even stronger relevance in the case of positive interactions, where MiMBl exclusively accounts for almost 50% of all successfully predicted interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002758-g004"><bold>Fig. 4f</bold></xref>). In fact, FBA's ability of predicting positive interactions is limited, as the maximum predicted biomass formation of a double deletion mutant would never be higher than the highest among those predicted for the two single deletion mutants. Thus, if a single deletion mutant has the maximum predicted fitness of 1 (meaning that the fitness of the mutant is the same as that of the wild-type), positive interactions involving the deleted gene will be impossible to predict. As FBA is bound to find the optimal solution that provides the highest growth, single mutants with maximum fitness are much more often predicted than the ones found by MiMBl, where minimal adjustment of the metabolic network is preferred over maintaining maximum growth. Indeed, MiMBl predicts decreased single mutant fitness for twice more gene knockouts than FBA (∼38.4 <italic>vs</italic> 18.1%). Consequently, MiMBl also displayed an improved capacity to predict both positive and negative epistasis involving the same gene. More than 80% of the genes display this feature <italic>in vivo</italic>. Interestingly, 30% of the genes involved in MiMBl predicted epistasis interact both positively and negatively, while FBA predicts that only 14% of the genes do so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002758-g004"><bold>Fig. 4f</bold></xref>).</p>

        <title>MiMBl predicts genetic interactions between distant genes in the network</title>
        <p>As metabolic networks are featured by several metabolites with a high degree of connectivity, interactions occur between distant pathways in the network.

        <title>Predicting genetic interactions of isoenzymes</title>
        <p>In a metabolic network reconstruction, a group of isoenzymes is represented by a single reaction, which is associated with two or more genes. Simulation-wise, such a reaction will be inactive only when all of the corresponding isoenzyme-coding genes are deleted and deletion of any single gene will not result in a loss of fitness. Thus, in case of a reaction with two isoenzymes, when the deletion of both isoenzyme-coding genes leads to decreased fitness <italic>in silico</italic>, a negative interaction will be predicted. Our analysis captured several of such cases, for example, the negative interactions between <italic>SER3</italic> and <italic>SER33</italic>, as well as between <italic>SAM1</italic> and <italic>SAM2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002758-g004"><bold>Fig. 4f</bold></xref>). While this gene-deletion-centered approach allows capturing interactions between isoenzyme-coding genes, it is not suited for predicting interactions between two functionally different genes where one (or both) of them have isoenzymes. However, such interactions are often observed <italic>in vivo</italic>, since isoenzymes do not always completely compensate each other's function due to differences in kinetic and/or regulatory characteristics. Although these effects cannot be directly captured using the currently available metabolic modeling tools, we suggest evaluating the metabolic basis of genetic interactions between functionally different genes with isoenzymes by taking a reaction-centered approach. For this purpose, flux through reactions catalyzed by isoenzymes was constrained to zero when at least one of the isoenzyme-coding genes was deleted. This way, five additional genetic interactions involving isoenzymes were correctly captured: a positive interaction between the isoenzyme group <italic>TLK1 &amp; TLK2</italic> and the gene <italic>ARO1</italic>, as well as four negative interactions involving the isoenzyme group <italic>ALD2-ALD6</italic> and other genes from the central carbon metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002758-g004"><bold>Fig. 4f</bold></xref>). These five interactions are thus likely to result from flux rerouting caused by the lack of compensation by the corresponding isoenzymes.</p>

        <title>Combining MiMBl and FBA predictions for understanding genetic interactions</title>
        <p>Use of MiMBl not only allowed us to expand the range of genetic interactions predicted by FBA, but also the combined use of these two complementary algorithms enabled finding of relevant interactions where only one or both simulation principles apply. For example, the interaction between <italic>PGK2</italic> and <italic>GDH2</italic>, exclusively captured by MiMBl, is due to balancing of NADH and glutamate, two of the most connected metabolites in the network. As there are alternative pathways for fulfilling NADH and glutamate requirement (despite implying higher metabolic adjustments), FBA could not capture this interaction. A similar effect is observed for the negative interaction between isoenzymes <italic>SER3</italic> and <italic>SER33</italic>. In the absence of both genes, FBA predicts the needed supply of serine to be totally fulfilled by rerouting the metabolic fluxes via the glyoxylate shunt and threonine biosynthesis. On the other hand, MiMBl predicts that the supply of serine will be shared between the two alternative pathways, but the rescue cannot be complete, because the corresponding metabolic adjustment cost overweighs the benefit of increased growth. This prediction is in very good agreement with the experimental verification that the double mutant growth is impaired and can be restored by adding glycine to the medium, which is the intermediate for serine synthesis via glyoxylate or threonine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002758-Otero1">[27]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Overall, our results demonstrate that the use of optimization-based algorithms that are stoichiometry representation independent is fundamental for unambiguously linking modeling results with biological interpretation. To this end, we report a new method for formulating objective functions for metabolic modeling – MiMBl. As a biological case study, we used MiMBl to gain insights into the flux rewiring underlying genetic interactions within the yeast metabolic network. The analysis showed that the combined use of different objective functions is of primary importance in order to achieve a more complete understanding of the operating principles behind complex biological phenomena such as genetic interactions. Indeed, the number of accurately predicted genetic interactions was almost doubled owing to the use of MiMBl, highlighting the impact of metabolic adjustment constraints on the operation of perturbed metabolic networks. In conclusion, MiMBl provides a framework for consistent mathematical formulation of biological objective functions and thereby facilitates unraveling of the genotype-phenotype relations in metabolic networks.</p>

        <p><bold>Corollary 1</bold>: When all (diagonal) entries of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002758.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are identical (uniform scaling matrix), and therefore equal to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002758.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the optimality condition is simplified to<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002758.e045"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002758.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>The same optimality condition can thus be guaranteed only when the matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002758.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is uniformly scaled. Note that due to the nature of the biological problem, the genuine representation of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002758.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> might not be known, thereby <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002758.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> cannot be guaranteed to be a uniform scaling matrix. More importantly, for metabolic modeling purposes (where flux units and ranges are problem dependent), it is nevertheless undesirable that the solution is sensitive to non-uniform scaling and thus context dependent.</p>
        <p><bold>Corollary 2</bold>: For any positive diagonal scaling matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002758.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the same optimality condition is still guaranteed if the cost coefficients vector<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002758.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is also scaled by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002758.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. However, the choice of the appropriate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002758.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for formulating a biologically meaningful problem will require existence of a unique representation of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002758.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for any given network, which is not possible due to subjective nature of stoichiometry representation.</p>
        <p>Now consider the following MiMBl-like formulated problem:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002758.e054"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002758.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>Where, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002758.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is cost coefficient of variable <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002758.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the objective function. The new problem biologically corresponds to the previous one, after mapping the flux space into metabolite space.

        <p>Similarly to the previous problem, the following optimality condition is satisfied, so <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002758.e066" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is an optimal solution.<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002758.e067"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002758.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>Scaling the optimality condition will result in:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002758.e068"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002758.e068" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>Unlike the previous situation (sum of fluxes in the objective function), using a MiMBl-like problem formulation guarantees that the optimality condition is always satisfied, independently of the stoichiometry representation.</p>

This analysis is complementary to and based on the same simulation constraints as used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002758-g001"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref> in the main text. As the contribution of each flux to the objective function changes based on the corresponding stoichiometry representation, different situations could be described, leading either to the same (a, b) or distinct (c, d) optimal solutions. To illustrate these different situations, four reactions within the model were linearly scaled one at a time by multiplying by a scalar θ as described in <bold><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref></bold>. <bold>a</bold>) Linear scaling of the reaction <italic>FBP1</italic>. As <italic>FBP1</italic> carries no flux under the simulated conditions, the scaling of this reaction does not affect the objective function value. <bold>b</bold>) Linear scaling of the reaction <italic>RPE1</italic>. For the range of θ tested, the objective function value perfectly correlated with the scaling factor of the reaction <italic>RPE1</italic>, which indicates that all obtained solutions are in fact the same optimal solution (or alternative optimal solutions, depending on the model complexity). This profile means that there is no pathway alternative to <italic>RPE1</italic> that can become part of the optimal solution. <bold>c</bold>) Linear scaling of the reaction <italic>RPI1</italic>.

Similarly to that of <italic>RPI1</italic>, scaling of <italic>NDI1</italic> leads to different optimal solutions. However, in this case, the objective function value stabilizes after a given θ, which means that this flux no longer influences the optimization. Such profile suggests that the optimal solution found after the given value of θ does no longer involve <italic>NID1</italic>, but an alternative pathway, which became preferred for minimizing the objective function.</p>
