<abstract>
<p>The filamentous fungus <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> played a central role in the development of twentieth-century genetics, biochemistry and molecular biology, and continues to serve as a model organism for eukaryotic biology. Here, we have reconstructed a genome-scale model of its metabolism. This model consists of 836 metabolic genes, 257 pathways, 6 cellular compartments, and is supported by extensive manual curation of 491 literature citations. To aid our reconstruction, we developed three optimization-based algorithms, which together comprise Fast Automated Reconstruction of Metabolism (FARM). These algorithms are: LInear MEtabolite Dilution Flux Balance Analysis (limed-FBA), which predicts flux while linearly accounting for metabolite dilution; One-step functional Pruning (OnePrune), which removes blocked reactions with a single compact linear program; and Consistent Reproduction Of growth/no-growth Phenotype (CROP), which reconciles differences between <italic>in silico</italic> and experimental gene essentiality faster than previous approaches. Against an independent test set of more than 300 essential/non-essential genes that were not used to train the model, the model displays 93% sensitivity and specificity. We also used the model to simulate the biochemical genetics experiments originally performed on <italic>Neurospora</italic> by comprehensively predicting nutrient rescue of essential genes and synthetic lethal interactions, and we provide detailed pathway-based mechanistic explanations of our predictions. Our model provides a reliable computational framework for the integration and interpretation of ongoing experimental efforts in <italic>Neurospora</italic>, and we anticipate that our methods will substantially reduce the manual effort required to develop high-quality genome-scale metabolic models for other organisms.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Few organisms have been as foundational to the development of modern genetics and cellular metabolism as <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>. Given the wealth of knowledge available for this filamentous fungus, the effort required to manually curate a high-quality genome-scale metabolic reconstruction would be daunting. To aid the reconstruction process, we developed three optimization-based algorithms. The first algorithm predicts flux while linearly accounting for metabolite dilution; the second algorithm removes blocked reactions with one compact linear program; and the third algorithm reconciles differences between <italic>in silico</italic> predictions and experimental observations of mutant viability. We have used these algorithms to develop the first genome-scale metabolic model for <italic>Neurospora</italic>. We have validated the accuracy of our model against an independent test set of more than 300 growth/no-growth phenotypes, and our model displays 93% sensitivity and specificity. Simulating the biochemical genetics experiments originally performed on <italic>Neurospora</italic>, we comprehensively predicted essential genes, nutrient rescues of auxotroph mutants and synthetic lethal interactions. With these predictions, we provide potential mechanistic insight into known mutant phenotypes, and testable hypotheses for novel mutant phenotypes. The model, the algorithms and the testable hypotheses provide a computational foundation for the study of <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> metabolism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>First discovered as an orange mold infestation of Paris bakeries in 1843 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Davis1">[1]</xref>, the filamentous fungus <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> has become a model organism for eukaryotic biology and the cornerstone of a vibrant research community <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Perkins1">[2]</xref>. Work on <italic>Neurospora</italic> has led to essential discoveries in circadian rhythms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Baker1">[3]</xref>, epigenetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Rountree1">[4]</xref>, genome defense <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Selker1">[5]</xref>, mitochondrial biology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Nargang1">[6]</xref>, post-transcriptional gene silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Romano1">[7]</xref> and DNA repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Inoue1">[8]</xref>. Most famously, work in the 1940's by Beadle and Tatum led to the Nobel Prize-winning ‘one-gene-one-enzyme’ hypothesis that established the fundamental link between genes and proteins in all organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Beadle1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Tatum1">[10]</xref>. Work on <italic>Neurospora</italic> thus paved the way for modern genetics and molecular biology.</p>
<p>Of equal consequence, the work by Beadle and Tatum ushered in a new era in the study of biochemistry and cellular metabolism. The genetic facility of <italic>Neurospora</italic>, coupled with its ability to grow on minimal media, simplified the isolation of mutants with additional nutrient requirements. The first such auxotrophic mutants established the universal link among genes, enzymes, and the ordering of reactions in biosynthetic pathways. Work over subsequent decades led to a compilation of hundreds of such mutants, shedding light on most major biosynthetic pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Perkins2">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-McCluskey1">[13]</xref>. With the sequencing and annotation of the <italic>Neurospora</italic> genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Galagan1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Borkovich1">[15]</xref>, these genetic data could be organized on a physical scaffold, genetic markers could be assigned to specific genes with predicted biochemical functions, genes could be assigned to previously orphaned biochemical reactions, and a global map of <italic>Neurospora</italic> metabolism could begin to emerge.</p>
<p>Genome-scale metabolic models have been constructed for over 100 organisms spanning bacteria to mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Feist1">[16]</xref>. These network models capture information about all known metabolic reactions and the genes that encode enzymes for these reactions in a computationally structured manner. More than simply a catalog of reactions, network models capture biochemical relationships between reactions and pathways, afford a framework for integrating genomic measurements, and provide constraints for computational inference. One widely used method for computational inference using metabolic network models is Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Orth1">[17]</xref>. FBA calculates the flux of metabolites through a network under the assumption that metabolism is at steady state on the time-scales of interest. Using constraint-based modeling methods like FBA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Lewis1">[18]</xref>, it is possible to predict the growth rate of organisms under different conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Varma1">[19]</xref>, the rate of production of metabolites of interest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Plata1">[20]</xref>, the phenotypic consequences of gene knockouts, and the metabolic impact of different gene expression programs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Brandes1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Colijn1">[22]</xref>. Constraint-based methods are also being used to guide metabolic engineering efforts by calculating the modifications required to optimize the production of desired metabolites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Lun1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Pharkya1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>The wealth of genetic and metabolic data available for <italic>Neurospora</italic>, along with ongoing efforts to knock-out and phenotypically characterize all ∼10,000 genes in the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Dunlap1">[27]</xref>, provides a strong foundation for the development of a genome-scale metabolic model. A metabolic model would, in turn, complement experimental efforts by integrating data from experiments on single genes into a coherent genome-wide metabolic framework, providing potential mechanistic insight into experimental phenotypic observations, and enabling the comprehensive modeling of perturbations that could not be feasibly performed in the lab. A genome-scale model is also a requirement for the rational and efficient use of <italic>Neurospora</italic> as a potential biofuels organism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Tian1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Znameroski1">[32]</xref>.</p>
<p>We report here the construction and validation of a high-quality genome-scale metabolic model for <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>. To guide the process of model construction, we developed a novel suite of algorithms called <italic>Fast Automated Reconstruction of Metabolism</italic> (FARM). We validated the model against an independent gene essentiality test set, and achieved 93% sensitivity and specificity. We applied the validated model to comprehensively predict nutrient rescue of essential genes and synthetic lethal interactions. With these predictions, we provide potential mechanistic insight into known mutant phenotypes, and testable hypotheses for novel mutant phenotypes. More generally, the model provides a framework for integrating and interpreting ongoing experimental efforts that continue extend the rich history of biochemical research on <italic>Neurospora</italic>.</p>

<title>Modeling process</title>
<p>We reconstructed, validated and performed computational predictions with the <italic>Neurospora</italic> metabolic network model in a process consisting of four stages, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003126-g001">Figure 1</xref>. Below we summarize the steps of the process, then we describe the optimization-based algorithms we developed to guide the process.</p>

<title>Modeling process.</title>
<p>The process used for the reconstruction and validation of the metabolic model is described in four stages. In the first stage, <italic>pathway-directed curation</italic>, the genome sequence annotation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Galagan1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Borkovich1">[15]</xref> , metabolic pathways derived from MetaCyc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Caspi1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Karp4">[111]</xref> and experimental evidence from the <italic>Neurospora</italic> bibliome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Karp1">[37]</xref> were used to construct the first draft of the NeurosporaCyc Pathway/Genome database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Karp5">[112]</xref>. For the second stage, <italic>iterative phenotype-directed curation</italic>, we utilized FARM to suggest changes to the metabolic network based on a training set of experimentally observed growth phenotypes. These suggestions were reviewed manually, and accepted into the final model only if they were consistent with published experimental evidence. In the third stage, we <italic>independently validated</italic> the model based on a test set of experimentally observed viability phenotypes that were not utilized during model construction. In the fourth stage, we <italic>comprehensively predicted</italic> the phenotypes of all essential genes, nutrient rescues, and synthetic lethal interactions.</p>

<title>Stage 1: Pathway-directed curation</title>
<p>We integrated the <italic>Neurospora</italic> genome and literature to generate an initial draft of the metabolic network. This process was initiated by computing the probability that each enzyme activity is encoded in the genome sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Galagan1">[14]</xref> using the <italic>EFICA</italic>z enzyme function predictor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Arakaki1">[33]</xref>. These predicted enzyme activities were then automatically assembled into experimentally elucidated pathways taken from MetaCyc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Caspi1">[34]</xref> using the Pathologic pathway prediction algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Dale1">[35]</xref>. Complementing this automated approach, we manually curated <italic>Neurospora</italic>-specific literature to identify experimentally determined enzymes, assign Gene Ontology terms to proteins, distinguish isozymes from enzyme complexes, catalog growth observations, and estimate the biomass composition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Borkovich1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Dunlap1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Ashburner1">[36]</xref>. Each assertion in the database was labeled with an evidence code to specify the type of experiment or computation performed to support its inclusion in the metabolic network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Karp1">[37]</xref>.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2a2">
<title>Stage 2: Phenotype-directed curation</title>
<p>We iteratively improved the initial metabolic model with a manually curated training set of experimentally observed viability phenotypes on minimal and supplemented media. We used FARM on this set to suggest reaction additions/removals that would improve prediction accuracy. These changes were manually reviewed and accepted only if consistent with published experimental evidence.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2a3">
<title>Stage 3: Independent validation of model predictions</title>
<p>To confirm that the final model was not over-fit to a single training set and to ensure that the predictions of the model could generalize to new phenotypes, we validated the model using an independent test set of experimentally observed viability phenotypes.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2a4">
<title>Stage 4: Comprehensive viability phenotype prediction</title>
<p>We applied the final model to generate three sets of predictions. Firstly, we predicted the essentiality of all genes in our model. Secondly, we predicted which nutrient supplements would rescue a manually curated set of inviable mutants, and provided mechanistic explanations for each rescue. Thirdly, we systematically performed <italic>in silico</italic> double knockout experiments to predict synthetic lethal interactions. In all three cases, published observations were available that validated the accuracy of the predictions. The metabolic model extends these published observations in a manner that would be difficult experimentally by assaying a comprehensive set of conditions, providing novel testable hypotheses, and providing potential mechanistic insight into these predictions.</p>
</sec></sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>FARM</title>
<p>A number of significant challenges remain in the reconstruction of high-quality genome-scale metabolic models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Thiele1">[38]</xref>. Although bioinformatic methods exist that can automate the generation of draft metabolic models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Henry1">[39]</xref>, extensive manual adjustment and literature curation remains essential for generating high-quality models. The assessment of model accuracy through independent empirical validation is also critical if the predictions of the model are to be trusted. Although a number of methods have been developed to aid in this task <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Henry2">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Jerby1">[51]</xref>, substantial manual effort is also still required.</p>
<p>To facilitate the automation of metabolic network reconstruction, we developed three optimization-based algorithms, which together comprise <italic>Fast Automated Reconstruction of Metabolism</italic> (FARM). These algorithms are: <italic>LInear MEtabolite Dilution Flux Balance Analysis</italic> (limed-FBA), which predicts flux while linearly accounting for metabolite dilution; <italic>Consistent Reproduction Of growth/no-growth Phenotype</italic> (CROP), which reconciles differences between <italic>in silico</italic> and experimental gene essentiality faster than previous approaches; and <italic>One-step functional Pruning</italic> (OnePrune), which removes blocked reactions with a single compact linear program.</p>
<sec id="s2b1">
<title>LInear MEtabolite Dilution Flux Balance Analysis (limed-FBA)</title>
<p>Flux balance analysis is a widely used method for predicting metabolic capabilities using genome-scale metabolic network models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Orth1">[17]</xref>. FBA represents a metabolic network by capturing the stoichiometries of constituent reactions in a stoichiometric matrix, <italic>S</italic>. The matrix <italic>S</italic> and the set of reaction constraints <italic>lb</italic> and <italic>ub</italic> define the set of all possible flux configurations <italic>v</italic> at steady state. By defining a metabolic objective function <italic>c<sup>T</sup>v</italic> that represents all the essential biomass components necessary for growth, linear programming can be used to predict whether the model supports growth under a given nutrient condition. The linear programming problem is:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003126.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003126.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>FBA can be used to predict gene essentiality by blocking reactions that correspond to the gene knockout and checking if the model can still support growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Lewis1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Chang1">[52]</xref>(see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).</p>
<p>A known shortcoming of FBA is that it does not account for dilution of metabolites involved in active reactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Benyamini1">[53]</xref>. These metabolites are referred to as <italic>active metabolites</italic>. Consequently, FBA can fail to require the biosynthesis of known essential compounds. For example, the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Duarte1">[54]</xref> suffers its highest error rate in predicting growth of mutants deficient in quinone biosynthesis. The reason for this error is that FBA allows quinones to be recycled <italic>in silico</italic>, whereas biologically quinones must be replenished by <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> to overcome their growth-associated dilution. To account for growth-associated dilution of active metabolites, we developed limed-FBA.</p>
<p>The limed-FBA method works by forcing active metabolites to dilute through an additional small dilution flux (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). We illustrate the difference between limed-FBA and FBA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003126-g002">Figure 2</xref>. As shown, FBA does not account for metabolite dilution; it allows metabolic cycles that lack an input flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003126-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast, limed-FBA forces dilution of active metabolites. This dilution necessitates a counteracting input flux, so limed-FBA disallows metabolic cycles that lack an input flux, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003126-g002">Figure 2B</xref>. A specific example for <italic>Neurospora</italic> is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003126-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, which focuses on the gene <italic>arg-14</italic> that encodes acetylglutamate synthase. This enzyme acts as an input flux to arginine biosynthesis and is required for growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Davis2">[55]</xref>. FBA uses the arginine biosynthesis pathway without input flux from acetylglutamate synthase, and thus incorrectly predicts <italic>arg-14</italic> is not essential. In contrast, limed-FBA forces dilution of the metabolites in the acetyl cycle, thus preventing these compounds from being produced without an input flux. As a consequence, limed-FBA correctly predicts that <italic>arg-14</italic> is essential.</p>
<fig id="pcbi-1003126-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003126.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption>
<title>limed-FBA vs FBA.</title>
<p>(A) FBA does not require an input flux for cycles because it does not account for dilution of metabolites that participate in active reactions. (B) limed-FBA requires an input flux for cycles to compensate for dilution of metabolites that participate in active reactions. (C) FBA fails to correctly predict <italic>arg-14</italic> gene essentiality because without an input flux, metabolite dilution prevents the isolated acetyl cycle compounds from being produced (side compounds not shown).</p>
</caption><graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003126.g002" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>A heuristic that is used in FBA to account for metabolite dilution is to add a small “drain” of diluted metabolites to the biomass composition. The issue with this heuristic is that it requires knowing a priori which metabolites are diluted, whereas limed-FBA determines which metabolites are diluted based on the flux. For example if this heuristic was used to add a metabolite in the cycle of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003126-g002">Figure 2</xref>, such as <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-L-glutamate, to biomass, then FBA would correctly predict the essentiality of <italic>arg-14</italic>. However, then FBA would also predict that the <italic>arg-14</italic> knockout cannot be rescued by arginine. In fact, arginine does rescue Δ<italic>arg-14</italic> experimentally, as correctly predicted by limed-FBA.</p>
<p>Importantly, we designed limed-FBA as a linear program. Linear programs can be solved robustly and quickly, making limed-FBA a practical solution to account for metabolite dilution. An alternative method that has been developed is <italic>Metabolite Dilution FBA</italic> (MD-FBA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Benyamini1">[53]</xref>. MD-FBA accounts for metabolite dilution by forcing a preset level of dilution for active metabolites. MD-FBA was shown to predict mutant growth more accurately than FBA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Benyamini1">[53]</xref>, but it has two major drawbacks. (1) MD-FBA places a lower bound but no upper bound on dilution, so it effectively allows unlimited export of all metabolites, which is not biologically plausible; and (2) MD-FBA requires a computationally expensive <italic>mixed integer linear program</italic> (MILP), which severely limits its practicality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Benyamini1">[53]</xref>.</p>

<title>Consistent Reproduction Of growth/no-growth Phenotype (CROP)</title>
<p>During stage 2 of our process, we iteratively improved the ability of the metabolic network model to predict gene knockout phenotypes. A number of computational algorithms have been described to maximize consistency between predicted and experimental growth/no-growth phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Henry1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Kumar1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Reed1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Latendresse1">[49]</xref>. These algorithms are typically designed to optimize a MILP, because they include binary variables to represent whether each reaction should or should not be included in the metabolic model. One such MILP-based algorithm is the Model SEED <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Henry1">[39]</xref>, , which is a fully-automated model reconstruction process for prokaryotes only. Another is GrowMatch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Zomorrodi1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Kumar1">[42]</xref>, which was designed to make small changes to models, such as adding or removing up to three reactions. One limitation of these approaches is that they do not account for the diverse evidence for reactions available for <italic>Neurospora</italic>, including enzyme function predictions, thermodynamic estimates, literature references, and pathway information, in a disciplined manner.</p>
<p>To quickly and accurately reconcile inconsistencies between predicted and experimental growth/no-growth phenotypes, we developed <italic>Consistent Reproduction Of growth/no-growth Phenotype</italic> (<italic>CROP</italic>). CROP solved inconsistencies while accounting for diverse evidence. This evidence included (1) whether we had manually curated a reaction with experimental evidence from the literature, (2) what pathways a reaction was part of, and whether these pathways were predicted to be in <italic>Neurospora</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Dale1">[35]</xref>, (3) thermodynamic estimates of Gibbs free energy, and (4) probabilistic estimates of enzyme function. This evidence was mathematically integrated on a probabilistic scale to assign each reaction a weight. Our approach to derive weights in a disciplined manner was motivated by the statistical maximum a posteriori estimator. Thus, the weights have a direct probabilistic interpretation: they depend on the product of the probabilities that the reaction is biochemically and thermodynamically plausible. These weights guided CROP's growth reconciliation toward metabolic network changes that were most consistent with available evidence. To achieve consistency when the model incorrectly predicts growth, CROP suggests reactions from the model to remove. To do this, CROP applies MILP. To achieve consistency when the model incorrectly predicts no-growth, CROP suggests reactions to add from a database of metabolic reactions, such as MetaCyc. A detailed comparison of CROP with previous methods is available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003126.s011">Text S3</xref>.</p>

<p>The model contains 836 genes that encode 1027 unique enzymatic activities.

<p>Cellular compartments in the model include the cytosol, the extracellular space, and 4 organelles: the glyoxysome, the vacuole, the nucleus, and the mitochondrion. The 299 transport reactions of the model enabled not only uptake and export of 137 metabolites, but also the exchange of metabolites between the cytosol and each organelle.</p>
<p>The model's growth objective was based on a modular biomass composition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Feist2">[69]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Beste1">[70]</xref>. Biomass modules were separately defined for DNA, RNA, amino acids, cell wall, lipids, sterols, essential cofactors, and secondary metabolites. This modular decomposition allowed for different goals in different applications of the model. For example, wild-type biomass contains substantial amounts of secondary metabolites, such as sphingolipids, ergosterol and carotenoids (which give <italic>Neurospora</italic> its characteristic orange color), so we included the secondary metabolites module in the biomass composition when predicting wild-type fluxes. On the other hand, secondary metabolites are not strictly required for viability, so we removed this module from the biomass composition when predicting viability.</p>
<p>The model quantitatively captures the growth rate of Neurospora. To illustrate this, we have plotted a range of glucose uptake rates against the model's predicted doubling times, and several data points extracted from the experimental literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Neville1">[71]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Courtright1">[73]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003126.s005">Figure S4</xref>).

<title>Model validation using gene essentiality</title>
<p>To validate the accuracy of the <italic>N. crassa</italic> iJDZ836 model, we manually curated a collection of mutant viability phenotypes from the literature. We split this collection into a training set, which we used with FARM to construct the model; and an independent test set, which we used to validate the final model. Both of these collections are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003126.s007">Table S1</xref>. To simulate gene knockout experiments, we removed reactions from the model that depend on the gene, applied limed-FBA, and predicted whether or not the perturbed model could grow. We then compared experimental observations to the model's <italic>in silico</italic> predictions. Accuracy was measured as two quantities: sensitivity and specificity.

<p>We curated a collection of mutant viability observations on minimal media and separated the collection into a training set, where knowledge of the viability phenotype was used to improve the model; and a test set, where the viability phenotype was hidden from the model. (A) Training and test set mutant viability observations were used to measure the sensitivity and specificity of the limed-FBA gene knockout viability predictions. While some inconsistencies were due to model error, several were resolved in the model's favor, as discussed in the text.

(C) For comparison, we display the mutant viability prediction accuracies of previously published FBA models for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>.

<p>The final model's predictive accuracy on the test and training sets using FBA and MD-FBA is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003126-g004">Figure 4B</xref>. Both of these methods are generally outperformed by limed-FBA.</p>
<p>The differences between FBA and limed-FBA can reveal subtle issues with existing experimental data. For example, because FBA allows recycling of coenzyme A and the biosynthesis of coenzyme A requires <italic>pan-2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-LakinThomas1">[74]</xref>, the essentiality of <italic>pan-2</italic> is missed by FBA. In contrast, limed-FBA correctly predicts essentiality of <italic>pan-2</italic>. Similarly, three other genes involved in coenzyme A biosynthesis (<italic>NCU08925</italic> and <italic>pan-3</italic>) and mitochondrial transport (<italic>mic-30</italic>) were predicted to be essential by limed-FBA, but not by FBA. Surprisingly, these three genes were in our test set of <italic>non-essentials</italic>. A potential explanation for these inconsistencies is that the function of these genes can be performed by an isozyme that was not captured in our model. In addition to these three genes, there is one more gene from our test set of non-essentials where limed-FBA predicted essentiality, but FBA predicted non-essentiality. This gene is <italic>pab-1</italic>. Like <italic>arg-14</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003126-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), <italic>pab-1</italic> serves as input to a metabolic cycle, so <italic>pab-1</italic> is not required by FBA. However, consistent with limed-FBA's prediction, the <italic>pab-1</italic> gene was reported to be essential by Beadle and Tatum's original publication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Beadle1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Tatum1">[10]</xref>.</p>

<title>Experimentally observed inviable mutants that were predicted viable</title>
<p>There were four inconsistencies where the model predicted viability and experimental data indicated lethality; these were <italic>thi-4</italic>, <italic>ace-7</italic>, and <italic>ace-8</italic> in the training set, and <italic>arg-4</italic> in the test set. The gene <italic>thi-4</italic> is required for its role in the thiamin diphosphate (TPP) biosynthesis pathway. However, this pathway includes the eukaryotic thiazole synthase, and to the best of our knowledge its reaction has not been characterized. Thus, this pathway was not included in the model. The incorrect prediction of the <italic>ace-7</italic> and <italic>ace-8</italic> mutants from the training set is likely due to regulatory effects, which our model does not capture. <italic>ace-7</italic> encodes a subunit of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and it has been experimentally shown that glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase tightly controls NADPH regeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Zhang1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Scott1">[75]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Brody1">[78]</xref>. But since the model predicts that NADPH can be regenerated by many enzymes, we were unable to capture the essentiality of <italic>ace-7</italic>. The gene <italic>ace-8</italic> encodes pyruvate kinase, which is known to partially control glycolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Thompson1">[79]</xref>.

In contrast, the model predicted that the Δ<italic>erg-14</italic> knockout was blocked in the production of mevalonate, which is a necessary precursor for the sterol component of biomass.

<title>Prediction of synthetic lethal interactions</title>
<p>Pairwise synthetic lethality arises when two mutants with single gene knockouts are viable, but the double knockout mutant is inviable. Synthetic lethality can reveal cross-pathway dependencies that provide valuable insights into metabolism at the genome scale, but an experimental approach to comprehensively perform double knockouts to identify synthetic lethals is currently infeasible for <italic>Neurospora</italic>. Computational models provide a mechanism to rapidly and comprehensively test all interactions as a way to prioritize subsequent experimental verification. To predict synthetic lethality using the model, we simulated all pairs of knockouts of non-essential genes and predicted viability on minimal media.</p>
<p>Of the roughly 700,000 double knockouts in the metabolic model, the model predicted 230 to be synthetically lethal on minimal media. The mechanisms underlying these predicted synthetic lethal interactions fall into three classes: those that encode isozymes of a common reaction, those that encode enzymes of a common pathway, and those that encode enzymes of interacting pathways. This list contains 22 isozyme pairs, 4 gene pairs in the same pathway, and 204 gene pairs in interacting pathways. All of these pairs are tabulated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003126.s008">Table S2</xref>. The non-isozyme gene pairs and a previously known isozyme pair are displayed in a symmetric interaction map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003126-g009">Figure 9</xref>.

<title>Mechanistic insight of synthetic lethal interactions</title>
<p>To validate the ability of the model to predict synthetic lethality, we manually curated a small number of experimentally observed synthetic lethal interactions. Some of these interactions involved the <italic>arg-2</italic> mutant, which is known to be “leaky” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Davis2">[55]</xref>. We used the remaining synthetic lethal interactions to validate our results. Of these 5 experimentally observed synthetic lethal interactions, the model correctly predicts 4.</p>

<title>Mechanistic insight into three experimentally validated synthetic lethal auxotrophs and their nutrient rescue.</title>
<p>(A) The nitrogen assimilation pathway contains two alternate routes that convert α-ketoglutarate into the essential metabolite L-glutamine (red). (A1) The <italic>en(am)-2</italic> mutant is viable, because α-ketoglutarate can be aminated to L-glutamate via <italic>am</italic>. (A2) The <italic>am</italic> mutant is viable, because α-ketoglutarate and L-glutamine can be converted to 2 L-glutamate via <italic>en(am)-2</italic>. (A3) The double mutant <italic>am</italic>:<italic>en(am)-2</italic> is lethal when ammonium is the nitrogen source because both routes to L-glutamine are blocked, but (A4) can be rescued when the media is supplemented with L-glutamate (A4). (B) The only two routes for the synthesis of the essential metabolite L-proline are through arginine degradation and proline biosynthesis. (B1) The <italic>pro-3</italic> mutant is blocked in proline biosynthesis, but can obtain L-proline through arginine degradation. (B2) The <italic>ota</italic> mutant is blocked in arginine degradation, but can obtain L-proline through proline biosynthesis. (B3) The double mutant <italic>pro-3</italic>:<italic>ota</italic> is blocked in both routes, but can be rescued when the nutrient media is supplemented with L-proline (B4). (C) There are only two biosynthetic routes to the essential metabolite uridine-5′-phosphate. (C1) The <italic>pyr-1</italic> mutant can still obtain uridine-5′-phosphate from extracellular uracil, and the <italic>uc-5</italic> mutant can obtain uridine-5′-phosphate from (S)-dihydroorotate (C2), but the <italic>pyr-1</italic>:<italic>uc-5</italic> double mutant is blocked in both routes (C3). However, it can be rescued when the nutrient media is supplemented with uridine through its conversion to uridine-5′-phosphate in the pyrimidine salvage pathways (C4). Side compounds not shown.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003126-g010">Figure 10B</xref> provides an example of synthetic lethality arising from mutations in two interacting pathways. The pathways for proline biosynthesis and arginine degradation both synthesize glutamate-semialdehyde, which is a precursor to the essential metabolite L-proline. Both the <italic>pro-3</italic> (glutamate-5-semialdehyde dehydrogenase) mutant in proline biosynthesis, and the <italic>ota</italic> (acetylornithine transaminase) mutant in arginine degradation are viable, because they represent the two alternate routes to synthesize L-proline. However, the double mutant <italic>pro-3</italic>:<italic>ota</italic> is blocked in both routes, so it is inviable, unless the nutrient media is supplemented with L-proline.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003126-g010">Figure 10C</xref> provides another example of synthetic lethality arising from two interacting pathways. On uracil-containing media, the uridine-5′-phosphate synthesis pathway and the path from uracil to uridine-5′-phosphate (UMP) both synthesize the essential UMP. So on uracil-containing media, both <italic>pyr-1</italic> (dihydroorotate dehydrogenase) in uridine-5′-phosphate synthesis and <italic>uc-5</italic> (uracil permease) are viable, because they represent the two alternate routes to synthesize UMP. Consequently, the double mutant <italic>pyr-1</italic>:<italic>uc-5</italic> on uracil-containing media is blocked in both routes, so it is inviable. Further, the <italic>pyr-1</italic>:<italic>uc-5</italic> mutant can be rescued by uridine, since uridine can be phosphorylated to UMP.</p>
<p>The novel predictions of synthetic lethality provide testable hypotheses for further experimentation. For example, the model predicts synthetic lethality between <italic>NCU02726</italic> (ethanolamine kinase) and <italic>gsl-3</italic> (3-dehydrosphinganine reductase). The products of these two genes catalyze reactions in two different pathways that lead to the production of the essential metabolite phosphoryl-ethanolamine. Ethanolamine kinase converts ethanolamine to phosphoryl-ethanolamine in a single reaction. Without ethanolamine kinase, the model predicts that phosphoryl-ethanolamine must be produced from the sphingolipid metabolism pathway. This requires the activity of <italic>gsl-3</italic>, which is an upstream member of this pathway.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003126.s003">Figure S2</xref> illustrates the potential mechanism underlying the predicted synthetic lethality between the <italic>suc</italic> gene (pyruvate carboxylase) and subunits of mitochondrial complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase). Under normal circumstances, NADH produced in the mitochondrial TCA cycle is oxidized to NAD in the electron transport chain via NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. Yet, the loss of complex I is known to be non-lethal in <italic>Neurospora</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Videira1">[91]</xref>. This places a metabolic burden on the rest of mitochondrial metabolism to oxidize the NADH. The model predicts that in the absence of complex I, NADH is oxidized by malate dehydrogenase in the reverse direction of the normal TCA cycle flux. To maintain this flux, the mitochondrion requires a steady source of oxaloacetate, which can only be supplied from pyruvate carboxylase, encoded by <italic>suc</italic>. This synthetic interaction is particularly noteworthy, because <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> lacks complex I, making <italic>Neurospora</italic> a prime model for studying its interactions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Building on its long history as a genetic model organism for biochemical genetics and cellular metabolism, we report here the first genome-scale metabolic network model for <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>. We assessed the <italic>Neurospora</italic> metabolic model's ability to predict the impact of gene deletions, nutrient supplements that would rescue essential gene deletions, and synthetic lethal interactions. In each case, computational predictions were validated against a curated dataset of experimentally observed mutant viability phenotypes. Importantly, to ensure that our model was not over-fit, we separated the experimental data into a training and test set. Whereas training data was used in the development of the model, the test set was reserved to assess the accuracy of the final model. The final accuracy assessment was thus independent of any data used during model training.</p>
<p>The prediction of the growth phenotype of gene deletions is a canonical test of metabolic model accuracy and a useful benchmark for assessing the quality of different models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Becker1">[92]</xref>. The accuracy of our model compares favorably to extensively curated models such as <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>. Moreover, at 93% sensitivity and specificity on a test set of 303 phenotyped gene knockouts, the <italic>Neurospora</italic> model displays high absolute accuracy that lends confidence to the ability of the model to make accurate novel predictions.</p>
<p>The <italic>N. crassa</italic> iJDZ836 model also demonstrates high accuracy in predicting the ability of different nutrients to rescue essential gene knockouts and in predicting synthetic lethal interactions. In the former case, the model displays nearly 90% accuracy on an independent test set of nutrient rescue experiments. In the latter case, we were only able to curate a handful of experimentally verified synthetic lethal interactions. Nonetheless, although no synthetic lethal data was used during model training, the model was able to correctly identify four out of five known synthetic lethal interactions.</p>
<p>Genome-scale metabolic models complement experimental investigations, and one role of metabolic modeling is to rapidly generate and prioritize testable predictions that can be used to guide subsequent experimentation. As important as the predictions themselves, metabolic models also provide potential mechanistic explanations for the results. The explanations provide an important check on the overlying predictions. During the validation of models, these explanations ensure that not only are correct answers given, they are given for valid underlying reasons. For novel predictions, mechanistic explanations can provide potential insight into the results as well as tangible avenues to experimental validation. To illustrate the last point, in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003126.s012">Text S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003126.s006">Figure S5</xref> we simulate the observed physiological effect of oxygen limitation on ethanol production when grown on xylose. Therefore, our model can be used to simulate perturbations that optimize ethanol yield, which can then be verified experimentally.</p>
<p>As with all previous modeling efforts, errors in predicting known experimental results highlight limitations in either the model itself or the modeling framework. In terms of the model, the quality will only be as good as the information that was used to develop it. In the case of <italic>Neurospora</italic>, the extraordinarily rich literature for this well-studied model organism was the foundation that enabled a model to be generated that performed with high accuracy. Nonetheless, certain areas of the model remain less well developed, and one value of model construction is the objective measure it can provide on the relative information available for different aspects of metabolism. This can be used to target areas that are less well understood. For example, the substrates of certain reactions in the thiamin diphosphate and neurosporaxanthin biosynthesis pathways and the fate of the end-product in the histidine degradation pathway cannot be included with confidence in any metabolic model, because they are open biochemical questions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Karp3">[93]</xref>.</p>
<p>More generally, the constraint-based modeling framework we used here is known to suffer from certain limitations. As with similar models, this accounts for a significant portion of the prediction errors in the <italic>Neurospora</italic> model. In particular, our model does not account for regulation of either enzyme expression or activity. These factors sometimes acted in combination. An illustrative example is <italic>gln-1</italic> and <italic>gln-2</italic>, which code for the alpha and beta subunit, respectively, of glutamine synthetase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Davila1">[94]</xref>. Our model requires both subunits for enzyme catalysis. However, it was experimentally shown that concentration of extracellular ammonium regulates this enzyme's subunit composition, which can include both subunits, only alpha subunits, or only beta subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Mora1">[95]</xref>. This metabolic complexity highlights the need for the future incorporation of kinetics and regulation.</p>
<p>In one instance, however, a prediction initially thought to be an error provided the means to identify an issue with an experimentally observed knockout. The viability phenotype experiment for Δ<italic>erg-14</italic> was performed on a knockout strain originally designated as a homokaryon. Experimental observations of this strain revealed a normal growth phenotype. In contrast, the model predicted that the Δ<italic>erg-14</italic> mutant was blocked in the production of mevalonate, which is a necessary precursor for the sterol component of biomass. Moreover, previous efforts to phenotype temperature-sensitive mutants of <italic>erg-14</italic> revealed severe morphological defects that were expected to be lethal in the full knockout <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Seiler1">[81]</xref>. Driven by these inconsistencies, a re-examination of the Δ<italic>erg-14</italic> knockout revealed that the mutant used was in fact a heterokaryon. This prediction, in effect, served as a blind control that highlighted the predictive value of the model.</p>
<p>The construction of genome-scale metabolic models remains a daunting task. Even aided by sophisticated tools for the management and visualization of pathway knowledge, a metabolic reconstruction still requires substantial manual review of the corresponding literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Thiele1">[38]</xref>. Moreover, it is desirable that the model construction process be guided by objective and quantitative measures of predictive accuracy. Incorporating this requirement into the model generation process increases the complexity of the task by requiring iterative cycles of data curation, model improvement, and accuracy assessment. To facilitate the process of model improvement, a number of tools have been developed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Henry1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Agren1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Latendresse1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Jerby1">[51]</xref>. We contribute to this set of tools with the development of a set of optimization-based algorithms, which together comprise <italic>Fast Automated Reconstruction of Metabolism</italic> (FARM).</p>
<p>Two of the three FARM algorithms specifically facilitate the process of model construction. <italic>Consistent Reproduction Of growth/no-growth Phenotype</italic> (CROP) assists in automating the process of adding and subtracting reactions from a model to improve predictive accuracy. CROP integrates diverse evidence for pathways into a probabilistic framework that assigns a weight to each reaction associated with the likelihood that the reaction is present in the network. These weights are then used to guide the selection of reactions to add or remove. Previous methods to achieve <italic>in silico</italic> growth used mixed integer linear programming (MILP), and thus required substantial compute time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Henry1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Kumar1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Reed1">[44]</xref>. For CROP, we utilize LP relaxation, which is faster by orders-of-magnitude. Additional details for this algorithm along with comparisons to GrowMatch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Zomorrodi1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Kumar1">[42]</xref> and Model SEED <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Henry1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Henry2">[40]</xref> are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003126.s011">Text S3</xref>.</p>
<p>OnePrune was developed to efficiently solve the problem of removing reactions that are blocked. OnePrune utilizes the goal programming optimization framework to achieve multiple competing objectives. The advantage of this framework is that once an individual objective is achieved, the optimization can pursue other objectives. OnePrune's goals are to send flux through as many reactions as possible, so once a reaction has achieved a nonzero flux, OnePrune is free to pursue flux through other reactions. Thus, OnePrune identified which reactions could carry flux with a single compact linear program.</p>
<p>The third FARM algorithm, limed-FBA, is an enhancement to the FBA method that improves predictive accuracy. limed-FBA accounts for the dilution of active metabolites that is ignored by FBA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003126-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), so limed-FBA is able to correctly identify the essentiality of reactions that are typically missed by standard FBA. For example, FBA predicted that <italic>pab-1</italic> was not essential, because <italic>pab-1</italic> serves as input to a metabolic cycle; however, limed-FBA predicted that <italic>pab-1</italic> was essential. In fact, essentiality of <italic>pab-1</italic> was shown by the original experiment of Beadle and Tatum on <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Beadle1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Tatum1">[10]</xref>.</p>

<title>Curation of viability phenotype data</title>
<p>To curate our viability phenotype data, we primarily relied on two resources. The first was <italic>The Neurospora crassa e-Compendium</italic>, curated by Alan Radford. The e-Compendium contains &gt;2,400 citations and &gt;3,000 gene entries. Numerous gene entries have associated mutant phenotypes extracted from the literature. In some cases, these phenotypes also include supplements that rescue no-growth mutants. Because this resource primarily lists phenotypes from mutants that are not knockouts, viability of a mutant could be due to non-essentiality of a mutated gene or to partial efficacy of a mutated enzyme. Thus, this resource did not clearly identify non-essential genes. The second resource was knockouts from the <italic>Neurospora</italic> Genome Project <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Dunlap1">[27]</xref>. Knockouts that did not germinate and grow in a short time were not further evaluated to determine whether they showed low growth or no growth, so this project did not clearly identify essential genes.</p>
<p>To collect the essential gene sets, we first identified inviable mutants in the e-Compendium, and only retained genes for which we could manually verify their essentiality in the literature. To split the essential genes into a training set and a test set we intersected the list of inviable mutants in the e-Compendium with the list of heterokaryon knockouts from the <italic>Neurospora</italic> Genome Project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~neurosporagenome/knockouts_completed.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.dartmouth.edu/~neurosporagenome/knockouts_completed.html</ext-link>). Genes that were in the intersection became the test set, and the rest remained in the training set.</p>
<p>To collect the non-essential gene sets, we used the homokaryon knockouts from the <italic>Neurospora</italic> Genome Project <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Colot1">[82]</xref>, all of which were experimentally observed to be viable in Vogel's minimal media <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Alberghina1">[102]</xref>.

This subset became our non-essential training set, while the rest of the homokaryon knockouts became our non-essential test set. Homokaryon knockouts that were in the essential gene set were discarded.</p>
<p>Both the supplemental nutrient rescue training and test sets were initially identified from the e-Compendium and from the book <italic>Neurospora: Contributions of a Model Organism</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Davis1">[1]</xref>.

<title>limed-FBA</title>
<p>limed-FBA is a linear method which requires a metabolite's concentration to dilute slightly if and only if it is used in active reactions. We model this dilution implicitly by forcing metabolites to compensate for their dilution through <italic>accumulation</italic>. This accumulation can be modeled mathematically using the formalism of FBA, as follows.</p>
<p>Let <italic>S</italic> be a stoichiometric matrix of irreversible reactions (where reversible reactions are represented as two irreversible reactions in opposite directions), <italic>v</italic> be a vector of (non-negative) steady-state metabolic fluxes, and <italic>b</italic> represent a vector of the associated metabolite concentrations changes. Then<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003126.e002"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003126.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>To linearly account for metabolite accumulation, we would like to construct <italic>b</italic> as a linear function of <italic>v</italic> so that <italic>b</italic><sub>i</sub> is positive but small when metabolite <italic>i</italic> participates in active reactions, and <italic>b</italic><sub>i</sub> is zero otherwise.</p>
<p>To construct such a <italic>b</italic>, we first introduce the binary stoichiometric matrix, <italic>S</italic><sup>binary</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Becker1">[92]</xref>, whose element at row <italic>i</italic> and column <italic>j</italic> is 1 if and only if the corresponding element of <italic>S≠0</italic>. Now consider <italic>S</italic><sup>binary</sup><italic>v</italic> for a particular metabolite <italic>i</italic> (this is row <italic>i</italic> of <italic>S</italic><sup>binary</sup> multiplied by <italic>v</italic>). Because <italic>S</italic><sup>binary</sup> and <italic>v</italic> are both non-negative, element <italic>i</italic> of <italic>S</italic><sup>binary</sup><italic>v</italic> represents the sum of the absolute values of the fluxes that produce and consume metabolite <italic>i</italic>. This quantity is twice the turnover of metabolite <italic>i</italic>. Thus, if metabolite <italic>i</italic> does not participate in active reactions, then element <italic>i</italic> of <italic>S</italic><sup>binary</sup><italic>v</italic> is zero. Otherwise, if metabolite <italic>i</italic> does participate in active reactions, then element <italic>i</italic> of <italic>S</italic><sup>binary</sup><italic>v</italic> is positive.</p>
<p>To ensure that the dilution is small when metabolite <italic>i</italic> participates in active reactions, we multiply <italic>S</italic><sup>binary</sup><italic>v</italic> by ε, where ε is a diagonal matrix whose number of rows and columns is the number of metabolites, and its elements, <italic>ε</italic><sub>ii</sub>, are small non-negative constants that correspond to each metabolite <italic>i</italic>.</p>
<p>Thus, we set<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003126.e003"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003126.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>We then implement limed-FBA according to<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003126.e004"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003126.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>Note that this equation does not hold for all <italic>v</italic>; rather, it only holds for those <italic>v</italic> that are feasible in limed-FBA. This equation can be simplified to<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003126.e005"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003126.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>We assign <italic>ε</italic> so that no metabolite's dilution rate can exceed a pre-chosen constant. Here, we set dilution to never exceed 0.1; this choice gives dilution rates on par with those theoretically prescribed by MD-FBA. In general, we assign <italic>ε</italic><sub>ii</sub> to be<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003126.e006"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003126.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <italic>v</italic><sub>max</sub> is the overall upper bound on the fluxes. We used <italic>v</italic><sub>max</sub> = 1000.</p>
<p>Metabolites in biomass already dilute according to FBA. So that we do not double-dilute biomass metabolites, metabolites whose growth-associated dilution is already captured in the pre-defined biomass (e.g. DNA, RNA, protein) are assigned <italic>ε</italic><sub>ii</sub><italic> = 0</italic>.</p>
<p>The use of small numbers such as <italic>ε</italic><sub>ii</sub> can create numerical difficulties for optimization solvers, such as IBM ILOG CPLEX. We found that these errors were rare, only occurred when growth was impossible, and disappeared when trying an alternate linear programming solution method (e.g. the simplex method instead of a barrier method). An alternative that we didn't try is to use an exact solver or one with more precision <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Lerman1">[104]</xref>.</p>
<p>As a consequence of limed-FBA's linearity, limed-FBA allows more dilution for metabolites with more flux. This is associated with a potential pitfall. Consider a metabolite that is produced as a by-product of growth, but is not connected to an exporter. To maximize growth, this metabolite would need to be depleted. To deplete this metabolite, limed-FBA could potentially “cheat”: it could create a high-flux loop that includes the metabolite, so that the metabolite is allowed to dilute more. If a reaction includes multiple metabolites, then including it in a loop is more likely to have system-wide effects; conversely, reactions with fewer metabolites are less likely to have system-wide effects. In accord with this, we found that limed-FBA used simple transport reactions (e.g. L-glutamine[cytosol]↔L-glutamine[nucleus]) to “cheat.” To address this, we disallow simple transport reactions from contributing towards dilution. We define these simple transport reactions as those that transport metabolites, but involve no chemical change. This disallowance is implemented mathematically by assigning columns in <italic>S</italic><sup>binary</sup> that correspond to these simple transport reactions to be all zeroes.</p>

<title>OnePrune</title>
<p>OnePrune's goal is to send flux through as many reactions as possible given an unlimited amount of the available nutrients. Mathematically, it's defined as a linear goal program:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003126.e007"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003126.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <italic>S</italic> is a stoichiometric matrix consisting of <italic>n</italic> irreversible reactions. This program does not contain upper bounds on the available nutrient sources, so the only factor limiting reaction flux is connectivity. Thus, in the optimal solution, all <italic>t</italic><sub>i</sub>'s should be binary: reactions with <italic>t</italic><sub>i</sub> of one can carry flux, while the other reactions are blocked.</p>
<p>OnePrune requires an irreversible stoichiometric matrix, but any reversible stoichiometric matrix can be transformed into an irreversible one (by splitting reversible reactions into two irreversible reactions of opposite direction) so this method is completely general. This requirement exists because direct inclusion of a reversible stoichiometric matrix would force OnePrune to deal with absolute values of reaction flux in a manner not amenable to linear programming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Shanno1">[105]</xref>. Moreover, only an irreversible stoichiometric matrix allows OnePrune to distinguish between different directions of the same reaction.</p>
<p>The set of blocked reactions of an irreversible stoichiometric matrix may differ slightly from those of a reversible stoichiometric matrix. For example, consider a reversible reaction between two metabolites disconnected from the metabolic network: A↔B. In an irreversible stoichiometric matrix, this would be modeled as two reactions: A→B and A ← B. Thus, the reversible reaction is blocked, whereas the two irreversible reactions could carry flux as part of a flux cycle according to FBA. To address this, we implemented OnePrune according to limed-FBA by using S<sub>limed</sub> as the stoichiometric matrix. This implementation disallows cycles that lack an input flux, so it disallows the cycle of A→B and A ← B. However, limed-FBA does allow some cycles—namely, those not penalized in S<sub>limed</sub> and those that have an input flux. Thus, reversible reactions that form such cycles (e.g. A[cytosol]↔A[extracellular]) will not be pruned by OnePrune. However, these reversible reactions can be identified <italic>a priori</italic> and addressed with Flux Variability Analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Mahadevan1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Gudmundsson1">[58]</xref> or the method of Jerby et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003126-Jerby1">[51]</xref>. Furthermore, reversible reactions that form such cycles are rare, and we found that OnePrune's determination of blocked reactions was identical to that of Flux Variability Analysis in practice.</p>
<p>To apply OnePrune to achieve our final pruned model, we allowed all extracellular metabolites in our model to be treated as nutrients.</p>

Furthermore, enough oxygen is present to generate the NAD+ required by the TCA cycle, which converts all the pyruvate to CO2 and water, resulting in no ethanol production.
