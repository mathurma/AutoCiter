<abstract>
<p>Hebbian forms of synaptic plasticity are required for the orderly development of sensory circuits in the brain and are powerful modulators of learning and memory in adulthood. During development, emergence of Hebbian plasticity leads to formation of functional circuits. By modeling the dynamics of neurotransmitter release during early postnatal cortical development we show that a developmentally regulated switch in vesicle exocytosis mode triggers associative (i.e. Hebbian) plasticity. Early in development spontaneous vesicle exocytosis (SVE), often considered as 'synaptic noise', is important for homogenization of synaptic weights and maintenance of synaptic weights in the appropriate dynamic range. Our results demonstrate that SVE has a permissive, whereas subsequent evoked vesicle exocytosis (EVE) has an instructive role in the expression of Hebbian plasticity. A timed onset for Hebbian plasticity can be achieved by switching from SVE to EVE and the balance between SVE and EVE can control the effective rate of Hebbian plasticity. We further show that this developmental switch in neurotransmitter release mode enables maturation of spike-timing dependent plasticity. A mis-timed or inadequate SVE to EVE switch may lead to malformation of brain networks thereby contributing to the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Neurotransmitter release is the principal form of chemical communication in the brain. When an action potential reaches a synapse, calcium influx activates the machinery for neurotransmitter release. During early neuronal development this machinery matures such that neurotransmitter release becomes time-locked to action potentials. By modeling this change in neurotransmitter release, we mechanistically show that the maturation process can be solely responsible for switching on associative (i.e. Hebbian) plasticity in the brain. The relevant proteins of the release machinery can thereby regulate the rate at which neural circuits represent sensory input, providing a novel mechanism to control the learning rate and onset. Appropriately timing of the onset of Hebbian plasticity is important because during early development sensory experience fine-tunes, often irreversibly, the neural wiring in our brain.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Functional circuits in the brain are rapidly established during early development and are fine-tuned by experience throughout life. In the rodent neocortex, for example, cortical columns form in the first three weeks after birth [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. During this period, thalamo-cortical input is essential for columnar formation [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and stimulus-evoked activity patterns further refine cortical connectivity [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Activity-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity, in particular Hebbian plasticity, guide the cortical refinement and are required for functional maturation of cortical circuits [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although the postsynaptic pathways involved in the developmental stages of synaptic plasticity are well characterized (e.g. [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]), the cellular mechanism on the presynaptic side that triggers the onset of Hebbian plasticity is still unclear [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Early in development, pre- and postsynaptic structures are co-localized, even in the absence of any action potential activity [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], while functional connectivity emerges later in development [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Initially, synapses are thus established, but functional communication between neurons is lacking. During this initial phase, spontaneous vesicle exocytosis can help to maintain synapses [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Reduced vesicle release during development reduces the rate of synapse formation (for review see [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]). Here we studied the role of vesicle exocytosis for maturation of associative plasticity. We propose that a switch in vesicular exocytosis mode ensures a discrete onset for Hebbian plasticity and triggers the activity-dependent neural circuit formation during neurodevelopment.</p>
<p>The mode of vesicular exocytosis changes rapidly during early development [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In immature synapses, neurotransmitter vesicles spontaneously fuse with the membrane whether or not there was a preceding action potential (spontaneous vesicle exocytosis, SVE), whereas in mature synapses evoked vesicle exocytosis (EVE) dominates synaptic communication [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. EVE can occur within an interval of several milliseconds (synchronously evoked vesicle exocytosis (sEVE)) or delayed up to several hundred milliseconds (asynchronous evoked vesicle exocytosis (aEVE)) after the action potential (<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Each mode of vesicle exocytosis has the ability to coordinate activity across a synapse, potentially leading to associative plasticity in neural networks. Immature neurons, due to their high input resistance, small size, slow membrane time constant and prolonged decay constant of the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], have a relatively high probability to generate an action potential resulting from postsynaptic integration of uncorrelated synaptic inputs (SVE). The impact of vesicle exocytosis on synaptic communication changes with development. With reduced input resistance and a faster decay of EPSP [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] the postsynaptic window of opportunity for coincidence detection is shortened such that only temporally correlated presynaptic activity (EVE) can be efficiently integrated by the postsynaptic neuron.</p>

When EVE mode dominates the release process, there will be competition between synapses of neurons that have low (left presynaptic neuron) and high (right presynaptic neuron) firing rates, with the former decreasing in strength and the latter increasing in strength (top and middle synapses). There is no such competition for SVE dominated synapses (bottom synapses). <bold>C</bold>: Vesicle exocytosis is initially dominated by SVE, which maintains the synaptic strength distribution.

The SVE-EVE balance can thus act to control the divergence rate during synaptic competition.</p>

<p>While the molecular mechanisms for the three principal modes of vesicle exocytosis (SVE, aEVE, sEVE) have been characterized [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], the functional role for SVE and aEVE is currently not clear [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Here, by modeling the developmental changes in exocytosis mode, we show that SVE optimally prepares neural circuits for learning by maintaining synaptic weights in the appropriate dynamic range and homogenizing the synaptic weights into a tight homogeneous distribution. A switch to EVE initiates a period of rapid synaptic plasticity where synaptic input can be efficiently stored in the network. The SVE-EVE balance regulates the rate of Hebbian plasticity in the synapse and learning in neuronal networks. Besides the role of asynchronous exocytosis in gain modulation [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], we show that increased locking of vesicle exocytosis to the action potential causes maturation of the STDP rule [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These results argue that SVE, often considered as 'synaptic noise', plays an important role in synaptic plasticity during neurodevelopment and predict that a developmentally regulated switch in the mode of vesicular exocytosis contributes to the activity dependent organization of the developing circuits.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Effective communication across a chemical synapse starts with vesicular exocytosis and subsequent diffusion of neurotransmitters to the postsynaptic terminal. We studied the effect of the three primary modes of vesicular exocytosis (SVE, aEVE and sEVE) on synaptic competition between synapses using a vesicle-timing dependent plasticity model, where presynaptic neurotransmitter release correlated with postsynaptic activity was necessary for Hebbian plasticity. We subsequently used a rate model to characterize the differential effects of the vesicle exocytosis modes on the ability of a neural network to represent a particular pattern of action potentials in matching synaptic weights.</p>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Vesicle-timing dependent plasticity (VTDP)–modeling framework</title>
<p>Most computational studies of synaptic plasticity with spiking neurons use a spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) rule [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], implicitly assuming that a presynaptic action potential leads to correlated vesicle exocytosis within a short interval. We focus on the timing of vesicular exocytosis, irrespective of whether it is preceded by presynaptic action potentials, leading to vesicle-timing dependent plasticity (VTDP model). Vesicles that are exocytosed within a canonical STDP time window contribute to time-dependent weight changes as described by the STDP model (<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.e007" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq (7)</xref>).</p>
<p>Vesicle exocytosis can occur in three different modes (<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). For SVE, exocytosis is independent of the arrival of an action potential at the presynaptic terminal [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For aEVE, exocytosis depends on the calcium concentration and the timing of exocytosis is therefore only loosely coupled to an action potential; each action potential induces a presynaptic calcium influx, whose intracellular concentration exponentially decays. For sEVE, exocytosis immediately follows an action potential.</p>
<p>To study synaptic competition using the VTDP model, we simulated a network model comprised of feed-forward connections from 500 presynaptic neurons to 10 postsynaptic neurons. A subset of the presynaptic neurons (20%) had a higher firing rate (8 Hz) compared to the rest (4 Hz). We used a Poisson process to generate action potentials at these rates. In turn, vesicle exocytosis from the presynaptic terminal was modeled as Poisson processes for SVE, aEVE and sEVE. In the model the probability of exocytosis depended on proteins that are available to support each of the different exocytosis modes. The switch from SVE to EVE is implemented by reducing the fraction of vesicles that are available for SVE and increasing the fraction of vesicles that are available for aEVE or sEVE such that the sum of the fractions remains constant. The probability for vesicle exocytosis also depended on the fraction of available vesicles at the synapse (Eq (<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.e003" ref-type="disp-formula">3</xref>)).</p>
<p>The rate of vesicle release for sEVE was directly related to the firing rate of each neuron. The release rate of SVE was scaled with the mean firing rate of all presynaptic neurons to obtain the same mean release rate as EVE. The rate of asynchronous release depended on the amount of residual Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which decays exponentially (Eq (<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.e004" ref-type="disp-formula">4</xref>)). The total amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entering the presynaptic terminal in response to a single action potential was also scaled to yield the same mean release rate as the other exocytosis modes. Thus, to effectively titrate the differential contribution of the release rate to synaptic plasticity, the cumulative release was normalized such that the mean and total vesicle release rates were equal for the three modes of neurotransmission.</p>
<p>An exocytosed vesicle was moved from the active pool to the recycling pool. Recovery from the recycling pool to the active pool was modeled as an exponential process (Eq (<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.e005" ref-type="disp-formula">5</xref>), [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]). The neurotransmitters released from each vesicle induced an excitatory postsynaptic current that decayed within several ms. We used leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with an adaptive spike threshold for the postsynaptic neurons. A homeostatic rule kept the firing rate of the postsynaptic neurons at the desired dynamic range (~5 Hz) by scaling the synaptic weights accordingly (Eq (<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.e008" ref-type="disp-formula">8</xref>)).</p>
<p>Thus, for SVE, vesicle exocytosis was spatially (across synapses belonging to the same neuron) and temporally (across time within individual synapses) random and was not coupled to the onset of presynaptic action potential (<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). For aEVE, vesicle exocytosis was spatially biased to synapses belonging to presynaptic neurons with higher firing rates, but it was temporally diffuse (<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). For sEVE the vesicle exocytosis was both temporally and spatially linked to the spiking activity of the neurons (<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec004">
<title>Spontaneous exocytosis has a permissive and evoked exocytosis has an instructive role in Hebbian plasticity</title>
<p>Synaptic plasticity leads to competition between synapses when presynaptic cells are active at different rates [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In the VTDP model, synapses that were active prior to a postsynaptic action potential were strengthened whereas the others were weakened. We used the VTDP model to study how the three vesicle exocytosis modes contribute to synaptic competition. When synaptic communication was mediated by SVE alone, the chemical neurotransmission did not lead to competition between synapses onto the same postsynaptic neuron, and maintained synaptic weight distribution to a homogeneous distribution, also referred to as a unimodal distribution (<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). Introducing a (partial) switch to either aEVE or sEVE caused divergence between synaptic weights for the synapses of the high and low firing rate neurons. The gradual change in synaptic efficacy results in a heterogeneous synaptic efficacy distribution in the network, with synapses that were either weak or strong, but fewer of the intermediate strength (referred to as multimodal). The amount of divergence (the degree of separation between high and low synaptic weights) between synapses of the low- and high firing rate neurons depended on the SVE-EVE balance (<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). When vesicle exocytosis was dominated by EVE we found that asynchronous exocytosis resulted in a moderate, and synchronous exocytosis resulted in a strong drive to increase the synaptic weights of the higher firing presynaptic neurons at the expense of synapses of the lower firing rate neurons (<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>). The SVE-EVE balance regulated the rate at which synaptic competition occurred (<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>). Correlated input could thus shape the structure of the network via EVE. As the rates of vesicle exocytosis onto the postsynaptic neuron were normalized such that they are equal for the three modes, this difference in outcome is caused by their spatiotemporal structure of the synaptic inputs to the postsynaptic neuron. This model of vesicle-timing dependent plasticity shows that the SVE-EVE balance can regulate the rate with which new patterns of action potentials are imprinted into synaptic weights. A switch from SVE to EVE enables a discrete onset for Hebbian plasticity and initiates a period at which synaptic weights rapidly rewire to represent dominant sensory activity. The SVE-EVE balance can control the rate of Hebbian plasticity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec005">
<title>Additional functional roles for SVE</title>
<p>In addition to the above described functional role for SVE to control the rate of Hebbian plasticity, we explored other functional roles for SVE. We first compared the effect of SVE (<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>) to that of EVE with uncorrelated spiking activity (<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>) on the distribution of synaptic weights. We found that SVE homogenizes the synaptic weights into a tighter weight distribution compared to EVE (<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). SVE events occur more diffusely compared to EVE, and furthermore the larger EPSC inputs from EVE result in stronger correlations between pre- and postsynaptic spiking. Thus, an additional functional role of SVE is homogenization into a tight synaptic weight distribution and increased stability against synaptic weight fluctuations compared to EVE. Homogenization is also important for synaptogenesis, because newly formed synapses with small initial weights grow stronger and become incorporated into the synaptic pool (<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Next we asked whether SVE during early development was necessary at all; and what would happen for a gradual increase in EVE in the absence of SVE. Synaptic fluctuations as well as divergence in synaptic weights due to differences in firing rate can be prevented by completely abolishing vesicle release (no SVE, no EVE). If neither SVE nor EVE are present, synaptic weights become saturated due to the homeostatic mechanism (<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004386.e008" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq (8)</xref>). If EVE increases gradually during development, synaptic weights also increase due to the homeostatic mechanism, while remaining heterogeneously distributed (<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>). Thus SVE is necessary to maintain synaptic weights in the appropriate dynamic range. SVE and EVE release mechanisms thereby both serve a biological role in synapse formation and synaptic maintenance [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>

<p>After the switch from SVE to EVE and subsequent changes in synaptic weight distribution across synapses occurred, the network now consists of a few strong synapses among many other weak ones [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This change in synaptic weight distribution shapes the network’s ability to encode patterns of action potentials and translate them into memory traces. We aimed to establish the differential roles of the exocytosis modes in the activity dependent organization of cortical circuits. The VTDP model implements the plasticity terms and vesicle exocytosis times separately for each synapse. Such operations are on matrices of size N<sub>i</sub> x N<sub>o</sub> (number of input neurons x number of output neurons), which is computationally more demanding than the classical STDP modeling which generates spike times and thus works with operations on vectors of size N<sub>i</sub> and N<sub>o</sub>. We therefore used a rate model that represents vesicle-timing dependent plasticity, consisting of a similar structure and that can be implemented with better computational efficiency (<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). The rate model will help other computational studies that want to conduct follow-up studies to implement our model efficiently. The exocytosis rates are a combination of SVE (randomly distributed across synapses) and EVE (strong for the subset of highly active presynaptic neurons). The evolution of synaptic weights is then followed over time. Synaptic efficacy is potentiated for synapses with high vesicle exocytosis rates at the expense of synapses that have lower rate of exocytosis (<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>Each network was initialized either without any particular structure, with each synaptic strength set randomly according to a unimodal distribution, or with a previously encoded weight pattern, comprised of a bimodal distribution of low and high values, that is different from the pattern presented (<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). While no pattern of action potentials could be stored during SVE, synaptic communication through EVE introduces competition that enables storage of the patterns of action potentials (<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). A switch from SVE to EVE thus generates a window of opportunity for a cortical network to rewire as instructed by experience. Rewiring an established circuit after the switch takes significantly more time than starting from a homogeneous state without patterns of action potentials imprinted (<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>SVE can thus be used to maintain baseline network activity and unspecific network connectivity, and the SVE-EVE balance regulates the rate at which time neural circuits are shaped by patterns of action potentials.</p>

<title>The developmental switch from SVE to EVE during human brain development</title>
<p>How is the SVE-EVE balance regulated? An initial suggestion that SVE and EVE might utilize distinct vesicle pools [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] was accompanied by a concerted research effort to characterize the differential regulatory pathways that impact vesicle exocytosis (for reviews, see [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]). Optical recordings from developing neurons <italic>in vitro</italic> demonstrated a switch from SVE to predominantly EVE as neurons matured [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The switch to EVE at the synaptic terminal occurs independent from whether there is functional communication with a postsynaptic neuron, suggesting a cell-autonomous process [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Investigations in cell-autonomous regulation of vesicle exocytosis focus on the functional properties of the proteins involved in the docking of vesicles to the presynaptic membrane such as the SNARE proteins Syntaxin, SNAP-25, and VAMP2/Synaptobrevin and a core set of SNARE-binding proteins: Synaptotagmin, Munc13, Munc18, Doc2 and Complexin [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
<p>Exocytosis of vesicles docked at the active zone in the presynaptic terminal is mediated by calcium-sensitive proteins. Calcium sensitivity and kinetics of vesicle exocytosis depends on the calcium sensors expressed. The presence of high-affinity calcium sensor Doc2b increases the fraction of SVE exocytosis [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], which might also act completely independent of presynaptic action potential induced calcium entry [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Doc2a on the other hand facilitates aEVE [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. sEVE is mediated by Synaptotagmin1, which is selectively enhanced by Complexin that can act as a fusion clamp or adaptor to inhibit SVE and aEVE [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] (<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>).</p>

<title>During cortical development there is a switch from exocytosis dominated by spontaneous exocytosis to asynchronous and synchronous vesicle exocytosis.</title>
<p><bold>A</bold>: The SVE-EVE balance is regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensing proteins (Doc2s and synaptotagmins). Complexin1 promotes Synaptotagmin1 mediated synchronous exocytosis while blocking Spontaneous and asynchronous exocytosis [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. <bold>B</bold>: In humans, the relative mRNA expression of these sensors varies in time. Early in development there are high levels of Doc2b (SVE, black line), which decay during the intermediate developmental stage at which time there is an increase in Doc2a (aEVE, green line) expression. The expression of Synaptotagmin1/Complexin1 (sEVE, red lines) increases throughout neurodevelopment, reaching their maximal expression levels during late development [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. <bold>C</bold>: By implementing the mRNA expression levels as ratios for SVE, aEVE and sEVE, a period of rapid learning is observed early in development during which SVE decreases and aEVE and sEVE increase. During this period the wiring in the neural circuitry is formed, after which the learning rate decreases. Gray shade is standard deviation. <bold>D</bold>: During early developmental periods synaptogenesis is prominent, until activity-dependent pruning reduces the synaptic density later in life.</p>

<p>The expression of these calcium sensors varies across time, which is reflected in the corresponding mRNA expression levels. We re-analyzed the human transcriptome [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] for mRNA expression profiles of the calcium sensitive proteins during neurodevelopment and found high Doc2b expression early in development was followed by a peak in Doc2a, while Synaptotagmin1/Complexin1 became prominent during early childhood (<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). These profiles are consistent with a switch from high SVE to aEVE early in development and dominant sEVE at later developmental stages. To study the developmental learning rate, the SVE, aEVE and sEVE ratio profiles were used to mimic a biological situation. The synapses belonging to the higher firing rate neurons strengthen at the expense of the synapses belonging to the lower firing rate neurons (for EVE, not for SVE). The learning rate (see <xref rid="pcbi.1004386.e009" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq (9)</xref> in the <xref rid="sec011" ref-type="sec">Materials &amp; Methods</xref>) diminishes if the synaptic weights approach their upper and lower bounds, which resulted in a learning rate peak around infancy (<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). During development, new synapses were formed [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and weak synapses were pruned ([<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], see <xref rid="sec011" ref-type="sec">Materials &amp; Methods</xref>). Early in development the rate of synaptogenesis was larger than the rate of synaptic pruning, which caused a rise in synaptic density (<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). After EVE became more dominant, the rate of synaptic pruning became larger than synaptogenesis, which caused a decrease in synaptic density.</p>
<p>The SVE-EVE switch thus coincides in time with the early stages in human neurodevelopment [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. There is a rapid increase in synaptogenesis around the time of birth for all cortical areas, while a burst of synapse formation occurs at different ages in cortical regions [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In the visual cortex, for example, synapse formation is accelerated between 3 and 4 months and the maximum density is reached between 4 and 12 months, while synaptogenesis in the prefrontal cortex reaches its peak well after the first year [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. After the peak in synaptic density, corresponding to about 150% of adult levels, a sensitive period with high levels of associative plasticity occurs, whereas plasticity that occurs beyond the end of this sensitive period alters connectivity patterns within the architectural constraints established during the sensitive period [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The switch from SVE to EVE triggers a period of rapid synaptic competition, mediated by synaptic depression and potentiation according to Hebbian plasticity rules. This may seem trivial, but it has important functional consequences for neural circuit development, as we will highlight here. In general, the switch provides a framework for understanding the onset of synaptic plasticity in circuit formation during neurodevelopment by mechanistically linking the onset to the developmental changes in vesicular exocytosis of neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>While the molecular mechanisms for vesicle exocytosis are well described, the functional roles of SVE and aEVE are unclear [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Our VTDP model showed that early in development, in the absence of relevant sensory input, SVE maintains synaptic weights in a homogeneous distribution and within the appropriate dynamic range. Molecular changes at the presynaptic terminal can then switch vesicle release from SVE to EVE. We propose that this SVE to EVE switch enables sensory inputs to fine-tune the circuit connectivity using activity dependent synaptic reorganization (<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>, [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]). The transition from SVE to EVE can initiate a window of strong associative plasticity, during which for example local connectivity can be reorganized extensively by activity-dependent mechanisms of plasticity such that the appropriate feature selectivity is established in the network [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Similar to the switch from immature (P9-11 in mice) to mature (P12+) visual responses, a switch from endogenous network oscillations to mature visual responses occurs at birth in human [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Children born prematurely have deficits in visual acuity and contrast sensitivity compared to children born at full term [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p>
<p>The SVE to EVE switch involves molecular changes at the presynaptic terminal and brain regions could open windows for rapid synaptic reorganization in a specifically programmed temporal order. Hierarchical organization of sensory-motor pathways may develop through a cascade of such windows for plasticity [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The sequential opening of such windows was for example observed for the visual cortex, where plasticity for inputs to L2/3 extends beyond the window of plasticity for thalamic inputs to L4 [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p>
<p>For an understanding of circuit plasticity during development, one needs to take into account the synaptic learning rule, the spike activity patterns present, and the timescales of their information content [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. For example, the timescales at which STDP operates can change the effectiveness of synapse refinement, and specifically STDP over short timescales does not necessarily lead to the appropriate circuit refinement during early development [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. During development correlations in spike activity patterns become faster, which can further change the efficacy of STDP [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Importantly, the developmental switch that we found was observable for different timescales of STDP and thus timescale independent.</p>
<p>Burst-based Hebbian learning rules, which integrate spike activity patterns over longer timescales, play a role in cortical refinement [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. For burst-based plasticity, LTP is favored over LTD [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Vesicle exocytosis in the form of aEVE (vesicles are released asynchronously after an action potential) could be considered a miniburst of vesicle exocytosis. Such a miniburst of vesicles introduces multiple pairings of vesicles with a postsynaptic spike as opposed to sEVE (vesicles are released directly after an action potential and have the same temporal relation to the postsynaptic spike). The release in the form of aEVE could thus bias the VTDP rule towards LTP over LTD early in development [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p>
<p>Neural responses become increasingly time-locked to stimuli during development [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Using the VTDP model, we show that the transition to action potential-dependent release can explain the maturation of the STDP rule observed in the somatosensory cortex ([<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], <xref rid="pcbi.1004386.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). The VTDP model thus links together the experimental observation of increased action potential-dependent input, receptive field refinement to the home column of sensory input and maturation of STDP that coincide in time during early postnatal development. Although plasticity mechanisms in the postsynaptic neuron change during development [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], our model does not depend on the molecular machinery for plasticity in the postsynaptic neuron. Solely by introducing changes in the presynaptic release machinery, our VTDP model can mechanistically elucidate the functional changes, structural reorganization and maturation of activity-dependent plasticity that occur during early neurodevelopment.</p>
<p>The early postnatal development is accompanied by periods with rapid, often irreversible changes [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], including but not limited to maturation of inhibition [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. A modeling study shows that the maturation of inhibition can initiate a critical period by preferentially suppressing spontaneous spiking activity relative to visually evoked activity [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. For this mechanism to be effective it should occur after the SVE-EVE switch, otherwise no evoked activity could be preferentially selected. Furthermore, the maturation of inhibition effectively increases the spiking threshold which affects all synapses simultaneously, whereas a SVE-EVE switch could initiate competition between synapses based on the identity of the presynaptic populations, thereby regulating synaptic plasticity in a region, layer or neuron type specific manner. The balance between SVE and EVE was shown to segregate between synapses, allowing the SVE-EVE switch to occur in a synapse specific manner [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The increase in inhibition could further functionalize the SVE-EVE switch by the selective suppression of SVE relative to EVE [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, the increased threshold caused by the maturation of inhibition could be compensated by homeostatic upscaling of all synapses, potentially abolishing the effect of inhibition.</p>
<p>The results presented herein shows that SVE independently and single-handedly places synaptic rewiring on hold, and switching to EVE induces a period of rapid, activity-dependent changes. Once the neural circuit is wired to represent particular sensory features, rewiring is significantly more difficult and requires disproportionately more vesicular neurotransmission.</p>
<sec id="sec010">
<title>The cell-autonomous regulation of the SVE-EVE balance</title>
<p>At the presynaptic terminal, proteins involved in the exocytotic machinery determine the SVE-EVE balance. The expression of the relevant calcium sensitive proteins can be genetically regulated, and evidence for a cell-autonomous switch from SVE to EVE has previously been shown <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Despite the fact that both SVE and EVE have the potential to drive Hebbian plasticity across the synapse, it is unclear how, where and when Hebbian plasticity develops in the first place [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The model presented here mechanistically links the mode of vesicular exocytosis to Hebbian plasticity during neural development. As the switch from SVE to EVE is genetically regulated, it is an ideal candidate mechanism to initiate region, layer and cell specific onset of Hebbian plasticity. Specific regulation of the onset of Hebbian plasticity is, for example, important for a hierarchical system in order to optimally deal with the input statistics, such that sensitivity to low-level features (i.e. orientation) develop prior to rewiring the circuits that deal with high-level features (i.e. object recognition) [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p>
<p>Neural circuits dealing with sensory information first establish diffuse connectivity with broad receptive fields, followed by selection and refinement of the projections (<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>, [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]). Whereas electrophysiological recordings of neural circuit development can be biased towards characterizing high firing rate neurons, the role of the SVE-EVE balance is optimally studied with optical and molecular techniques that can assess specific cell activity and collect large population statistics without bias [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Further development of molecular techniques to regulate and track the cellular content of the SVE-EVE balance together with optical recording techniques is necessary for fundamental insights in the role of vesicular exocytosis on the structural and functional aspects of synapse maturation and maintenance during neural development.</p>
<p>Our results predict that SVE plays a permissive role in the expression of synaptic plasticity and is important for the maintenance of synaptic strengths by disconnecting the action potential-dependent activity during early neurodevelopment. In agreement with this proposition, selective disturbance of SVE release in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromotor junction alters the structural organization of the synapses during development [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p>
<p>Understanding the specificity of cell-autonomous regulation of the SVE-EVE balance across time and brain region will provide important insight into the maturation of synaptic wiring and creation of functional networks during brain development. An SVE-EVE imbalance might result in learning deficits because functional circuits would not be appropriately formed by sensory experience in the absence of the regulated switch in the mode of neurotransmitter release. As such, deregulation of the molecular pathways of the three modes of vesicle exocytosis might contribute to the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders. For example, the expression of Complexin1, a protein that suppresses SVE and enhances EVE, is dysregulated in patients with schizophrenia, depression and bipolar disorder [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Complexin1 knock-out mice show developmental deficits [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Hence understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying vesicle exocytosis in relation to developmental regulation of Hebbian plasticity may lead to the rational design of treatments that could alleviate learning deficits early in neural development.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>To study the role of exocytosis mode on Hebbian plasticity without assumptions regarding structure of the network, we use a feed-forward connection scheme. An input pattern consists of a subset of upstream (presynaptic) excitatory neurons with higher firing rates relative to the rates of the other neurons. The competitive input in vivo can originate from an over-representation of particular sensory inputs or variability in neural excitability [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. We apply homeostatic plasticity [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] to maintain the firing rates of the postsynaptic neurons within a certain range (~5 Hz), which also ensures competition between the synaptic inputs.</p>
<p>The vesicles can be exocytosed according to three different mechanisms each represented by a fraction, which can vary because it reflects the presynaptic protein content of the relevant Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive proteins for SVE, aEVE and sEVE (<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>, [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]). After vesicle exocytosis, the postsynaptic membrane is depolarized, through which each released vesicle can contribute to a time-dependent learning effect. In the case of aEVE and sEVE, the resulting connectivity pattern is comprised of a few strong connections among many weak connections (Figs <xref rid="pcbi.1004386.g001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004386.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Reference [<xref rid="pcbi.1004386.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]).</p>

<p>We describe vesicle exocytosis in terms of the rate of Poisson processes for SVE, aEVE and sEVE.

<p>The network consists of 500 input neurons that are connected to 10 output neurons. A subset of neurons that has high firing rates represent neurons with receptive fields that are strongly activated by external stimuli. The presynaptic neurons produce Poisson distributed action potentials according to a probability p<sub>s</sub> = r<sub>i</sub> * Δt. Initially, SVE equilibrates the network to the desired firing rate (<italic>r</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>), leading to a mean synaptic weight <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub><italic>(0)</italic>.

<p>Learning has occurred when the distribution of synaptic weights has become bimodal.
