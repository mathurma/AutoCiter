<abstract>
<p>Catch-up growth after insults to growing organs is paramount to achieving robust body proportions. In fly larvae, injury to individual tissues is followed by local and systemic compensatory mechanisms that allow the damaged tissue to regain normal proportions with other tissues. In vertebrates, local catch-up growth has been described after transient reduction of bone growth, but the underlying cellular responses are controversial. We developed an approach to study catch-up growth in foetal mice in which mosaic expression of the cell cycle suppressor p21 is induced in the cartilage cells (chondrocytes) that drive long-bone elongation. By specifically targeting p21 expression to left hindlimb chondrocytes, the right limb serves as an internal control. Unexpectedly, left–right limb symmetry remained normal, revealing deployment of compensatory mechanisms. Above a certain threshold of insult, an orchestrated response was triggered involving local enhancement of bone growth and systemic growth reduction that ensured that body proportions were maintained. The local response entailed hyperproliferation of spared left limb chondrocytes that was associated with reduced chondrocyte density. The systemic effect involved impaired placental function and IGF signalling, revealing bone–placenta communication. Therefore, vertebrates, like invertebrates, can mount coordinated local and systemic responses to developmental insults that ensure that normal body proportions are maintained.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The coordination of organ growth is necessary to attain correct individual organ sizes and body proportions. While extensive studies in insects have revealed that both intra-organ and inter-organ communication mechanisms are involved in regulating organ growth, vertebrate studies have lagged behind. Here, we developed a new mouse model to examine cellular mechanisms underlying growth regulation after a developmental insult. The cell cycle suppressor p21 was expressed in the cartilage that drives growth of the long bones, targeting the left limb exclusively and leaving the right limb as an internal control. By triggering the insult during the last gestational week, we found that left–right limb symmetry was maintained due to the following 2 compensatory mechanisms: (1) hyperproliferation of the spared cells within the targeted cartilage, which indicates that these cells respond to a signal coming from the arrested cells, and (2) a growth reduction in the rest of the body, an effect that correlates with changes in the levels of placental insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signalling and that can be rescued by boosting placental efficiency. These results reveal that the response to developmental insults is quite evolutionarily conserved across species as well as open new avenues of future research for the development of therapies to treat growth disorders.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>An important question in biology is how cells integrate intrinsic and extrinsic information such that their combined behaviours produce higher-order processes and structures, as seen during organogenesis and tissue repair. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, injured imaginal discs can undergo compensatory proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref001">1</xref>] as well as secrete an alarm signal that triggers both a systemic developmental delay and reduced growth of the spared imaginal discs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref005">5</xref>]. Together, these processes allow the damaged tissue(s) to catch-up with other tissues, but the role of damaged versus undamaged cells remains controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref007">7</xref>]. In vertebrates, systemic growth reduction after injury in a nonessential organ has not been reported. However, systemic catch-up growth has been described after transient impairment of whole-body growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref010">10</xref>], and local growth compensation can occur after unilateral manipulation of long bones within the limbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref011">11</xref>]. Tight control of inter-limb and limb–body proportions are critical for efficient locomotion and interaction with the environment, and therefore long bones are an excellent model for studies of growth regulation.</p>
<p>Growth of the long bones is driven by a process called endochondral ossification (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref013">13</xref>]). Once mesenchymal cells condense into the template of the skeletal elements, they differentiate into collagen II–expressing chondrocytes that go through sequential differentiation steps from bone ends to centre. Round resting chondrocytes give rise to flat proliferative cells that form columns and, after a few rounds of duplication, cease proliferation and start to differentiate into hypertrophic chondrocytes. These cells increase their volume as they progress towards the centre of the shaft, lay down a collagen X–rich extracellular matrix, and secrete factors that recruit vasculature and bone precursors (osteoblasts) from the perichondrium, a fibrous layer that wraps the cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref015">15</xref>]. Some hypertrophic chondrocytes die by apoptosis, while others transdifferentiate into osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref017">17</xref>]. Osteoblasts form the primary ossification centre by replacing the original matrix with bone. This process is later repeated at the ends of the bone (epiphyses), forming the secondary ossification centres. The so-called growth plate remains as a cartilage disc between the primary and secondary ossification centres and responds to both intrinsic and extrinsic factors that ultimately regulate bone length. For example, indian hedgehog (IHH), secreted by pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes, and parathyroid hormone-like peptide, secreted by resting chondrocytes, form a negative feedback loop that couples chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref013">13</xref>]). This loop is the main conduit through which other local signals, such as fibroblast growth factors and bone morphogenetic proteins, exert their function, often impacting on the expression of key transcription factors. A number of systemic and local extrinsic signals (growth hormone, insulin-like growth factors [IGFs]) also play crucial roles in the modulation of chondrocyte activity and bone growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref019">19</xref>]. As per the regulation of growth after an insult, it has been proposed that bone catch-up growth is due to a cell-autonomous delay in the normal developmental decline of chondrocyte proliferation, such that when the insult is lifted, the formerly arrested chondrocytes retain a higher proliferative potential correlating with the stage at arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref020">20</xref>]. It was suggested that a similar mechanism applies to other organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref021">21</xref>]. However, the possible contribution of unaffected cells has not been examined, which is important because a cell-autonomous mechanism does not account for cases in which catch-up growth is faster than expected for the observed maturation delay (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref022">22</xref>]).</p>
<p>Here, we developed new mouse models to transiently decrease long-bone growth in mice in order to determine the contributions of cell-autonomous and nonautonomous regulation during catch-up growth. Namely, we blocked proliferation in 50% of the cartilage chondrocytes that drive long-bone elongation, specifically in the left hindlimbs, such that the right limb remains as an internal control. Unexpectedly, left–right symmetry was maintained, revealing the deployment of compensatory mechanisms. Locally, we observed hyperproliferation of wild-type (WT) chondrocytes that mostly compensated for the lack of proliferation of their arrested neighbours. Systemically, a mild growth reduction affected the rest of the body, contributing to maintenance of limb–body proportions. In summary, our results reveal that long-bone catch-up growth shares some similarities with the response of imaginal discs to developmental insults in insects. We found that this response is mostly cell nonautonomous, representing a paradigm shift in the field that opens up new research avenues for basic and translational studies.</p>

<title>An intersectional genetic approach enables inducible p21 misexpression preferentially in left limb chondrocytes</title>
<p>A major roadblock for studies of intra- and inter-organ growth regulation in mouse embryos has been a lack of models in which growth rate can be altered in a specific cell type within an organ, and ideally in only one of two paired organs, leaving the unmanipulated organ as an internal control. To address this deficiency, we devised new mouse models of inducible and transient growth inhibition in the left limb. We generated an <italic>Igs7</italic><sup><italic>TRE-LtSL-p21/+</italic></sup> allele, a variant of a double-conditional allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref023">23</xref>], to achieve doxycycline (Dox)-tuneable misexpression of the cell cycle suppressor <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> (<italic>p21</italic> hereafter) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref024">24</xref>] in the cells in which activities of the bacteriophage recombinase Cre and of the (reverse) tetracycline transactivator ([r]tTA) intersect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005086.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). Due to a floxed tdTomato-STOP sequence (LtSL), expression of tdTomato (tdT) takes place in cells expressing (r)tTA but having no history of Cre activity, whereas <italic>p21</italic> is expressed in the cell population with a history of Cre and current (r)tTA activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005086.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). We named the general type of allele Dox-controlled and Recombinase Activated Gene OverexpressioN (DRAGON). By combining the <italic>DRAGON-p21</italic> allele with an <italic>asymmetric-Pitx2-enhancer-Cre</italic> line expressing Cre in the precursors of the left limb mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005086.s005">S1A–S1F Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref025">25</xref>] and a cartilage-specific <italic>Col2a1-rtTA</italic> line containing the reverse tetracycline transactivator under the control of a type II collagen promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref026">26</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005086.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), Dox-dependent ectopic <italic>p21</italic> expression was achieved specifically in non-hypertrophic chondrocytes of the left limb cartilage elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005086.g001">Fig 1C and 1C’</xref>). Consequently, any growth adjustment detected in the right limb of triple transgenic animals (<italic>Pit-Col-p21</italic>) when compared to control littermates must be due to activation of a systemic effect or inter-organ communication.</p>

<p>When Dox was administered from <underline>e</underline>mbryonic day (E) 12.5 until birth (<italic>ePit-Col-p21</italic> model), analysis at E14.5–E17.5 revealed the expected cartilage-exclusive expression of tdT, mainly in the right skeletal elements, and <italic>p21</italic> expression preferentially in the left limb cartilage, albeit in a mosaic fashion. For example, 36%–67% versus 0.8%–23% of chondrocytes were found to be p21<sup>+</sup> in left versus right proximal tibia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005086.s005">S1G–S1K Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005086.g001">Fig 1C–1F</xref>; <italic>n =</italic> 3 E15.5; <italic>n</italic> = 5 E17.5 proximal tibias; <italic>n</italic> = 3 E17.5 proximal humerus). As we previously observed with the <italic>Cre</italic> transgene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref019">19</xref>], the activity of Cre and therefore <italic>p21</italic> expression was more widespread in the left hindlimb than in the left forelimb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005086.s005">S1I–S1K Fig</xref>; only 22%–38% of chondrocytes were p21<sup>+</sup> in the left proximal humerus). Therefore, we focused our initial analysis on the hindlimb. As expected, proliferation was inhibited in p21<sup>+</sup> proximal tibia chondrocytes at E15.5 and E17.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005086.g001">Fig 1D and 1E and 1G</xref>; <italic>n =</italic> 3 and <italic>n =</italic> 5, respectively).

However, the normal expression domains of <italic>Ihh</italic>, <italic>Cola10a1</italic>, and <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> in (pre)hypertrophic chondrocytes (which do not express the transgene) appeared slightly fainter in the distal femur and proximal tibia cartilage, and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of the combined proliferative and pre-hypertrophic zones revealed that their normalized counts were diminished in the left versus right cartilage (although only significantly for <italic>Cdkn1c</italic>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005086.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005086.s001">S1 Data</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005086.s002">S2</xref> Data.

<title>Mosaic local proliferation blockade in the left limb cartilage slightly reduces bone growth but does not alter left–right limb symmetry</title>

However, the effect was milder than expected, given that between one-third and two-thirds of chondrocytes were being arrested. This result suggested that compensatory mechanisms that minimized the impact of the p21 insult had been activated in the left limbs.

<p>We next took advantage of our unilateral approach that provides an experimental and a control limb within an animal and performed left–right intra-individual comparisons to determine the degree of asymmetry.

<title>Cell-nonautonomous compensation by spared neighbours in response to mosaic blockade of chondrocyte proliferation</title>
<p>The compensatory response observed in the limbs of <italic>ePit-Col-p21</italic> mice could be due to both bone-intrinsic cellular mechanisms and the aforementioned apparent extrinsic regulation. We first tested for any organ-intrinsic responses and started by examining proliferation of the spared chondrocytes in the hindlimbs. Indeed, the left/right ratio of 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation by p21<sup>−</sup> chondrocytes was higher in experimental animals as compared with controls at E17.5 and P0 but not E15.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005086.g003">Fig 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005086.s006">S2H Fig</xref>), revealing cell-nonautonomous compensatory proliferation of p21<sup>−</sup> cells in the presence of p21<sup>+</sup> neighbours. Because p21<sup>−</sup> cells did not differ in size from those of control mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005086.s006">S2I Fig</xref>), the hyperproliferation of these cells at E17.5 likely contributes to the lack of a left-specific growth reduction in <italic>ePit-Col-p21</italic> embryos. In fact, overall EdU incorporation in left and right <italic>ePit-Col-p21</italic> PZs (without distinguishing between p21<sup>+</sup> and p21<sup>−</sup> cells), while tending to be slightly reduced, was not significantly different, indicating that the compensatory proliferation phenomenon is quite effective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005086.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Moreover, the proliferative disadvantage of p21<sup>+</sup> versus p21<sup>−</sup> chondrocytes in the left limb of <italic>ePit-Col-p21</italic> mice resulted in dilution of p21<sup>+</sup> chondrocytes from 45%–50% of PZ chondrocytes at E15.5 and E17.5 to approximately 20% at P0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005086.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>; <italic>n =</italic> 3, 5, and 8, respectively), and this depletion was not due to inactivation of rtTA activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005086.g003">Fig 3D</xref>; <italic>n =</italic> 3 at E17.5; <italic>n</italic> = 3 at P0).</p>

<title>Compensatory proliferation requires a minimum threshold of p21<sup>+</sup> chondrocytes</title>
<p>We next addressed whether the proportion of p21<sup>+</sup> chondrocytes in the growing cartilage influences the extent of compensatory proliferation. Given that forelimb bones show a lower proportion of p21<sup>+</sup> chondrocytes than hindlimb bones within each embryo analysed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005086.s005">S1K Fig</xref>; 55.4% ± 11.2% in tibia versus 32.8% ± 7.1% in humerus; <italic>n =</italic> 3; <italic>p</italic> = 0.0267 for paired <italic>t</italic> test), we first tested whether compensatory proliferation was triggered in the proximal humerus. We found that although there was a trend towards increased proliferation in left p21<sup>−</sup> chondrocytes, the difference was not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005086.g004">Fig 4D</xref>; <italic>n =</italic> 3), suggesting that compensatory proliferation requires a minimum insult threshold to be triggered. Because intrinsic differences between forelimb and hindlimb bones might exist in regards to the compensatory proliferation response, we also tested the threshold hypothesis using only hindlimb bones. In order to induce p21 expression in fewer chondrocytes than in <italic>ePit-Col-p21</italic> mice, we made use of a newly generated <italic>Col2a1-tTA</italic> line (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec017">Materials and methods</xref>) in place of the <italic>Col2a1-rtTA</italic> transgene, such that <italic>p21</italic> expression was achieved from approximately E12.5 onwards in the absence of Dox (<italic>Pit-tTA-p21</italic> model) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005086.s008">S4A Fig</xref>). tTA expression in this line is less extensive than rtTA in the <italic>Col2a1-rtTA</italic> line, as <italic>p21</italic> misexpression was detected in fewer left tibial chondrocytes than in <italic>ePit-Col-p21</italic> left tibia (30%–40% at E15.5, 15%–35% at E17.5, 10%–20% at P0; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005086.s008">S4A Fig</xref>). Consistent with our prediction of a threshold being needed, compensatory proliferation was not detected in the <italic>Pit-tTA-p21</italic> model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005086.s008">S4B and S4C Fig</xref>). To further investigate whether a minimum insult threshold is required to trigger increased proliferation, we calculated the correlation coefficient between the percentage of p21<sup>+</sup> chondrocytes and the extent of proliferation in the PZ from left and right <italic>ePit-Col-p21</italic> (in vivo and ex vivo) and <italic>Pit-tTA-p21</italic> tibiae, at E17.5 (or E15.5 plus 2 d ex vivo). Segmental linear regression analysis revealed that the extent of EdU incorporation by p21<sup>−</sup> chondrocytes did not correlate with the proportion of p21<sup>+</sup> neighbours when this proportion was below 35%, but beyond this threshold, there was a linear correlation between both parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005086.g004">Fig 4E</xref>; <italic>n =</italic> 26 bones). These results suggest that compensatory proliferation is due to a signal produced in proportion to the number of arrested chondrocytes, that the signal needs to reach a certain threshold to be effective, and that it remains active until at least P0 despite the dilution of p21<sup>+</sup> chondrocytes.</p>

<title>The systemic growth reduction of <italic>ePit-Col-p21</italic> embryos involves impaired placental function and when it is rescued, limb–body proportions are altered</title>
<p>We reasoned that the most likely foetal organ to control systemic growth by responding to a circulating alarm signal is the placenta because in rodents it produces higher IGF levels than any other organ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref028">28</xref>] and is considered the main organ controlling foetal growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref029">29</xref>], whereas hepatic IGFs regulate systemic growth mainly after weaning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref018">18</xref>]. Placental weight was not diminished in <italic>ePit-Col-p21</italic> embryos (<italic>n =</italic> 19) as compared to <italic>ePit-p21</italic> controls (<italic>n =</italic> 17), such that the placenta/body weight ratio was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005086.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). This result suggests that placental efficiency is reduced in response to the left-cartilage p21 insult. To determine the status of placental IGF signalling, we tested the expression of several pathway members by qRT-PCR and found that <italic>Igf2</italic> levels were increased in the placentas of <italic>ePit-Col-p21</italic> embryos as compared to <italic>ePit-p21</italic> controls, whereas the levels of <italic>Igf1r</italic> did not vary significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005086.g006">Fig 6C</xref>; <italic>n =</italic> 3 experimental and <italic>n</italic> = 4 control). Increased expression of <italic>IGF2</italic> by the placenta has been seen as part of a placental stress response triggered by prenatal insults such as alcohol exposure, which is also associated with placental functional impairment, increased placental/body weight ratio, and foetal growth restriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref031">31</xref>]. Therefore, one possible interpretation of our results is that the left limb cartilage stress response is relayed to the placenta, which then indirectly impacts on foetal growth. Perhaps explaining why increased IGF2 expression does not correlate with enhanced embryo growth, we found an increase in the level of <italic>Igf2r</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005086.g006">Fig 6C</xref>; <italic>n =</italic> 6 experimental and <italic>n</italic> = 6 control), which encodes a decoy receptor that can decrease local IGF2 availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref032">32</xref>]. Furthermore, inhibition of IGF2R has been shown to boost placental efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref033">33</xref>].</p>
<p>As a means to test whether the systemic growth reduction in <italic>ePit-Col-p21</italic> embryos was due to impaired IGF signalling within the placenta, we injected pregnant dams (from E15.25 to E17.25, 3 times per day, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005086.g006">Fig 6D</xref>) with an IGF2 analogue (Leu<sup>27</sup>-IGF2) that does not cross the placental barrier, can only bind IGF2R (and not IGF1R), and thus was shown to increase placental efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref033">33</xref>]. Body and placental weight and femur length of <italic>ePit-Col-p21</italic> embryos were compared between litters that were either treated or not treated with Leu<sup>27</sup>-IGF2 to determine the degree to which body/organ size was rescued, and they were also compared with <italic>ePit-p21</italic> embryos within treated litters to determine whether Leu<sup>27</sup>-IGF2 differentially affected experimental and control embryo growth. Boosting placental function led to the following results:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Femur length of treated <italic>ePit-Col-p21</italic> embryos was significantly increased compared to untreated experimental embryos (<italic>n =</italic> 9 and <italic>n</italic> = 11, respectively), and within treated litters, femur length was not significantly different between <italic>ePit-Col-p21</italic> and <italic>ePit-p21</italic> littermates (<italic>n =</italic> 6), demonstrating preferential rescue of the mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005086.g006">Fig 6E and 6F</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Whereas placental weight remained unchanged following Leu<sup>27</sup>-IGF2 administration, body weight of treated <italic>ePit-Col-p21</italic> embryos was significantly increased compared to untreated experimental embryos (<italic>n =</italic> 9 and <italic>n</italic> = 19), and within-litter comparison revealed that body weight was not only rescued but also slightly increased beyond that of <italic>ePit-p21</italic> littermates (<italic>n =</italic> 6), suggesting that <italic>ePit-Col-p21</italic> embryos are especially sensitized to the systemic growth factors produced by the placenta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005086.g006">Fig 6G and 6H</xref>). Consequently, the placenta/body ratio was notably reduced in treated versus untreated <italic>ePit-Col-p21</italic> embryos, to levels even lower than in treated <italic>ePit-p21</italic> littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005086.g006">Fig 6I and 6J</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Because the body size was “over-rescued” as compared to the bones, the femur/body weight ratio of rescued <italic>ePit-Col-p21</italic> embryos was diminished compared to <italic>ePit-p21</italic> littermates or untreated litters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005086.g006">Fig 6K</xref>, <italic>n =</italic> 5 untreated and <italic>n</italic> = 6 treated <italic>ePit-p21</italic> embryos; <italic>n</italic> = 6 untreated and <italic>n</italic> = 8 treated <italic>ePit-Col-p21</italic>). Taken together, these results suggest that, in the presence of local growth defects, a systemic growth reduction is necessary to maintain limb–body proportions. Unexpectedly, rescue of the systemic effect did not result in left–right asymmetry in <italic>ePit-Col-p21</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005086.g006">Fig 6L</xref>), indicating that a specific decrease in growth of the unmanipulated limb, which is independent of placental function, contributes to the maintenance of left–right symmetry upon a unilateral insult.</p></list-item>

<title>A holistic view of compensatory responses triggered by developmental insults</title>
<p>In summary, our results show that when the embryonic long bones experience mosaic inhibition of chondrocyte proliferation, an adaptive growth response can be triggered that involves cell-nonautonomous local mechanisms and systemic changes during the time frame of the insult, such that body proportions are maintained. We refer to this new type of catch-up growth that happens during an on-going insult as ‘adaptive growth’ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005086.s011">S7 Fig</xref>). Our finding that a local compensatory response occurs during the insult and involves cell-nonautonomous mechanisms is distinct from previous models that proposed that compensation occurs after the insult is lifted and is cell-autonomous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref020">20</xref>]. Therefore, our results introduce a new conceptual framework for interpreting studies of perturbed long-bone growth. Furthermore, the experimental approach we devised for the study of growth regulation in mice makes a strong case for using unilateral perturbation approaches when studying bilateral organs. Although a local response such as compensatory proliferation or reduced cell density could have been unveiled with a mosaic bilateral injury, a subtle body-weight effect would likely be ascribed to the reduced size of all limbs and not to inter-organ communication. Indeed, the hint that prompted us to explore inter-organ communication was the observed reduction in the unmanipulated limb between experimental and control mice. Below, we discuss the potential mechanisms and evolutionary conservation of local and systemic responses to developmental injury.</p>

<sec id="sec013">
<title>Compensatory proliferation</title>
<p>We have shown that a few days into mosaic inhibition of proliferation affecting &gt;35% of chondrocytes of the left limb, spared chondrocytes undergo increased proliferation, such that the overall proliferative rate in the left cartilage almost matches that of the right limb. We propose the following order of events, based on correlative data from our study:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>In response to a reduction in the number of chondrocytes produced, extracellular matrix production is increased (and thus cell density is reduced). As a consequence, the amount of cartilage scaffold being laid down is not reduced, and thus endochondral ossification can proceed at an almost normal rate. This proposed response fits with stereological studies that showed that, in growth plates with low proliferative rates, it is mainly the production of extracellular matrix that contributes to bone growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref034">34</xref>]. In this regard, the small decrease in chondrocyte density seen in <italic>Pit-tTA-p21</italic> mice could explain why these mice do not show increased left–right asymmetry despite lacking compensatory proliferation and systemic growth reduction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005086.s008">S4F and S4G Fig</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>When the insult is extensive enough for cell density to drop below a certain threshold, compensatory proliferation is triggered in spared chondrocytes, to an extent proportional to the number of affected chondrocytes. Because we found that the extent of compensatory proliferation does not linearly correlate with cell density—but it does with the proportion of p21<sup>+</sup> chondrocytes—we posit that density plays a permissive rather than an instructive role and that stress signals emanating from p21<sup>+</sup> chondrocytes are needed as well. These stress signals could be diffusible molecules or cell–cell interactions, and they could act either in short range, affecting only cells in their proximity, or in long range, via a self-propagated travelling wave [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref035">35</xref>] and leading to a whole-organ (i.e., community) effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005086.s011">S7A and S7B Fig</xref>). Moreover, although our ex vivo experiments suggest that compensatory proliferation is a bone-intrinsic process, we cannot rule out that tissues such as the cartilage–bone interface or the perichondrium (also present in the cultures) play a role in modulating compensatory proliferation. To distinguish between all these possibilities, new insult models that allow triggering of focal insult domains of variable size and positions will be required.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Once p21<sup>+</sup> chondrocytes have been replaced by p21<sup>−</sup> cells and the threshold cell density has recovered, compensatory proliferation stops, such that overgrowth is not generated.</p></list-item>

<sec id="sec014">
<title>Systemic growth reduction</title>
<p>Our results reveal a mild but consistent systemic growth reduction (approximately 10%) in response to a local insult in the cartilage. We propose that the stress response generated in the left cartilage is somehow communicated to the placenta, which in turn systemically reduces growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005086.s011">S7 Fig</xref>). We suggest the following 2 mechanisms that could account for the injured cartilage–placenta communication:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Stress signals are produced locally—either by p21<sup>+</sup> chondrocytes, p21<sup>−</sup> chondrocytes, the perichondrium, or cells at the cartilage–bone interface—are released into circulation, and, when they surpass a threshold, impact on placental efficiency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005086.s011">S7C Fig</xref>). It was recently shown that a subpopulation of natural killer (NK) cells that are transiently abundant in the decidual region of the placenta can promote placental function and foetal growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref036">36</xref>]. If the function of these cells was impaired by the circulating stress signals in <italic>ePit-Col-p21</italic> embryos, this could negatively impact on placental function and explain the systemic growth reduction.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There is a size-monitoring system that detects impaired long-bone growth and leads to a systemic growth reduction that allows the impaired organ to keep up with the rest of the body. Such a mechanism would likely require a central integrator where size-for-age information is stored and compared to actual organ size, but as of yet, there is almost no evidence for such a system (see discussion in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref013">13</xref>]).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>With regards to potential growth correction treatments, it would be important to determine whether all <italic>ePit-Col-p21</italic> organs are equally reduced or whether the musculoskeletal system (which is especially dependent on IGF signalling) is primarily affected. Resolution of the latter question is currently difficult because the embryos are too small for individual organs to be weighed reliably. Volumetric analyses using mesoscopic techniques such as optical projection tomography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref037">37</xref>] on embryos expressing fluorescent reporters in the tissue of interest will be necessary to achieve the necessary level of resolution.</p>

<title>Left–right limb crosstalk</title>
<p>An unexpected result of our study is that when placental function is boosted in <italic>ePit-Col-p21</italic> concepti through maternal Leu<sup>27</sup>-IGF2 treatment, long-bone growth is not enhanced to the same extent as body weight, resulting in a reduction in the ratio of bone length to body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005086.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Given that the right cartilage templates are not experiencing the same p21 insult as the left ones, the dampened response of the right skeletal elements to the systemic rescue suggests that the insult in the left cartilage influences growth of the right limb through some sort of left–right crosstalk. A similar crosstalk has been previously proposed in studies of amphibian limb regeneration, in which it was shown that amputation of the contralateral limb at the same rostrocaudal level as the originally amputated limb reduced the regenerative rate of the latter, whereas ipsilateral or contralateral amputation at a different rostrocaudal level did not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref038">38</xref>]. Moreover, a study of tibial fracture repair in young rats showed that the healing environment of a fractured bone triggers the release of growth-promoting signals in the growth plate of the fractured bone and that the same signalling is induced in the contralateral growth plate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref039">39</xref>]. As previously proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref038">38</xref>], the most obvious candidate system to mediate crosstalk between the left and right limbs is the nervous system. While the exact mechanism remains to be determined, a recent study showed that peripheral sympathetic nerves might inhibit bone growth in response to sustained social stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref040">40</xref>]. Regardless of the mechanism, these results suggest that the observed systemic growth reduction in <italic>ePit-Col-p21</italic> embryos is a combination of 2 effects: reduced growth efficiency of the contralateral bones in response to the left-specific insult, and impairment of placental function that affects the rest of the body.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec016">
<title>Evolutionary conservation of compensatory mechanisms</title>
<p>Collectively, our results reveal that the processes leading to coordination of growth within and between organs to achieve normal proportions upon developmental insults are conserved across metazoans. However, the magnitude of the contributions of local and systemic mechanisms likely varies across phyla because the extent of the systemic growth reduction observed in mice seems to be less extreme than in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, with the caveat that different insults or tissues could elicit distinct responses. The exact underlying mechanisms also vary because we did not observe up-regulation of the <italic>dilp8</italic> homologue <italic>Relaxin1</italic> in the insulted cartilage. Different molecular mechanisms aside, the compensatory response in vertebrates shares some features with the response in insects, such as our finding that the injured tissue is able to catch up despite being exposed to an environment that stunts growth of the rest of the body. One explanation for this result is that local compensatory proliferation overrides a systemic effect. We further speculate that if the same ‘alarm’ signal were to trigger both the intrinsic and systemic mechanisms following injury, this would provide an evolutionarily advantageous strategy to achieve robust coordination of organ growth.</p>
<p>While many unknowns remain in the field of organ growth and repair, further exploration of the mechanisms revealed by this study will open exciting new avenues for basic and translational research and lead to an understanding of human growth disorders.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>When data were available for control and experimental, a normalized measurement (left/right ratio or percentage of average control mice) was calculated for both. Between different time points, the normalized measurements were compared by multiple unpaired <italic>t</italic> test with Holm-Sidak correction for multiple comparisons. Within the same time point, comparisons were done by an unpaired Mann-Whitney test (1 variable and 2 conditions), by 1-way ANOVA (1 variable and ≥3 conditions), or by 2-way ANOVA (2 variables and 2 or more conditions) following a matched (paired) design when possible (indicated when not). When left and right measurements were compared within experimental animals only, paired 2-tailed <italic>t</italic> test was used. For all ANOVA, alpha = 0.05. All relevant parameters for the statistical tests can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005086.s004">S1 Table</xref>. When parametric tests were used, data normality was confirmed by Shapiro-Wilk test and equality of variance by F-test. Prism7 software (Graphpad) was used for most analyses. Most graphs show individual values and mean ± SD, unless otherwise indicated.</p>

<p>To generate the <italic>Igs7</italic><sup><italic>TRE-LtSL-p21</italic></sup> mouse line, the <italic>NruI</italic>-STOP-loxP-tdTomato-<italic>SnaBI</italic> fragment in the <italic>Ai62(TITL-tdT) Flp-in</italic> replacement vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref023">23</xref>] was replaced by a custom <italic>NruI</italic>-tdTomato-STOP-loxP-<italic>MluI-HpaI-SnaBI</italic> cassette, to generate an empty DRAGON vector. A PCR-amplified Kozak-Cdkn1a cassette was subsequently cloned into the <italic>MluI</italic> and <italic>SnaBI</italic> sites to generate the <italic>DRAGON-p21</italic> vector. This vector was then used for recombinase-mediated cassette exchange into <italic>Igs7-</italic>targeted G4 ES cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref023">23</xref>]. Two successfully targeted clones were injected into C2J blastocysts to generate chimeras, obtaining 27 chimeric males (out of 30 born) with 75% to 100% chimerism. Two males from each clone were crossed to BL6 albino mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) to assess germline transmission and to establish the new mouse lines. To generate the <italic>Col2a1-tTA</italic> line, a <italic>Kozak-tTA</italic> fragment was PCR-amplified from plasmid <italic>pEnt L1L3 tTA-3</italic> (Addgene plasmid #27105, gift of Edward Hsiao) and cloned into a vector containing the regulatory region of mouse <italic>Col2a1</italic> obtained from plasmid <italic>p3000i3020Col2a1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref041">41</xref>]. Backbone-free vector DNA was injected into FVB zygotes to generate transgenic lines. Four out of 11 founders transmitted the <italic>Col2a1-tTA</italic> allele.

<title>Tibial culture</title>
<p>A previously described protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref043">43</xref>] was slightly adapted to culture embryonic long bones. Briefly, E15.5 tibiae were obtained from the embryos of Dox-treated pregnant females, dissected free of as much soft tissues as possible in ice-cold PBS, and then cultured (at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) in 24-well plates with serum-free DMEM (Gibco) containing 0.2% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), 0.5 mM L-glutamine, 40 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco), 0.05 mg/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma), and 1 mM betaglycerophosphate (Sigma). The medium additionally contained 1 ng/μl Dox to maintain transgene expression. After 2 d, the bones were incubated with 10 μM EdU for 90 min, then fixed in PFA and processed for histological analysis.</p>
<p>Note that after 2 d, we consistently observed growth of 19% to 23% in control limbs as compared to the original length. This is less than in vivo (approximately 87% growth between E15.5 and E17.5), and the main difference seemed to be at the level of the proximal cartilage, which does not proliferate, likely due to insufficient diffusion of nutrients because it is larger than the distal cartilage. We therefore focused our analysis on the distal cartilage, which at these stages is expected to contribute one-third of total growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref044">44</xref>], i.e., approximately 29%, quite similar to the observed growth.</p>

<title>Micro-CT scans and measurements</title>
<p>Whole femora and tibiae were scanned using a Scanco μCT 35 (Scanco Medical, Brüttisellen, Switzerland) system. Six-μm voxel size, 45 KVp, 0.36-degree rotation step (180-degree angular range), and a 400-ms exposure per view were used for the scans, which were performed in air. Scanco μCT software (HP, DECwindows Motif 1.6) was used for 3D reconstruction and viewing of images. After 3D reconstruction, ‘Distance 3D’ tool was used for measuring the length of the ossified region. Three measurements were taken and the average derived for each bone. The observer was blinded to the genotype of the mouse.</p>

<title>Sample processing for histology</title>
<p>Mouse embryos were euthanized by hypothermia in cold PBS. Mouse pups were euthanized by decapitation after hypothermia-induced analgesia. Knees (or isolated full tibiae and femora) were dissected out, skinned, and fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Electron Microscopy Sciences) in PBS for 2 d at 4°C. After several washes with PBS, the tissue was then cryoprotected, first by brief incubation with a solution of 15% sucrose and then 30% sucrose in PBS for at least 4 h at 4°C, and then embedded in Cryomatrix (Thermo) using dry-ice-cold isopentane (Sigma). The knees were oriented sagittally and facing each other, with the tibiae on the bottom of the block (i.e., closest to the blade when sectioning). Serial 7-micron sections were collected with a Leica Cryostat on Superfrost slides, allowed to dry for at least 30 min, and stored at −80°C until used. For all histological techniques, frozen slides were allowed to reach room temperature in a closed box, and Cryomatrix was washed away for 15 min with warm PBS (37°C).</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry and TUNEL</title>
<p>Sections were incubated in citrate buffer (10 mM citric acid, 0.05% Tween 20 [pH 6.0]) for 15 min at 90°C, allowed to cool down, washed with PBSTx (PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100), blocked with 5% BSA in PBSTx for 30 min at room temperature, and incubated with the primary antibody over night at 4°C (see list of antibodies below). After PBSTx washes, incubation with Alexa647- and/or Alexa555-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes; 1/500 in PBSTx with DAPI) was performed for 1 h at room temperature. After PBSTx washes, the slides were mounted with Fluoro-Gel (Electron Microscopy Sciences). For TUNEL staining, endogenous biotin was blocked after antigen retrieval using the Avidin/Biotin blocking kit (Vector #SP-2001), and TdT enzyme and Biotin-16-dUTP (Sigma #3333566001 and #11093070910) were subsequently used following manufacturer instructions. Biotin-tagged DNA nicks were revealed with Alexa488- or Alexa647-conjugated streptavidin (Molecular Probes, 1/1000) during the incubation with the secondary antibody.</p>
<p>Antibodies (host species, vendor, catalogue number, dilution) included tdT (rabbit polyclonal, Rockland #600-401-379, 1/500), p21 (rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology #sc-471, 1/300), p19<sup>Arf</sup> (rat monoclonal, clone 12-A1-1, Novus Biologicals #NB200-169, 1/100), and p16-INK4A (rabbit polyclonal, Proteintech #10883-1-AP, 1/300).</p>

<title>In situ hybridisation</title>
<p>The protocol described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005086.ref046">46</xref>] was followed. For embryos and newborns, samples were not decalcified. Except for <italic>Col2a1</italic>, <italic>Col10a1</italic>, and <italic>Ihh</italic> (provided by Dr. Licia Selleri), the templates for most riboprobes were generated by PCR from embryonic cDNA, using primers containing the SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase promoters. Sequence of the primers is available upon request. After purification of the PCR product (Qiagen PCR purification kit), DIG-labelled probes were transcribed following manufacturer instructions (Roche), treated with DNAase for 30 min, and purified by LiCl-mediated precipitation in alcoholic solvent. Probes were kept at −80°C in 50% formamide (Fluka). For immunohistochemistry after in situ hybridisation, sections were incubated in citrate buffer (10 mM citric acid, 0.05% Tween 20 [pH 6.0]) for 15 min at 90°C, allowed to cool down, washed with PBSTx, and incubated with 1% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in PBSTx for 1 h to block endogenous peroxidases. After BSA blocking and primary antibody incubation, endogenous biotin was blocked using Avidin/Biotin Blocking kit (Vector #SP-2001), and then the slides were incubated with a biotinylated secondary antibody. A brown precipitate was obtained using a peroxidase-coupled streptavidin-biotin complex (Vectastain Elite ABC Kit, Vector #PK-6100) and DAB substrate (Vector #SK-4100), following manufacturer instructions.</p>

<title>Imaging</title>
<p>For in vivo experiments, sagittal sections of the knees were imaged, focusing on the region between both menisci and analysing at least 2, and typically 4, sections per limb. For cultured distal tibiae, frontal sections were used because they allow for better identification of the different epiphyseal regions. The transition between round (resting) and flat (columnar) nuclei, roughly describing an arch between the upper point of the wedges formed by the groove of Ranvier, was chosen as the start of the PZ, while the transition towards bigger, more spaced nuclei (pre-hypertrophic) was chosen as the end of the PZ. The point where pericellular matrix is sharply reduced around enlarging chondrocytes was considered as the start of the HZ, while the end of the HZ was marked as the distal end of the last intact chondrocyte. Bright-field and fluorescence images were taken on a Zeiss inverted microscope (Observer.Z1) using Axiovision software (Zeiss). Mosaic pictures were automatically reconstructed from individual 10× (bright-field) or 20× (fluorescence) tiles.</p>

<title>EdU incorporation</title>
<p>Five mg/ml EdU in PBS was injected (50μg/g body weight, s.c for pups, i.p. for adults and pregnant females) 1.5 h before euthanizing the mice. EdU was detected using the Click-iT Alexa488 Imaging Kit (Invitrogen, C-10337) once the immunohistochemistry and/or TUNEL staining were finished on the same slides. The fraction of nuclei that were positive for EdU, p21, or tdT in the PZ of the cartilage was determined using ImageJ or CellProfiler, followed by manual curation.</p>

<title>Potential mechanisms leading to adaptive growth after unilateral mosaic growth inhibition in long-bone chondrocytes.</title>
<p>(A–B) Two alternative mechanisms that could underlie compensatory proliferation in response to a stress signal, classified based on whether they work at the whole growth plate level (panel A, community effect mediated by a self-propagated travelling wave) or just by proximity to the stress signal (panel B). Coloured outlines identify chondrocytes producing the stress molecule. Note that in panel A, the self-propagating signal could be the same as the original stress molecule. t1–t3 refer to subsequent times of the travelling wave. (C) Potential relay of the stress signal into circulation, which in turn impacts on placental function, causing a systemic reduction in growth (stunting).</p>
