<abstract>
<p>The diffusible signal factors (DSFs) are a family of quorum-sensing autoinducers (AIs) produced and detected by numerous gram-negative bacteria. The DSF family AIs are fatty acids, differing in their acyl chain length, branching, and substitution but having in common a <italic>cis</italic>-2 double bond that is required for their activity. In both human and plant pathogens, DSFs regulate diverse phenotypes, including virulence factor expression, antibiotic resistance, and biofilm dispersal. Despite their widespread relevance to both human health and agriculture, the molecular basis of DSF recognition by their cellular receptors remained a mystery. Here, we report the first structure–function studies of the DSF receptor regulation of pathogenicity factor R (RpfR). We present the X-ray crystal structure of the RpfR DSF-binding domain in complex with the <italic>Burkholderia</italic> DSF (BDSF), which to our knowledge is the first structure of a DSF receptor in complex with its AI. To begin to understand the mechanistic role of the BDSF–RpfR contacts observed in the biologically important complex, we have also determined the X-ray crystal structure of the RpfR DSF-binding domain in complex with the inactive, saturated isomer of BDSF, dodecanoic acid (C12:0). In addition to these ligand–receptor complex structures, we report the discovery of a previously overlooked RpfR domain and show that it binds to and negatively regulates the DSF synthase regulation of pathogenicity factor F (RpfF). We have named this RpfR region the RpfF interaction (FI) domain, and we have determined its X-ray crystal structure alone and in complex with RpfF. These X-ray crystal structures, together with extensive complementary in vivo and in vitro functional studies, reveal the molecular basis of DSF recognition and the importance of the <italic>cis</italic>-2 double bond to DSF function. Finally, we show that throughout cellular growth, the production of BDSF by RpfF is post-translationally controlled by the RpfR N-terminal FI domain, affecting the cellular concentration of the bacterial second messenger bis-(3′-5′)-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP). Thus, in addition to describing the molecular basis for the binding and specificity of a DSF for its receptor, we describe a receptor–synthase interaction regulating bacterial quorum-sensing signaling and second messenger signal transduction.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Communication between many species of gram-negative bacteria is mediated by a family of cell–cell signaling autoinducers (AIs) known as the diffusible signal factors (DSFs). DSFs are fatty acids, containing a signature <italic>cis</italic>-2 double bond critical for their activity. The DSFs differ from one another by their acyl chain length, branching, and the presence of additional double bonds. We have carried out the first structure–function studies of DSF binding to a receptor, regulation of pathogenicity factor R (RpfR). We have determined X-ray crystal structures of the RpfR DSF-binding domain in complex with an active DSF, <italic>cis</italic>-2-dodecenoic acid, and in complex with its inactive saturated isomer, dodecanoic acid (C12:0). These X-ray crystal structures, together with extensive complementary in vivo and in vitro functional studies, reveal the molecular basis of DSF recognition and the importance of the <italic>cis</italic>-2 double bond to DSF function. In addition, we have discovered a previously overlooked domain at the RpfR N-terminus, and we show that this domain binds to and negatively regulates the DSF synthase regulation of pathogenicity factor F (RpfF). We present X-ray crystal structures of this domain alone and in complex with RpfF, which—together with in vivo and in vitro functional studies—describe how RpfR binds to RpfF, negatively regulating the synthesis of its own AI.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Quorum sensing is a form of bacterial cell–cell communication that enables populations of bacteria to synchronize their gene expression in order to coordinate group behaviors such as bioluminescence, sporulation, genetic competence, biofilm formation, motility, and virulence factor expression (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref002">2</xref>]). Quorum sensing is mediated by signaling molecules known as autoinducers (AIs) that bacteria secrete and detect. While gram-positive bacteria communicate using peptide AIs (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref004">4</xref>]), gram-negative bacteria use a panoply of small molecule AIs, including the diffusible signal factors (DSFs) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref005">5</xref>]), which are the focus of the studies presented here.</p>
<p>DSFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000123.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) are a family of fatty acid AIs produced and detected by a wide range of gram-negative bacteria, including important pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref006">6</xref>].

<p>The enzyme RpfF catalyzes the synthesis of DSF family signals through the dehydration of 3-hydroxyacyl thioesters attached to acyl carrier protein (ACP), producing the <italic>cis</italic>-2 double bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000123.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).

While structural studies have examined DSF synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref019">19</xref>], the structural basis of DSF–receptor interactions are unexplored.</p>
<p>The DSF receptor RpfR is conserved in numerous gram-negative bacteria, including, among others, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cenocepacia</italic>, <italic>Cronobacter turicensis</italic>, <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic>, <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic>, and <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic>. RpfR was predicted to contain three domains, namely Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS), diguanylate cyclase (DGC), and phosphodiesterase (PDE) domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000123.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref022">22</xref>]. PAS domains are ligand-binding domains present in all kingdoms of life, and they are capable of detecting a multitude of signals, including small molecules, light, redox, as well as the conformational state of other proteins (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref024">24</xref>]). Therefore, the RpfR PAS domain was predicted to bind DSF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref022">22</xref>]. DGC domains, such as that found in RpfR, produce the bacterial second messenger bis-(3′-5′)-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP), whose increased concentration is associated with biofilm formation and sessile behavior. PDE domains hydrolyze c-di-GMP to linear 5′-phosphoguanylyl-(3′,5′)-guanosine (pGpG), reducing the cellular concentration of c-di-GMP, which commonly triggers biofilm dispersal and virulence factor expression (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref025">25</xref>]). BDSF binding to RpfR was previously shown to trigger its PDE activity, decreasing the intracellular concentration of c-di-GMP and favoring biofilm dispersal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000123.g001">Fig 1D</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we present a structure–function analysis of RpfR, revealing detailed mechanistic insight into DSF sensing. Additionally, we identified receptor-mediated control of DSF production via a direct interaction of RpfR with the DSF synthase RpfF. The foundation of this work are four X-ray crystal structures. The first two structures presented are those of the RpfR PAS domain in complex with BDSF or the saturated inactive isomer of BDSF, dodecanoic acid (C12:0). Structural comparison of these models along with in vivo functional analysis reveals the molecular basis for BDSF-binding specificity and the role of the DSF <italic>cis</italic>-2 double bond in signal perception. Additionally, we discovered that in contrast to prior predictions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref022">22</xref>], RpfR in fact contains an overlooked N-terminal domain that binds to RpfF, inhibiting DSF synthesis. Consistent with its function, we refer to the RpfR N-terminal domain as the RpfF interaction (FI) domain. To explore the mechanism of RpfR-mediated RpfF inhibition, we determined the X-ray crystal structures of the RpfR FI domain alone and in complex with RpfF. These crystal structures, along with extensive in vivo and in vitro studies, reveal the mechanistic basis of this regulation and its contribution to restraining BDSF synthesis and elevating the intracellular concentration of c-di-GMP. Since DSF signaling commonly regulates cellular behaviors, including biofilm formation, biofilm dispersal, swarming motility, extracellular protease production, antibiotic resistance, and other virulence-associated phenotypes in important human and plant pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref032">32</xref>], the mechanistic insight into DSF sensing and synthesis presented here set the stage for developing inhibitors important for human health and agriculture.</p>

<title>Structure of the RpfR PAS domain bound to dodecanoic acid</title>
<p>To gain insight into the molecular recognition of BDSF by RpfR, we crystallized and determined the structure of the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>turicensis</italic> RpfR PAS domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000123.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000123.s010">S1 Table</xref>). Without adding fatty acid to the crystallization experiment, we observed prominent electron density in the PAS domain core that was consistent with a 12-carbon fatty acid ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000123.g002">Fig 2A–2C</xref>). Intriguingly, even when an excess of BDSF was included during crystallization, the electron density was consistent with a fatty acid that did not contain a <italic>cis-2</italic> double bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000123.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). These data suggested that RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>(PAS) copurified with a tightly bound fatty acid likely originating from the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> overexpression host. Indeed, using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS), we determined that the ligand is the saturated isomer of BDSF, C12:0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000123.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), which <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> is known to produce endogenously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref033">33</xref>].

<p>While C12:0 is an inactive isomer of BDSF, the RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>(PAS)–C12:0 structure provided the first insight into how fatty acids interact with RpfR and, as shown below, proved to be important for comparative analysis. In the RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>(PAS)–C12:0 structure, the C12:0 carboxylic acid group forms multiple hydrogen bonds with a set of conserved hydrophilic residues (S169, N172, Y183, and R187) at one end of the ligand-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000123.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).

<title>Purification and X-ray crystal structure of the RpfR PAS domain–BDSF complex</title>
<p>BDSF was previously demonstrated to trigger RpfR<sub>Ct</sub> phosphodiesterase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref020">20</xref>].

It is notable that while <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> contains a highly conserved <italic>rpfR</italic> homolog named the gene modulating RNase II (<italic>gmr</italic>), it lacks a DSF synthase and, to our knowledge, does not produce a DSF AI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref034">34</xref>]. We speculate, however, that <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> Gmr PDE activity could be regulated by C12:0. Regardless, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> was previously demonstrated to synthesize BDSF when transformed with an expression plasmid containing <italic>rpfF</italic><sub>Bc</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref030">30</xref>]. Therefore, we purified RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>(PAS) from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> coexpressing RpfF<sub>Bc</sub>. The purified RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>(PAS) was then denatured and LC-MS used to identify the released ligand (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000123.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Indeed, the bound ligand was BDSF, confirming that we had purified the RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>(PAS)–BDSF complex.</p>
<p>The RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>(PAS)–BDSF complex was crystallized and its structure determined to a resolution of 2.3 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000123.g002">Fig 2D–2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000123.s010">S1 Table</xref>). Comparison of the RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>(PAS)–BDSF and RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>(PAS)–C12:0 structures reveals that the ligands adopt different conformations, resulting from the absence or presence of the <italic>cis</italic>-2 double bond in C12:0 or BDSF, respectively. Furthermore, while RpfR<sub>Ct</sub> arginine (Arg) 187 makes a single H-bond to C12:0, it adopts a different rotameric configuration in the presence of BDSF, forming an additional H-bond between its δ nitrogen and the BDSF carboxylic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000123.g002">Fig 2B and 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on the measured distances and atom types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000123.g002">Fig 2B and 2E</xref>), the position of BDSF in the RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>(PAS)-binding pocket appears to be influenced by an interaction between BDSF and the conserved residue asparagine (Asn) 202 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000123.g002">Fig 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000123.s002">S2A Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000123.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).

<p>Relative to wild-type <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cenocepacia</italic>, strains with RpfR proteins containing mutations predicted to disrupt the binding of BDSF to RpfR<sub>Bc</sub>(PAS) should be less sensitive to BDSF, exhibit lower PDE activity, display elevated levels of c-di-GMP, and have increased competitive fitness in biofilms due to elevated biofilm production. We engineered mutations RpfR<sub>Bc</sub>–S168A,–N171A,–R186A, and–N201A (corresponding to the above-described and conserved RpfR<sub>Ct</sub> BDSF-interacting residues S169, N172, R187, and N202 [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000123.s002">S2A Fig</xref>]) in the chromosomal copy of <italic>rpfR</italic> and competed them 1:1 with wild-type under a daily cycle of biofilm formation, dispersal, and reattachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref035">35</xref>]. Consistent with the interactions observed in the RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>(PAS)–BDSF crystal structure, each mutation produced large and significant fitness advantages, with selective coefficients (<italic>s</italic>) ranging from 0.58 to 1.17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000123.g002">Fig 2G</xref>). Furthermore, each of these mutations resulted in a significant increase in cellular c-di-GMP relative to the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000123.g002">Fig 2H</xref>). While it is possible that the site-directed mutations affected RpfR stability and, in turn, the ability of RpfR to respond to BDSF, we found that purified full-length wild-type RpfR<sub>Bc</sub>, RpfR<sub>Bc</sub>–S168A,–N171A,–R186A, and–N201A were comparably soluble (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000123.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Finally, in line with the fact that the RpfR<sub>Bc</sub>(PAS) BDSF-binding mutants displayed increased competitive fitness in the in vitro biofilm life cycle assay and elevated levels of c-di-GMP, we note that RpfR<sub>Bc</sub>(PAS) is subject to positive selection under conditions favoring biofilm growth, such as in a cystic fibrosis patient for which increased biofilm production proves advantageous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref011">11</xref>].</p>

<p>Initial evidence suggesting that RpfR(FI) and RpfF interact came from studies in which an RpfR<sub>Bc</sub> construct containing both the FI and PAS domains (RpfR<sub>Bc</sub>[FI–PAS]) and RpfF<sub>Bc</sub> were coexpressed in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> to obtain RpfR<sub>Bc</sub>(FI–PAS) bound to BDSF.

During our experiments to obtain BDSF-bound RpfR<sub>Bc</sub>(FI–PAS), RpfR<sub>Bc</sub>(FI–PAS) containing an N-terminal hexahistidine (His<sub>6</sub>) affinity tag copurified with nontagged RpfF<sub>Bc</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000123.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). As this interaction was not observed when His<sub>6</sub>-tagged RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>(PAS) was purified following coexpression with RpfF<sub>Bc</sub>, we hypothesized that RpfR<sub>Bc/Ct</sub>(FI) binds to RpfF<sub>Bc</sub>. To test this hypothesis, we coexpressed RpfF<sub>Bc</sub> and RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>(FI) and purified the RpfF<sub>Bc</sub>–RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>(FI) complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000123.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).</p>

<title>RpfR(FI) inhibits RpfF thioesterase activity</title>
<p>Based on the fact that RpfR(FI) and RpfF form a complex, we hypothesized that RpfR(FI) regulates RpfF enzymatic activity. To test this hypothesis, we generated <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> 4′-phosphopantetheinyl ACP (holo-ACP<sub>Ec</sub>) and charged it with C12:0. C12:0-charged ACP<sub>Ec</sub> (C12:0–ACP<sub>Ec</sub>) is a substrate for the analysis of in vitro RpfF thioesterase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref017">17</xref>], which we then measured in either the absence or presence of RpfR<sub>Bc</sub>(FI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000123.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). In the absence of RpfR<sub>Bc</sub>(FI), C12:0–ACP<sub>Ec</sub> was readily converted by RpfF<sub>Bc</sub> to holo-ACP<sub>Ec</sub>. In the presence of RpfR<sub>Bc</sub>(FI), conversion of C12:0–ACP<sub>Ec</sub> substrate by RpfF<sub>Bc</sub> was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000123.g004">Fig 4B</xref>).

<title>RpfF-RpfR(FI) complex structure</title>
<p>To understand how RpfR(FI) inhibits RpfF thioesterase activity, we determined the RpfF<sub>Bc</sub>–RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>(FI) X-ray crystal structure to a resolution 2.0 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000123.g005">Fig 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000123.s010">S1 Table</xref>). RpfF<sub>Bc</sub>–RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>(FI) is a heterohexamer consisting of three RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>(FI) and RpfF<sub>Bc</sub> protomers. The heterohexamer is generated by 3-fold crystallographic symmetry of the asymmetric unit containing RpfF<sub>Bc</sub>–RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>(FI). Each RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>(FI) protomer simultaneously interacts with two RpfF<sub>Bc</sub> protomers near their homodimerization interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000123.g005">Fig 5A–5C</xref>). This interaction places RpfR(FI)<sub>Ct</sub> in close proximity to the RpfF<sub>Bc</sub> substrate tunnel entrance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000123.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>). It is also worth noting that the RpfF<sub>Bc</sub>–RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>(FI) interfacial residues are conserved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000123.s002">S2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000123.s008">S8</xref> Figs), and this interaction is likely common in bacteria encoding both proteins.</p>

<p>When comparing the structure of RpfF<sub>Bc</sub> alone (PDB:5FUS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref017">17</xref>] with the structure of RpfF<sub>Bc</sub>–RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>(FI), perhaps the most surprising observation is that RpfF<sub>Bc</sub>–RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>(FI) contains no bound fatty acid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000123.s009">S9A Fig</xref>). In the previously determined crystal structure of RpfF<sub>Bc</sub>, C12:0 originating from the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> expression system was identified as a ligand in the RpfF<sub>Bc</sub> substrate tunnel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref017">17</xref>]. Attempts to remove C12:0 prior to biochemical and structural studies were unsuccessful, suggesting that C12:0 may be tightly bound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref017">17</xref>]. Consistent with the absence of bound fatty acid in RpfF<sub>Bc</sub>–RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>(FI), structural alignment of RpfF<sub>Bc</sub>–RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>(FI) with RpfF<sub>Bc</sub> shows that in the complex, phenylalanine (Phe) residues 44 and 88 have adopted a conformation in which they would sterically clash with bound fatty acid if it were present (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000123.s009">S9B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, superposing the structures of RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>(FI) alone with the structure of RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>(FI) in complex with RpfF<sub>Bc</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000123.g005">Fig 5B</xref>) reveals that RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>(FI) undergoes minor conformational changes primarily at the RpfF<sub>Bc</sub> binding surface. The most significant of these changes occur in RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>(FI) in which the N-terminus of strand β3 extends by one residue, the β2–β3 loop shifts to form contacts with two molecules of RpfF<sub>Bc</sub> near their homodimerization interface, and the β4–β5 loop becomes buried in the RpfF<sub>Bc</sub> interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000123.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Based on the proximity of RpfR(FI)<sub>Ct</sub> to the RpfF<sub>Bc</sub> substrate tunnel and its ability to inhibit RpfF thioesterase activity, we propose that RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>(FI) functions to sterically block acyl-ACP substrates from entering the RpfF active site.</p>

<title>RpfR regulates BDSF and c-di-GMP production in vivo</title>
<p>To measure the regulatory effect that RpfR has on RpfF BDSF synthesis in vivo, we employed a <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cenocepacia</italic> BDSF bioassay and mass spectroscopy to monitor the extracellular accumulation of BDSF in wild-type and mutant strains.

<title>The role of the BDSF <italic>cis</italic>-2 double bond</title>
<p>The defining feature of the DSF family of AIs that distinguishes them from other fatty acids is their <italic>cis</italic>-2 double bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000123.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref012">12</xref>]. The <italic>cis</italic>-2 double bond dramatically affects DSF receptor–binding affinity and biological activity. BDSF was shown to tightly bind RpfR<sub>Bc</sub> (K<sub>d</sub> = 877 nM), while C12:0 (K<sub>d</sub> = 800 μM) and <italic>trans</italic>-2 dodecenoic acid (K<sub>d</sub> = 150 μM) were found to weakly interact with the receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref022">22</xref>]. Consistent with these results, BDSF was active in a <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cenocepacia</italic> BDSF bioassay, while C12:0 and <italic>trans</italic>-2 dodecenoic acid were inactive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref041">41</xref>]. Despite great interest in DSF-signaling systems, the mechanism of molecular recognition employed by DSF receptors such as RpfR to distinguish DSF AIs from other cellular fatty acids, including the <italic>trans</italic>-2 and saturated isomers of DSF AIs, was unknown. As detailed below, we propose that the BDSF <italic>cis</italic>-2 double bond establishes RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>-binding specificity and affinity by enabling unique ligand–receptor contacts and, in contrast to more flexible fatty acids such as C12:0, by paying a lower entropic cost upon receptor binding.</p>
<p>Structural comparison of RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>(PAS)–C12:0 and RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>(PAS)–BDSF reveals mostly subtle conformational changes localized to the RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>(PAS) domain ligand-binding side chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000123.g002">Fig 2B and 2E</xref>). One conformational difference is RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>–R187, which makes an additional H-bond to the BDSF carboxylic acid than it makes to the C12:0 carboxylic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000123.g002">Fig 2B and 2E</xref>). Interestingly, RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>–R187 can mediate this additional H-bond because it adopts a different rotameric configuration in the BDSF-bound structure. Much of the RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>–R187 side chain is solvent exposed, and we speculate that it could play a role in regulating the activity of the receptor C-terminal enzymatic PDE domain upon BDSF binding.</p>
<p>Based on the measured distances and atom types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000123.g002">Fig 2B and 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000123.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), BDSF appears to be interacting with the conserved RpfR<sub>Ct</sub> amino acid Asn202. As an α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid, BDSF contains an electron deficient C<sub>β</sub> (C3). We propose that the more electron rich N202 amide nitrogen interacts with the electron deficient C<sub>β</sub> of BDSF. This interaction cannot occur for the fully saturated C12:0 and would be significantly weaker for <italic>trans</italic>-2 dodecenonic acid because its C<sub>β</sub> would be suboptimally positioned further away from N202. Additionally, in some RpfR proteins, there is a tyrosine corresponding to RpfR<sub>Ct</sub>–Y183, whose hydroxyl interacts with the N202 side chain amide N-H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000123.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). This interaction could further increase the electron density on the N202 amide nitrogen, strengthening its interaction with C<sub>β</sub> (C3) of BDSF.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to note that due to the presence of the <italic>cis</italic>-2 or <italic>trans</italic>-2 double bond in BDSF and <italic>trans</italic>-2 dodecenoic acid, respectively, they are more rigid than their saturated isomer C12:0. Theoretically, there is less entropy lost upon receptor binding to BDSF or <italic>trans</italic>-2 dodecenoic acid than upon binding to C12:0. Thus, we speculate that in addition to the specific receptor contacts mediated by the BDSF <italic>cis</italic>-2 double bond, it could contribute to receptor affinity and specificity by lowering the entropic penalty paid in comparison to saturated fatty acids.</p>

<title>BDSF-mediated quorum sensing is regulated by an interaction between its receptor and synthase</title>
<p>We have discovered a previously unidentified PAS-like domain at the RpfR N-terminus and demonstrated that it binds directly to RpfF, inhibiting BDSF synthesis in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000123.g004">Fig 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000123.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>), ultimately affecting the cellular concentration of c-di-GMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000123.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Ongoing studies in our labs are examining the molecular basis of this regulation. Due to the proximity of the RpfR FI domain to the RpfF substrate tunnel entrance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000123.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>), in all likelihood, RpfR sterically blocks acyl-ACP binding to RpfF and acyl-ACP substrate access to the RpfF active site.</p>
<p>While we have shown that RpfR(FI) interacts with RpfF—tuning or restraining the amount of BDSF produced and secreted—we believe that RpfR(FI) has also evolved to limit the amount of general acyl-ACP substrate cleavage. It was previously demonstrated that RpfF cleaves a broad range of acyl-ACP substrates, producing free fatty acids, which is energetically wasteful, as many of these would not be DSF AI compounds or serve any other known physiological role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref043">43</xref>]. Many bacteria that express RpfF also contain an enzyme, regulation of pathogenicity factor B (RpfB), that salvages free fatty acids by ligating them to coenzyme A (CoA), generating substrates for beta oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref043">43</xref>]. RpfB was shown to be important for counteracting RpfF substrate promiscuity, as <italic>rpfB</italic> mutants displayed RpfF-dependent growth defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref043">43</xref>]. It is important to note that bacteria encoding RpfR do not contain RpfB, and how these bacteria might compensate for RpfF substrate cleavage promiscuity was unknown. We propose that an important role for RpfR(FI) is to compensate for the lack of RpfB in these bacteria by tightly regulating RpfF, governing its cleavage of acyl-ACP substrates.</p>
<p>Based on the existing data, we propose the following model for RpfR function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000123.g007">Fig 7</xref>). At low-cell density and below a critical concentration of BDSF, the RpfR c-di-GMP PDE has minimal activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref022">22</xref>], and biofilms can form because c-di-GMP levels are elevated. Why the RpfR PDE domain is minimally active in the absence of BDSF is unknown, but we hypothesize that the RpfR PAS domain may directly interact with the PDE domain inhibiting its activity. Throughout cellular growth, RpfR directly regulates RpfF processing of acyl-ACP substrates. More specifically, the newly discovered RpfR FI domain binds RpfF at its acyl-ACP–binding site, limiting its promiscuous cleavage of acyl-ACP substrates. Ultimately, the BDSF concentration reaches a critical concentration in which its binding to the RpfR PAS domain activates RpfR c-di-GMP PDE activity. This activation converts c-di-GMP to pGpG, triggering biofilm dispersal. It is important to note that PDE domains are typically allosterically activated upon dimerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref044">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref047">47</xref>]. We propose that BDSF binding to the RpfR PAS domain activates RpfR PDE activity by triggering RpfR dimerization or the conformational rearrangement of catalytically inactive (autoinhibited) RpfR dimers. In fact, a similar model was proposed for the regulator of biofilm dispersal of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (RbdA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref048">48</xref>]. Finally, what role, if any, BDSF binding to RpfR(PAS) plays in controlling the RpfR(FI)–RpfF association is unknown; however, if BDSF binding to RpfR(PAS) regulates RpfR(FI)–RpfF association, in turn controlling RpfF activity, then BDSF, RpfR, and RpfF comprise a feedback loop regulating BDSF synthesis. Determining whether such a feedback loop exists and elucidating the structural basis of its function is necessary if we are to understand the regulatory controls modulating BDSF synthesis and cell–cell communication.</p>

<title>Proposed mechanism of RpfR activation by BDSF and RpfF inhibition by RpfR.</title>
<p>At low-cell density (top left), BDSF levels are low and the RpfR PDE domain is minimally active, permitting elevated levels of c-di-GMP and favoring biofilm formation. Here, we depict a theoretical regulatory interaction between the PAS (rainbow cartoon) and PDE (gray box) domains. At high-cell density (top right), BDSF has accumulated and bound to the RpfR PAS domain. This activates the RpfR PDE domain to degrade c-di-GMP to pGpG, favoring biofilm dispersal. Here, we depict RpfR PDE domain dimerization occurring upon BDSF binding; however, PDE activation may also occur via the rearrangement of catalytically inactive (autoinhibited) RpfR dimers. Throughout cellular growth, the RpfR FI domain (purple surface) associates with RpfF (light orange) (bottom), restraining BDSF synthesis, in turn modulating the cellular level of c-di-GMP.

<p>Finally, we note that PAS and PAS-like domains structurally similar to the RpfR FI domain are common components of histidine kinases as well as other bacterial signal transduction proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000123.ref023">23</xref>]. It will be interesting to determine whether some of these domains, like the FI domain, function to directly regulate the activity of a target enzyme. We propose that these interactions, like the physiologically important interactions identified here between RpfR and the AI BDSF as well as between RpfR and the BDSF synthase RpfF, could be targeted for the development of signaling agonists or antagonists and could serve as therapeutics modulating critical bacterial developmental processes including biofilm formation, biofilm dispersal, and virulence.</p>
