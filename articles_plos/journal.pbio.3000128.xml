<abstract>
<p>The genetic architecture of adaptive traits is of key importance to predict evolutionary responses. Most adaptive traits are polygenic—i.e., result from selection on a large number of genetic loci—but most molecularly characterized traits have a simple genetic basis. This discrepancy is best explained by the difficulty in detecting small allele frequency changes (AFCs) across many contributing loci. To resolve this, we use laboratory natural selection to detect signatures for selective sweeps and polygenic adaptation. We exposed 10 replicates of a <italic>Drosophila simulans</italic> population to a new temperature regime and uncovered a polygenic architecture of an adaptive trait with high genetic redundancy among beneficial alleles. We observed convergent responses for several phenotypes—e.g., fitness, metabolic rate, and fat content—and a strong polygenic response (99 selected alleles; mean <italic>s</italic> = 0.059). However, each of these selected alleles increased in frequency only in a subset of the evolving replicates. We discerned different evolutionary paradigms based on the heterogeneous genomic patterns among replicates. Redundancy and quantitative trait (QT) paradigms fitted the experimental data better than simulations assuming independent selective sweeps. Our results show that natural <italic>D</italic>. <italic>simulans</italic> populations harbor a vast reservoir of adaptive variation facilitating rapid evolutionary responses using multiple alternative genetic pathways converging at a new phenotypic optimum. This key property of beneficial alleles requires the modification of testing strategies in natural populations beyond the search for convergence on the molecular level.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>It is widely assumed that adaptation is mainly polygenic, with the underlying frequency changes being so small that they are difficult to detect and characterize. Taking advantage of laboratory-based natural selection of replicated populations of the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila simulans</italic> exposed to a high temperature regime, we identified a polygenic response with many (99) selected alleles having pronounced allele frequency changes (AFCs). Despite phenotypic convergence across the 10 replicates, the genomic response was highly heterogeneous, with different subsets of the selected alleles contributing to the convergent phenotype in each of the replicate populations. The observed genetic redundancy not only indicates lack of genetic constraint but also demonstrates that multiple genetic pathways lead to convergent phenotypic outcomes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite a long-standing interest, it is surprising how limited the understanding of the genetic architecture of adaptation is. The best characterized adaptive traits have a simple genetic basis such as pigmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref003">3</xref>], lactose persistence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref004">4</xref>], and resistance to viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref005">5</xref>], insecticides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref006">6</xref>], and malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref007">7</xref>]. Population genetic tests for the identification of selected loci build on genomic signatures predicted for selective sweeps where selection targets independently spread in the population until they ultimately become fixed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref009">9</xref>]. However, such simple traits are the exception rather than the rule, and most traits are polygenic, with many contributing loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref011">11</xref>]. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses for traits such as human height [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref013">13</xref>], blood lipid levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref014">14</xref>], and basal metabolic rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref015">15</xref>]—which have identified many small-effect loci—provide strong evidence for the importance of the polygenic model. The allele frequency dynamics predicted for adaptive polygenic traits with a sufficiently large mutational target differ from those of selective sweeps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref017">17</xref>]: subtle frequency changes at many small-effect loci, rather than large changes at few loci. The identification of the loci contributing to adaptive polygenic traits is, however, impeded by several challenges: (1) many causative variants identified in GWAS are deleterious, typically segregating at low frequencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref018">18</xref>]; (2) the adaptive role of many traits studied by quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and GWAS has not yet been convincingly demonstrated; (3) without replication and time series data, the analysis of extant populations may not be sufficiently powerful to distinguish between selective sweeps and polygenic adaptation. These challenges are probably best illustrated by human height, with the observed clinal variation in human populations being explained by selection on many loci with small effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref020">20</xref>]. Two recent analyses suggest, however, that the previously noted selection signal is better explained by population stratification, which was not sufficiently accounted for [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>Due to these limitations, genomic selection signatures of polygenic adaptation to a new trait optimum have not received as much attention as selective sweep signatures. Once reliable alternative approaches are available to identify loci contributing to polygenic adaptive traits, it will be possible to address their importance for adaptive processes. Here, we demonstrate that replicated populations evolving in the same environment provide a novel approach to characterize adaptive loci. Specifically, we use whole-genome sequencing data from multiple time points in 10 replicated <italic>Drosophila simulans</italic> populations to identify selected alleles. We distinguish between the allele frequency dynamics of selective sweeps and polygenic adaptation by testing the redundancy of selected alleles during evolution in a new thermal environment. Genetic redundancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref025">25</xref>] is a key feature of polygenic traits with excess of beneficial variants; as a result, nonparallel genomic changes are expected in populations evolving to the same fitness optimum. We demonstrate that thermal adaptation in this species is highly polygenic and displays an unprecedented level of genetic redundancy, which has been predicted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref025">25</xref>] but has rarely been conclusively demonstrated at the molecular level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref026">26</xref>].</p>

<title>Increased fitness in the evolved replicates</title>
<p>Temperature is a key environmental factor for all ectotherms, and the associated adaptive response in <italic>Drosophila</italic> involves many contributing loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref027">27</xref>]. To understand the genomic architecture of this canonical polygenic trait, we exposed 10 replicates (each with 1,000 individuals) from 202 <italic>D</italic>. <italic>simulans</italic> isofemale lines to a new hot temperature regime that cycled every 12 hours between 18 and 28°C, mimicking night and day. After more than 100 generations, we assessed the adaptive response of the 10 evolving replicates. We contrasted fecundity of the ancestral population with each of the evolved replicates after rearing all of them in the hot temperature regime. In agreement with previous results in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref028">28</xref>] and <italic>simulans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref029">29</xref>], the evolved replicates had significantly higher fecundity, and therefore fitness, than the ancestral population (ANCOVA, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000128.s001">S1A Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Reconstruction of the selected haplotype blocks</title>
<p>To characterize the genomic signature of adaptation in the evolved replicates, we generated replicated time series data by sequencing pools of individuals (Pool-Seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref030">30</xref>]) from the evolving replicates every 10th generation. After stringent filtering steps (Materials and methods), we obtained 5,090,460 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the major chromosomes (X, 2, and 3). We screened for SNPs with more pronounced allele frequency changes (AFCs) following 60 generations of evolution than were expected by genetic drift alone. After testing each replicate separately (Fisher’s exact test) and all replicates jointly (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel [CMH] test) we obtained 52,199 candidate SNPs. The number of reported candidate SNPs is likely heavily inflated because these statistical tests assume independence of all SNPs, which is violated in our experimental population due to linkage disequilibrium between candidate SNPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref032">32</xref>] (in particular for candidate SNPs with a low starting frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref033">33</xref>]). Reasoning that SNPs that are specific to selected haplotypes will have correlated allele frequencies across replicates and time points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref033">33</xref>], we clustered SNPs by allele frequencies and reconstructed selected haplotype blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g001">Fig 1</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and methods</xref> “Reconstruction of the selected haplotype blocks (selected alleles)”). In total, we identified 99 haplotype blocks containing 23,835 SNPs, sized between 1.65 kb and 5 Mb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000128.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). To confirm the accuracy of the reconstructed haplotype blocks, we sequenced 100 haplotypes from five different evolved replicates and 189 ancestral haplotypes. We compared the marker SNPs of the identified haplotype blocks with the phased haplotypes to validate the inferred linkage patterns.

<p>Manhattan plots (panel A, D) show negative log<sub>10</sub> transformed <italic>p</italic>-values from CMH test contrasting the ancestral (F0) with evolved (F60) populations (Chromosome 2L: 1–5 Mb). SNPs with highly correlated allele frequencies across replicates and time points are clustered together with stringent clustering (panel A), and each cluster is indicated by a different color. SNPs in each cluster (e.g., the orange cluster marked with an asterisk in panel A) have correlated frequency trajectories across 60 generations in 10 replicates (panel B); the black line depicts the median allele frequency trajectory. (C) Trajectories of the median allele frequency of the correlated SNPs are shown for each of the clusters in this region (color code corresponds to panel A). Despite different starting frequencies, the median trajectories greatly resemble each other, suggesting that they are correlated and reflect a large selected genomic region. (D) Combining the adjacent short clusters with less stringent correlation identifies a haplotype block with weakly correlated SNPs. All SNPs, which cluster together, are used as markers for this selected haplotype block. (E) Time-resolved allele frequencies of marker SNPs for the haplotype block (panel D) are plotted along their genomic positions. Each dot indicates the mean frequency of five SNPs in overlapping windows (offset = 1 SNP). The time-resolved allele frequencies show a consistent increase across the entire haplotype block throughout the experiment. The data are from replicate 4. (F) The reconstructed haplotype block (panel D, E) is experimentally validated. Rows represent 20 phased haplotypes from evolved replicate 4. The reconstructed haplotype block is indicated by a black frame. Each column corresponds to a marker SNP, with red color indicating the character state of the haplotype block, blue the alternative allele, and yellow an unknown nucleotide.

<title>Phenotypic convergence of the evolved replicates</title>
<p>To determine the selected phenotypes driving the genomic selection signatures, we performed gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses of genes overlapping with the SNP markers of the selected alleles. Consistent with there being many selected genes contributing to similar phenotypes, we detected significant enrichment in several GO categories, including oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial respiratory chain, ATP synthesis coupled electron transport, melanin biosynthesis process, monosaccharide transportation activity, DNA repair, and endopeptidase activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000128.s015">S2 Table</xref>). Moreover, genes in the KEGG pathway oxidative phosphorylation were also significantly enriched (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000128.s016">S3 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>The GO enrichment analysis suggests that several phenotypes changed in response to the hot environment. We chose resting metabolic rate and fat content as high-level phenotypes for experimental validation because (1) they both reflect the enrichment for metabolic pathways (oxidative phosphorylation pathway), (2) fat content has been shown to respond to temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref034">34</xref>], and (3) gene expression differences between hot- and cold-adapted <italic>Drosophila</italic> populations from Africa and Europe also reveal metabolic differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref035">35</xref>]. Consistent with the genomic signature, both fat content and metabolic rate differed between the ancestral population and the evolved replicates. Females in evolved replicates contained significantly less body fat than the ancestral population (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0007, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) and had higher metabolic rates (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), but no difference was noted for males (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.7 for both traits, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>).

<title>Genomic heterogeneity among the evolved replicates</title>
<p>Our experimental setting allowed us to empirically quantify several fundamental variables in adaptation genetics, including the starting frequency and distribution of selection coefficients (<italic>s</italic>) for beneficial alleles. Furthermore, the highly convergent phenotypic response across the replicates allowed us to investigate the fundamental question of whether adaptation to a specific stress is driven by the same alleles in all replicates or whether multiple alternative genetic routes are possible.</p>
<p>Despite the high confidence in the reconstruction of selected haplotype blocks, i.e., selected alleles, the selected sequence variant(s) remain(s) unknown. Hence, we estimated the frequency of each selected allele using the median frequency of all its marker SNPs. Most of the selected alleles started from a low frequency in the ancestral population, but several alleles were rather common with frequencies up to 0.75 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The strong selection coefficients of the selected alleles inferred across the replicates (min = 0.0229, max = 0.137 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) suggest that a highly parallel genomic architecture could be expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref038">38</xref>]. However, we observed a highly heterogeneous response across the 10 replicates. A characteristic example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>, in which a selected allele undergoes a striking frequency change in some replicates but shows no change in others. We quantify the genomic heterogeneity among replicates using a new summary statistic, the replicate frequency spectrum (RFS), which reports the frequency distribution of replicates in which selected alleles increase in frequency. Indeed, using a ≥0.1 AFC cutoff, we find that most of the 99 selected alleles increase in only four to six replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000128.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Few alleles showed a selection response in only one or two replicates, and only a single allele increased in all 10 replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000128.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). On average, 53 selected alleles were identified per replicate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). To account for the influence of the starting allele frequencies in the ancestral population, we also used allele-specific frequency increase thresholds to determine selected alleles in evolved replicates (Materials and methods “Different approaches to determine the presence of selected alleles and their frequencies"), and the same trends were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000128.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), i.e., the frequency distribution of selected alleles is heterogenous across the replicates.</p>

<title>Genomic heterogeneity does not match the sweep paradigm</title>
<p>We used the heterogeneous genomic pattern among replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000128.s003">S3 Fig</xref>) to discern several different adaptive scenarios (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000128.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Because the P-element is spreading in the ancestral population in our experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref040">40</xref>], the observed heterogeneity among replicates might have been driven by the new replicate-specific P-element insertions. Nevertheless, a careful examination of P-element insertions showed that the observed insertions occurred at frequencies that were too low to explain the adaptive response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000128.s017">S4 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>With most selected alleles starting from a low frequency in the ancestral population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) and the moderate effective population size (<italic>N</italic><sub>e</sub>) of the experimental populations (&lt;300, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000128.s018">S5 Table</xref>), the combined effects of selection and genetic drift could have contributed to the observed heterogeneity through differential loss of rare selected alleles across replicates. To test whether the observed heterogeneity among replicates could be explained by the interplay between selection and drift, we simulated evolution under a sweep paradigm with constant <italic>s</italic> (different among alleles but similar across replicates and time) but without linkage and epistasis. Using replicate-specific <italic>N</italic><sub>e</sub> estimates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000128.s018">S5 Table</xref>), and allele-specific starting frequencies and <italic>s</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>), we simulated 1,000 iterations of 99 independent alleles in 10 replicates across 60 generations. We detected some heterogeneity among replicates, but unlike the experimental data, most alleles spread in 7–9 replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). The difference between the RFS of simulated and experimental data was large (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), and the similarities among replicates measured by the Jaccard index are significantly higher in simulated than experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g005">Fig 5B</xref>).

<p>To rule out the possibility that Hill-Robertson interference caused the observed heterogeneity among replicates, we included linkage in sweep simulations using information from 189 phased ancestral haplotypes.

<title>Adaptive genetic redundancy of the selected alleles</title>
<p>Other factors, such as linkage between selected and deleterious alleles, or frequency-dependent selection, could contribute to the observed replicate heterogeneity. Nevertheless, the combination of the striking phenotypic convergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>) and different subsets of selected alleles across replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000128.s003">S3 Fig</xref>) strongly suggests that the ancestral population contained more beneficial alleles than were needed to achieve optimum fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref025">25</xref>], i.e., genetic redundancy. The simplest form of genetic redundancy is when all beneficial alleles have equal effects but not all of them are required in a given replicate to reach the fitness optimum. Under this scenario, different combinations of alleles can reach the fitness optimum in different replicates and subsequently produce a heterogeneous genomic pattern among them. We scrutinized genetic redundancy through jackknifing and randomly sampled a subset of the 99 selected alleles that matched the observed number of selected alleles for each replicate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). This simple paradigm of genetic redundancy fits the observed pattern of heterogeneity among replicates better than simulations based on the sweep paradigm; the difference in RFS between the simulated and experimental data is less than sweep paradigm (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g004">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g005">5A</xref>). Furthermore, the redundancy paradigm fits the experimental data better than the sweep paradigm regardless of the threshold used to detect selected alleles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000128.s009">S9 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the combination of selected alleles shared across the replicates was significantly more similar in the experimental data (median Jaccard index = 0.41) than for randomly combined alleles of the redundancy paradigm (median Jaccard index = 0.36, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−5</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Despite a significant difference, the experimental Jaccard index is only slightly higher than for random combinations of alleles. The higher similarity of the experimentally evolved replicates could simply be a consequence of alleles with higher starting frequency increasing in frequency in more replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000128.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). Thus, unlike a previous report of convergent adaptation in two tree species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref041">41</xref>], we find no evidence for strong genetic constraints that limit the possible combination of beneficial alleles in our experimental populations.</p>
<p>Because our redundancy test did not model the frequency trajectory of selected alleles, we also simulated a quantitative trait (QT) with stabilizing selection after a shift in trait optimum. We assumed equal effect size for all 99 alleles in 10 replicates with starting frequencies matching the experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) and simulated frequency trajectories of selected unlinked alleles in a population of 300 diploids for 60 generations. These simple QT simulations nicely matched the observed heterogeneity pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). The RFS difference between the simulated and experimental data was smaller than for other adaptive scenarios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), and the similarity among replicates in simulated data was not statistically different from the empirical data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). A similar fit was obtained when modeling linkage for the beneficial alleles in the QT paradigm, using the same linkage parameterization as in the sweep simulations (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g004">4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g005">5A and 5B</xref>). Regardless of which frequency threshold was used to identify selected alleles, the difference in RFS between the experimental data and the simulated data under a QT without (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000128.s011">S11 Fig</xref>) and with (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000128.s012">S12 Fig</xref>) linkage was still less than sweep paradigm simulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000128.s008">S8 Fig</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Quantitative genetic theory assumes that, in populations close to the trait optimum, strong-effect alleles do not segregate at intermediate frequencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref043">43</xref>]. Thus, after shifts of the trait optimum, the phenotypic response is typically mediated by many small-effect alleles with no discernable change in allele frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref016">16</xref>]. In our data, strongly selected alleles (mean <italic>s</italic> = 0.059) do occur at intermediate frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, max = 0.75; mean = 0.182). This discrepancy may have several explanations, ranging from an ancestral population that has not reached the trait optimum to major impact of genetic drift and population structure and migration-selection balance in the ancestral population. The abundance of large-effect alleles contributing to adaptation also contradicts another theoretical prediction that polygenic trait adaptation is driven by alleles of small effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref044">44</xref>]. We addressed the possibility that the strong selection response in our experiment is driven by the combined effect of a large number of small-effect variants located on the selected allele: if a large number of randomly distributed variants contributes to the selected trait (i.e., infinitesimal model), the size of a selected genomic region should correlate with the number of contributing variants resulting in stronger selection for larger alleles. We tested this by regressing the estimated <italic>s</italic> of a given allele with its starting frequency, the number of replicates in which an allele increases in frequency (replicate frequency), and locus size (either physical or genetic distance). Because only the starting frequency (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 1.11 × 10<sup>−12</sup>) and replicate frequency (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 2.2 × 10<sup>−16</sup>) were significant, our data do not support a model with many randomly distributed targets of selection. These conclusions are robust to the choice of frequency increase threshold for determining replicate frequency and estimating <italic>s</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000128.s019">S6 Table</xref>).

<p>With 99 selected alleles and 202 founder isofemale lines, on average, every second founder carries a different selected allele. This implies that natural <italic>D</italic>. <italic>simulans</italic> populations harbor vast reservoirs of variants capable of contributing to temperature adaptation and different combinations of these variants result in similar phenotypic changes. Thus, beneficial alleles tend to segregate at higher frequencies than neutral SNPs in our experimental population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g006">Fig 6</xref>), suggesting a role for balancing selection—possibly driven by seasonal temperature changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref045">45</xref>].</p>

<p>Is the adaptive genetic redundancy of temperature adaptation an exception, or do more traits have a similar genetic basis? The empirical evidence for adaptive genetic redundancy is extremely sparse, but this probably reflects a bias toward methodologies that search for convergent genetic changes. Studies of genomics of adaptation in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref046">46</xref>] and <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref037">37</xref>] have identified repeatable genomic signatures in replicate populations. However, these populations have either started from fewer lines, whereby beneficial alleles had higher starting frequencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref046">46</xref>] or had been maintained in lab for a very long time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref037">37</xref>]. Indeed, recent studies that used freshly collected individuals have identified more heterogeneous genomic responses among replicate populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref026">26</xref>]. Examples for adaptive genetic redundancy include de novo mutations in experimental <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref047">47</xref>], pigmentation in African <italic>Drosophila</italic> in which different genes contribute to the same dark phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref048">48</xref>], desiccation resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref026">26</xref>], and the hemoglobin oxygen affinity mediated by different amino acid substitutions in 56 avian taxa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref049">49</xref>]. Truncating selection studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref050">50</xref>] and corn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref051">51</xref>] reporting rapid phenotypic responses despite a small number of founders also indirectly support the presence of abundant genetic redundancy in natural populations. The abundance of large-effect beneficial alleles segregating in natural populations suggests that more alleles are segregating than needed to reach the fitness optimum, and ultimately many alternative genetic pathways can be used. Thus, the genomic signature of adaptation could differ among natural populations exposed to a similar environment, and genome scans for convergent genomic signatures across populations are less likely to succeed for such QTs.</p>

<title>SNP calling</title>
<p>SNPs were called from replicates of the ancestral population; in brief, SNPs with base quality of 40 in at least one of the 10 ancestral replicates were selected for further analyses. To improve the reliability of the pipeline, the polymorphic sites in the upper 1% and lower 1% tails of the coverage distribution (i.e., ≥423× and ≤30×, respectively; upper tail based on the library with the highest sequencing depth; lower tail estimated from total coverage of all ancestral and evolved replicates at generation 60, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000128.s021">S8 Table</xref>), and minor alleles with coverage less than 10 reads were removed.

<title>Inference of candidate SNPs</title>
<p>To identify SNPs with pronounced AFCs, Fisher’s exact and CMH tests were used. First, we contrasted the ancestral and the evolved replicates at generation 60 using the CMH test to identify SNPs with a consistent frequency change across replicates (using PoPoolation2, function <italic>cmh-test</italic>.<italic>pl</italic>). Second, the pronounced AFCs specific to each replicate were determined by contrasting each ancestral replicate with the corresponding evolved replicate at generation 60 (e.g., ancestral replicate 5 with evolved replicate 5) using Fisher’s exact test (PoPoolation2, function <italic>fisher-test</italic>.<italic>pl</italic>: option—<italic>min-count 5</italic>). For the parameters of <italic>fisher-test</italic>.<italic>pl</italic>, the minimum SNP coverage for each replicate was set to 5% of the average coverage of ancestral and evolved (generation 60) samples. For the maximum coverage, the upper 1% tail of the coverage distribution in the sample with the highest sequencing depth was chosen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000128.s021">S8 Table</xref>). In total, 10 Fisher exact tests were performed.</p>
<p>Neither the CMH nor the Fisher’s exact test accounts for drift. Thus, to determine the candidate SNPs whose AFCs were higher than expected under drift, neutral Wright-Fisher simulations were performed with Nest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref056">56</xref>] (function <italic>wf</italic>.<italic>traj</italic>) assuming independence among SNPs. As a first step for the neutral simulations, <italic>N</italic><sub>e</sub> was estimated for each of the replicates. We used windows of 1,000 SNPs based on AFCs between the ancestral and evolved replicates at generation 60 for autosomes (each chromosome separately) and the X chromosome using Nest (function <italic>estimateWndNe</italic>, method <italic>Np</italic>.<italic>planI</italic>). We averaged the medians of the <italic>N</italic><sub>e</sub> estimates across replicates; the estimated <italic>N</italic><sub>e</sub> was 291 for autosomes and 262 for the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000128.s018">S5 Table</xref>), and we used these estimates of <italic>N</italic><sub>e</sub> to perform simulations to compute false discovery rate–corrected q-values of the CMH test. We computed false discovery rate–corrected q-values for the Fisher’s exact test by performing neutral simulation using replicate-specific <italic>N</italic><sub>e</sub> estimates for autosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000128.s018">S5 Table</xref>) and a <italic>N</italic><sub>e</sub> of 262 for the X chromosome. The simulation parameters (i.e., number of SNPs, allele frequencies in the ancestral replicates, sequence coverage of replicates, and the number of replicates and generations) matched the experimental data. Candidate SNPs were inferred based on an empirical CMH/Fisher’s exact test cutoff (q ≤ 0.05) using neutral simulations. After correction, we obtained 47,532 candidate SNPs across replicates (CMH test), and 4,667 additional SNPs deviated from neutral expectations in at least one of the replicates (Fisher’s exact test). This number of candidate SNPs is still heavily inflated due to the considerable linkage expected in our experiment.</p>

<title>Reconstruction of the selected haplotype blocks (selected alleles)</title>
<p>Because only few recombination events occur during 60 generations of evolve and resequence (E&amp;R) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, selected variants typically occur on rather large haplotype blocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref057">57</xref>]. While some methods have been proposed to reconstruct haplotypes from Pool-Seq data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref059">59</xref>], they are restricted to cases in which most of the founder haplotypes are known. Although we have sequenced 189 phased haplotypes from the ancestral population, this number accounts for only about 25% of the founder chromosomes (the 202 isofemale lines used for establishing the ancestral population were not inbred). Therefore, we identified haplotype blocks carrying the beneficial mutation using a modification of a recently published approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref033">33</xref>]. We reasoned that SNPs specific to selected haplotypes have correlated allele frequencies across replicates and time points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref033">33</xref>]. Thus, we clustered SNPs by allele frequencies and shifted our focus from candidate SNPs to selected haplotype blocks.</p>
<p>First, we grouped candidate SNPs together with stringent clustering (minimum average Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.75 among SNPs). Candidate SNPs (q ≤ 0.05) inferred from both CMH and Fisher’s exact tests were combined and used for the selected haplotype block reconstruction; the candidate SNPs from the CMH test were polarized based on the rising allele, and only SNPs with a frequency increase of ≥0.2 (between any time points from F0 to F60) in at least two replicates were retained. Additionally, all candidate SNPs from Fisher’s exact tests were polarized based on the rising allele and used for block reconstruction. The allele frequencies of these candidate SNPs were transformed (arcsine of the square root, using <italic>numpy</italic>.<italic>arcsin</italic> and <italic>numpy</italic>.<italic>sqrt</italic> functions in Python) and standardized, i.e., centered to mean and scaled to unit variance (using function <italic>sklearn</italic>.<italic>preprocessing</italic>.<italic>scale</italic> in Python). The left and right arms of Chromosomes 2 and 3 were concatenated for this analysis, because some haplotype blocks overlap the centromere. All pairwise Pearson’s correlation coefficients were computed among SNPs in sliding windows of 1 Mb with a step size of 500 kb. Each window should have at least a minimum of 20 candidate SNPs. The correlation matrix was converted to Euclidean distance, d = √2(1 − r), and entered in a distance matrix (using function <italic>scipy</italic>.<italic>spatial</italic>.<italic>distance</italic>.<italic>squareform</italic> in Python), which was used for hierarchical clustering (using function <italic>scipy</italic>.<italic>cluster</italic>.<italic>hierarchy</italic>.<italic>linkage</italic> in Python). SNPs with the minimum average Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.75 were classified into a cluster. Clusters obtained from overlapping windows were merged if they shared at least five SNPs. Only clusters with more than 20 SNPs were retained.</p>
<p>We identified many relatively short clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). Recombination, either in the ancestral population or during the experiment, results in less strongly correlated allele frequency trajectories. Hence, several adjacent clusters show very similar frequency change across replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Therefore, all the SNPs in clusters with average correlation of 0.75 (see above) were used for another round of clustering (similar to above), but SNPs with the minimum average Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.35 were classified into a cluster. Similar to above, clusters that share at least five SNPs in overlapping windows were merged. The importance of combining clusters with correlated allele frequency trajectories into a haplotype block is evident from the presence of several distinct peaks in the genomic region underlying a haplotype block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Without information about the correlation, a naïve interpretation may have been that several independent alleles were selected.</p>

<title>Validation of reconstructed haplotype blocks using phased haplotypes</title>

We accounted for the presence of ambiguous alleles (very low or high coverage) in phased haplotypes by allowing up to 20% missing or mismatched SNPs to consider a phased haplotype to contain a reconstructed block (i.e., ≥80% sequence identity). Of the reconstructed haplotype blocks, 84% and 82% were present in the evolved and ancestral haplotypes, respectively (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g001">Fig 1F</xref> for an example, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000128.s014">S1 Table</xref>).

<title>Selected haplotype blocks: Selected alleles</title>
<p>Typically, multiple haplotypes are associated with a putative selection target, in particular when it occurs at higher frequency in the ancestral population. Because we cannot identify the selected mutation, we use the term “selected allele” in the subsequent analyses to refer to selected haplotype blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>), i.e., describing a suite of haplotype blocks carrying the target(s) of selection. Due to the limited mapping resolution in our experiment, we cannot distinguish whether the selection signature of a selected allele is generated by multiple selected targets (allelic heterogeneity) or a single target of selection. However, we addressed the possibility that the selection response in our experiment is driven by the combined effect of a large number of small-effect alleles located on the selected haplotype blocks (Materials and methods: “Identification of factors affecting <italic>s</italic>”).</p>

<sec id="sec019">
<title>Different approaches to determine the presence of selected alleles and their frequencies</title>
<p>Despite selected haplotype blocks being reconstructed with high confidence, the selected sequence variant remains unknown. Because estimates of the selection coefficient (<italic>s</italic>) and the results of computer simulations under the different selection regimes critically depend on the allele frequency of the selection target, we used six different methods to estimate the frequency of the selected allele. In the ancestral and evolved populations, the frequency of selection targets is estimated by the median frequency of all SNPs characterizing a selected allele (please note that we redefine selected alleles for method 5 and 6). Furthermore, our analyses require the distinction between selection targets increasing in frequency (i.e., contributing to adaptation) and those not contributing to adaptation.</p>
<sec id="sec020">
<title>Methods 1 and 2</title>
<p>Method 1 and method 2 use an ad hoc cutoff for AFC in the contrast between the ancestral population and the evolved replicates at generation 60. Thus, replicates with at least a 0.1 (method 1) or 0.2 (method 2) frequency increase of selected alleles after 60 generations were considered to have alleles contributing to adaptation and consequently were included in the calculation of <italic>s</italic> (see below: “Inference of selection coefficient”).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec021">
<title>Methods 3 and 4</title>
<p>Because the AFC for selected and neutral alleles depends strongly on the allele frequency in the ancestral population, methods 3 and 4 use an allele-specific frequency change threshold, which depends on the frequency in the ancestral population. We performed selective sweep simulations to determine the expected frequency increase under selection for each allele. For each selected allele, <italic>s</italic> was computed for all 10 replicates (“Inference of selection coefficient”), and the highest <italic>s</italic> was used for forward Wright-Fisher simulations. A total of 1,000 simulations were performed for each allele using PoolSeq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref063">63</xref>] (function <italic>wf</italic>.<italic>traj</italic>) using replicate-specific <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000128.s018">S5 Table</xref>) and starting frequency.

To avoid this bias, we assumed that the region with the highest <italic>s</italic> in a selected allele contains the target(s) of selection: each selected allele was divided into several regions (clustering with stringent correlation coefficient of 0.75), and for each region, the median <italic>s</italic> across the replicates with a frequency increase ≥0.1 was computed, similar to method 1.

<title>Contrasting selective sweep and QT paradigms</title>
<p>We observed a highly heterogeneous response across the 10 evolved replicates; most of the 99 selected alleles increase in only four to six replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000128.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). We used this heterogeneous pattern among replicates to discern several different adaptive scenarios (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000128.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To compare different evolutionary paradigms (sections A–E below correspond to scenarios A–E in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000128.s004">S4 Fig</xref>) to the empirical data, we used the RFS—i.e., the frequency distribution of replicates in which selected alleles increase in frequency—as a summary statistic to measure the fit between the simulated and observed data. We determined the RFS using different thresholds of frequency increase (method 1–6) to identify replicates with a selected allele. These thresholds are specified in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000128.s004">S4 Fig</xref> with different colors.</p>
<p>Because simulations of the QT paradigm (sections C–E below, C–E in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000128.s004">S4 Fig</xref>) require additional parameters, which cannot be estimated from the data (e.g., distance to the trait optimum), we did not perform simulations for all methods to estimate the frequencies of selected alleles. We used only three different thresholds based on method 1, 3, and 4 to identify selected alleles in each replicate.</p>
<p>In each evolutionary scenario summarized in section A–E, 1,000 sets of 10 replicates (similar to empirical data) were simulated, RFS was determined for each set, and mean and 95% CI were computed for each category of RFS (i.e., 1 to 10 replicates). For each simulation, we compared RFS of the empirical data (observed) and the mean RFS of simulations (expected) using Σ(obs − exp)<sup>2</sup>. We compared Σ(obs − exp)<sup>2</sup> of different simulations using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s honest significant difference (HSD).</p>
<p>We also estimated the similarity among replicates by calculating the Jaccard index of all pairwise combinations in evolved replicates using the same three thresholds used for QT simulations (method 1, 3, 4; see above). Pairwise Jaccard indices were also computed for each simulation set of 10 replicates for all evolutionary scenarios in A–E using the same three frequency change thresholds: methods 1, 3, and 4 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000128.s008">S8</xref>).</p>

<title>A. Sweep paradigm with a constant <italic>s</italic> across replicates and no linkage</title>
<p>Because drift in small populations can result in considerable heterogeneity among replicates, we used computer simulations to test whether the observed heterogeneity among replicates can be explained by the combined effect of the selective sweep and drift.

<title>C. Genetic redundancy paradigm</title>
<p>One prediction of the QT paradigm with stabilizing selection is that the same trait optimum can be obtained by different combinations of contributing alleles (genetic redundancy). Before simulating the trajectories of the selected alleles, we first tested genetic redundancy.</p>
<p>Independent of the method used to estimate the frequency of the selected allele (and thus the method to determine the threshold for allele frequency increase after 60 generations), a different number of selected alleles was detected among the replicate populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000128.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Nevertheless, all replicates converged for the high-level phenotypes: fitness, fat content, and resting metabolic rate (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g002">2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000128.g002">2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000128.s001">S1B</xref>).

Hence, we first identified P-element insertions and then compared the frequency increases of the P-elements to the one of selected alleles.</p>
<p>The raw reads of evolved replicates at generation 60 were separately mapped to a TE-merged reference genome using bwa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref066">66</xref>] version 0.7.9a (<italic>bwasw</italic> algorithm).

<p>We used different frequency thresholds for identification of selected alleles (methods 1, 3, and 4). We filtered the identified P-elements by selecting those with frequencies ≥threshold that have insertion sites in the genomic regions corresponding to selected alleles. Furthermore, the P-elements with frequency increase must be present in at least one of the replicates that have frequency increase of ≥threshold for any given selected allele. Then, for each selected allele with an available P-element in the filtered data set, we computed delta (absolute frequency difference) using the frequency of the allele in any of the two replicates with highest frequency at generation 60 and the frequency of the P-element in those replicates.</p>

<p>All phenotypic assays were performed in a common garden setting (with temperature fluctuating between 18°C and 28°C) to eliminate the possibility that uncontrolled environmental variation is affecting the phenotypic measurements. We reconstituted the ancestral population from the isofemale lines that were used to seed the original ancestral population. Because <italic>N</italic><sub>e</sub> of isofemale lines is very small, very limited adaptation is expected to have occurred during their maintenance in the lab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref071">71</xref>]. Even mutations accumulated during the maintenance of the isofemale lines are not expected to have a major influence because they will be specific to individual isofemale lines and will thus represent only a small fraction in the reconstituted ancestral population. We refer to the reconstituted ancestral population as “ancestral population” hereafter. All 10 evolved replicates and the ancestral population were maintained for at least two generations at the assaying conditions with controlled density (400 eggs per bottle) prior to assays to avoid maternal effects.</p>

<title>A. Fecundity assay</title>
<p>At generation 103, between three to six subreplicates were set up for each of the 10 evolved replicates to ensure reliable fecundity estimates. Ten subreplicates were set up for the ancestral population. Immediately after eclosion, around 250 flies (females and males) were put in a bottle. Because the flies were collected under CO<sub>2</sub> anesthesia, we only started measuring fecundity in two-day-old flies. For the next four days, which corresponds to the egg-laying period during the experimental evolution, the flies were daily transferred to new bottles without CO<sub>2</sub> anesthesia, and the eggs in each bottle were counted. After the fourth day, females and males were separated, and the females were counted, dried, and weighed. Fecundity—measured as the total number of eggs laid per female during four days (between day two to five after eclosion)—was log10-transformed and analyzed using a linear model.</p>
<p>To test for the significance between fecundity of the ancestral and evolved (all 10 evolved replicates combined) populations, we initially fitted a linear mixed model with a fixed categorical effect (population) with two levels (ancestral and evolved) and a fixed continuous effect (average body weight). The subreplicates of the ancestral and evolved populations were included as a random effect. The mixed model was not significantly different from the linear fixed effects model tested using the function <italic>anova</italic>. Therefore, following the principle of parsimony, we present results from the linear fixed effects model (Fecundity<sub>ijk</sub> ~ μ + population<sub>i</sub> + average body weight<sub>j</sub> + error<sub>ijk</sub>).

<title>B. Resting metabolism assay</title>
<p>The evolved populations were at generation 113 when phenotyped for resting metabolic rate. The flies used for measurement of metabolic rate were maintained at controlled density as described above (evolved replicates for seven to nine and ancestral population for four to seven generations). Flies were collected immediately after eclosion and mated for 24 hours, and then females and males were separated and maintained in bottles with <italic>Drosophila</italic> medium (150 flies in a bottle). After 48 hours of CO<sub>2</sub> anesthesia recovery, flies were used for metabolic rate measurement. Females and males were four to five and six to seven days old, respectively, during resting metabolic measurements. Our preliminary assays identified no significant difference in the metabolic rate of four- to five- and six- to seven-day-old males when groups of 25 males were tested in RC respirometry chambers (30 mL; Sable Systems, Las Vegas, Nevada). For measuring metabolic rate, 150 flies were transferred to a 250-mL bottle without CO<sub>2</sub> anesthesia. To avoid desiccation and starvation, 50 mL of <italic>Drosophila</italic> medium was placed in each bottle and sealed with a stopper. The resting metabolic rate was measured by repeated CO<sub>2</sub> emission measurements of stop-flow respirometry (Sable Systems). Flies of different replicates were randomly assigned to each bottle, and one bottle with only <italic>Drosophila</italic> medium was used as an empty control in each run. CO<sub>2</sub> measurement was conducted at 18°C in the dark, overnight for at least 12 hours. During the measurement assay, an 8-channel multiplexer (RM8 Intelligent Multiplexer) controlled the sequential flushing and closing of eight bottles. Each bottle was flushed for 15 minutes at a constant flow rate of 75 μL/min. After the flush phase, the bottle was closed while the rest of bottles continued to be flushed. Therefore, CO<sub>2</sub> in each bottle was measured every two hours. The flushed air passed through a magnesium perchlorate column to remove water, and CO<sub>2</sub> was measured with a CA-10A carbon dioxide analyzer (Sable Systems). At the end of each run, the flies were counted, dried, and weighed. An in-house macro was used for computing the total CO<sub>2</sub> emission during each flushing time and the mean flow rate by ExpeData software. The resting metabolic rate for each bottle was computed as the average of the three lowest data points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref073">73</xref>]. The metabolic rate is presented as V<sub>CO2</sub> μL h<sup>−1</sup> mg<sup>−1</sup>. A total of 32 subreplicates (16 for each sex) were measured for the ancestral population. At least six subreplicates were measured for each evolved replicate (three for each sex).</p>
<p>To test for the significance between the metabolic rate of the ancestral and evolved (all 10 evolved replicates combined) populations, we initially fitted a linear mixed model with two fixed categorical effects (population and sex) each with two levels (population: ancestral and evolved; sex: female and male) and interaction between the fixed categorical effects. Subreplicates of the ancestral population and subreplicates of the evolved replicates were included as a random effect. Similar to fecundity, the mixed model was not significantly different from the linear fixed effects model. Therefore, we present results from the linear fixed-effects model (Metabolism<sub>ijk</sub> ~ μ + population<sub>i</sub> + sex<sub>j</sub> + population<sub>i</sub>: sex<sub>j</sub> + error<sub>ijk</sub>).

<p>We assayed the ancestral population and evolved replicates for fat content at generation 124. Similar to other phenotypic assays, the evolved replicates and ancestral population were maintained in a density-controlled common garden setting (for three to six generations). After eclosion, flies were mated for 1 day, and females and males were separated and placed in vials (eight flies in each vial). After 48 hours, the body fat was measured in four-day-old flies three hours after the start of the daily 28°C cycle. Homogenates were prepared as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref074">74</xref>], and lipid measurements were performed by coupled colorimetric assay as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000128.ref075">75</xref>]. Flies were placed in a 2-mL screwcap tube containing 600 μL 0.05% Tween-20 and two 5-mm sterile metal beads and were homogenized by a SPEX SamplePrep 1600 MiniG for 2 minutes at 1,475 rpm. Homogenates were heat-inactivated for 5 minutes at 70°C and centrifuged for 9 minutes at 9,000 rpm, and 200 μL of the supernatant was transferred to an Eppendorf tube and immediately used for lipid measurements. We used a Glycerol standard (Sigma G7793) as reference. The amount of 50 μL of supernatant and standards (1.2, 1, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0 mg/mL) were transferred to a 96-well plate, and blank absorbance was measured at 540 nm in an EnSpire 2300 Microplate Reader (PerkinElmer). The amount of 200 μL of Triglyceride Working Reagent (Sigma, Catalog number TR0100) was added to each sample and standards and was incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes with mild shaking. After the incubation time, the final absorbance was measured at 540 nm. The two measurements were first blank-corrected by subtraction of blank (i.e., 0.05% Tween-20), and then the second absorbance was subtracted from the first absorbance. Glycerol standards were done in duplicates, and two measurements were averaged for making the standard curves with polynomial regression line to compute the concentration of triglyceride (TAG) in the samples. Fat content is expressed as μg TAG equivalents per fly. A total of 26 subreplicates (13 for each sex) were measured for the ancestral population, and eight subreplicates were measured for each evolved replicate (four for each sex).</p>
<p>The measured fat content (μg TAG equivalents/fly) was log-transformed and analyzed using a linear model. To test for the significance between the fat content of the ancestral and evolved (all 10 evolved replicates combined) populations, we initially fitted a linear mixed model with two fixed categorical effects (population and sex) each with two levels (population: ancestral and evolved; sex: female and male), a fixed continuous effect (average body weight), and interaction between the fixed categorical effects. The subreplicates of the ancestral population and subreplicates of the evolved replicates were included as a random effect. Due to error during weighing, for six subreplicates, we did not provide weight values in the linear model. The average body weight was not significant and was therefore dropped from the model. The mixed model was also not significantly different from the linear fixed effects model. Therefore, we present results from the linear fixed effects model (Lipid<sub>ijk</sub> ~ μ + population<sub>i</sub> + sex<sub>j</sub> + population<sub>i</sub>: sex<sub>j</sub> + error<sub>ijk</sub>). The data met the assumptions of normality of the residuals and homogeneity of variance.</p>
<p>The same model as above was used to test for differences between the 10 evolved replicates. Here, we treated population as a fixed categorical effect with 10 levels. Similar to other phenotypic assays, the mixed effects model including a random effect was not significantly better than the fixed effects model and was therefore dropped in favor of the simpler fixed effects model. The interaction between fixed effects was dropped from the final model because it was not significant. Significance of the fixed effects was tested using ANOVA F-tests. We present effect sizes as lsmeans and used Tukey’s HSD to correct for multiple testing.</p>

<title>Increased fitness and phenotypic similarity among 10 evolved replicates.</title>
<p>(A) Evolved females are more fecund than the ancestral population (ANCOVA, Tukey’s HSD test <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). The number of eggs laid over four days (two to five days after eclosion) were counted, (B) Females of 10 evolved replicates are equally fecund (ANCOVA, Tukey’s HSD test, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Similar fat content (C) and metabolic rate (D) were measured among males of the evolved replicates (two-way ANOVA, Tukey’s HSD test <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). The bars show least-squares means of the linear model, and error bars depict 95% confidence levels of least-squares means. The dark khaki horizontal bar shows the 95% confidence levels of least-squares means of the ancestral population.

<title>Genomic heterogeneity in evolved replicates.</title>
<p>The RFS shows the frequency distribution of replicates in which selected alleles increase in frequency. Different thresholds were used to identify an allele as selected in each replicate; Top panel: ≥0.1 (method 1) and ≥0.2 AFC (method 2): an allele with ≥0.1/0.2 frequency change, bottom panel: ≥5% (method 3) and ≥10% (method 4) ASFC: lower 5%/10% tail of AFC in selective sweep simulations (Materials and methods “Different approaches to determine the presence of selected alleles and their frequencies”). Regardless of the threshold used to determine a selected allele in a given replicate, a heterogeneous pattern among replicates is observed.

<title>Different simulation scenarios used to contrast selective sweep and QT paradigms.</title>
<p>We compare different adaptive sweep and QT scenarios to the empirical data: selective sweep simulations of alleles without (panel A) and with (panel B) linkage were studied, as well as different aspects of a QT paradigm: genetic redundancy (panel C) and simulations of AFCs assuming a QT with stabilizing selection without (panel D) and with (panel E) linkage among alleles. Sweep simulations (panel A and B) were performed for 99 (A1–6, B1–6) and 79 alleles (increasing in more than four replicates, A7 and B7). The selection coefficient (<italic>s</italic>) was estimated using the median frequency trajectories of selected alleles in replicates with ≥0.1 (method 1, orange circles) and ≥0.2 (method 2, brown circles) AFC. <italic>s</italic> was also estimated using the median frequency change in replicates with ≥5% (method 3, light blue circle) and ≥10% (method 4, dark blue circle) ASFC. <italic>s</italic> and starting frequency of the selected alleles were estimated using either all SNP characteristic of a given selected allele (“full alleles”) or only the “core region” (methods 5 and 6). See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and methods</xref> “Different approaches to determine the presence of selected alleles and their frequencies” for description of different methods and the definition of core region. The details of the redundancy paradigm are explained in Materials and methods “C. Genetic redundancy paradigm.” Simulations of a QT with stabilizing selection were performed with 99 loci using starting frequency of selected alleles (“full allele”) and equal effect sizes of all alleles using unlinked (panel D) or linked (panel E) alleles.

<title>Selection coefficients (<italic>s</italic>) of selected alleles using different approaches to estimate the frequency of a given selected allele.</title>
<p>The median frequency of each allele (the median frequency of all marker SNPs of a selected allele) was computed, and the frequency trajectory of replicates with ≥0.1 (method 1) and ≥0.2 (method 2) AFC until generation 60 were used for <italic>s</italic> estimation (A–C).
