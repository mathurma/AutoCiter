<abstract>
<p>Categorization is an important cognitive process. However, the correct categorization of a stimulus is often challenging because categories can have overlapping boundaries. Whereas perceptual categorization has been extensively studied in vision, the analogous phenomenon in audition has yet to be systematically explored. Here, we test whether and how human subjects learn to use category distributions and prior probabilities, as well as whether subjects employ an optimal decision strategy when making auditory-category decisions. We asked subjects to classify the frequency of a tone burst into one of two overlapping, uniform categories according to the perceived tone frequency. We systematically varied the prior probability of presenting a tone burst with a frequency originating from one versus the other category. Most subjects learned these changes in prior probabilities early in testing and used this information to influence categorization. We also measured each subject's frequency-discrimination thresholds (i.e., their sensory uncertainty levels). We tested each subject's average behavior against variations of a Bayesian model that either led to optimal or sub-optimal decision behavior (i.e. probability matching). In both <italic>predicting</italic> and <italic>fitting</italic> each subject's average behavior, we found that probability matching provided a better account of human decision behavior. The model fits confirmed that subjects were able to learn category prior probabilities and approximate forms of the category distributions. Finally, we systematically explored the potential ways that additional noise sources could influence categorization behavior. We found that an optimal decision strategy can produce probability-matching behavior if it utilized non-stationary category distributions and prior probabilities formed over a short stimulus history. Our work extends previous findings into the auditory domain and reformulates the issue of categorization in a manner that can help to interpret the results of previous research within a generative framework.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Categorization is an important cognitive process that allows us to simplify, extract meaning from, and respond to objects in the sensory environment. However, categorization is complicated because an object can belong to multiple categories. Thus, to inform our categorical judgments, we must make use of prior information. Given the importance of categorization, we hypothesized that humans utilize optimal strategies for making categorical judgments that allow us to minimize categorization errors. We found, though, that whereas subjects used prior information (i.e., category prior probability), they were sub-optimal in their categorization behavior. This seems to be common in other perceptual and cognitive tasks as well. We then explored the bases for this sub-optimal behavior and found that it can be consistent with an optimal strategy if we assume that subjects have trial-by-trial noise in components of the judgment process. This work extends previous similar findings into the field of auditory categorization and provides a means to reinterpret previous results.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Categorization is a natural and adaptive process that allows the brain to organize the typically high-dimensional and continuous sensory information into robust hierarchical and discrete representations. These discrete representations, or categories, are a means to mentally manipulate, reason about, and respond to objects in our environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Ashby1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Grinband1">[2]</xref>. For instance, in auditory perception, humans and other animals can ignore the natural acoustic variability that exists between different utterances of the same vocalization in order to differentiate one type of vocalization (e.g., a <italic>howl</italic>) from a second type (e.g., a <italic>bark</italic>). In other situations, listeners can use this variability to identify one caller (e.g., Lassie) from another (e.g., Benji).</p>
<p>The perceptual ease with which we can categorize sound belies the complex computations underlying this ability. One reason categorization is complex is that a sensory property may be ambiguous with respect to the stimulus' category membership. For example, because both dogs and wolves can produce howls, the acoustic structure of the howl by itself may not provide enough information to the listener for proper identification of the caller. In such cases, and in the absence of other sensory information, the listener needs to rely on other sources of information to correctly categorize a sound and identify whether the howl came from a dog or a wolf. This information can be prior knowledge such as knowing that the probability of encountering a wolf is low. Since prior information is subjective, it is of fundamental interest to understand the degree to which an observer acquires this information and then uses it to perform categorical judgments.</p>
<p>The utility of prior information in visual categorization has been well studied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Ashby1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Lee1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Hansen2">[10]</xref>. In comparison, our understanding of how prior information informs categorical judgments in audition is relatively limited and has only more recently become an active area of research <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Holt1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Sullivan2">[15]</xref>. More importantly, auditory categorization has not been tested or modeled in situations in which the auditory stimulus is ambiguous with regard to its category membership. Understanding auditory-categorization behavior is important for differentiating between modality-specific versus modality-general computational strategies, which can provide insights into the underlying neural computations.</p>
<p>In particular, categorization can be understood as the result of a probabilistic inference process in which the observer combines sensory and prior information according to their relative levels of uncertainty (noise) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Knill1">[16]</xref>. Bayesian statistics is a useful mathematical framework to formulate generative models for such categorical inference processes. However, it requires a precise quantification of the different levels of uncertainty in order to provide behavioral predictions that allow for unique model interpretations. For example, different decision strategies can lead to very similar model predictions if the sensory noise levels are allowed to be free parameters.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was two-fold: (1) to test whether human subjects can learn and use category-prior information when making auditory categorical judgments and (2) to carefully constrain and validate a generative Bayesian model of auditory categorization against experimental data. To this end, we developed a novel auditory categorization task that required subjects to categorize the frequency of a tone burst into one of two overlapping categories (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). We systematically varied the prior probability of choosing a frequency from category <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in different blocks of the experiment. Furthermore, we determined each subject's sensory uncertainty by measuring individual frequency-discrimination thresholds. Based on these uncertainty measurements, we formulated a Bayesian model to individually quantify how well each subject learned the categorical priors (i.e., the category distributions and prior probabilities) and to test whether subject's employed an optimal decision strategy. We found that most subjects appropriately learned the different category prior probabilities, yet showed some variability and uncertainty in the shape of the learned category distributions. Furthermore, given the measured sensory uncertainty during the experiment, subjects' overall behavior was more consistent with probability matching rather than an optimal decision strategy for category choice. Further analyses indicated that overall probability-matching behavior could emerge if, trial-by-trial, subjects employed an optimal decision strategy and assumed non-stationary categorical priors.</p>

<title>Experimental setup</title>
<p>Six subjects (two female) participated in two tasks: (1) a discrimination task that estimated each subject's frequency-discrimination thresholds and (2) an auditory-categorization task that tested how each subject used category-prior information. Both tasks were conducted in a darkened anechoic chamber (2 m×1.5 m, Industrial Acoustics Company, Inc.), which housed a chair for the subject, a gamepad, a table mounted with an LCD computer screen (P190S, Dell, Inc.), a speaker (MSP7, Yamaha, Inc.), and a chin rest. The speaker was positioned ∼0.1 m below a subject's ears when his/her head was placed on the chin rest. The gamepad registered the subject's responses during each task. Both the discrimination and categorization tasks were designed and implemented in MATLAB (version R2010b) with the Tower-of-Psych and Snow-Dots packages (freely available resources <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Heasley1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Heasley2">[18]</xref>). For both tasks, the stimuli were 750-ms tone bursts (10-ms <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ramp; frequency range: 500–5550 Hz). The tone frequencies were distributed uniformly in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> units. Stimuli were synthesized with an RX6 Multifunction Processor (Tucker-Davis Technologies, Inc.) with a sampling rate of 25 kHz and were presented at 65 (± 3) dB SPL.</p>

<title>Discrimination task and analysis</title>
<p>Each subject participated in a two-interval, two-alternative forced choice frequency-discrimination task. This task measured each subject's frequency-discrimination threshold at eight different “standard” frequencies, which were distributed between 500–5550 Hz: 794, 1260, 2297, 2639, 3031, 3482, 4462, and 4976 Hz. A trial began with a visual “GO” cue on the computer screen, followed by the presentation of the first tone burst. After a 1000-ms delay, the second tone burst was presented. Following offset of this second tone burst, the subject had 2000 ms to report which tone burst had the higher frequency. Subjects only received feedback (in the form of a yellow circle on the computer screen) when a response was not made within the allotted response window.</p>
<p>In each trial, one tone burst was one of the standard frequencies, whereas the other “comparison” tone burst had a different frequency. We used a 2-up-1-down adaptive staircase procedure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Levitt1">[19]</xref> to adjust the frequency of the comparison tone across trials. On a trial-by-trial basis, the order of the standard and comparison tone bursts was randomized, as well as the choice of the standard tone burst. Each subject participated in 2–4 experimental sessions. Each session consisted of two blocks of trials; each block contained 30 or 40 trials per standard tone frequency (320 or 480 total trials).</p>
<p>The data for each subject were collapsed across sessions and only trials in which a response was made within the allotted response window were included in subsequent analyses. We computed a psychometric function representing the probability that the subject reported the comparison tone (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) as higher than the standard tone (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Since the values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> varied across subject and session, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values were binned into five equidistant bins (in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> units) for each <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and subject. Each subject's psychometric functions (i.e., one function for each standard tone frequency) were fit with a cumulative Gaussian with free parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> using a maximum-likelihood fitting procedure to the raw data.</p>
<p>We assumed that a subject's discrimination process was the result of a comparison between the frequencies of the standard and comparison tone bursts. We also assumed that the subject's sensory measurements of the comparison and standard tone bursts followed Gaussian distributions, each with the same standard deviation, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, that we defined as the frequency-discrimination threshold of that standard tone frequency <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Green1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Macmillan1">[22]</xref>. Consequently, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was calculated directly from the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> derived from the cumulative Gaussian fit: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We then computed each subject's frequency-discrimination threshold as the average of the values measured at each of the eight standard tone frequencies (in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> units). We used this average value for the predictions of our Bayesian model (see <bold>Bayesian model</bold>).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2d">
<title>Categorization task and analysis</title>
<p>Each subject then participated in a two-alternative, forced-choice categorization task. The subject reported whether the frequency of a tone burst was a member of one of two different frequency categories (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>).</p>
<p>The frequency range between 550–5550 Hz was divided into two equal (in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> units), but overlapping, piecewise-uniform category distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003715-g001">Figure 1a</xref>). Category <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> contained frequency values between 500 to 2488 Hz. Category <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> contained frequency values between 1115 to 5550 Hz. These two categories were designed so that category <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> comprised the <italic>lower</italic> two-thirds of the frequency range, whereas category <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> comprised the <italic>upper</italic> two-thirds of the frequency range (again in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> units). As a consequence of this design, one part of each category's distribution was exclusive to that category (i.e., the extreme thirds of the entire frequency range), whereas the other part was shared with the other category (i.e., the middle third of the range).</p>

<title>Schematic diagram of the categorical priors employed in the categorization task.</title>
<p>(a) The category distributions over tone-burst frequency are piecewise uniform, such that all frequencies for a particular category are equally likely. (b) Three category prior probabilities were employed in separate blocks of trials by varying the proportion of trials that presented a tone belonging to each category. Here, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represents the category prior probability, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
</caption><graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.g001" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>Our critical experimental manipulation was to vary the category prior probabilities, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was either category <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or category <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We varied the prior probabilities, on a block-by-block basis, by appropriately selecting the proportion of trials originating from a particular category. We tested the influence of three different category prior probabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003715-g001">Figure 1b</xref>). In two of the manipulations, it was more likely that the frequency of a tone burst originated from one category than the other. In the third manipulation, it was equally likely that the frequency of a tone burst originated from either category.</p>
<p>Before the first session, the category prior probabilities were explained to each subject. A trial began with a brief 1500-ms countdown, followed by a visual ‘GO’ cue indicating the imminent presentation of a tone burst. After tone-burst offset, the subject had 1000 ms to report a choice. Subjects received visual feedback on every trial: a green circle for correct responses, a red circle for incorrect responses, and a yellow circle for no response within the allotted 1000-ms response window. In separate blocks of trials, the prior probability for category <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was one of three values: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 0.25, 0.5, or 0.75. On a trial-by-trial basis, we randomly selected the category according to its prior probability. Once a category was selected, we randomly selected a frequency from that category. As noted above, because the category distributions were piecewise uniform, any stimulus within the category was equally likely: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for all frequencies <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> within the category distribution (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> outside of the distribution. The value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, is defined by the width of the category distributions.</p>
<p>Each subject participated in 3–5 sessions of the categorization task; each session included one block of each of the three category prior probabilities. In total, each subject completed between 600–1000 trials for each category prior probability.</p>
<p>For each subject, we computed the psychometric function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represents the subject's category choice) for each of the three category prior probabilities across all sessions. Tone frequencies were binned into nine equidistant bins that spanned the entire frequency range: three frequency bins in each of the two unambiguous frequency regions and three bins in the ambiguous frequency region. We fit each psychometric function with a cumulative Gaussian using a maximum-likelihood procedure and identified the frequency at which a subject was equally likely to choose <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>: that is, the point of subjective equality (PSE). We also fit cumulative Gaussians to each subject's categorization performance separately for each session to test for any potential learning effects throughout the course of the experiment.</p>

<title>Bayesian model</title>
<p>We developed a Bayesian model that tested three key aspects of each subject's categorization behavior. First, we tested whether subjects used the category-prior information for their categorical decisions. Second, we tested the degree to which subjects were able to learn category distributions. Finally, we tested the degree to which subjects employed an optimal decision strategy given the characteristics of the categorization experiment.</p>
<p>Categorization can be considered an inference process over the generative graphical model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003715-g002">Figure 2a</xref>. The true category <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of a stimulus is governed probabilistically according to the prior probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003715-g002">Figure 2b</xref>, top panel). The category distribution, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, indicates the probability that a stimulus from a category <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> has a certain tone frequency <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We assumed that each tone with frequency <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> generated a sensory signal <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> according to the probability density <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which characterized the sensory uncertainty and noise in the auditory pathway.

The auditory sensory signal <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e063" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represents a noisy measurement of the true tone frequency <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The black arrows define the generative conditional probability densities <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e065" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e066" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, respectively. The task of the observer is to infer the category membership of the tone's frequency from this noisy sensory measurement <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (red line from bottom to top level).

<p>We assumed that subjects performed Bayesian inference over this generative model when solving the categorization task: given the sensory evidence <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, subjects computed the posterior probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In this equation, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the likelihood that the measured frequency belonged to a particular category <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The likelihood <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was calculated by marginalizing over the tone frequency as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We assumed that subjects either (1) learned the experiment's stimulus distributions (“objective priors”; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003715-g002">Figure 2b</xref>, middle-left) or (2) only learned an approximation of these distributions (“subjective priors”). For the latter case, we parameterized <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> using two piecewise-uniform distributions, each convolved with a Gaussian (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003715-g002">Figure 2b</xref>, middle-right). The subjective category distributions can be thought of as noisy estimates of the objective distributions. Each subjective distribution had its own mean (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) but had the same distribution width (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and the same Gaussian standard deviation (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Finally, similar to the category distributions, the values of the category prior probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> were assumed either to be (1) the experimental prior probabilities (objective priors) or (2) the free parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, representing each category prior probability (subjective priors).</p>
<p>Based upon the posterior <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we tested whether subjects employed an optimal decision strategy to make a category choice (either <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e089" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). This strategy is a <italic>maximum a posteriori</italic> (MAP) strategy, in which subjects chose the most probable category given <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e090" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In other words: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e091" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Thus, the subjects chose <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e092" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and chose <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e094" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> otherwise.</p>
<p>We also tested whether subjects' decisions reflected probability matching (MATCH) as a general index of sub-optimal categorization behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Gaissmaier1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Koehler1">[25]</xref>.

<p>Finally, to directly compare and fit the model's predictions to each subject's behavioral data, we computed the psychometric function as a function of the true frequency <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e097" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e098" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>

<p>Assuming objective priors, we used the Bayesian model to <italic>quantitatively predict</italic> each subject's categorization performance. We assumed the likelihood function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e099" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e100" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which was measured and fixed separately for each subject (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e101" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; see <bold>Discrimination task and analysis</bold>). Under these assumptions, the model has no free parameters. Therefore, we could <italic>predict</italic> each subject's psychometric function for each category prior probability and for both optimal (MAP) and sub-optimal (MATCH) categorization. We calculated the quality of the MAP and MATCH predictions by computing their respective log-likelihood values across all <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e102" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> conditions. We rescaled these log-likelihood values relative to the predictions of two reference models: (1) an empirical model, which represents how well the observed data explains itself (i.e., a binomial model that employs the empirical choice probabilities), and (2) a random-guessing model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Stocker1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>Assuming that subjects only learned noisy estimates of the categorical priors (i.e., subjective priors), we also computed maximum-likelihood fits of the model for both MAP and MATCH behavior to each subject's categorization performance. The sensory uncertainty <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e103" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was again <italic>fixed</italic> for each subject based on the results of the discrimination experiment.

<title>Human subjects can quickly learn category priors</title>
<p>Because the subjects were initially unaware of the categorical priors, subjects had to learn both the category distributions and the category prior probabilities to make informed category decisions. To test whether subjects learned this information, we first compared each subject's psychometric functions (i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) across the three different values of the category prior probability<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We fit these psychometric functions with a cumulative Gaussian and extracted the point of subjective equality (PSE) for each curve. The psychometric functions and Gaussian fits for an example subject (S3) are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003715-g004">Figure 4a</xref>. Two main points can be taken from this figure. First, as the tone frequency increased, the probability that the subject chose <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> decreased. Second, as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> increased, the psychometric functions shifted toward higher tone frequencies. However, the slopes of the psychometric functions remained consistent across category prior probability. These effects were comparable across individual subjects, with all but subject S2 exhibiting clear effects of the different category prior probabilities.

<title>Bayesian-model predictions</title>
<p>Our Bayesian model makes distinct predictions for subjects' psychometric performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003715-g006">Figure 6</xref>). In the lowest and highest thirds of the frequency range, choice behavior is independent of category prior probability and identical for MATCH and MAP. This independence occurs because these frequency ranges are exclusive to categories <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e129" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e130" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, respectively.

Under the objective-priors assumption, probability matching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003715-g006">Figure 6a</xref>, left) yields psychometric functions that exhibit a characteristic plateau.

<p>Under the subjective-priors assumption, the predicted characteristics of the psychometric functions change distinctly for MAP and MATCH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003715-g006">Figure 6b</xref>).

<title>Data versus model predictions for objective priors</title>
<p>We compared the predictions of the Bayesian observer with each subject's behavior assuming the objective priors (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2"><bold>METHODS</bold></xref>). In general, the model predictions for both types of decision behavior did not accurately reflect subjects' behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003715-g007">Figure 7</xref>). MATCH behavior predicted step-like psychometric functions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003715-g006">Figure 6</xref>) that were reflected only in some subjects' performance (e.g. S4). The predictions of the model with the MAP decision strategy were even less accurate: this decision strategy predicted slopes of the psychometric functions that were substantially and consistently steeper than those observed in each subject.</p>

<title>Analysis of categorization behavior with subjective priors and all free parameters</title>
<p>The previous model analyses revealed that probability matching (MATCH) is much better than the optimal (MAP) strategy in both <italic>predicting</italic> each subject's categorization behavior as well as explaining behavior after <italic>fitting</italic> the model with subjective priors. However, this comparison assumes that we have accurately measured each subject's sensory uncertainty. It is possible that, with additional sources of sensory uncertainty (e.g., memory noise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Knig1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Harris1">[32]</xref>), the MAP strategy could be equally as descriptive as MATCH behavior. Indeed, under certain noise conditions, MAP and MATCH behaviors are equivalent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Ashby2">[33]</xref>. To address this possibility, we performed an additional analysis in which all of the parameters were fit, including <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e159" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (for a total of eight free parameters).</p>
<p>When we included <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e160" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as a free parameter, both strategies accurately reflected individual subject's categorization behavior (fits not shown). However, we found that, without exception, MATCH behavior was still a better explanation of each subject's performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003715-g013">Figure 13a</xref>). Moreover, in order for the MAP strategy to achieve this improvement in explanatory power, the sensory noise <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e161" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> had to be <italic>10–100</italic> times larger than the measured values for each subject.

<title>Effects of noise on the categorical priors</title>
<p>Up to now, the model formulations assumed that subjects' estimates of the categorical priors were constant. However, this may not be true. Thus, we were interested in determining how trial-by-trial noise on the categorical priors may affect categorization performance. In particular, we wanted to test whether this additional noise could cause performance under an optimal decision strategy (MAP) to appear sub-optimal (MATCH).</p>
<p>We conducted a series of simulations in which we added noise to both the means of the category distributions and the prior probabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003715-g014">Figure 14a</xref>). Increasing category-distribution noise (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e164" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) led to decreases in the slope of the psychometric function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003715-g014">Figure 14b</xref>). Note, even though the net effect of this noise is similar to having constant Gaussian-shaped distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003715-g014">Figure 14b</xref>, inset), the predicted categorization performance is different from the MAP predictions with constant Gaussian-shaped distributions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003715-g006">Figure 6</xref>). In the latter case, there is no effect on the slopes of the psychometric function.</p>

<p>Increasing prior-probability noise (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e173" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) exhibited qualitatively different effects on performance as a function of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e174" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003715-g014">Figure 14c</xref>). First, under asymmetric prior-probability conditions (i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e175" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 0.25 or 0.75), sufficiently small levels of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e176" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (e.g., below ∼0.08) did not substantially influence the psychometric function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003715-g014">Figure 14c</xref>, left and right panels). However, larger levels of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e177" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> caused the function to exhibit plateaus. Moreover, depending on the level of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e178" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we could observe over-, under-, or true probability matching; compare the bright and dark red traces in the left and right panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003715-g014">Figure 14c</xref>. Interestingly, when the prior probabilities were symmetric (i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e179" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 0.5), <italic>any</italic> level of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e180" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> led to psychometric functions with a characteristic plateau.</p>
<p>One potential interpretation of this noise is that subjects' categorical priors are non-stationary. Specifically, we hypothesized that subjects estimated the categorical priors only over recent trial history. To investigate this hypothesis, we computed running estimates of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e181" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> over different bin lengths of consecutive trials and compared the variability in these estimates with the levels of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e182" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that yielded step-like psychometric functions. We found that the variability in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e183" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> over relatively short bin lengths (i.e., generally &lt;16 trials) was generally consistent with these <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003715.e184" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003715-g015">Figure 15</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We found that subjects learned the categorization task to varying degrees. All but one subject could use the category-prior information to solve the task. Subjects learned general characteristics of the category distributions (i.e., high versus low frequencies) and the category prior probabilities as early as the first session. This is consistent with previous work showing that the largest effects of category learning occur early in training and then are fine-tuned with further experience <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Kruschke1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Edgell1">[35]</xref>. Our finding that subjects learned the category prior probabilities is consistent with previous visual categorization tasks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Lee3">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Bohil1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Hansen1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Estes1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Hansen3">[38]</xref>. However, the systematic evaluation of prior probabilities and category learning in this study is novel for audition.</p>
<p>One goal of this study was to test whether subjects employed an optimal decision strategy to perform auditory categorization under categorical ambiguity. In order to do this, we developed a single generative Bayesian model that allowed us to both predict and fit each subject's psychometric curve for all tested conditions under instances of either optimal or sub-optimal categorization behavior. A critical component of this approach was that we separately estimated each subject's perceptual noise by measuring frequency-discrimination thresholds.</p>
<p>One finding of our model predictions was that subjects' performances were not accurately predicted assuming the objective priors (i.e., box-shaped distributions). This suggests that subjects were limited in their ability to learn the objective priors. Indeed, our model fits were consistent with the hypothesis that subjects learned smooth approximations of the box-shaped distributions. This finding may not be surprising: previous work has demonstrated that subjects often assume approximate versions of experimental distributions when learning new behavioral tasks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Maddox1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Berniker1">[42]</xref>. It is possible that the large degree of uniform overlap between the categories contributed to subjects' difficulties in estimating the category distributions. However, other evidence suggests that subjects can, to an extent, learn category distributions that are non-Gaussian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Acerbi1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Neumann1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Jazayeri1">[44]</xref>. Therefore, with extensive training, subjects might have been able to learn the objective priors.</p>
<p>Another important finding was that subjects' performances were more consistent with probability matching. This was the case after both predicting and fitting performance with our Bayesian model. Because this type of behavior reflects sub-optimal categorization, we conducted further analyses to investigate whether subjects actually implemented an optimal decision strategy but performed sub-optimally due to additional uncertainties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Ashby2">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Maddox2">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Green2">[46]</xref>.</p>
<p>Additional memory noise was unlikely to account for this possibility for two reasons. First, when sensory noise was a free parameter and could account for additional memory noise, probability matching still outperformed the optimal decision strategy. Second, the fitted values of the sensory noise for the optimal strategy were 10–100 times larger than our measured estimates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003715-g013">Figure 13</xref>). This difference between the measured and fitted values seems unreasonable given previous work on the effects of memory noise on frequency discrimination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Knig1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Harris1">[32]</xref>.</p>
<p>We also simulated the effects of additional noise on the category distributions and prior probabilities. The results of the simulations suggested that a combination of category-distribution and prior-probability noise could lead to psychometric functions that mimic probability-matching behavior (i.e., shallow psychometric functions with a plateau), even though the decision strategy was optimal (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003715-g014">Figure 14</xref>).</p>
<p>Categorical-prior noise could reflect true uncertainty or subjects' tendencies to search for patterns in sequences of random events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Gaissmaier1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Koehler1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Ayton1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Wolford1">[48]</xref>. One interpretation is that our subjects assumed that the categorical priors changed over time (i.e., they were non-stationary). Under this assumption, our analyses suggested that subjects' estimates of the categorical priors were reflections of the short-term stimulus history (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003715-g015">Figure 15</xref>). Future work is necessary to determine more quantitatively whether subjects whose performance is most sensitive to the local trial history are more likely to exhibit psychometric functions that mimic probability-matching behavior and how this effect changes after extensive training.</p>
<p>Together, our results suggest that the prevalence of probability matching in perceptual tasks might reflect model assumptions of stationarity that are not correct <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Healy1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Thomas1">[49]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Summerfield1">[52]</xref>. In other words, the interpretation of subjects' categorical behavior should not focus on sub-optimal versus optimal decision strategies but, rather, should focus on the degree to which subjects assume the environment is stationary and which factors can impact these assumptions. For example, changes in cost-reward structures may not change subjects' decision strategy, but may influence their view of environmental stationarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Healy1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Bohil1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Healy2">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003715-Wozny1">[50]</xref>.</p>
