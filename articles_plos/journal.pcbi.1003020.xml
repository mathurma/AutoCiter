<abstract>
<p>The dynamics of the PP<sub>i</sub> release during the transcription elongation of bacterial RNA polymerase and its effects on the Trigger Loop (TL) opening motion are still elusive. Here, we built a Markov State Model (MSM) from extensive all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the mechanism of the PP<sub>i</sub> release. Our MSM has identified a simple two-state mechanism for the PP<sub>i</sub> release instead of a more complex four-state mechanism observed in RNA polymerase II (Pol II). We observed that the PP<sub>i</sub> release in bacterial RNA polymerase occurs at sub-microsecond timescale, which is ∼3-fold faster than that in Pol II. After escaping from the active site, the (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> group passes through a single elongated metastable region where several positively charged residues on the secondary channel provide favorable interactions. Surprisingly, we found that the PP<sub>i</sub> release is not coupled with the TL unfolding but correlates tightly with the side-chain rotation of the TL residue R1239. Our work sheds light on the dynamics underlying the transcription elongation of the bacterial RNA polymerase.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Pyrophosphate ion (PP<sub>i</sub>) release is a critical step in the nucleotide addition cycle of transcription elongation. Despite extensive experimental studies, the kinetic mechanism of the PP<sub>i</sub> release in bacterial RNA polymerases (RNAP) still remains largely a mystery. As a cellular machine, RNAP contains more than 3000 residues, and thus it is challenging for all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to directly capture the process of the PP<sub>i</sub> release. In this study, we have simulated the dynamics of the PP<sub>i</sub> release at microsecond timescale using the Markov State Models (MSMs) built from extensive MD simulations in explicit solvent. MSM is a powerful kinetic network model and can predict long timescale dynamics from many short MD simulations. Our results suggest a simple two-state model for the PP<sub>i</sub> release in RNAP, which sharply contrasts with the more complex four-state hopping model in the yeast RNA polymerase (Pol II). We also observe a 3-fold faster dynamics for the PP<sub>i</sub> release in RNAP compared to Pol II, consistent with the faster transcription rate in the bacterial systems. Our results greatly improve our understanding of the PP<sub>i</sub> release, and also provide predictions to guide future experimental tests.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The DNA-dependent RNA polymerase is the main enzyme that participates in the transcription process transferring the genetic information from DNA to messenger RNA (mRNA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Fuda1">[1]</xref>.

<p>In each nucleotide addition cycle (NAC) of the multi-subunit RNA polymerase, the post-translocation state first allows the substrate NTP to bind to the active site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Vassylyev1">[6]</xref>. Then, a critical domain, named trigger loop (TL), can fold then expel the solvent from the active site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Palangat1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Huang1">[17]</xref>, and finally form direct contacts with the substrate NTP. Substitution of a conserved TL histidine can significantly decrease the polymerization rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Kaplan1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Kaplan3">[21]</xref>. Recent mutagenesis studies have shed light on the roles of the TL on the nucleotidyl transfer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Zhang1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Kaplan3">[21]</xref>, and the reverse intrinsic hydrolysis process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Yuzenkova1">[22]</xref>. Previous MD simulation studies also provided information on TL dynamics and its potential regulatory roles during the translocation process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Kireeva1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Feig1">[24]</xref>. After the catalytic reaction, PP<sub>i</sub> forms and releases from the active site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Da1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Carvalho1">[26]</xref>; then the TL opens and allows the template DNA to translocate so that a new NAC can start. Extensive biochemical and theoretical studies have been performed to understand the specific steps in the NAC, such as motions of the TL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Huang1">[17]</xref>, catalysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Carvalho1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Seibold1">[30]</xref>, translocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Kireeva1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Feig1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Hein1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Malinen1">[33]</xref> and NTP binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Batada1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Gong1">[35]</xref>.</p>
<p>PP<sub>i</sub> release in single subunit T7 RNA polymerase is proposed to be tightly coupled with the translocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Yin1">[36]</xref> but the same coupling is not observed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>) RNA polymerase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Abbondanzieri1">[37]</xref>. Interestingly, recent fluorescence and biochemical studies found that the PP<sub>i</sub> release in the <italic>E. coli</italic> RNA polymerase occurs shortly before or concurrently with the translocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Malinen1">[33]</xref>. Nonetheless, the interplay between the PP<sub>i</sub> release step and the TL opening motions at molecular level is still elusive. Previously, we used MD simulations to study the PP<sub>i</sub> release in the eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (Pol II) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Da1">[25]</xref>. We proposed a hopping model for Pol II in which PP<sub>i</sub> release was coupled with the TL tip motion through the interactions between the TL residue H1085 and the (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> group, and subsequently hopping among several positive charged residues in the secondary channel. Our model further suggested that the PP<sub>i</sub> release is a fast dynamic process so that it may not be able to induce the fully TL opening motion.</p>
<p>A comparison of the secondary channel and TL structure between Pol II and bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) from <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> (<italic>Tth</italic>) displays substantial differences (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Wang1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Vassylyev2">[7]</xref>. In Pol II, the TL contains a long loop domain (from the Rpb1 residue T1080 to T1095) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Wang1">[3]</xref>. However, the TL in RNAP consists of two alpha helices connected by a short turn in the closed state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Vassylyev1">[6]</xref>. This structural difference suggests that the dynamics of the TL folding in these two systems are likely to be different. Moreover, in addition to the conserved <italic>Tth</italic> TL residue H1242, the <italic>Tth</italic> TL residue R1239 also interacts with the substrate NTP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Vassylyev1">[6]</xref>; this residue is absent in Pol II and mutation of the counterpart residue in <italic>E. coli</italic> (R933A) can reduce the nucleotide addition rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Zhang1">[20]</xref>. Moreover, the secondary channel in <italic>Tth</italic> RNAP is much shorter than that in Pol II (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g001">Figure 1</xref>), and exhibits a different layout of the positively charged residues. Specifically, in Pol II, the four residues, K619, K620, K518 and K880 are located at relatively separated sites (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). However, the positively charged residues in <italic>Tth</italic> RNAP: K908, K912, K780 and K1369 are close to each other in a continuous region (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Given these structural differences, it is of interest to compare the dynamics of PP<sub>i</sub> release in RNAP with that in Pol II.</p>

<p>Although conventional all-atom MD simulations can provide the dynamic information for biological macromolecules at atomic resolution, it is still challenging to capture the biologically relevant timescales in microseconds or even longer. Markov State Models (MSMs) constructed from a large number of short simulations provide one way to overcome this timescale gap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Bowman1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-No1">[39]</xref>. MSMs have been successfully applied to model the long timescale dynamics that cannot be directly accessed by conventional MD simulations in studying the conformational changes of biological macromolecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-No1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Chodera1">[41]</xref>, including our previous study of PP<sub>i</sub> release in Pol II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Da1">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study, in order to reveal the mechanism of the PP<sub>i</sub> release in RNAP, we constructed a MSM from extensive all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in explicit solvent with a system size of nearly 300,000 atoms and aggregated simulation time of ∼1 µs. Our results reveal that the PP<sub>i</sub> release in <italic>Tth</italic> RNAP adopts a simple two-state model with a fast dynamics over a few hundred nanoseconds. Surprisingly, we found that the PP<sub>i</sub> release is not coupled with the secondary structure unfolding of TL but only with the side-chain rotation of the TL residue R1239.</p>

<title>PP<sub>i</sub> release in bacterial RNAP follows a simple two-state model</title>
<p>To study the release mechanism of the (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> group in RNAP, we modeled the PP<sub>i</sub>-bound RNAP complex by directly cleaving the P<sub>α</sub>-O bond in the ATP-bound RNAP complex that is derived from the <italic>Tth</italic> RNAP crystal structure (See SI <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003020.s001">Figure S1</xref> for the two structures and the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section for the modeling details) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Vassylyev1">[6]</xref>. This modeled PP<sub>i</sub>-RNAP complex was used as the starting structure for the steered MD (SMD) simulations to obtain the initial release pathways. To eliminate the bias in SMD simulations, we have then performed 100 10-ns MD simulations, and these simulations have widely sampled the region in the secondary channel (See SI <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003020.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Finally, we have constructed a MSM from these simulations to obtain the dynamics and other thermodynamic properties of the PP<sub>i</sub> release (See the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section for details).</p>
<p>Our MSM shows that the PP<sub>i</sub> release in <italic>Tth</italic> RNAP adopts a simple two-state model. In addition to the initial state with the PP<sub>i</sub> in the active site (S1 state in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), only one additional metastable state is identified (S2 state in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), and this state is ∼7-fold more populated than the S1 state (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The S2 state locates in an elongated region where several positively charged residues can stabilize the (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> group. These results contrast with our previous findings that the (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> group in Pol II hops through four clearly separated metastable states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Da1">[25]</xref>.</p>

<p>(A) Two metastable states (S1 and S2) are identified. 500 randomly selected conformations from each metastable state are superimposed and represented with cyan and green spheres for S1 and S2 respectively. Each sphere indicates the coordinate of the center of mass of the PP<sub>i</sub> group. (B) The two metastable states are displayed as two circles, and the size of these circles is proportional to the equilibrium populations of the S1 (12.6%±0.02%) and S2 (87.4%±0.02%) state, (C) Key interactions between (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> group and RNAP in each state are displayed. (D) Conservation analysis of the positively charged residues that interact with the (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> group among different species. The sequence alignment was performed using the online software ClustalW2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/</ext-link>).</p>

<p>When the (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> group is in the active site (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), three positively charged β′ residues R1029, H1242 and R1239 can interact with the negatively charged (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> group. The residue R1029 locates at the exit of the active site, and thus it may play similar roles on the PP<sub>i</sub> release with its corresponding residue K752 in Pol II (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Da1">[25]</xref>. Interestingly, the location of the conserved TL residue H1242 is different from its counterpart residue H1085 in Pol II, though both of them are in direct contact with the (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> group. Both before and after chemistry, H1242 interacts with the P<sub>α</sub>-O atom of the NTP in RNAP, whereas H1085 is in contact with P<sub>β</sub>-O atom in Pol II (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g003">Figure 3</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Wang1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Vassylyev1">[6]</xref>. To achieve this, the H1242 in RNAP has to locate deeper in the active site compared to H1085. Finally, R1239 in RNAP locates at the same position as H1085 in Pol II, suggesting that these two residues may play similar roles in the PP<sub>i</sub> release.</p>

<p>After escaping from the active site, the (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> group reaches the S2 state with an elongated shape. In this state, multiple positively charged residues on the secondary channel (K780, K908, K912 and K1362) can provide favorable electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> group (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, the (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> group in Pol II is found to transfer through several hopping sites where groups of positively charged residues are spatially well separated (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Da1">[25]</xref>. From the S2 state, the (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> group will directly enter the solvent. In order to elucidate the specific roles of the three important residues: R1029, H1242 and R1239 in the PP<sub>i</sub> release (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), we performed additional mutant simulations starting from several different conformations from the S1 and S2 states.</p>

<p>The mutant simulation results indicate that both residues R1239 and R1029 can facilitate the escape of the (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> group from the active site to S1 state (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Here, we use the distance between the (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> group and the P<sub>α</sub> atom of the 3′-terminal nucleotide of the RNA chain (<italic>d</italic><sub>αβ</sub>) to describe the extent of the PP<sub>i</sub> release from the active site. In the WT simulations (See P1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), the (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> group can move towards the exit of active site with the <italic>d</italic><sub>αβ</sub> value increasing from 6 Å to around 8 Å (See the left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). However, the R1239A and R1029A mutants lead to a weaker tendency for the (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> group to escape the active site (the <italic>d</italic><sub>αβ</sub> value fluctuates around 5.5 Å, middle and right panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). On the other hand, the R1029K mutant is shown to have a similar effect to help the (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> group to leave the active site as in WT(see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003020.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). These results indicate that positively charged residues play a crucial role to facilitate the PP<sub>i</sub> to release from the active site.</p>
<p>Notably, the H1242A mutant can dramatically promote the PP<sub>i</sub> release from P1 site (See SI <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003020.s004">Figure S4C</xref>), suggesting that H1242 may prevent the PP<sub>i</sub> release from the active site. In contrast, the TL residue H1085 in Pol II was previously found to facilitate the PP<sub>i</sub> release from the active site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Da1">[25]</xref>. This difference may be due to the different locations of these two residues in the active site. Compared with H1085 in Pol II, H1242 in RNAP locates significantly deeper inside of the active site (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Therefore, it will be more difficult for H1242 to rotate and help the (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> group to leave the active site. Instead, H1242 can provide an attractive interaction to prevent the PP<sub>i</sub> release.</p>
<p>Next, we evaluated the roles of residues R1239 and R1029 in PP<sub>i</sub> release when the (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> group is at the S2 state (P2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). In the WT system, the (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> group fluctuates around its initial location within our simulations at a few nanoseconds, which was also observed in the R1029K mutant simulations initiated from P2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Intriguingly, R1029A and R1239A substitutions lead to dramatic, but opposite, effects. The R1029A substitution facilitates the PP<sub>i</sub> release toward the solvent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, right panel). Combined with the previous observations, we conclude that the R1029 may facilitate the PP<sub>i</sub> release from the active site but prevents the PP<sub>i</sub> release when it arrives at the S2 state. Thus R1029 plays a similar role as the corresponding residue K752 in Pol II (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Da1">[25]</xref>. In contrast, the R1239A substitution drives the (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> group back to the S1 state, suggesting that R1239 is critical for the (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> group to escape the active site (middle panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). This indicates that R1239, rather than H1242 residue, plays the role in PP<sub>i</sub> release most equivalent to that played by H1085 in Pol II. Compared with its counterpart residue H1085 in Pol II, the R1029 has a longer and more flexible side chain. In addition, it can form a stronger salt bridge with the (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> group. Therefore, the side-chain rotation of R1239 alone may be sufficient to facilitate the PP<sub>i</sub> release.</p>

<title>PP<sub>i</sub> release does not induce the TL backbone unfolding, but is tightly coupled with the side-chain rotation of the TL residue R1239</title>
<p>In order to reveal if the PP<sub>i</sub> release is coupled with the TL unfolding in RNAP, we have monitored the structural changes of the TL during the PP<sub>i</sub> release. We calculated the RMSD values of the heavy atoms (non-hydrogen) for both the complete TL domain (β′ residue Q1235 to G1255) and its tip part (residues R1239 to A1249). RMSD values for the complete TL mostly fluctuate between 1 and 3 Å (See SI <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003020.s005">Figure S5A</xref>), indicating that TL does not unfold during the PP<sub>i</sub> release. On the other hand, for the tip part of the TL, the RMSD values mostly fluctuate between 1 and 2.5 Å when the (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> group is in the S1 state (See SI <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003020.s005">Figure S5B</xref>). But RMSD values increase to between 2 and 4.5 Å when the (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> group reaches the S2 state, indicating that the tip region of the TL becomes more flexible after the (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> group leaves the active site. The Mean First Passage Time (MFPT, the average transition time from S1 state to S2 state) for the PP<sub>i</sub> release is around 0.5 µs (See SI <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003020.s008">Table S1</xref> and the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section for MFPT calculation details), which is three-fold faster than that in Pol II (∼1.5 µs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Da1">[25]</xref>. These results further support the idea that PP<sub>i</sub> release occurs too fast to lead directly to unfolding of the TL helices.</p>
<p>More interestingly, we found a direct correlation between the PP<sub>i</sub> release and the side chain rotation of the TL residue R1239. The PMF profile in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g005">Figure 5A</xref> clearly shows that the transition of the (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> group from the S1 to S2 state correlates with the rotational motion of the residue R1239, with its distance to the Mg<sup>2+</sup>A ion increasing from 10 to 14 Å (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g005">Figure 5B and C</xref>). These results are consistent with our previous observation that R1239 can facilitate the PP<sub>i</sub> release. When the (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> group arrives at the S2 state (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g005">Figure 5D</xref>), its interaction with the residue R1239 is lost, and this increase the fluctuations of the residue R1239 (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).</p>

<p>We did not observe the backbone unfolding of the TL during the PP<sub>i</sub> release in our model. However, since the timescale for the PP<sub>i</sub> release is an order of magnitude longer than our individual seeding MD simulations, there exists a possibility that the seeding MD simulations may be biased by initial conformations obtained from steered MD, where the TL is always folded. We thus performed control simulations of both isolated TL domain and a truncated model in which all the motifs surrounding the TL domains were included to further investigate its folding. For an isolated TL domain (from A1225 to A1265) in free solution, it can quickly unfold at ∼210-ns (See SI <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003020.s006">Figure S6A–C</xref>). However, the inclusion of the RNAP motifs surrounding the TL domain can shield not only TL helix facing the active site but also part of the other TL helix facing the secondary channel from the solvent. This may greatly stabilize the secondary structure of the TL domain and prevent it from unfolding. Indeed, no unfolding events were observed in two independent 300-ns MD simulations, and the secondary structure of the TL domain was well preserved (See SI <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003020.s007">Figure S7A–C</xref>). These control simulations suggest that the TL domain must be exposed to the solvent before its secondary structures can be unfolded. We speculate that the side chain rotation of the TL residue R1239 may initiate and allow the overall motion of the TL domain, and this will in turn make the TL more exposed to the solvent and eventually unfold. Interestingly, one recent crystal structure of the RNAP captures an open state of the TL, and in this structure the completely solvent-exposed segment (TL residues from 1246 to 1254) is unfolded but, the segment that is not fully exposed to the solvent remains folded (TL residues from 1235 to 1243) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Vassylyev2">[7]</xref>. Based on the control simulations, we conclude that the full opening motion of the TL likely occurs at a timescale longer than the timescale of PP<sub>i</sub> release.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Based on extensive unbiased MD simulations, we built a MSM for the PP<sub>i</sub> release in RNAP to elucidate its long timescale dynamics. The MSM identified a two-state model for the PP<sub>i</sub> release (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). The mutant simulations indicate that the β′ residues R1239 and R1029 can facilitate the escape of the (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> group from the active site after the catalytic reaction (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Then the (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> group transfers to the S2 state, where it forms favorable interactions with four positively charged residues on the secondary channel: K908, K912, K780 and K1369 (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). More strikingly, our work suggests that the PP<sub>i</sub> release does not induce the TL unfolding but tightly couples to the side-chain rotation of the TL residue R1239, which in turn makes the TL tip region more flexible. Furthermore, our control simulations show that TL is stable in Pol II, but can quickly unfold (within 200 ns) when exposed to the solvent. We thus speculate that the rotation of R1239 that accompanies the PP<sub>i</sub> release may allow solvent to re-enter the active site and promote the overall movements of the TL domain; This TL movements would further lead to its exposure to solvent and eventually allow TL unfolding. However, the timescales for this solvent-induced TL unfolding may be significantly longer than that of the PP<sub>i</sub> release so that we didn't observe it in our simulations.</p>

<p>We found that the TL in RNAP may be more difficult to unfold than that of Pol II, since its secondary structures barely unfold upon the PP<sub>i</sub> release. Therefore, if the open state of the TL is a pre-requisite step for the translocation as recently suggested by both experimental <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Malinen1">[33]</xref> and computational studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Feig1">[24]</xref>, it is intriguing that the transcription rate for bacterial RNAP is much faster than that of Pol II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Maiuri1">[27]</xref>. Despite that the more stable secondary structure of the TL in RNAP may slow down its opening motion, its reverse closing motion may be spontaneous and fast. This fast closing motion may further accelerate the nucleotide addition process to achieve an overall fast transcription rate.</p>
<p>Finally, our MSM indicates that the PP<sub>i</sub> release in bacterial RNAP is faster than that in Pol II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Da1">[25]</xref>. This faster dynamics is due to several factors: First, the secondary channel of RNAP is shorter than the that of Pol II due to the absence of the funnel region, therefore the (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> release path is shorter, which leads to a faster PP<sub>i</sub> release from the active site of RNAP. Next, in RNAP, the PP<sub>i</sub> only needs to overcome a single free energy barrier before it can be released to the solvent (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). In contrast, the PP<sub>i</sub> release in Pol II was found to go over multiple free energy barriers sequentially before it could be released (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Furthermore, in our model for RNAP, the S2 state (in the pore) has a population over seven times larger than that of the S1 state (in the active site). Thermodynamically, this difference will favor release of PP<sub>i</sub> from the active site. However, in Pol II, the equilibrium population of the S2 state (the first state in the pore) is comparable to that of the S1 state (in the active site) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Da1">[25]</xref>. This difference may be due to the fact that the S2 state in bacterial RNAP is greatly stabilized by four positively charged residues that are spatially close to each other (K908, K912, K780 and K1369), but in Pol II, these positively charged residues locate at relatively separate sites (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Finally, R1239 in RNAP can substantially facilitate the (Mg-PP<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2−</sup> release from the active site all the way to the solvent due to its longer and more flexible side chain (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003020-g005">Figure 5</xref>). However, its counterpart residue for PP<sub>i</sub> release from Pol II, H1085, only promotes the PP<sub>i</sub> escape from the active site to the first metastable state, S1, rather than all the way to solvent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Da1">[25]</xref>.</p>

Two sets of pulling simulations were along the wall of the secondary channel: one was pulled towards the center of the C<sub>α</sub> atoms of group I residues, and the other was directed to the center of C<sub>α</sub>atoms of both group I and group II residues. The third set of pulling simulations pointed to the center of the C<sub>α</sub>atoms of group II and group III residues, and toward the solvent. The external force was only applied on the center of mass of the PP<sub>i</sub> group with a force constant of 0.5 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup> Å<sup>−2</sup> and pulling rate of 0.01 Å/ps.

<p>We applied the Robust Perron Cluster Cluster Analysis (PCCA+) algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Deuflhard1">[56]</xref> to lump the 200 microstates obtained above into 2 macrostates. The number of macrostates was determined from the implied timescale plot of the 200 microstate. The plot levels off starting from the lag time of 4 ns and exhibits one clear gap, suggesting that two macrostates exist (See SI <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003020.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). Finally we chose a lag time of 4.5 ns to calculate the equilibrium populations and the Mean First Passage Time (MFPT).</p>
<p>We calculated the MFPTs to estimate the average transition rates between each macrostates pair. As described before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Da1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003020-Silva1">[54]</xref>, the MFPT can be determined using the following formula:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003020.e003"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003020.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula> where <italic>P<sub>ij</sub></italic> is the transition probability from state <italic>i</italic> to state <italic>j</italic>, <italic>t<sub>ij</sub></italic> is the lag time used to construct the transition probability matrix <italic><bold>T</bold><sub>ij</sub></italic>, <italic>t<sub>ij</sub></italic> is equal to 4.5 ns in our model, and MFPT<italic><sub>if</sub></italic> is the mean first passage time of the state <italic>j</italic> to final state <italic>f</italic>. For each transition, a set of linear equations can be solved under the boundary condition in which MFPT<sub><italic>ff</italic></sub> = 0. The uncertainties of the MFPT were obtained by bootstrapping the MD trajectories for 100 times.</p>

<title>5. Validating the Markov State Model</title>
<p>In order to check if the model is markovian, we have plotted the implied timescales (<italic>τ<sub>k</sub></italic>) as a function of the lag time <italic>τ</italic>:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003020.e004"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003020.e004" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>μ<sub>k</sub></italic> is the eigenvalue of the transition probability matrix <italic>T</italic> with the lag time <italic>τ</italic>. The implied timescales correspond to the average transition times between two groups of states, and thus indicate the dynamics of the system. If <italic>τ</italic> is sufficiently large, the model is markovian, and the predicted implied timescales will not change upon the further increase of the lag time. In our system, the implied timescale plots reach the plateau at the lag time of ∼4 ns (See SI <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003020.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). Therefore, we select the lag time of 4.5 ns to construct the final MSM.</p>
<p>To further validate the model, we predicted the probability for a given macrostate to stay within it after a certain lag-time based on our MSM, and this predicted values are in good agreement with those obtained from the original MD simulations (See SI <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003020.s003">Figure S3B</xref>).</p>

<title>6. Control simulations of the truncated systems</title>
<p>In order to investigate the stability of the TL in free solution, we have performed a 300 ns control simulation with the isolated TL domain (A1225 to A1265) in solution (with ∼6900 atoms, See SI <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003020.s006">Figure S6B</xref>). However, it is difficult to extend individual MD simulations of the complete transcription complex (nearly 300 K atoms) to hundreds of nanoseconds due to its high computing cost. Therefore, we have also performed simulations with a truncated RNAP complex containing all the motifs surrounding the TL domain (See SI <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003020.s007">Figure S7A</xref>), including β subunit residues 381–569, 831–1049, β′ residues 604–794, 901–1470, 10 upstream hybrid DNA-RNA base pairs, 6 downstream DNA base pairs and Mg<sup>2+</sup>A in the active site. The final solvated system only contains ∼118 K atoms, but it still takes more than 2 months to perform one 300-ns simulation using 24 CPU cores.</p>
<p>The explicit SPC water model was used for the MD simulations, 1 and 29 Na<sup>+</sup> ions were added to neutralize the isolated TL and truncated RNAP model respectively. The other setups for the MD simulations were the same as the seeding MD simulations. We have performed one 300-ns simulation for the isolated TL and the other two 300-ns simulation for the truncated RNAP. For the truncated RNAP model, several terminal residues that are truncated from the complete model were fixed in the simulations in order to avoid undesired unfolding.</p>
