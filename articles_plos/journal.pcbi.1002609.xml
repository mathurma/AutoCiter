        <p>Reproduction is inherently risky, in part because genomic replication can introduce new mutations that are usually deleterious toward fitness. This risk is especially severe for organisms whose genomes replicate “semi-conservatively,” e.g. viruses and bacteria, where no master copy of the genome is preserved. Lethal mutagenesis refers to extinction of populations due to an unbearably high mutation rate (<italic>U</italic>), and is important both theoretically and clinically, where drugs can extinguish pathogens by increasing their mutation rate. Previous theoretical models of lethal mutagenesis assume infinite population size (<italic>N</italic>). However, in addition to high <italic>U</italic>, small <italic>N</italic> can accelerate extinction by strengthening genetic drift and relaxing selection. Here, we examine how the time until extinction depends jointly on <italic>N</italic> and <italic>U</italic>. We first analytically compute the mean time until extinction (<italic>τ</italic>) in a simplistic model where all mutations are either lethal or neutral. The solution motivates the definition of two distinct regimes: a survival phase and an extinction phase, which differ dramatically in both how <italic>τ</italic> scales with <italic>N</italic> and in the coefficient of variation in time until extinction. Next, we perform stochastic population-genetics simulations on a realistic fitness landscape that both (i) features an epistatic distribution of fitness effects that agrees with experimental data on viruses and (ii) is based on the biophysics of protein folding. More specifically, we assume that mutations inflict fitness penalties proportional to the extent that they unfold proteins. We find that decreasing <italic>N</italic> can cause phase transition-like behavior from survival to extinction, which motivates the concept of “lethal isolation.” Furthermore, we find that lethal mutagenesis and lethal isolation interact synergistically, which may have clinical implications for treating infections. Broadly, we conclude that stably folded proteins are only possible in ecological settings that support sufficiently large populations.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Most spontaneous mutations hurt organismal fitness, e.g. by destabilizing proteins. In many species, the normal mutation rate is strikingly high: on the order of one per genome per replication. In the face of these mutations, how can proteins maintain their native structure, and how can populations of organisms avoid extinction? Are there physics-based limits on how large the mutation rate of any species can be before the onslaught of mutations outpaces natural selection and melts-down proteins? Here, we address these questions with a computational model that combines protein folding thermodynamics with individual-based population genetics simulations. We calculate a theoretical “speed limit” equal to a few mutations per genome per replication—near the mutation rate of RNA viruses. Additionally, we find that the speed limit can be much lower in small populations where “random genetic drift” is strong. Thus, we conclude that stably folded proteins are only possible in ecological settings that support sufficiently large populations. These findings may have clinical implications for treating viral infections with drugs that elevate the viral mutation rate.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>On average, mutations hurt organismal fitness, e.g. by destabilizing proteins. Thus, left unchecked, new mutations tend to erode fitness and endanger the long-term survival of any species. Fortunately, natural selection usually balances against mutational genetic decay by rewarding the fit and weeding out the unfit. However, when the genomic mutation rate (i.e. the expected number of mutations per genome duplication) exceeds a critical value (<italic>U<sub>crit</sub></italic>), mutation outpaces selection, causing population extinction in a process known as “lethal mutagenesis” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Loeb1">[1]</xref>. Lethal mutagenesis is important both theoretically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Wilke1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Martin1">[7]</xref> and clinically, where drugs (e.g. Ribavirin) can extinguish pathogens, especially RNA viruses, by elevating the mutation rate beyond <italic>U<sub>crit</sub></italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Loeb1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Domingo1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Cameron2">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Aside from mutation rate, population size (<italic>N</italic>) also plays an important role in extinction. All existing estimates of <italic>U<sub>crit</sub></italic> assume that <italic>N = ∞</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Wilke1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Wilke2">[4]</xref>, so that extinction can be modeled with relatively simple deterministic equations. In contrast, every real population has only finitely many members and is consequently subjected to “random genetic drift,” i.e. stochastic fluctuations in birth-death events. More precisely, every real population of size <italic>N</italic> is guaranteed to experience fluctuations of order <italic>∼1/N</italic> reminiscent of “shot noise,” since births and deaths occur as discrete events. Upon first thought, it may seem that genetic drift merely represents a small correction to the deterministic dynamics. However, the actual behavior is dramatically more interesting: Since drift continually obfuscates fitness differences among individuals, it weakens selection and implicitly tilts the mutation-selection balance in favor of mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Lynch1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Kimura1">[16]</xref>. By this mechanism, known as “Muller's ratchet,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Felsenstein1">[17]</xref> <italic>unbiased</italic> birth-death fluctuations end up downwardly <italic>biasing</italic> mean fitness within a population. Muller's ratchet has long been studied theoretically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Haigh1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Gordo1">[24]</xref> and routinely exploited experimentally to prepare low fitness lines of organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Halligan1">[25]</xref>. However, the extent to which high mutation rates exacerbate Muller's ratchet en route to extinction is neither qualitatively nor quantitatively well understood. We revisit this issue and review the literature on Muller's ratchet in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>.</p>
      <p>In principle, mutations can cause extinction by two distinct, though non mutually exclusive mechanisms. First, deleterious mutations might decrease the absolute birth rate of a population to such a great extent that individuals are killed by natural forces (e.g. old age, environmental stresses, etc) faster than they reproduce. Most previous studies, e.g. refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Wilke1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Lynch2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Lynch3">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Schultz1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Whitlock1">[23]</xref>, have analyzed this first scenario, which represents a struggle between a population and its environment. A second, qualitatively distinct scenario is possible for organisms that reproduce “semi-conservatively,” including all viruses and unicellular species (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> for elaboration): Every birth event risks ruining the “original” genome with new lethal mutations, thereby reducing the census size and risking extinction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Wilke2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Tannenbaum1">[26]</xref>. These dynamics represent the struggle of a population against itself. In this paper, we focus primarily on this second mode of extinction.</p>
      <p>A sticking point for all lethal mutagenesis models is the relationship between genotype and fitness, i.e. the fitness landscape (FL). The distribution of fitness effects (DFE) among new single mutations furnishes the first order description of the FL. The second order description specifies the form of epistasis, i.e. how pairs of mutations interact to impact fitness. With few exceptions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Zeldovich1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Chen1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Martin1">[7]</xref>, previous studies generally assume that the DFE conforms to a simple mathematical function and make drastic simplifying assumptions regarding epistasis. In particular, most previous studies assume either no epistasis, or that mutations interact either all synergistically or all antagonistically, leaving little room for phenomena such as compensatory mutations. The motivation behind those assumptions is in part due to the large number of (unknown) parameters necessary to even write down a reasonably complex, epistatic FL.</p>
      <p>Here, we circumvent that impasse by utilizing a previously developed approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Wylie1">[27]</xref> that is virtually parameter-free. We do not explicitly <italic>impose</italic> a DFE or a model of epistasis. Instead, those features emerge as the <italic>output</italic> from a biophysics-based protein folding requirement: We assume that mutations inflict fitness penalties proportional to the extent that they unfold proteins. Remarkably, this minimal assumption roughly accounts for the DFE observed in site-specific mutagenesis experiments on several viral species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Wylie1">[27]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here, we combine our biophysics-based FL with individual-based population-genetics simulations where extinction can only result from lethal mutations. We measured the time until extinction (<italic>τ)</italic> as a function of population size (<italic>N</italic>) and mutation rate (<italic>U</italic>). In accord with previous studies, we observe an ultimate mutation rate (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002609.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>≈2.5 mutations per genome) beyond which even infinitely large populations go extinct “almost immediately” (<italic>τ∼log(N)</italic> generations). However, when <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002609.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we find that <italic>τ</italic> depends dramatically on <italic>N</italic>: Small populations go extinct in <italic>τ∼log(N)</italic> generations, whereas large populations survive “almost indefinitely” (<italic>τ∼e<sup>N</sup>/N</italic>). The boundary between “large” and “small” populations depends on <italic>U</italic> and is reminiscent of a “phase transition” between survival and extinction. In addition to <italic>τ</italic>, the coefficient of variation (i.e. standard deviation divided by mean) also undergoes a transition from values near zero in the extinction phase to values near one in the survival phase. These results contradict the simplistic intuition that “small populations are more stochastic than large populations.”</p>
      <p>For comparison, we also analytically solve for <italic>τ</italic> in a very simple model in which all mutations are either lethal or neutral. Solutions to this model clarify the meaning of extinction in finite populations and motivate our definition of survival vs. extinction phases.</p>

          <title>Birth</title>
          <p>This paper concerns asexual populations of replicating entities, henceforth called “cells.” “Births” occur when a mother cell gives rise to exactly two daughters and the mother simultaneously dies. In continuous time, individual cells are chosen to give birth with probability proportional to their fitness (<italic>W</italic>), i.e. their birth rate.

          <title>Death</title>
          <p>Besides the death of mothers upon birth, death also occurs by three additional mechanisms. First, if a birth event “tries to” increase the number of cells (<italic>n(t))</italic> beyond a maximum number (<italic>N)</italic>, then a random cell is removed from the population (similar to Moran's model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Ewens1">[28]</xref>). Note that, strictly speaking, <italic>N</italic> is not the population's size but rather its capacity; density-dependent mortality kicks in abruptly when <italic>n = N</italic>. Secondly, as described below, some cells inherit new mutations, and if any of these mutations are lethal, then that daughter cell is killed immediately. Thirdly, cells can die (with rate <italic>δ</italic>) of “natural” causes, e.g. old age, washout, clearance, etc, independent of replication events or lethal mutations. Extinction in real populations is likely caused by a combination of these second and third mechanisms of death. For the bulk of this paper, we focus our attention on the second source, which represents an ultimate limit to population survival. A crucial feature of this limiting regime is that extinction cannot result from low fitness per se, which merely increases the generation time. Rather, lethal mutations are the only mechanism that can cause extinction in this regime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002609-g001">fig. 1</xref>).</p>

          <title>Mutation</title>
          <p>Each of the two daughter cells independently can acquire (nonsynonymous) mutations during their birth, i.e. replication is semi-conservative; see below for elaboration on this crucial assumption. In particular, if both daughters inherit lethal mutations, then the census size decreases by one. Note that if a master copy of the replicating genome was preserved (i.e. replication was conservative) and the natural death rate is zero, the population could not decrease in size and extinction would be impossible. We assume that the number of new nonsynonymous mutations per cell per birth event is Poisson distributed with mean <italic>U</italic>, i.e. <italic>U</italic> is the total genomic nonsynonymous mutation rate. In general, mutations can either be lethal or else merely perturb fitness (<italic>W</italic>), i.e. alter the doubling time. Our hypothesis that the onset of extinction is marked by excessive lethal mutations has experimental support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-GrandePerez1">[29]</xref> in viruses (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>).</p>

          <title>Biological interpretations</title>
          <p>Our use of the term “semi-conservative” is based on the mechanism of DNA replication during cellular binary fission: Each daughter cell inherits one of the parent's two DNA strands, which then acts as a template for (potentially erroneous) synthesis of the remaining strand. Semi-conservative replication applies to all unicellular species. Additionally, our semi-conservative model can be interpreted in terms of cells infected by viruses, even though real viruses often have single stranded genomes that, on a molecular level, are conserved during replication. In particular, viral reproduction is <italic>effectively</italic> semi-conservative if the following assumptions apply:</p>
          <list list-type="order">
            <list-item>
              <p>Infected cells lyse (i.e. the “mother” cell dies) when viruses emerge from them.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <p>The number of virus particles that emerge upon lysis is very large.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <p>Of the large number of released virus particles, only a small number (<italic>R<sub>o</sub></italic>) go on to infect other cells, independent of viral fitness. For simplicity, we assume that <italic>R<sub>o</sub> = 2</italic> throughout this paper.</p>
            </list-item>
          </list>
          <p>Assumptions 2 and 3 together insure that the same exact genome molecule that infects a cell does not initiate subsequent infections (i.e. that the process is essentially semi-conservative). Note that, when considering viruses, we keep track of the number of infected cells as opposed to free viruses, which cannot autonomously replicate. We assume that only a single genome infects a particular cell, i.e. low multiplicity of infection; without this assumption, a virus's fitness would depend not only on its own genotype, but also on that of co-infecting viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Elena1">[30]</xref>. Also note that our model does not explicitly consider infected versus uninfected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Perelson1">[31]</xref>; for a treatment of lethal mutagenesis with such a model, see ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Martin1">[7]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Flat, non-epistatic fitness landscape: survival phase versus extinction phase</title>
        <p>The goal of this paper is to calculate which values of the population capacity (<italic>N</italic>) and mutation rate (<italic>U</italic>) support survival and which lead to extinction. In a sense, the answer is trivial: extinction is certain if <italic>N&lt;∞</italic> and <italic>U&gt;0</italic> since the population only has a finite number of configurations and all of them, including extinction, will be visited <italic>eventually</italic>. Nevertheless, the question remains as to which values of <italic>N</italic> and <italic>U</italic> enable populations to live a “long time” versus a “short time.” However, it is not clear <italic>a priori</italic> even whether there exists a sharp, qualitative distinction between “long” and “short” or whether those concepts continuously blur together. Obviously, a crucial prerequisite for understanding extinction in finite populations is to define exactly what is meant by “long” and “short,” i.e. “survival” vs. “extinction.” To this end, we first consider a simple, analytically solvable fitness landscape whose solutions clarify these crucial preliminary issues. Later, we consider a more realistic FL based on protein biophysics.</p>
        <p>By “fitness landscape” (FL) we mean a mathematical function relating genotype to fitness. We first consider a very simple FL in which the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) among new mutations is always the same, independent of genotype and/or fitness; this FL is non-epistatic, by definition. To further simplify our analysis, we assume that this preliminary landscape is “flat,” insofar as all mutations are either lethal or completely neutral.</p>
        <p>Given said assumptions, all relevant aspects of the population are completely described by the number of living cells (<italic>n(t)</italic>). <italic>n(t)</italic> thus undergoes a biased random walk, with a natural absorbing boundary at <italic>n = 0</italic> and a reflecting boundary at <italic>n = N</italic>.

We denote these two opposing regimes as the “survival phase” and “extinction phase.” The boundary between survival and extinction occurs when the natural death rate balances net fitness:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002609.e008"><graphic orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002609.e008" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3a)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula id="pcbi.1002609.e009"><graphic orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002609.e009" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3b)</label></disp-formula></p>
        <p>Note that, if <italic>Uλ&gt;ln(2)≈0.7</italic>, populations will be in the extinction phase even if no natural death occurs (<italic>δ = 0</italic>). To a close approximation, the effect of natural death is merely to decrease (<italic>Uλ</italic>)<italic><sub>crit</sub></italic> by an amount <italic>δ/W*</italic>, i.e. the number of natural deaths per generation. Also not that the value of <italic>N</italic> is irrelevant to whether populations are in the survival or extinction phase on this non-epistatic fitness landscape (FL); the picture will be radically different later, when we consider a more realistic FL.</p>
        <p>We now turn to the stochastic features of this model. Given the initial condition that there are <italic>N</italic> cells at <italic>t = 0</italic>, all populations go extinct with probability one, but we can calculate the statistics of how long the population survives before going extinct (i.e. hitting the absorbing state at <italic>n = 0</italic>).

        <title>Extinction on epistatic biophysical fitness landscape</title>
        <p>We next consider a recently developed biophysics-based fitness landscape (FL), which features a continuous distribution of fitness effects (DFE) among random new mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002609-g002">fig. 2</xref>). The basic assumption of this approach is that mutations inflict a fitness penalty proportional to the extent that they unfold proteins by perturbing thermodynamic stability (<italic>ΔG</italic>). Below, and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002609-g002">fig. 2</xref>, we describe some important features of this model; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> and/or ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Wylie1">[27]</xref> for details.</p>
        <list list-type="order">
          <list-item>
            <p>This FL is epistatic: a given mutation unfolds barely-stable proteins more so than very stable proteins.</p>

          <list-item>
            <p>Each cell has a fixed number (<italic>Γ</italic>) of proteins, or, more precisely, <italic>Γ</italic> protein folding domains. For convenience, we assume <italic>Γ = 20</italic> in simulations.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>Mutations that completely unfold proteins or hit a small fraction of functionally critical residues (e.g. the active site) are considered lethal. Points 1–3 above are not explicit assumptions of our model; rather, they follow naturally and implicitly from a biophysics-based framework (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> and ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Wylie1">[27]</xref>). Crucially, the DFE from this FL roughly agrees with experimental data, at least for viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Wylie1">[27]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002609-g002">fig. 2C</xref>). Unlike the flat landscape that we considered previously, the biophysical FL features many mutations that only slightly decrease fitness. These mutations profoundly increase the importance of <italic>N</italic> (even when <italic>δ = 0</italic>), because they can only be purged by sufficiently large populations (<italic>|Ns|&gt;1</italic>).</p>
        <p>As with most multi-locus models, dynamics on our biophysics-based FL is too complex to solve analytically for finite <italic>N</italic>. Thus, we resort to stochastic computer simulations, as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002609-g003">Fig. 3a</xref> shows how the mean extinction time (<italic>τ</italic>) depends on population capacity (<italic>N</italic>) for various mutation rates (<italic>U</italic>). On this log-log plot, upward bending curves increase faster than a power law (exponential-like scaling, c.f. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002609.e011">eq.4b</xref>), whereas downward bending curves increase slower than a power law (logarithmic-like scaling, c.g. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002609.e010">eq.4a</xref>). As we observed in the non-epistatic analytic model, <italic>U</italic> strongly impacts <italic>τ</italic>. Above an ultimate extinction rate (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002609.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>≈2.5, roughly estimated by eyeing simulation results), <italic>τ</italic> scales approximately logarithmically with <italic>N</italic> (extinction phase), even when <italic>δ = 0</italic> and <italic>N→∞</italic>. For very small <italic>U</italic>, <italic>τ</italic> scales approximately exponentially with <italic>N</italic> (survival phase) for all <italic>N</italic>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002609.s004">Fig.S4</xref> explicitly shows <italic>τ</italic> versus <italic>U</italic>. For reference, we note that real RNA viruses have mutation rates in the approximate range <italic>0.1&lt;U&lt;5</italic>, whereas DNA based microbes generally have <italic>U≈0.003</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Drake1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Sanjuan1">[33]</xref>.

A few viral species have slightly higher mutation rates than the threshold <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002609.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (≈2.5) from our model (e.g. bacteriophage Qβ has <italic>U≈5</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Sanjuan1">[33]</xref>); this is likely due to large burst size: see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>.</p>

        <p>In stark contrast to the preliminary, non-epistatic FL, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002609-g003">fig. 3a</xref> shows that <italic>N</italic>, not just <italic>U</italic>, also determines whether a population is in the survival or extinction phase. This is most apparent in the cyan curve representing <italic>U = 2</italic>, whose curvature suddenly changes near at a critical value (<italic>N<sub>crit</sub></italic>). For large <italic>N</italic>, populations are in the survival phase, whereas below <italic>N<sub>crit</sub></italic> populations enter the extinction phase. <italic>N<sub>crit</sub></italic> becomes arbitrarily large as <italic>U→U<sub>crit</sub></italic>. To get a quantitative sense of these values, given reasonable parameter values, consider <italic>U = 2</italic>: <italic>N<sub>crit</sub></italic> equals <italic>100</italic> or so when <italic>δ = 0</italic> and rises to <italic>∼10<sup>4</sup></italic> for the modest value of <italic>δ = 0.1</italic>. <italic>τ</italic> is only ∼100 generations in the extinction phase, and rises quickly from this level in the survival phase.</p>
        <p>The extinction vs. survival phases are even more clearly delineated by the coefficient of variation (<italic>CV<sub>τ</sub></italic>) of the extinction time (i.e. its standard deviation divided by its mean (<italic>τ</italic>)). <italic>CV<sub>τ</sub></italic> measures stochasticity in populations' longevity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002609-g003">Fig. 3b</xref> shows that deep in the extinction phase, <italic>CV<sub>τ</sub>→0</italic>, whereas <italic>CV<sub>τ</sub>→1</italic> in the survival regime. These limits make intuitive sense: <italic>CV<sub>τ</sub> = 0</italic> represents deterministic extinction, whereas <italic>CV<sub>τ</sub> = 1</italic> is a hallmark of an exponential distribution describing the waiting time for an extraordinary run of independent lethal mutations in all <italic>N</italic> cells. Thus, <italic>CV<sub>τ</sub></italic> behaves as an “order parameter” familiar from phase-transition theory: survival plays the role of the “ordered phase” (<italic>CV<sub>τ</sub> = 1</italic>) while extinction represents the disordered phase (<italic>CV<sub>τ</sub> = 0</italic>). In contrast, the preliminary, non-epistatic FL does not transition from the extinction to survival phase as <italic>N</italic> increases, since <italic>CV<sub>τ</sub></italic> in a monotonic function of <italic>N</italic> in that model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002609.s003">fig.S3</xref>).</p>
        <p>A crucial lesson from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002609-g003">fig. 3b</xref> is that <italic>N<sub>crit</sub></italic> depends on <italic>U<sub>crit</sub></italic>, and vice versa. Curves representing higher mutation rates “peel off” to <italic>CV<sub>τ</sub> = 1</italic> at larger values of <italic>N</italic> than do curves representing lower <italic>U</italic>. However, for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002609.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the curves cannot transition to <italic>CV<sub>τ</sub> = 1</italic> for any value of <italic>N</italic>. This assertion is clear from the fact that a finite percentage (10% here, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) of mutations are unconditionally lethal, and at sufficiently large <italic>U</italic>, nearly all progeny will acquire these (if no other) lethal mutations, resulting in extinction. Following the logic of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002609.e007">eq.2</xref>, an upper bound for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002609.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> given 10% unconditional lethals, is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002609.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> nonsynonymous mutations per genome replication. Overall, the transition from extinction to survival is summarized by the “phase diagram” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002609-g003">fig. 3c</xref>. The non-rectangular phase boundary in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002609-g003">fig. 3c</xref> emphasizes the interrelatedness of <italic>N<sub>crit</sub></italic> and <italic>U<sub>crit</sub></italic>. In particular, the boundary can be crossed by either increasing <italic>U</italic> (i.e. lethal mutagenesis) or decreasing <italic>N</italic>, which we refer to as “lethal isolation.” <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002609.s005">Fig.S5</xref> shows a quantitative version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002609-g003">fig. 3c</xref>.</p>
        <p>Why does the biophysics-based FL enable “lethal isolation” while the non-epistatic FL does not? The answer is that mean net fitness (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002609.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) increases with <italic>N</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002609-g004">fig. 4c</xref>) on the biophysics-based landscape; this increase derives from two distinct sources. First, larger populations more effectively purge weakly deleterious mutations having <italic>Ns&lt;1</italic>, thereby driving up the mean birth rate (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002609.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) among living members of the population. Consequently, large populations can grow fast enough to outpace natural death (<italic>δ</italic>). Secondly, and more profoundly, small populations produce a larger fraction (<italic>λ</italic>) of lethal mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002609-g004">fig. 4a</xref>) on the epistatic, biophysics-based FL; these additional lethal mutations can decrease <italic>W<sub>net</sub></italic> below zero and cause extinction even when <italic>δ = 0</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002609-g003">figs. 3</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002609-g004">4</xref>). The biophysical basis for this effect is that, when proteins are only barely stable (as predicted to be the case in small populations, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002609-g004">fig. 4b</xref>), more mutations are within striking range of the unfolding transition at <italic>ΔG = 0</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002609-g002">fig. 2a</xref>) and a corresponding lethal phenotype.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>A prerequisite for understanding extinction in finite populations is a coherent method for classifying extinction versus survival: Although all finite populations eventually go extinct, our analytic and simulation models show that “not all extinction is the same.” That observation led us to define two opposing dynamical phases for evolving populations: The extinction phase is characterized by rapid, nearly deterministic (<italic>CV<sub>τ</sub>≈0</italic>) decline whereas the survival phase is characterized by long yet uncertain extinction times (<italic>CV<sub>τ</sub>≈1</italic>). Intuitively, one usually thinks of small populations as being more stochastic than large populations. However, results from our biophysical fitness landscape (FL) show that that intuition needs refinement: the increased <italic>stochasticity caused by small N actually makes extinction more deterministic</italic> (e.g. <italic>CV<sub>τ</sub></italic> can decrease with <italic>N</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002609-g003">fig. 3b</xref>). The situation is analogous to a building experiencing an earthquake: if the strength of noisy seismic vibrations (i.e. genetic drift) crosses a threshold, gravity (i.e. deleterious mutations) deterministically destroys the building (i.e. population goes extinct).</p>
      <p>Previous studies of mutation-induced extinction focused exclusively on either the role of high mutation rate (<italic>U</italic>) or small population capacity (<italic>N</italic>). Those that focused on high <italic>U</italic> neglected the role of genetic drift by assuming that <italic>N = ∞</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Wilke1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Wilke2">[4]</xref>. Likewise, those studies that included genetic drift generally neglected the role of high <italic>U</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Martin1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Lynch2">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Lande1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Whitlock1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Gabriel1">[34]</xref>. This paper bridges those previous two approaches by exploring how interplay between small <italic>N</italic> and large <italic>U</italic> accelerates extinction. We found that rapid extinction occurs on the biophysical FL whenever <italic>N</italic> is too small (<italic>N&lt;N<sub>crit</sub></italic>) or <italic>U</italic> is too large (<italic>U&gt;U<sub>crit</sub></italic>). Furthermore, we found that <italic>N<sub>crit</sub></italic> depends on <italic>U<sub>crit</sub></italic> and vice versa, i.e. the phase boundary in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002609-g003">fig. 3c</xref> is not rectangular. In particular, small population capacity reduces <italic>U<sub>crit</sub></italic>. This reduction is generally modest: e.g. we see <italic>U<sub>crit</sub></italic> shift from about two to about one in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002609-g003">figs. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002609.s005">S5</xref>, as <italic>N</italic> varies from 10 to 10<sup>5</sup>. Although <italic>U<sub>crit</sub></italic> depends only weakly on <italic>N</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002609-g003">fig. 3</xref> shows that <italic>τ</italic>, as well as the qualitative behavior of the population, can depend dramatically on <italic>N</italic>.</p>
      <p>Semi-conservative reproduction is a key feature of our model that distinguishes it from most previous studies, e.g. refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Wilke1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Lynch2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Lynch3">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Schultz1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Whitlock1">[23]</xref>. This distinction is sharpest in the regime that <italic>δ = 0</italic>, where low fitness (i.e. long generation time) contributes to extinction only insofar as it increases the fraction of lethal mutations (<italic>λ</italic>). In other words, the population is its own (and only) enemy in the <italic>δ = 0</italic> regime. In reality, populations must survive not only in spite of themselves, but also in spite of death imposed by the environment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002609-g003">Fig. 3a</xref> shows that, in the plausible scenario where 10% of the population dies from natural causes each generation, <italic>τ</italic> is further shortened significantly. We note that obtaining parameter values for <italic>δ</italic> is not always straightforward because it requires discriminating between natural death and density-dependent death (i.e. death due to fixed <italic>N</italic>). For example, cells infected with HIV turn over approximately once per day <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Markowitz1">[35]</xref>, but it is unclear what fraction of the turnover is due to density dependence versus other “natural” causes.</p>
      <p>For the sake of simplicity, we assumed that only two offspring result from a birth event. In the case of viruses, two should be replaced by an “effective burst size” that takes into account the number of virions released during the infected cell's lifetime as well as the fraction of those virions that go on to infect future cells. A simple deterministic analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Wilke1">[2]</xref> suggests that <italic>U<sub>crit</sub></italic> increases as the logarithm of effective burst size, but otherwise does not change the qualitative picture. In the context of finite populations, large burst size may also non-trivially reduce the effective population size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Charlesworth1">[36]</xref>, since all members of a burst are closely related; we leave investigation of this topic to future work.</p>
      <p>Apart from large burst size, Martin and Gandon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Martin1">[7]</xref> recently pointed out another mechanism that may partially buffer viral populations against extinction. Using an explicit viral dynamics model that includes both susceptible and infected cells, those authors point out that as viral load declines under elevated mutation rates, the number of susceptible cells is predicted to correspondingly increase. This effect may tend to offset and/or halt the decline in growth rate caused by elevated mutation rates. While this mechanism may be important, our model predicts that its extinction-buffering potential may be limited. In particular, we predict that the fraction of lethal mutations (<italic>λ</italic>) increases as fitness decreases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002609-g004">fig. 4a</xref>); in our model, any increased growth rate, from whatever origin, will be countered by a correspondingly elevated death rate from lethal mutations.</p>

        <p>Deterministic models remove <italic>N</italic> from consideration by assuming that <italic>N = ∞</italic>, which enables a comparatively straightforward calculation of the ultimate mutation rate (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002609.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) beyond which even infinitely large populations go extinct.

While it is unsurprising that <italic>τ</italic> decreases as <italic>N</italic> does, it <italic>is</italic> rather surprising that decreasing <italic>N</italic> can fundamentally change the dynamical regime of the population from survival to extinction.</p>
        <p>Zeldovich et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Zeldovich1">[3]</xref> utilized a biophysical fitness landscape similar to the one presented here. Apart from their assumption that <italic>N = ∞</italic>, the main difference with our approach is that their fitness landscape had a strictly flat “mesa,” i.e. they approximated <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002609.e037">eq.6</xref> (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) as a true step function. By contrast, our model features nearly-neutral mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002609.s004">fig.S4</xref>) which enhance the role of population capacity (<italic>N</italic>), since mutations with <italic>Ns&lt;1</italic> are invisible to natural selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Wylie1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-CrowJFaK1">[37]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The deterministic theory of Bull and Wilke, first laid out in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Wilke1">[2]</xref> and subsequently elaborated upon in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Wilke2">[4]</xref>, is another important benchmark for comparison. Using a simple, classical equation, those authors calculated equilibrium mean fitness and compared this to the rate of natural death. Neglecting beneficial/compensatory mutations, they calculated a maximum allowable “deleterious mutation rate” of <italic>ln(2)≈0.7</italic>, which is the same value we calculated for the <italic>lethal</italic> mutation rate (<italic>Uλ</italic>) in the preliminary, non-epistatic FL.

The discrepancy between 0.7 and 2.5 derives from many factors, including compensatory mutations in our model and ambiguity in what those authors mean by “deleterious,” i.e. which mutations they would define as deleterious as opposed to neutral.</p>

        <title>Previous calculations of <italic>N<sub>crit</sub></italic> (stochastic studies)</title>
        <p>Random drift is the paramount concern of a separate line of previous studies that describe extinction in terms of Muller's ratchet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Lynch2">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Schultz1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Poon1">[38]</xref>. However, those studies minimize the importance of mutation rate. For example, neglecting beneficial mutations and using an approach based on fixation probabilities, Lande <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Lande1">[21]</xref> calculated that <italic>τ∼1/U</italic>; i.e. his result is that <italic>U</italic> merely sets the time units but is irrelevant to the essential behavior. As another example, Whitlock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Whitlock1">[23]</xref> included beneficial mutations and calculated that <italic>N<sub>crit</sub>∼(U<sub>deleterious</sub>/U<sub>beneficial</sub>)<sup>1/3</sup></italic>, which depends only on the balance of beneficial to deleterious mutations and <italic>not</italic> on the mutation rate itself. Both of those examples contradict our results, which show that <italic>N<sub>crit</sub></italic> and <italic>τ</italic> depend dramatically on <italic>|U|</italic>. The dominant reason for the discrepancy is that those authors assumed that deleterious mutations occur “one at a time,” which is not true when the rate that mutations are introduced (<italic>U</italic>) exceeds the rate at which selection removes them <italic>(∼1/s</italic>). When <italic>U/s≫1</italic>, the population experiences “Hill-Robertson interference” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Hill1">[39]</xref>, which both accelerates extinction and also makes analytic solutions intractable.</p>
        <p>A separate, very serious concern about many previous studies (e.g. refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Lynch2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Lande1">[21]</xref>) is that, for all parameter values they explored, they always observed a small coefficient of variation in extinction time (<italic>CV<sub>τ</sub></italic>). Based on our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002609-g003">fig. 3</xref>), this suggests that <italic>those authors only probed the extinction regime</italic>. In other words, their models were constructed such that extinction occurred nearly deterministically. By contrast, it seems likely that most, if not all, natural populations are in the survival regime as long as their population size and/or mutation rate are not interfered with externally (e.g. via mutagens or habitat destruction). A related issue concerns the initial conditions of those models. They assumed that populations were extremely fit initially, such that each individual leaves a large number (<italic>R<sub>o</sub></italic>) of descendants (<italic>R<sub>o</sub>≫1</italic>). Extinction occurs in those models when <italic>R<sub>o</sub></italic> semi-deterministically drops to just below one, after several deleterious mutations achieve fixation. By contrast, our simulations begin in a natural condition (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>): mutation-selection-drift equilibrium, which may not even exist in those previous models. The existence of a quasi-equilibrium state, i.e. the survival phase, is a major advantage of our approach. Indeed, the survival phase can be viewed as a stochastic analog of deterministic mutation-selection equilibrium.</p>

        <title>Other sources of random genetic drift</title>
        <p>In this paper we have focused on the subtly deleterious impact of unbiased fluctuations on allele frequency (i.e. genetic drift) caused by finite population capacity (<italic>N</italic>). In addition to finite <italic>N</italic>, several other factors can have a similar effect, including population bottlenecks, micro-environmental fluctuations, and stochasticity in gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Wang1">[40]</xref>; these effects are sometimes summarized collectively by an “effective population size” (<italic>N<sub>e</sub></italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Charlesworth1">[36]</xref>.

        <title>Importance of fitness landscape</title>
        <p>An important result from previous studies is that <italic>τ</italic> depends strongly on both the severity of deleterious mutations (i.e. the DFE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Lynch2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Lande1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Gabriel1">[34]</xref>) and on epistasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Schultz1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Poon1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Kondrashov1">[41]</xref>. The DFE has traditionally been represented by either a single selection coefficient (i.e. a Dirac delta function) or by a continuous function (e.g. Gamma distributions), which was assumed not to change with fitness and/or time. Thus, even relatively simple approaches were forced to make somewhat ad-hoc modeling choices and also introduce several parameters. The fact that <italic>τ</italic> depends strongly on the DFE thus presents a dilemma to researchers: they must either comb through a high-dimensional parameter space or else their results depend on myriad questionable assumptions. Our model circumvents this problem because the parameters (e.g. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002609.e037">eqs. 6</xref>,<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002609.e038">7</xref> in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) are not “adjustable”; rather, they are set by strictly biophysical considerations. In effect, we exchanged a poorly understood, high-level question (how mutations affect fitness) for a well-understood, microscopic question (how mutations affect protein folding thermodynamics). The validity of this exchange is commensurate with the extent to which our DFE matches experimental data (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Wylie1">[27]</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002609.s004">fig.S4</xref>).</p>
        <p>Apart from the advantages of our FL, we expect that the qualitative behavior in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002609-g003">fig. 3</xref> might also be observed in some traditional models. We anticipate that the essential requirements are (i) both beneficial and deleterious mutations (so that the population does not inevitably “slide downhill”) and some upper bound on fitness (so that the population cannot forever “climb uphill”).</p>

        <title>Extinction versus “error catastrophe”</title>
        <p>Decades ago, Eigen calculated that genomes can become “delocalized” in sequence space during an “error catastrophe” when the mutation rate exceeds a critical value <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Eigen1">[42]</xref>. As pointed out by previous authors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Wilke1">[2]</xref>, extinction and error catastrophe are distinct concepts: The former is a demographic process whereas the latter refers to loss of the single fittest genotype on a toy fitness landscape, usually in the <italic>N = ∞</italic> limit.

        <title>Connections with experiments and viral infection treatment</title>
        <p>In reality, is extinction accompanied by excessive lethal mutations (as in our model) or merely by a slow generation time that is unable to keep pace with natural death (as in previous models, e.g. refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Wilke1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Lynch2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Lynch3">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Schultz1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Whitlock1">[23]</xref>? These two scenarios are distinguishable in laboratory evolution experiments on viruses because viral load (nucleic acid molecules per mL) and infectivity (plaques formed per mL viral suspension) can be measured separately. Several experiments on at least three viral species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-GrandePerez1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Crotty1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Severson1">[47]</xref> show that when <italic>U</italic> is elevated near/past <italic>U<sub>crit</sub></italic>, viral load transiently continues to increase, simultaneous with a decline in infectivity. Thus, noninfectious genomes (i.e. those carrying lethal mutations) signal extinction during experiments, in accord with our model's interpretation of extinction.</p>
        <p>A clinically relevant prediction of our model is that changing <italic>N</italic> can radically alter population survival, especially when <italic>U</italic> is elevated by drugs. This phenomenon was observed experimentally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Domingo1">[8]</xref> with foot-and-mouth disease virus, where merely 10-fold dilutions during viral passages dramatically accelerated extinction in the presence of mutagenic drugs. As remarked by those authors, this finding suggests that therapies combining both mutagenic drugs and traditional drugs (which reduce the number of viable viruses) could substantially increase efficacy. Indeed, our analytic results (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002609.e011">eqs.4</xref> and eq.S11a) imply that even in the survival phase, the expected time to extinction depends exponentially on (i.e. is very sensitive to) both <italic>U</italic> and <italic>N</italic>, suggesting that altering either of these parameters could dramatically impact the chances of population extinction during a fixed time interval.</p>
        <p>Apart from extinction per se, our general biophysics-based approach also has substantial experimental support. Our basic assumption is that protein unfolding/misfolding accounts for the deleterious effects of most mutations. If this were true, species with high <italic>U</italic> and/or low <italic>N</italic> should have less stable proteins. Several experimental facts suggest that this is in fact the case. First, chaperone overexpression compensated for the fitness decline caused by single-cell bottlenecks (low <italic>N</italic>) in bacterial populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Fares1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-MaisnierPatin1">[49]</xref>. Thus, these populations likely contained unstable, unfolded proteins which caused the fitness decline. Secondly, Fernandez and Lynch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Fernandez1">[50]</xref> recently reported more structural defects and thermodynamic instability among monomeric protein subunits in small populations than in large populations. Along similar lines, another study calculated less stability among proteins in endosymbiotic bacteria (small <italic>N</italic>) than in orthologs from free living relatives (large <italic>N</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-vanHam1">[51]</xref>. Thirdly, proteins from RNA viruses (high <italic>U</italic>) have a lower density of van der Waals contacts than orthologs in DNA viruses (lower <italic>U</italic>), suggesting, though not proving that RNA viral proteins are less stable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Tokuriki1">[52]</xref>. Indeed, we have gone even further and predicted the distribution of stabilities within proteomes from species with various <italic>U</italic> and <italic>N</italic> (see fig. 5 from ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Wylie1">[27]</xref>).</p>

        <p>The approach here closely follows ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Wylie1">[27]</xref>. Every cell contains a number (<italic>Γ</italic>) of <italic>well-adapted</italic> proteins, each of which exists in thermal equilibrium between its native, functional conformation and an ensemble of unfolded, nonfunctional conformations. The fraction of time in equilibrium that protein <italic>i</italic> spends in its native conformation is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002609.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Qualitatively, our assumption is that fitness is impaired when either the concentration of folded proteins decreases or, equivalently, the concentration of unfolded proteins increases. Quantitatively, we assume that<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002609.e033"><graphic orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002609.e033" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(5a)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula id="pcbi.1002609.e034"><graphic orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002609.e034" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(5b)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula id="pcbi.1002609.e035"><graphic orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002609.e035" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(5c)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002609.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the fraction of time in equilibrium that protein <italic>i</italic> spends in its native conformation and <italic>W</italic> is fitness (i.e. birth rate). The approximation between <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002609.e033">eq.5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002609.e034">eq.5b</xref> is valid for <italic>P<sup>nat</sup>≈1</italic>, as is the case for real proteins (see below). <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002609.e033">Eq.5a</xref> emphasizes the positive interpretation that each of the proteins is required in order for the organism to live and function. Likewise, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002609.e034">eq.5b</xref> emphasizes the negative interpretation that misfolded/unfolded protein hurts the organism in proportion to their concentration in the cell.</p>
        <p>In our model, <italic>P<sup>nat</sup></italic> is the master variable that connects proteins with fitness. However, it is simpler to work with a closely related quantity: the free energy difference (<italic>ΔG</italic>, also called “protein stability”) between the folded conformation and the ensemble of nonfunctional conformations. We assume that proteins fold “two-state” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Privalov1">[53]</xref>, which implies the relationship<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002609.e037"><graphic orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002609.e037" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(6)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>k<sub>b</sub></italic> is Boltzman's constant and <italic>T</italic> is temperature.</p>
        <p>Working with <italic>ΔG</italic> simplifies mutational effects because, (i) effects of mutations on free energy (<italic>ΔΔG</italic>) are well characterized experimentally and (ii) <italic>ΔΔG</italic> (but not <italic>ΔP<sup>nat</sup></italic>) is additive when several mutations accumulate sequentially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Serrano1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Tokuriki2">[55]</xref>. We approximate <italic>p(ΔΔG)</italic> by a Gaussian function with a mean of +1 kcal/mole and standard deviation 1.7 kcal/mole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Zeldovich1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Kumar1">[56]</xref>, which reasonably matches empirical data from the ProTherm database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Kumar1">[56]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002609.s004">fig.S4</xref>):<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002609.e038"><graphic orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002609.e038" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(7)</label></disp-formula></p>
        <p>We also assume that <italic>p(ΔΔG)</italic> is independent of <italic>ΔG</italic>, which is consistent with empirical data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Chen1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Kumar1">[56]</xref>, though only to a rough approximation.</p>
        <p>While most mutations in our model only alter <italic>ΔG</italic>, a small fraction destroy protein function for non-thermodynamic reasons. For example, a few amino acid positions comprise the active catalytic site, and virtually all mutations there will abolish functional activity. Assuming that there are 3 catalytic residues, another 3 nearby critical sites and 100 total residues in the folding domain, these represent 6% of all random mutations. Besides the active site, some point mutations abolish activity by introducing premature STOP codons. Assuming random codon usage, premature STOP codons represent ≈4% of random mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Wylie1">[27]</xref>. Thus, together, these categories comprise ≈10% of all nonsynonymous mutations, which we assume to unconditionally confer a lethal phenotype.</p>
        <p><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002609.e037">Eqs.6</xref>,<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002609.e038">7</xref> al ong with said assumptions regarding lethal mutations, indirectly imply the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) in the biophysical model; detailed explanation of how this works is the subject of ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002609-Wylie1">[27]</xref>. Briefly, we first equilibrated populations for at least 10<sup>5</sup> generations, at which point populations had substantial diversity in fitness. Next, we measured the DFE among all single point mutations for each clone in the population. Finally, these DFE were averaged to obtain the overall DFE, e.g. in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002609-g002">fig. 2C</xref>. This procedure essentially averages the DFE of each clone, weighting each in proportion to its probability of being randomly chosen as the starting point for mutagenesis experiments. Since our DFE describes nonsynonymous mutations only, synonymous mutations were removed from the experimental datasets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002609-g002">fig. 2c</xref>.</p>

        <title>Simulation procedures</title>
        <p>We iterated the birth-death-mutation process for 10<sup>5</sup> generations or until population extinction, whichever occurred first. Each birth event represents <italic>1/n(t)</italic> generations. All populations were initialized with genomes (i.e. sets of <italic>ΔG</italic> values) sampled from a single, “burn-in” population that had previously achieved mutation-selection-drift equilibrium during 10<sup>5</sup> generations of evolution. The parameter values (<italic>N = 10<sup>5</sup>, U = 1</italic>) of the burn-in population were chosen so as to lie clearly in the survival regime yet close to the regions of parameter space being probed throughout the paper. This choice minimizes the impact of (inherently somewhat artificial) initial conditions. The fraction of lethal mutations (<italic>λ</italic>) was estimated during each simulation run as the total number of lethal mutations divided by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002609.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002609.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the time-averaged number of cells during the run.</p>
