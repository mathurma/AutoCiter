<abstract>
<p>Although molecular chaperones are essential components of protein homeostatic machinery, their mechanism of action and impact on adaptation and evolutionary dynamics remain controversial. Here we developed a physics-based ab initio multi-scale model of a living cell for population dynamics simulations to elucidate the effect of chaperones on adaptive evolution. The 6-loci genomes of model cells encode model proteins, whose folding and interactions in cellular milieu can be evaluated exactly from their genome sequences. A genotype-phenotype relationship that is based on a simple yet non-trivially postulated protein-protein interaction (PPI) network determines the cell division rate. Model proteins can exist in native and molten globule states and participate in functional and all possible promiscuous non-functional PPIs. We find that an active chaperone mechanism, whereby chaperones directly catalyze protein folding, has a significant impact on the cellular fitness and the rate of evolutionary dynamics, while passive chaperones, which just maintain misfolded proteins in soluble complexes have a negligible effect on the fitness. We find that by partially releasing the constraint on protein stability, active chaperones promote a deeper exploration of sequence space to strengthen functional PPIs, and diminish the non-functional PPIs. A key experimentally testable prediction emerging from our analysis is that down-regulation of chaperones that catalyze protein folding significantly slows down the adaptation dynamics.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Molecular chaperones or heat-shock proteins are essential components of protein homeostatic machinery in all three domains of life, whose role is not only to prevent protein aggregation but also catalyze the protein folding process by decreasing the energetic barrier for folding. Importantly, chaperones have often been implicated as phenotypic capacitors since they buffer the deleterious effects of mutations, promote genetic diversity, and thus speed up adaptive evolution. Here we explore computationally the consequences of chaperone activity in cytoplasm via long-time evolutionary dynamics simulations. We use a 6-loci multi scale model of cell populations, where the fitness of each cell is determined from its genome, based on statistical mechanical principles of protein folding and protein-protein interactions. We find that by catalyzing protein folding chaperones buffer the deleterious effect of mutations on folding stability and thus open up a sequence space for efficient and simultaneous optimization of multiple molecular traits determining the cellular fitness. As a result, chaperones dramatically accelerate adaptation dynamics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Evolutionary selection of protein sequences is a complex task whereby several traits such as translation efficiency, structural integrity (i.e. folding stability and kinetics), molecular function, as well as interactions with other proteins in the cellular milieu should be simultaneously optimized. Imposing simultaneous and often contradictive (pleiotropic) constraints on protein sequence evolution severely limits the repertoire of possible solutions in sequence space and thus slows down the evolutionary dynamics. It is widely accepted that strong selective pressure against protein misfolding plays a key role in determining the rate of protein evolution and sustainable mutational loads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Drummond1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Serohijos1">[5]</xref>. However, other constraints such as the need to avoid protein sequestration to non-functional protein-protein interactions (NF-PPIs) in the cytoplasm are also emerging as important determinants of the rates and outcomes of evolutionary dynamics of proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Zhang1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Yang1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>From <italic>de novo</italic> folding of nascent polypeptides to refolding of mature misfolded proteins, chaperones or heat-shock proteins assist in maintaining the necessary abundance of folded proteins, compensating for the selective costs of erroneous protein synthesis, misfolding, and sequestration of proteins in NF-PPIs. In three domains of life, chaperones are essential components of protein homeostatic machinery. Chaperonins, like GroEL, effectively catalyze the folding process by increasing the rate at which misfolded proteins are converted into their folded conformations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-England1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Chakraborty1">[13]</xref>; this process can lead to diminished aggregation and NF-PPIs due to the limited presence of aggregation-prone misfolded species in the cytoplasm. Lindquist and others posited that chaperones may act as phenotypic capacitors by buffering the fitness effects of deleterious mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Queitsch1">[14]</xref>, leading to a greater genetic diversity and speeding up adaptive evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Bogumil1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Tokuriki1">[16]</xref>. A recent in vivo study from our lab <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Bershtein1">[12]</xref> also showed that the chaperone action in dynamic cellular milieu can be pleiotropic, i.e. it extends beyond the immediate effect of protein folding by reducing the participation of destabilized proteins in NF-PPIs and affecting their accessibility to ATP-dependent proteases .</p>
<p>Apparently, chaperones play a key role in sculpting the fitness landscape of organisms. However, understanding the evolutionary implications of this fact requires a multi-scale modeling that realistically represents the mechanism of chaperone action and reaches across the necessary length and time scales. Recently, we developed a multi-scale evolutionary model for population dynamics simulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Heo1">[7]</xref>, where the fitness (rate of division) of each cell is derived explicitly from its genomic sequence by using the physical principles of protein folding and interactions. The model provided insights into the co-evolution of molecular properties of proteins, their abundances in the cytoplasm, and their functional and NF-PPIs. Here we significantly extend this ab inito model to explicitly account for chaperone activity in the cytoplasm of model cells. The model elucidates not only the immediate pleiotropic effect of chaperone action on cellular fitness but also its long-term evolutionary consequences. We find that the chaperone activity provides a significant acceleration of adaptive evolution by minimizing the detrimental effect of protein misfolding and therefore opens new paths in sequence space for efficient and simultaneous optimization of multiple molecular traits, determining the fitness of model cells.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Our ab initio 6-loci model cells contain explicit genomes that encode six essential, birth rate controlling, proteins that are modeled as 27-mer lattice proteins as introduced in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Heo1">[7]</xref>. The advantage of this coarse-grained protein model is that a crucial conformational subset, consisting of all maximally compact conformations, can be enumerated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Shakhnovich1">[17]</xref>, making the calculations of binding and folding stabilities exact within a selected representative conformational ensemble. At the initial stage of the simulations, each protein in the model is assigned a conformation, which is deemed folded and thus functional, and each protein complex in the functional PPI network is assumed to be functional only in one specific docking mode out of 144 possible ones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Heo1">[7]</xref>. The model of Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Heo1">[7]</xref> considered NF-PPIs only between folded proteins. Here we also take into account the misfolded compact Molten Globule (MG) states of proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Ptitsyn1">[18]</xref> by modeling the ensemble of unfolded states as maximally compact yet non-native conformations (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Methods</italic></xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003269-g001">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>, we allow all proteins in their folded and MG states to interact with each other in the cytoplasm of model cells to form functional and non-functional protein complexes. Experimental studies show that GroEL and several other chaperones do not interact strongly with proteins in their native state, see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Viitanen1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Tsurupa1">[22]</xref>. Therefore, here we only consider interactions between the model chaperone and proteins in their MG state. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003269-g001">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>, the interaction surface of the chaperone is modeled as a 2D (3×3) lattice fragment, consisting of nine amino acid residues that are found in the apical domain of the chaperonin GroEL and that have been shown to be essential for substrate binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Fenton1">[23]</xref>.</p>

<p>We assume that functional protein complexes constitute the same prototypical PPI network as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Heo1">[7]</xref>: the first protein is active in monomeric form, the second and third proteins are functional as a heterodimer, and finally, the fourth, fifth and sixth proteins form a “date triangle” where they function in various combinations of pairwise complexes between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003269-g001">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). We then postulate, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Heo1">[7]</xref>, that the division rate of an individual cell is a product of the functional concentrations of proteins for the postulated prototypical PPI network:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003269.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>Here <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a parameter used to scale the rate and thus the time, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the postulated “optimal” total concentration of proteins, which reflects the assumption that protein synthesis comes at a cost, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the total concentrations of individual proteins, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a control parameter that defines a fitness penalty for deviation from the optimal <italic>total</italic> concentration of all proteins. Overall, the role of the denominator in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003269.e001">Eq. <bold>[1]</bold></xref> is to penalize the deviations from the optimal protein levels and to avoid a fitness gain by a mere overexpression of proteins. Hence, the cell division rate in our model is determined by a fitness function, which stems from an intuitive physical-biological assumption that a subset of gene products acts in concert to promote healthy cell divisions.</p>
<p>In what follows, we define the functional concentrations of monomer and dimers in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003269.e001">Eq. <bold>[1]</bold></xref> as<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003269.e006"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e006" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the Boltzmann probability that proteins <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> interact with each other in a specific docking conformation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Methods</italic></xref>), <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the concentration of the monomeric protein product of gene 1 in its native folded form, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the concentration of the binary complex formed by the folded states of proteins <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic>.</p>
<p>We employ a simplified two-step kinetic model to describe the catalytic activity of active chaperones, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003269-g001">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Methods</italic></xref> for the technical aspects of the formulation). In this active model, the chaperone acts as a catalyst to accelerate the rate of protein folding. As a control, we also consider a passive model of chaperone action, whereby the role of chaperone is simply to bind and release proteins in their MG states. It is noteworthy that, in contrast to a conventional catalyst, which decreases the activation barrier for both forward and backward reactions, an active chaperone increases the rate of conversion of misfolded proteins into their folded form without increasing the rate of reverse reaction of unfolding. Such “one-way” catalysis, which requires consumption of ATP, increases the concentration of folded species, which is equivalent, under steady state conditions, to an effective increase of thermodynamic stability of a protein as outlined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Bershtein1">[12]</xref>. We model binding of MG proteins to the chaperone with a pre-equilibrium assumption since the association/dissociation of chaperone with an MG protein is a fast process as compared to subsequent kinetic steps in which the actual protein folding occurs. It has been shown that these later kinetic steps, which lead to folding, are rate limiting as they almost always require ATP hydrolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Horwich1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>Examples of active chaperones with catalytic folding activity include the chaperonins, GroEL in prokaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Horwich1">[24]</xref> and TRiC in eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Frydman1">[25]</xref>. While the applicability of our model is not limited to the GroEL-like chaperonins, the catalytic activity of this class of chaperones has been well established, see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Chakraborty1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Horwich1">[24]</xref>. Therefore, our model directly applies to this class of chaperones, which forms a good experimental system to test our predictions. Henceforth, unless otherwise indicated, we refer to the chaperones with catalytic activity simply as chaperones.</p>

<title>Chaperones dramatically speed up evolutionary dynamics</title>
<p>We explored the effect of chaperones on evolutionary dynamics by running long time evolutionary simulations (200,000 generations) of model cell populations. Our simulations start from monoclonal populations of model cells, whose sequences have been designed by using the method reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Berezovsky1">[26]</xref> to provide high stabilities <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for all 6 proteins in their folded states without regard for their functional and NF-PPIs (see details in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Methods</italic></xref>). In our model, the acceleration of protein folding rate due to chaperone action is determined by the parameter <italic>x</italic>, which is the ratio of the rate at which a folded protein is released by the chaperone to the rate at which spontaneous protein folding occurs (defined in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Methods</italic></xref>).</p>
<p>To determine the effects of chaperone buffering on adaptive evolution, we tested two models – an active and a passive model. In the active model, the chaperone acts as a catalyst and accelerates protein folding. However, in the passive model, the chaperone assumes a simple role by merely binding and releasing proteins in their MG states. While for the passive model we set <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the active model we assume a modest <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> throughout this work, consistent with the estimates of the dynamic model given in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Bershtein1">[12]</xref>. In both cases we keep the chaperone concentration fixed at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. To highlight the role of chaperones we always, in parallel, run control simulations for cells without chaperones, i.e. setting <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>To determine broadly the effect of chaperones on adaptation dynamics we ran evolutionary simulations at three different temperatures, i.e. <italic>T</italic> = 0.85 (low), T = 1.05 (medium), and T = 1.25 (high). Throughout this work, all temperatures are in units calibrated to Miyazawa-Jernigan (MJ) potentials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Miyazawa1">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>The effect of chaperones on the evolution of fitness is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003269-g002">Fig. 2</xref> as fitness ratio, i.e. the ratio of birth rate in the model with chaperone to that without chaperone. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003269-g002">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref> shows the time evolution of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the active model <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The chaperones provide dramatic fitness benefit during the adaptive evolution, especially at early stages. The effect of chaperones is more pronounced at higher temperatures, where proteins in the MG state are more prevalent. While the fitness ratio reaches its peak of 100 at intermediate adaptation times for T = 0.85, it peaks at 250 for T = 1.05 and dramatically over 1000 for T = 1.25. After the initial fast adaptation period, the relative fitness effect of chaperones abates. Up to this point, however, the cells already have gained a considerable fitness advantage, and in the long time limit, we see gradually declining fitness ratios as the organisms become more and more fit. Nevertheless, the evolutionary dynamics with chaperones always leads to a higher long-time fitness than the evolutionary dynamics without chaperones, although the final fitness ratio is not as dramatic as those observed at intermediate evolutionary times.</p>

It is clear that the chaperones in the passive model do not provide a noticeable fitness gain but rather a small fitness loss (due to the sequestration of proteins by chaperones) at the initial stage of adaptation for all three temperatures. In light of these results, we conclude that the active folding of proteins by chaperones is necessary to provide a fitness benefit to cells in the evolutionary dynamics. In the following, unless otherwise indicated, we present the data only for the active model at the low temperature T = 0.85 as representative of our general results.</p>

<title>Chaperones promote epistasis in the evolution of molecular properties of proteins</title>
<p>Now, we turn to a detailed account of the evolutionary dynamics of the physicochemical properties of proteins, i.e. their stabilities <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and functional interaction probabilities <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the functional heterodimers and date triangles (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Methods</italic></xref> for the definitions of these quantities).

The chaperones provide a noticeable increase in stability for the monomeric proteins, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003269-g003">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>. Interestingly, at the initial stage of adaptation within 500 generations, the monomer loses its stability considerably by accumulating destabilizing mutations in the presence of chaperones. However, subsequent mutations bring about a rapid turnaround, resulting in a very stable monomer, which persists throughout the rest of the evolutionary dynamics. The non-monotonic dependence of stability of the monomeric protein on evolutionary time is an indication of a chaperone-enhanced epistatic behavior. The chaperone buffering relaxes significantly the stability constraint and allows the accumulation of more mutations in the locus encoding natively monomeric protein. This effect is mainly responsible for the initial sharp drop in the stability of the monomer. The resulting enhanced genetic diversity provides a path to a faster optimization of collective properties of all proteins in the cytoplasm such as NF-PPIs, as we show below.</p>

<p>The evolutionary dynamics of stability for the heterodimer and date triangle proteins show quite a different trend, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003269-g003">Figs 3<italic>B</italic> and 3<italic>C</italic></xref>. Initially, both the heterodimer and date triangle proteins lose their stability, but later on, the stability of date triangle proteins is slowly restored. However, in striking contrast to the monomer, the stability of heterodimer and date triangle proteins in the presence of chaperones shows a downward trend with evolutionary time, as compared to that of the chaperone-free cytoplasm of model cells.</p>
<p>The evolution of strengths of functional interactions, reflected in the parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the heterodimer and date triangle proteins, is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003269-g003">Fig. 3<italic>D</italic> and 3<italic>E</italic></xref>, respectively. The chaperones significantly increase <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for both the heterodimer and date triangle complexes. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the heterodimer increases rapidly within first 1000 generations, in the presence of chaperones. The rate of increase of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the date triangle is slower than that for the heterodimer; nevertheless, the chaperones provide a significant increase in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the date triangle complexes as well. Hence, our results show that the chaperones shift the balance between the strengths of functional interaction and stability of proteins in favor of the former at the expense of the latter. Indeed, it is more advantageous for faster adaptation that the heterodimer and date triangle proteins primarily develop strong interaction surfaces to contribute to the fitness. High stability of proteins establishes later on once the strong functional interaction between them is ensured.</p>

<title>Chaperones dramatically diminish the loss of proteins to NF-PPIs</title>
<p>While the effect of chaperones on protein stabilities and interactions is significant, it cannot fully account for the huge overall fitness increase, which transiently reaches up to a factor of 100 at the low temperature T = 0.85 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003269-g002">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). Therefore, there must be another factor affecting fitness, where the effect of chaperones appears even more pronounced. To that end, we turn to the analysis of NF-PPIs, which affect fitness through modulation of concentrations of proteins in their functional form. We find that at the early stages of adaptation the chaperones dramatically decrease the concentrations of protein complexes engaged in NF-PPIs, releasing more proteins to become functional. This can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003269-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, where we plot the time evolution of the fraction of protein material wasted in NF-PPIs in the absence and presence of chaperones.

Apparently, at the very early stage of adaptation, cell resources are mostly wasted unproductively to NF-PPIs. Both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003269-g004">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic> and 4<italic>B</italic></xref> show that the chaperones give rise to a rapid increase in the functional concentrations of monomeric and heterodimer proteins within the first 5,000 generations. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003269-g004">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>, the rate of decrease of NF-PPIs for the date triangle proteins is slower than that observed for the monomer and heterodimer proteins; nevertheless, with chaperones, it still occurs at the early stage of adaptation within 10,000 generations.</p>

<p>We find therefore that, while the chaperones interact directly with proteins to affect its molecular properties, their greatest impact on cellular fitness occurs indirectly through the optimization of a collective property of all proteins in the cytoplasm of model cells, namely, their NF-PPIs.</p>

<p>We found that at the very early stage of adaptation, after 500 generation, the chaperones induce a strong positive selection pressure on the monomer, which lasts, in average for about 10000 generations, after which the monomer falls under purifying selection. However, without the chaperones, the monomer evolves under positive selection only for a short time between 1500 to 6000 generations. On the other hand, without the chaperones, the net selection on both the heterodimer and date triangle genes is negative, apparently due to the dominance of the stability constraint. In the presence of chaperone buffering, however, these loci evolve under positive selection for about 8000 to 10000 generations before they revert back to purifying selection. An important generic effect apparent in the time evolution of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is that the chaperone buffering relaxes the negative selection pressure on all proteins and promotes the fixation of a greater number of beneficial mutations. Therefore, after the initial stage of fast adaptation, when all genes evolve under positive selection, we observe that the chaperones bring all genes closer to neutral regime in the adapted populations.</p>
<p>Next, we evaluated the effect of chaperones on the polymorphism in evolving populations of model cells. To that end we determined the average sequence entropy for each protein locus in our model. This quantity is determined from the alignment of gene sequences between all model organisms within the population (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Methods</italic></xref>). These results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003269-g006">Fig. 6</xref>.</p>

<p>Overall, we find that chaperones greatly enhance polymorphism in evolving populations. For all protein types, the sequence entropy rapidly increases within a few hundred generations with chaperone. For the monomer and date triangle proteins, the entropy stays approximately at the same level for the duration of an evolutionary run after the initial fast increase. For the heterodimer proteins, however, the entropy gradually increases reaching a level, which is almost two times higher than that for the monomer and date triangle proteins. A greater degree of polymorphism observed for the heterodimer proteins helps these proteins evolve faster than other loci in the model, as we note below.</p>
<p>The enhanced neutrality due to chaperone buffering also increases the rate of protein evolution considerably. Indeed, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003269-g005">Figs., from 5<italic>D</italic> to 5<italic>F</italic></xref>, the chaperones increase the net number of non-synonymous mutations for all loci. Initially, the monomer still evolves with the chaperones faster than the heterodimer and date triangle genes. However, the rate of evolution of heterodimer is the fastest as a result of more phenotypic diversity of this gene in population as indicated by the entropy plot (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003269-g006">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>). Apparently, the evolutionary rates of the heterodimer and date triangle loci are slower that that of the monomer throughout the evolutionary dynamics with or without chaperones. Finally, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003269.s001">Fig. <italic>S1</italic></xref> shows that the rate of synonymous substitutions is approximately the same for all protein types, as could be expected. However, we also see that the rate of synonymous substitutions is slightly faster with chaperones as compared to that of chaperone-free evolution. Such slightly faster evolution of synonymous substitutions might be due to hitchhiking of neutral mutations with beneficial ones that should more pronounced with chaperone evolution.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our ab intio cell model, while much simpler than real biological systems, captures the essence of biological complexity that stems from the fact that the main effects, epistatic effects, and pleiotropic effects on different parameters often act in antagonistic directions. The pleiotropic concept of optimization of antagonistic traits in evolutionary biology, which gives rise to a complex fitness landscape, has its analog in the concept of frustration in physics, where competing interactions lead to a complex energy landscape with many suboptimal minima equal to or close to global minimum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Campbell1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Sfatos1">[30]</xref>. In our model, the molecular traits, whose optimization might be antagonistic, include protein stability, abundances, functional, and NF-PPIs. An earlier study showed how antagonistic constraints result in a peculiar co-evolution of protein abundances and functional PPIs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Heo1">[7]</xref>. Here we introduced a new essential component of the cellular milieu – the chaperone activity, which enhances the conversion of proteins from the MG state to their native conformation. The chaperone action in our model partially relaxes an essential constraint on protein sequences to maintain high stability of proteins. The resulting chaperone buffering dramatically affects evolutionary dynamics by opening up sequence space, to provide a dramatic acceleration of the adaption process. We find that only the active chaperone model has a strong effect on evolutionary dynamics, while the passive chaperone model, where an MG protein is bound to the chaperone to prevent its sequestration to NF-PPIs has no effect on fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003269-g002">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). However, an important caveat here is that our model does not consider an irreversible aggregation and other elements of protein quality control such as proteolytic activity. Hence, the passive model might also be efficient when all the kinetic aspects of protein quality control are taken into account.</p>
<p>Mechanistically, our main finding is that the chaperones act pleiotropically to affect fitness in a number of ways. Firstly, the relaxation of the stability constraint allows achieving stronger functional PPIs at the expense of lower thermodynamic stability for the proteins participating in the functional PPIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003269-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Secondly, a more dramatic effect of the chaperone on cellular fitness stems from faster and greater decrease of the NF-PPIs in the course of the evolutionary dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003269-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). The NF-PPIs are a collective property of all proteins in the cellular milieu. There is evidence that proteins in their MG state are largely responsible for NF-PPIs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Booth1">[31]</xref>. The active chaperone in our model converts the proteins in their MG states into their folded conformations, leading to a drop in NF-PPIs with an ensuing increase in fitness due to a diminished sequestration of functional proteins.</p>
<p>Recent experimental and theoretical studies with the chaperonin GroEL corroborate some of our findings. Tokuriki and Tawfik performed a series of random mutagenesis experiments on a number of non-endogenous enzymes expressed in <italic>E. Coli</italic> to investigate the impact of overexpression of GroEL on enzyme evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Tokuriki1">[16]</xref>. They found that GroEL indeed helps folding of destabilized proteins and potentially facilitates the evolution of enzymes to gain new functions. The acceleration of adaptive evolution by GroEL is also found in a recent study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Bogumil1">[15]</xref> in which the evolutionary rates of GroEL clients and non-clients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Kerner1">[32]</xref> were compared. It was found that the GroEL obligatory proteins evolve 35% faster than the proteins that fold spontaneously without the GroEL assistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Bogumil1">[15]</xref>. The importance of GroEL for adaptive evolution is highlighted by the case of the endosymbiotic bacterium <italic>Buchnera</italic>, which often undergoes population bottlenecks through maternal transmission and thus quickly accumulates random mutations that destabilize proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Moran1">[33]</xref>. Remarkably, the expression level of GroEL in <italic>Buchnera</italic> is almost 8 times greater than that of <italic>E. coli</italic> under the normal conditions.</p>
<p>Quayle and Bullock define evolvability as the number of generations that it takes for a population to reach its phenotypic target that maximizes fitness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Quayle1">[34]</xref>. Our study highlights the dual role of chaperones not only as a catalyst of protein folding but also as a catalyst on the fitness landscape, which lowers the genetic “barriers” between phenotypes and thus promotes evolvability. A key prediction emerging from our analysis is that the catalytic activity of chaperone gives rise to a dramatic acceleration of adaptive evolution. Hence, we predict that the depletion of active chaperones through down-regulation of their expression should directly affect the rate at which organisms adapt to new environments, which can be directly experimentally testable.

<p>Our proteins consist of 27 amino acid residues that fold into 3×3×3 cubic lattice conformations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Shakhnovich1">[17]</xref>. We use the MJ potentials to model intra- and inter-molecular interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Miyazawa1">[27]</xref>. While the 27-mer lattice model has 103,346 maximally compact conformations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Shakhnovich1">[17]</xref>, we employ a uniform subset of randomly selected 10,000 conformations as our conformational ensemble to speed up calculations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Heo1">[7]</xref>. We calculate the Boltzmann probability of folding to a native state, i.e. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for each protein <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as follows<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003269.e087"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e087" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the energy of the native conformation and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e089" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the temperature in units corresponding to the calibration with MJ potentials.</p>
<p>We model the functional protein-protein and protein-chaperone interactions using a rigid docking scheme. The six faces of a cubic lattice provide six possible interaction surfaces and there are four rotational degrees of freedom to dock two interaction surfaces of two lattice proteins. Hence, in total, there exist 6×6×4 = 144 docking modes for a binary protein complex. The Boltzmann probability of interaction <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e090" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> between the dimer proteins <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> are calculated as<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003269.e091"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e091" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e092" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the interaction energy of the functional binding mode, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the interaction energies for 144 docking modes and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e094" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the temperature. Because 27-mers are quite small (as compared to real protein sizes), in order to represent both interior and interaction surface of proteins, we employed two different lattice conformations to model our proteins: one for interior part that determines stability and one for interaction surface that determines PPI, as has been done in previous studies, see e.g. Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Heo1">[7]</xref>. Hence, the lattice conformations that we used to represent protein surfaces in order to calculate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e095" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are randomly chosen conformations but they are not the same lattice conformation that we used to represent the stability energetics of native folds. This approach provides a less tight coupling between interior and exterior of proteins that would be the case for small 27-mers representing therefore a more realistic description of protein geometry and energetics.</p>

In order to calculate the quantities <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e172" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e173" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e174" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e175" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> we partitioned the overall simulation time into the time intervals of length 100 generations. Given the two DNA sequences, say, DNA-1 and DNA-2 that are 100 generations apart, we first count the number of synonymous <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e176" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and non-synonymous <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e177" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> substitutions between them, and second determine the number of synonymous <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e178" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and non-synonymous <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e179" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> sites at the frames in this time interval, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e180" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is non-degenerate, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e181" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is 2-fold and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e182" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 4-fold degenerate sites, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003269-Hartl1">[36]</xref>. By using the above quantities, we next calculate the cumulative sums <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e183" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e184" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, over all time intervals and the arithmetic averages <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e185" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e186" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and finally determine <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003269.e187" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula></p>
