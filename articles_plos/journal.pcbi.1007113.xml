<abstract>
<p>In order to further our understanding of how gene expression contributes to key functional properties of neurons, we combined publicly accessible gene expression, electrophysiology, and morphology measurements to identify cross-cell type correlations between these data modalities. Building on our previous work using a similar approach, we distinguished between correlations which were “class-driven,” meaning those that could be explained by differences between excitatory and inhibitory cell classes, and those that reflected graded phenotypic differences within classes. Taking cell class identity into account increased the degree to which our results replicated in an independent dataset as well as their correspondence with known modes of ion channel function based on the literature. We also found a smaller set of genes whose relationships to electrophysiological or morphological properties appear to be specific to either excitatory or inhibitory cell types. Next, using data from PatchSeq experiments, allowing simultaneous single-cell characterization of gene expression and electrophysiology, we found that some of the gene-property correlations observed across cell types were further predictive of within-cell type heterogeneity. In summary, we have identified a number of relationships between gene expression, electrophysiology, and morphology that provide testable hypotheses for future studies.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The behavior of neurons is governed by their electrical properties, for example how readily they respond to a stimulus or at what rate they are able to send signals. Additionally, neurons come in different shapes and sizes, and their shape defines how they can form connections with specific partners and thus function within the complete circuit. We know that these properties are governed by genes, acting acutely or during development, but we do not know which specific genes underlie many of these properties. Understanding how gene expression changes the properties of neurons will help in advancing our overall understanding of how neurons, and ultimately brains, function. This can in turn help to identify potential treatments for brain-related diseases. In this work, we aimed to identify genes whose expression showed a relationship with the electrical properties and shape measurements of different types of neurons. While our analysis does not identify causal relationships, our findings provide testable predictions for future research.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Two prominent features that distinguish neurons from other cells are their electrical activity and their characteristic morphology. The specific pattern of electrophysiological activity displayed by a given neuron is a core property of its identity as one type of neuron or another. Similarly, different cell types often show striking differences in their size, branching complexity, and other morphological features. Neuronal cell types defined according to their electrophysiological or morphological characteristics show substantial correspondence with one another as well as with those defined using classification schemes based on transcriptomic criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref001">1</xref>]. Electrophysiological characteristics of neurons, as well as their connectivity patterns, give rise to the computational properties of a given circuit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref003">3</xref>]. Additionally, modeling studies show that morphological changes in simulated neurons can critically change their signaling capabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref006">6</xref>]. Thus, understanding the origins of neuronal electrophysiology and morphology is an important step in understanding the mechanisms of brain function, both in the context of basic research and in the search for treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>
<p>A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that give rise to electrophysiological or morphological diversity must necessarily include a catalogue of the genes whose products contribute to these properties. Many genes have been shown experimentally to influence neuronal electrophysiology through a variety of mechanisms, including but not limited to ion channel activity, protein trafficking, and transcription factor activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref009">9</xref>]. Processes such as axon guidance and the development of dendrite morphology are also known to be under genetic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref010">10</xref>]. Despite this, our understanding of the relationship between gene expression and electrophysiological or morphological properties is quite limited.</p>
<p>Correlational approaches looking at the relationship between gene expression and neuronal properties in the absence of experimental manipulation can be a valuable method of prioritizing genes for future experimental study. For example, multiplex RT-PCR has been used to examine relationships between binary expression of a small group of genes and various electrophysiological parameters, allowing for reliable prediction of electrophysiological phenotypes based on combinatorial gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref011">11</xref>]. In addition, the recently developed PatchSeq methodology, in which electrophysiology, morphology, and gene expression are analyzed in a single cell, has been used to examine relationships between gene expression and morphological or electrophysiological properties. However these analyses have thus far been limited to either predicting neuronal properties based on combinatorial gene expression profiles, examining relationships between cell types, or showing relationships predicted <italic>a priori</italic> based on known gene function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>In previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref016">16</xref>], we combined publicly accessible electrophysiological and gene expression datasets in order to examine the relationship between gene expression and electrophysiological properties. By matching groups of cells inferred to be similar based on multiple information sources, such as the transgenic reporter line and the brain region cells were isolated from, we were able to combine separate datasets containing gene expression and electrophysiological data to generate lists of genes which were correlated with one of several electrophysiological properties (as outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The goal of this approach was to identify candidate genes that could be further studied using knockout or knockdown approaches in order to determine whether a causal relationship was present.</p>

<p>One caveat in our prior study is that the gene-electrophysiology correlations we identified may have been confounded by overall differences between broad cell classes. Across multiple datasets and cellular characterization methods, including gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref020">20</xref>], and electrophysiology and morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref001">1</xref>], clustering cellular phenotypes in an unbiased manner reveals the major taxonomic difference between neurons to be between projecting and non-projecting neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref018">18</xref>], or in the case of those cell types present in the cortex or hippocampus, excitatory and inhibitory neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref020">20</xref>]. Thus, the commonly held view that a neuron’s identity is first and foremost defined by its excitatory or inhibitory identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref021">21</xref>] is corroborated across multiple data sources and experimental modalities.</p>
<p>Therefore, we reasoned that the dataset we used previously was potentially susceptible to this confounding effect of cell class, since it contained a mixture of cells from different broad cell classes. In this work, we will use the term “cell type” to refer to narrowly-defined cell types, and “cell class” to refer to those which are broadly-defined (excitatory versus inhibitory or projecting versus non-projecting). We refer to correlations between gene expression and electrophysiological or morphological properties that are explained by differences between cell classes as “class-driven,” (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) and to those that exist based on graded differences within broad cell classes as “non-class-driven” (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). We reason that gene-property relationships that are non-class-driven would be more likely to be potential causal regulators of the associated property. Although some class-driven correlations likely do reflect true relationships between genes and properties which distinguish excitatory from inhibitory cells, separating these relationships from instances where one cell class has a higher value of a property and coincidentally higher or lower expression of a gene without additional sources of data is not possible. Effectively, such situations are analogous to attempting to draw conclusions about correlations with only two data points.</p>
<p>Due to limitations in available data, we were unable to address the effect of cell class in our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref016">16</xref>]. Since then, the RNA-seq and electrophysiology datasets from the Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS) (which we originally used as validation data) have expanded greatly, with more cells and more transgenic lines represented. This increase in size, together with the fact that the AIBS data were collected using standardized protocols, suggests that this dataset might prove valuable for discovering genes correlated with electrophysiological and morphological properties. In addition, the growing use of the PatchSeq methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref012">12</xref>], allowing transcriptomic, electrophysiological, and morphological characterization of the same single cell, also affords an opportunity to test gene-property correlations.</p>
<p>Leveraging the larger size of the new AIBS dataset, we were able to address limitations of our previous study related to excitatory versus inhibitory cell class by employing statistical methods to help mitigate the effects of cell class. These methods, together with the larger number of cell types represented in the new dataset, allowed us to identify novel electrophysiological and morphological property-related gene sets which are potentially more likely to represent meaningful biological relationships.</p>

<title>Primary dataset</title>
<p>The primary dataset we used combined groups of cells from mouse visual cortex characterized by the Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://celltypes.brain-map.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://celltypes.brain-map.org/</ext-link>), where multiple Cre-driver lines were used to target cells for characterization. Standard electrophysiological protocols were used to characterize cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, with a subset of these cells further undergoing detailed morphological characterization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref001">1</xref>]. In addition, a separate group of cells were subjected to deep single-cell RNA-sequencing to characterize cellular transcriptomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref020">20</xref>]. Because the same Cre-lines were used to characterize cells along multiple modalities of neuronal function, we were able to summarize these data to the “cell type” level (reflecting Cre-line, cortical layer, and major neurotransmitter; shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007113.s004">S1 Table</xref>) by pooling and combining cellular characterization data across different animals and data modalities. We acknowledge that the cell type classification used here is somewhat crude and that there is overlap between cell types as we have defined them, as well as variability within types, but chose to define cell types in this way because it allows us to combine data from the RNA-seq and electrophysiology/morphology datasets. The definition of multiple cell types within one Cre-line based on cortical layer and major neurotransmitter is supported by cross-layer differences in gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref020">20</xref>] and in electrophysiological properties (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007113.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The final combined dataset is composed of 34 inhibitory GABAergic and 14 excitatory glutamatergic types (48 total) with electrophysiological data, and 30 inhibitory and 13 excitatory types (43 total) with morphological data. The increased size of this dataset is a considerable advance over our prior analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref016">16</xref>], which employed an older version of the same dataset (only 12 cell types) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref019">19</xref>]. This was made possible in part because of more Cre-lines available for analysis and finer cortical layer dissections for the transcriptomic data. For each cell type thus defined, we computed the mean log expression value for each gene represented in the RNA-seq dataset and the mean value of each of sixteen electrophysiological and six morphological properties (described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007113.s005">S2 Table</xref>). Some of the electrophysiological and morphological properties were log-transformed prior to taking the mean (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec016">Methods</xref>). In order to account for the existence of correlations among properties, we additionally performed principal component analysis (PCA) on either the electrophysiological or the morphological properties, and assessed the correspondence of each of the resulting principal components (E_PC1-E_PC3 and M_PC1-M_PC3) to gene expression.</p>

<sec id="sec004">
<title>Analysis approach</title>
<p>Our goal was to identify, for each electrophysiological or morphological property, genes that were correlated with the property (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). However, overall differences between excitatory and inhibitory cell classes can make the interpretation of such relationships more complicated in several ways. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g001">Fig 1B</xref> shows an example of a gene-property correlation that appears almost entirely <bold>class-driven</bold>, meaning that although no relationship appears <italic>within</italic> either cell class, the apparent relationship is entirely driven by differences <italic>between</italic> cell classes. In this case, inhibitory cell types show higher expression of the gene and a greater value of the property compared to excitatory cell types. In contrast, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g001">Fig 1C</xref> shows a <bold>non-class-driven</bold> relationship, meaning one that manifests in both cell classes, but which may be obscured by baseline differences when the cell classes are grouped. In this example, a correlation that appears within both classes independently is obscured by a higher value of the property in inhibitory compared to excitatory cell types. Although this obscuring effect is present in this particular example, it is not required for a relationship to be considered non-class-driven; we expected to see some relationships that were consistent both within each class as well as among all cell types. Both class-driven correlations and non-class-driven correlations that are obscured by the effects of class can be viewed as instances of Simpson’s paradox, in which the direction of an overall relationship is the opposite of the relationship within relevant subsets of the data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref023">23</xref>]. We hypothesized that non-class-driven, but not class-driven, relationships would be consistent with those relationships existing across individual cells within a cell type (small points, representing individual cells within a type, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g001">Fig 1B–1D</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to computationally account for these possibilities, we evaluated each combination of gene and property using a statistical model that assesses the predictive value of the gene on the property while controlling for the effects of cell class. We termed this model the <bold>class-conditional model</bold> (P~G+C, where P is the value of the property, G is the gene expression level, and C is cell class). This model would be expected to identify a significant relationship between the gene and the property when a non-class-driven relationship is present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), but would not identify relationships that are class-driven (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The class-conditional model is by no means the only method that could be used to control for the effects of cell class, and other methods such as subsetting the dataset to look at only one class at a time would likely produce useful results as well. We chose to use the class-conditional approach because it allowed us to use the data from both excitatory and inhibitory cell types, whereas subsetting the dataset to include only one class would have led to our throwing out data from many relevant cell types. For comparison, we modeled the same gene-property pairs using a <bold>class-independent model</bold> (P~G), which assesses the predictive value of the gene on the property irrespective of cell class. This model is similar in principle to the correlational method used in our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref016">16</xref>] and would be expected to produce a significant result in cases showing class-driven relationships (such as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) but might miss some instances of non-class-driven relationships (such as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>Another possible gene-property relationship is one where there is an interaction between gene and class, meaning that the gene-property relationship is different in excitatory and inhibitory cell types. An interaction could indicate either that excitatory and inhibitory cell types both show a correlation between the gene and property, but the slopes are in opposite directions (as in the example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), or that the gene is correlated with the property only in one cell class. To detect such situations, we introduced a third model, the <bold>interaction model</bold> (P~G+C+G*C), which tested whether the relationship between gene expression and the property in question was significantly different between excitatory and inhibitory cell types. In summary, the three models are designed to answer three different questions:</p>
<p>Class-independent model: Is expression of the gene a significant predictor of the property if we assume that cell class is not a factor?</p>
<p>Class-conditional model: After accounting for cell class, is the gene’s expression a significant predictor of the property?</p>
<p>Interaction model: Is the relationship between the gene’s expression and the property statistically different in inhibitory and excitatory cells?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec005">
<title>Accounting for cell class results in the identification of a distinct but overlapping set of genes</title>
<p>We first set out to understand how accounting for cell class identity (excitatory or inhibitory) affects the interpretation of gene-property relationships. We found 12,225 genes with expression levels passing our basic filtering criteria (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec016">Methods</xref> for details on how expression-level filtering was performed) and assessed each gene in combination with each electrophysiological or morphological property. We modeled each relationship with or without including an indicator variable for cell class, using the class-conditional or class-independent models described above. For most properties, we found that the degree of overlap between the sets of genes identified in the two models (at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1) was substantial but far from a complete intersection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, Venn diagrams, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007113.s005">S2 Table</xref>). For example, for after-hyperpolarization (AHP) amplitude, we found ~6000 significantly-associated genes in the class-independent model and ~6500 in the class-conditional model; out of these, ~3700 genes were shared between models. Thus, accounting for cell class results in the identification of a substantially different set of candidate genes, which suggests that many of the genes identified in our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref016">16</xref>] might reflect class-driven gene-property relationships.</p>

<p>We found that most of the electrophysiological properties showed some degree of correlation with E_PC1, as well as varying degrees of overlap with the genes showing a significant result in the class-conditional model, whereas E_PC2 showed substantial overlap with only sag and AP threshold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007113.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>). The morphological properties showed poorer overlap with the principal components, likely because M_PC1 and M_PC2 were primarily correlated with properties for which no significant genes were identified in the class-conditional model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007113.s002">S2D and S2E Fig</xref>). For both sets of features, excitatory and inhibitory cell types were fairly well separated by the combination of PC1 and PC2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007113.s002">S2C and S2F Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We next asked how overall differences in morphological and electrophysiological properties between excitatory and inhibitory cells affect gene-property relationships. To this end, we used a linear model to estimate the effect of cell class on each property. For most properties, there was a significant (p &lt; 0.05) effect of cell class. The features of action potential (AP) threshold, input resistance, sag, rheobase, branchiness, soma surface, and bifurcation angle, as well as E_PC3, M_PC2, and M_PC3, are exceptions to this. The existence of a significant difference in most properties between excitatory and inhibitory cell types highlights the importance of taking cell class into account when attempting to relate these properties to gene expression. The properties without a significant difference are likely to be less susceptible to class-driven effects, but the class-independent model still might miss potentially interesting relationships due to differences in gene expression between classes, resulting in genes which are identified by the class-conditional model only.</p>
<p>We compared the strength and direction of the relationship in both the class-independent and class-conditional models by directly comparing the slopes derived from each model for each gene-property relationship (where slope indicates the change in the property per 2-fold change in gene expression; shown for AHP amplitude in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). While there is broad agreement between the class-independent and class-conditional models (r<sub>Spearman</sub> = 0.52), a substantial number of gene-property relationships are significant in one model but not the other (at FDR = 0.1). In other words, these relationships are either class-driven (significant in the class-independent model only) or non-class-driven and obscured by class (significant in the class-conditional model only). For example, the relationship between the gene <italic>Gprasp1</italic> and AHP amplitude illustrates an example of a class-driven relationship where the apparent relationship is entirely due to broad differences in excitatory and inhibitory classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). The gene <italic>Camk2g</italic> shows a non-class-driven relationship with the same property that is obscured in the class-independent model by higher AHP amplitude values in inhibitory cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). However, many genes, such as <italic>Xxylt1</italic>, are identified using either model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g002">Fig 2E</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec006">
<title>Divergent gene-property relationships in inhibitory versus excitatory cell classes</title>
<p>We next wondered whether some gene-property relationships might be potentially different within, or specific to, excitatory or inhibitory cell types. To test this, we incorporated an interaction term between gene expression and excitatory versus inhibitory cell class to assess whether the gene-property relationships (i.e. slopes) were different within each cell class. For nearly all properties, there were fewer genes with a significant interaction term in the interaction model compared to the number with a significant gene term in the class-conditional model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, Venn diagrams, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007113.s006">S3 Table</xref>). For example, out of the ~6600 genes significantly associated with AHP amplitude in the class-conditional model, ~2300 also show interactions, and there are an additional ~700 which show an interaction but are not significant in the class-conditional model. This could indicate that “true” interactions are comparatively rare, but this finding is also likely partly explained by differences in statistical power. In addition, these interactions do not appear to be merely the result of low or no gene expression within one cell class but not the other; we did not observe strong correlations for any property between the interaction term coefficient and the average difference in expression levels between inhibitory and excitatory cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007113.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>For all properties, we found that the slopes of the gene-property relationships within excitatory cell types were poorly correlated with those within inhibitory cell types (example features maximum branch order and AHP amplitude shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>). By definition, the genes with significant interaction terms were those where the slopes calculated within excitatory and inhibitory classes were very different from each other (pink and purple points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>). If the majority of gene-property relationships are shared between excitatory and inhibitory cell types, as one might expect if neuronal properties are regulated using largely consistent mechanisms even across cell classes, one might expect a positive correlation between slopes calculated in inhibitory and excitatory cell types. However, such a correlation may be lacking in this analysis because we would expect most genes to have no relationship to a given property and thus for the deviations of their slopes from zero to be essentially random.</p>
<p>The properties maximum branch order and sag are unusual in that they show few significant genes using the class-conditional model, but many (1914 and 1109, respectively) with significant interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, Venn diagrams, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007113.s006">S3 Table</xref>; slopes for maximum branch order plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). We hypothesize that this might be because these properties are under stronger (or otherwise more readily identified) genetic control in excitatory compared to inhibitory cell types, together with the uneven numbers of excitatory and inhibitory cell types (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec012">Discussion</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref> show examples of genes with significant interaction terms for AHP amplitude.

In other words, the interaction model identified a potentially interesting relationship in the case of <italic>Nrxn3</italic> which was missed by the class-conditional model. For <italic>Man1c1</italic>, the interaction model does not reveal a new relationship, but instead highlights the fact that this gene-property relationship, if real, is potentially more complicated than would be assumed based on the class-conditional model alone. <italic>Man1c1</italic> is an enzyme involved in the maturation of N-linked oligosaccharides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref024">24</xref>], and is thus a plausible regulator of AHP amplitude, since N-linked glycosylation of voltage-gated potassium channels or their auxiliary subunits is known to regulate both surface trafficking and channel function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref026">26</xref>]. The apparent class-specificity of this relationship could result from class-specific co-expression of certain potassium channels or other enzymes involved in glycan synthesis or maturation.</p>

<title>Results from the class-conditional model are more likely to validate using independent methods</title>
<p>We next asked how the gene-property relationships from the class-independent and class-conditional models, based on our analysis of the AIBS cortical cell types dataset, might generalize to other datasets. We first compared the results reported here to those from our earlier NeuroElectro/NeuroExpresso (NE) literature-based dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref016">16</xref>], after subsetting these data to include only non-projecting cell types (reflecting 19 cell types in total sampled throughout the brain, described in detail in the Methods). We chose to use non-projecting cell types in the NE dataset, as these were recently described by a mouse brain-wide transcriptomic survey as corresponding to a single broad cell class [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref018">18</xref>]. To this end, we used the same linear model-based approach as in the AIBS dataset to assess the relationships between between genes and electrophysiological properties in the NE dataset. This approach was identical to the class-independent model, except that the dataset contained only one cell class. Next, for gene-property relationships from both the class-independent and class-conditional models, we assessed their aggregate consistency with those from the NE dataset. Here, we defined “consistency” for a given model (i.e. class-independent or class-conditional) and property as the Spearman correlation between gene-property slopes calculated from the AIBS dataset with the slopes for the same set of gene-property relationships in the NE dataset (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g004">Fig 4B</xref>).</p>

For only one feature, membrane time constant (tau), was the class-independent model more consistent (p &lt; 0.05) than the class-conditional with the NE dataset. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g004">Fig 4B</xref> shows an example of how consistency was measured for AP half-width.

<title>Assessing within-cell type correlations using PatchSeq datasets</title>
<p>We next wondered whether these between-cell type gene-property relationships might be predictive of cell-to-cell heterogeneity within a given cell type. We reasoned that the recently developed PatchSeq methodology, allowing morphological, electrophysiological, and transcriptomic characterization from the same single cell, presents a unique opportunity to test this possibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref012">12</xref>]. While these data at present are limited by relatively modest sample sizes and technical factors such as inefficient mRNA capture and potential off-target cellular mRNA contamination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref027">27</xref>], we nonetheless sought to use these data to assess the nature of within-cell type gene-property relationships.</p>
<p>To this end, we performed an integrated analysis of 5 PatchSeq datasets, with each dataset characterizing transcriptomic and electrophysiological diversity of mouse forebrain inhibitory cells from the neocortex, hippocampus, and striatum (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1007113.t001">Table 1</xref>). We chose to focus on inhibitory neurons here as these were present in each of the PatchSeq datasets. Our analysis includes one novel dataset of 19 Pvalb-Cre positive interneurons recorded in region CA1 of the mouse hippocampus, reported here for the first time. Cells in this dataset (referred to as the Bengtsson Gonzales dataset), were characterized as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref015">15</xref>].</p>

<p>To jointly analyze these PatchSeq datasets, we first mapped PatchSeq sampled cells to the subclass level (i.e., major cell type level; e.g., Pvalb, Sst, Vip; defined in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007113.s007">S4 Table</xref>) as defined by as defined by cellular dissociation-based single-cell RNAseq reference atlases from the cortex and striatum (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec016">Methods</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref020">20</xref>]. Next, for each major cell type, we identified genes that are highly variable in their expression levels <italic>within</italic> cells of the same type. We reasoned that these highly-variable genes might be those most likely to drive or appear correlated with electrophysiological heterogeneity within each cell type. Lastly, we performed a joint analysis across PatchSeq datasets to assess the strength of gene-property relationships within cell types where the gene was highly variable. Here, we used a mixed-effects regression model, with gene expression as a fixed effect and dataset and cell type as random effects and with cells weighted by their estimated transcriptome quality (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec016">Methods</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the limitations of the PatchSeq data, we found a small number of genes whose expression levels were significantly associated with cell-to-cell electrophysiological heterogeneity within cell types (FDR = 0.1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). For example, we found that expression of <italic>Kcna1</italic>, which encodes the potassium channel Kv1.1, was inversely correlated with AP half-width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g005">Fig 5B</xref>; Beta<sub>PatchSeq</sub> = -0.0484 ± 0.0106, q<sub>PatchSeq</sub> = 0.0683) within hippocampal <italic>Pvalb</italic> and striatum <italic>Pthlh</italic> cells (the only cell types in which the variability in <italic>Kcna1</italic> expression met our threshold for analysis). Importantly, there was also a significant relationship with the same directionality for <italic>Kcna1</italic> and AP half-width in the AIBS dataset (Beta<sub>class-conditional</sub> = -0.048 ± 0.011, q<sub>class-conditional</sub> = 0.001). Moreover, the relationship between <italic>Kcna1</italic>/Kv1.1 expression and action potential width has been experimentally reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref028">28</xref>].</p>

<p>As another example, we saw an inverse correlation between <italic>Fxyd6</italic> expression and AHP amplitude, based on cortical Lamp5- and striatum Th- cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, Beta<sub>PatchSeq</sub> = -0.695 ± 0.118, q<sub>PatchSeq</sub> = 0.00841). We also saw a similar relationship in the AIBS dataset (Beta<sub>class-conditional</sub> = -0.021 ± 0.003, q<sub>class-conditional</sub> = 0.00001). Intriguingly, <italic>Fxyd6</italic> encodes phosphohippolin, a regulator of Na+/K+ ATPase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref029">29</xref>] and is thus plausibly involved in the AHP and action potential repolarization. Intriguingly, in a separate single-cell RNA-seq study of CA1 interneurons, <italic>Fxyd6</italic> was found to be more highly expressed cells known to spike more slowly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>In general, we found that when a gene-property relationship was statistically significant in both the PatchSeq and AIBS class-conditional analyses (at FDR = 0.1), this relationship was usually in the same direction in both analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g005">Fig 5A</xref>; 10 out of 13 gene-property relationships total). Results were similar in the class-independent model, except with a smaller set of gene/ephys relationships matching between both (7 out of 9 relationships were in a consistent direction). All of the genes which were consistent between the class-independent and PatchSeq analyses were also consistent in the class-conditional model. While our analyses of these PatchSeq datasets should be considered preliminary (pending the availability of larger and higher-quality datasets), we find the correspondence with our earlier analysis encouraging. Namely, this analysis suggests that some of the same genes that appear to drive large differences across cortical cell types might also be defining more subtle within-cell type heterogeneity.</p>

<title>The expected relationship between voltage-gated potassium channels and AHP amplitude is apparent only after accounting for cell class</title>
<p>We next asked whether we see a relationship between an electrophysiological feature and a category of genes which are known regulators of that feature. Voltage-gated potassium channels are known to be involved in producing the after-hyperpolarization following an action potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref034">34</xref>] (AHP amplitude; illustrated by the dashed arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). We thus hypothesized that for many of these genes, higher expression levels would be associated with larger AHP amplitudes (although not all voltage-gated potassium channels necessarily contribute directly to AHP amplitude). We further hypothesized that this relationship would be more apparent after accounting for cell class, in part because AHP amplitudes differ considerably between excitatory and inhibitory cell classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g006">Fig 6B–6D</xref>). Indeed, our previous work found a spurious negative correlation between expression of the <italic>Kcnb1</italic> gene and AHP amplitude which resulted from higher expression of Kcnb1 in excitatory cell types compared to others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref016">16</xref>].</p>

Thus the results obtained using the class-conditional model are consistent with our <italic>a priori</italic> hypothesis that expression levels of voltage-gated potassium channel genes are more likely to show positive than negative relationships with AHP amplitude, whereas the results obtained using the class-independent approach do not appear to support this conclusion.</p>

<p>Expression of <italic>Scn1b</italic>, a voltage-gated sodium channel subunit, shows a negative relationship with action potential half-width in the class-conditional model (q = 0.0008; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g007">Fig 7B</xref>), and is also related to a number of other properties including E_PC1 and E_PC2. This relationship is obscured in the class-independent model due to overall longer half-widths in excitatory cell types. Consistent with the idea that <italic>Scn1b</italic> might function to shorten AP half-widths, layer 5 cortical pyramidal neurons from mice lacking the <italic>Scn1b</italic> gene show longer half-widths than controls, due to changes in protein stability of voltage-gated potassium channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref036">36</xref>].</p>
<p>Interestingly, the <italic>Lrrk2</italic> gene, mutations in which contribute to Parkinson’s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref037">37</xref>], is positively correlated with neurite branchiness (number of branch points per μm) in the class-conditional model, but not the class-independent model (q = 0.049; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). <italic>Lrrk2</italic> has been shown by several studies to regulate neurite outgrowth and branching in cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref038">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref041">41</xref>].</p>
<p>We do find some examples in which the reported direction of a gene-property relationship in the literature is inconsistent with the direction predicted based on our class-conditional model. For example, we found a positive correlation between expression of the potassium channel subunit gene <italic>Kcnab2</italic> and maximum firing frequency (q = 1.8 * 10<sup>−5</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). In contrast to this, mice with a knockout of the same gene exhibit hyperexcitability in neurons of the amygdala [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref042">42</xref>]. This discrepancy could reflect a role of <italic>Kcnab2</italic> in limiting spiking within fast-spiking cells. In other words, perhaps certain cell types express high levels of <italic>Kcnab2</italic> because they are fast-spiking, rather than the other way around. Since our analysis is by definition correlational, we are unable to distinguish the direction of causation, if any, between gene expression and neuronal properties.</p>
<p>Not only do the genes discussed here provide important validation for our method, but the existence of a smooth correlation between these genes and their associated properties is potentially interesting. The previous studies cited above provide causal evidence for gene-property relationships via gain- and loss-of-function approaches, which are likely more reminiscent of pathological states than of natural variability between cell types. Our results suggest that these genes could additionally play an instructive role in setting the precise levels of electrophysiological or morphological properties between cell types under normal physiological conditions. In addition, since morphological features are in part established due to developmental gene expression patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref043">43</xref>], such features may show poor correlations with mRNA sampled from adult cells. Of course, the correspondence between the causal effects of gene expression as measured by loss-of-function studies may not always correspond neatly to the correlational relationship observed between naturally-occurring cell types, as illustrated above for <italic>Kcnab2</italic>.</p>

<p>One notable feature from this analysis is that many of these genes, like <italic>Kcna1</italic> and <italic>Scn1b</italic> discussed above, are significantly associated with several or many different properties. For example, maximum firing frequency, input-output curve slope, and average interspike interval show a similar pattern in the strength of their association with this set of genes. These features all measure similar aspects of neuronal function (broadly speaking, whether a neuron tends to fire rapidly or not), so it would be surprising if they did not show correlations with the same genes. Two more properties that closely share associated genes are AP half-width and AHP amplitude, which measure distinct aspects of the action potential waveform, but might share genetic underpinnings related to rapid channel opening and closing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref044">44</xref>]. The genes most strongly associated with various electrophysiological properties tend not to show significant associations with the morphological properties of branchiness and max branch order. However, some of the genes associated with these morphological properties do show some (generally weak) associations with some electrophysiological properties (for example <italic>Mgat5</italic> and <italic>Ifitm10</italic>).</p>
<p>Several of the genes for which we were unable to find conclusive loss-of-function studies in the current literature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g007">Fig 7F–7I</xref>) seem particularly intriguing, given what is known about their cellular function. In the discussion, we briefly speculate about how these genes might function as regulators of the properties with which they are associated in our analysis. However, further study will be needed to determine what role, if any, these genes play in regulating electrophysiological or morphological properties.</p>

<sec id="sec012" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work we presented a series of correlations between gene expression and electrophysiological or morphological properties, each representing a testable hypothesis for future studies. Our key insight here is to introduce cell class (i.e., excitatory and inhibitory cell type identity) as an indicator variable when modeling the relationship between genes and properties. This has the advantage of 1) avoiding the identification of class-driven correlations, 2) helping identify a subset of non-class-driven correlations that might have been obscured by overall differences between excitatory and inhibitory cell types, and 3) revealing instances where gene-property relationships might be different for excitatory versus inhibitory cell types.</p>
<p>Although the idea that non-class-driven correlations would have a higher chance of reflecting a meaningful relationship between a specific gene and property compared to class-driven ones seems straightforward, we evaluated this prediction through a number of specific empirical tests. First, we found better correspondence between gene-property relationships from the class-conditional model with those derived from the non-projecting cell type subset of our prior NeuroExpresso/NeuroElectro dataset. Second, we observed consistency between the class-conditional model and gene-property relationships derived from five independently-collected PatchSeq datasets, suggesting that the relationships described here might be predictive of gene-property relationships within narrowly-defined cell types, consistent with the hypothesis presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g001">Fig 1B–1D</xref>. Third, our analysis of the relationship between action potential after-hyperpolarization (AHP) amplitude and voltage-gated potassium channel genes suggests that genes and electrophysiological features showing a significant result in the class-conditional model are more likely to reflect known functions of those genes.</p>
<p>The PatchSeq and voltage-gated potassium channel analyses highlighted distinct advantages of the class-conditional model. The class-conditional model revealed higher overlap between the PatchSeq and AIBS datasets, compared to the class-independent model, where most shared relationships (for both models) were in a consistent direction. This indicates that the class-conditional model might be more sensitive to certain relationships, and our analysis of the PatchSeq datasets argues in favor of the biological relevance of these same relationships. In contrast, the main advantage of the class-conditional model in the voltage-gated potassium channel analysis was primarily to avoid class-driven correlations. In other words, the class-conditional model exhibits increased specificity, an important factor when considering that these results might be used to help prioritize genes for experimental study.</p>
<p>In this work, we have operationalized the concepts of class-driven and non-class-driven correlations as those which produce a significant result in the class-independent model only or in the class-conditional model, respectively. This is a simplification, since both effects can exist simultaneously to differing degrees (for example, <italic>Daam1</italic> and AP half-width, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g007">Fig 7I</xref>) and our ability to distinguish them with confidence is limited by the number and composition of cell types in the dataset. It should be emphasized that, since these categories are defined based on significance thresholds, the distinction between, for example, a non-class-driven relationship which is obscured by class and one which is significant in either model is not meaningful in a statistical sense and should not be interpreted as being directly informative about the underlying biology. Bearing this in mind, the distinction may be useful in practice for prioritizing genes for further examination. Thus, we have shown that thresholding the set of all genes based on one model or the other results in the identification of a distinct but overlapping set of genes, meaning that the choice of model is consequential.</p>
<p>A novel feature of our analysis is the investigation of gene-property relationships that are divergent within excitatory and inhibitory cell types. Using the interaction model, we found a small subset of genes showing significant associations in the class-conditional model that also have a significant interaction term, indicating that their relationship with the property in question is dependent on cell class. We also found another small set of gene-property relationships that have a significant term in the interaction but not the class-conditional model. In contrast to all other properties analyzed, for the properties sag and maximum branch order, the interaction model identified many more genes compared to the class-conditional model. One possible explanation is that for both of these features, the absolute slopes in excitatory cells tend to be higher than those in inhibitory cells (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g003">Fig 3B</xref> for maximum branch order), suggesting either that these features might be under stronger genetic control in excitatory types compared to inhibitory, or that the genes associated with them in excitatory cell types are more readily identified by our analysis. Since this dataset contains more inhibitory than excitatory types, an inhibitory-specific relationship may be identified in the class-conditional model by virtue of the number of cell types, but an excitatory-specific relationship would likely be “diluted” by the larger number of inhibitory cell types not showing the relationship. It is also possible that, in the case of maximum branch order, this effect is partially explained by methodological differences in the dataset, since inhibitory but not excitatory morphological reconstructions contain axons in addition to dendrites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref001">1</xref>].</p>

<title>Novel putative gene/electrophysiology relationships</title>
<p>Our primary motivation for comparing gene expression to neuronal properties is to identify candidate genes that might influence those properties. While directly testing the functional relevance of specific gene-property predictions is beyond the scope of this work, we have highlighted below some of our potentially novel findings that might be of greatest interest for further follow up.</p>
<p><italic>Rab33a</italic> expression is positively correlated in the AIBS dataset with AHP amplitude with a significant interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g007">Fig 7F</xref>), and also shows significant positive correlations with E_PC1, input-output curve slope, maximum firing frequency, and rheobase, and significant negative correlations with AP half-width and average interstimulus interval (ISI). <italic>Rab33a</italic> is a small GTPase thought to be involved in regulation of vesicle trafficking, likely at stages prior to plasma membrane docking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref046">46</xref>]. One hypothesis for how <italic>Rab33a</italic> could regulate AHP amplitude and/or AP half-width is that <italic>Rab33a</italic> might facilitate the transport and/or insertion of vesicles containing voltage-gated potassium channels, or regulators thereof, into the axonal membrane, leading to narrower action potentials and larger AHPs. Our analysis of the AIBS data suggests that any effects of <italic>Rab33a</italic> expression on AHP amplitude would be present only in inhibitory cell types.</p>
<p><italic>Med23</italic> (also known as <italic>Crsp3</italic>), a subunit of the mediator complex which acts as a transcriptional co-activator for RNA polymerase II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref048">48</xref>], shows a positive correlation with AHP amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g007">Fig 7G</xref>). Although the complete set of roles played by <italic>Med23</italic> are incompletely understood, it has been shown to modulate signaling by the BMP, Ras/ELK1, and RhoA/MAL pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref050">50</xref>]. Thus it has the potential to regulate a variety of genes, including potentially voltage-gated potassium channels or interacting proteins thereof. Given <italic>Med23</italic>’s role in regulating transcription through a variety of signaling pathways, it is notable that our analysis showed only one feature with which it was convincingly associated. It is also interesting to note that mutations in <italic>Med23</italic> have previously been associated with intellectual disability, in some cases with a predisposition to seizures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref052">52</xref>].</p>
<p>Expression of <italic>Nphp4</italic> encoding the cytoskeletal-associated protein nephrocystin-4 was negatively correlated with AP half-width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g007">Fig 7H</xref>) as well as with resting membrane potential and maximum firing frequency. Although <italic>Nphp4</italic> is primarily understood for its function in the kidney, <italic>Nphp4</italic> mutations often cause co-morbid deficits in the nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref053">53</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>Nphp4</italic> has been shown to regulate actin networks via its interaction with the polarity protein <italic>Inturned</italic> and with the formin <italic>Daam1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref054">54</xref>]. <italic>Daam1</italic> is also negatively correlated with AP half-width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g007">Fig 7I</xref>), and not significantly correlated with any other features. The actin network in the axon forms a highly regular lattice structure which includes regularly interspersed voltage-gated sodium channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref055">55</xref>]. A similar relationship between the actin network and other voltage-gated ion channels has not been tested, but seems plausible. A potential mechanism through which <italic>Nphp4</italic> and <italic>Daam1</italic> could regulate the shape of the action potential might involve the organization of the axonal actin network structure, which might change the local levels or relative positioning of voltage-gated ion channels, especially potassium channels, or their regulators.</p>

<title>Limitations and caveats</title>
<p>We note that the gene-property relationships reported here are by definition correlational. Demonstrating that any specific gene is involved in regulation of any electrophysiological or morphological property is beyond the scope of this work. Our goal in this study was to generate testable hypotheses which, together with the current body of published literature, will help guide future experiments. We expect that this list of putative relationships contains some proportion of causal genes, and based on our analyses expect that this proportion may be higher than that in our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref016">16</xref>], However, causality can only be determined for a given gene and property using direct experimental methods.</p>
<p>Additionally, as in our prior work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref016">16</xref>], we have limited our analyses to models in which expression levels of a single gene predict downstream properties in an approximately linear fashion, and in which that gene is regulated primarily at the transcriptional level. Some instances of mechanisms involving interactions between multiple genes, or those involving a non-linear relationship between log-gene expression and an electrophysiological or morphological property, are likely to have been missed here. In addition, for mechanisms through which electrophysiological or morphological properties are controlled at the translational or post-translational level, our analysis is unlikely to provide insight into the gene whose product directly controls the property. However, this analysis has the power to identify transcripts whose products are involved in the translation, modification, or trafficking of proteins which in turn regulate electrophysiology or morphology.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the generalizability of the gene-property relationships reported here might be limited by the fact that the AIBS dataset only reflects cells sampled from the adult mouse primary visual cortex. Therefore, the relevance of our results to other brain regions depends on the assumption that many of the same genes regulate electrophysiological or morphological properties in different cell types. This assumption of generalizability across brain areas appears to be appropriate in the case of <italic>Kcna1</italic> and maximum firing frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g007">Fig 7A</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref007">7</xref>]). Additionally, this assumption is supported by our comparisons with the NeuroExpresso/NeuroElectro dataset and PatchSeq datasets, both of which contain cells sampled from other brain regions. However, some relationships may not generalize across brain regions due to differences in expression of other genes or the presence of post-translational modifications which modify the consequences of expressing a given gene.</p>
<p>An additional caveat in the interpretation of our analysis is the likely existence of what we might call “subclass-driven” relationships. In the same way that differences between excitatory and inhibitory cell types can drive apparent correlations, we might expect that differences between other categories, such as Sst and Pvalb interneurons, would have a similar effect. However, we expect this effect to be small relative to the effects of excitatory/inhibitory cell class (see Zeisel et al., 2018).</p>
<p>Another potential confounding factor in our reliance on the AIBS datasets is the uneven balance in the count of inhibitory versus excitatory cell types. The practical consequence of this is that the results from the class-conditional model are likely biased towards explaining gene-property relationships within inhibitory cell types, and might be missing relationships that are specific to excitatory cell types. Additionally, our validation of the class-conditional model using the NeuroExpresso/NeuroElectro and PatchSeq datasets was limited to interneurons for reasons of data availability. Even in the absence of a significant interaction term, gene-property relationships may have stronger evidence in one cell class than the other. An example of this is <italic>Lrrk2</italic> and branchiness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007113.g007">Fig 7C</xref>), where despite very similar slopes between classes and no statistical evidence of an interaction, the correlation among excitatory cells is much tighter than that among inhibitory cells. For this reason, when prioritizing genes for future study, we strongly recommend making a plot of gene, property, and cell class before concluding that the overall result is likely to apply to both classes.</p>

<title>Future directions</title>
<p>The primary goal of this project was to produce a list of genes which we can recommend for future study based on their correlations with electrophysiological and morphological properties in the AIBS dataset. We believe that some of the genes we identified are promising candidates for future study.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the use of our results by others in prioritizing genes for investigation, we are providing a Jupyter Notebook file to facilitate exploration of the data (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/PavlidisLab/transcriptomic_correlates" xlink:type="simple">https://github.com/PavlidisLab/transcriptomic_correlates</ext-link>). We have endeavored to make this easy to use for researchers with little or no coding experience. The notebook runs using Binder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref056">56</xref>], which allows for interactive exploration of the data within the user’s web browser without the need for any software installation. We encourage those who are interested in a particular electrophysiological or morphological property, gene, or set of genes, to explore the data and to make their own judgements as to which genes are worth following through on experimentally and which measures should be prioritized for recording. Our recommendation is to use the gene list in conjunction with other sources of information about gene function, such as Gene Ontology annotations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref057">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref058">58</xref>] and previously published literature, in prioritizing genes for future study.</p>

<p>The RNA-seq dataset from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref020">20</xref>] was accessed via the Allen Institute for Brain Science’s Cell Types database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://celltypes.brain-map.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://celltypes.brain-map.org/</ext-link>) on June 19, 2018, and contains 15,413 cells isolated by microdissection and fluorescence-activated cell sorting from primary visual cortex of mice expressing tdTomato under the control of various Cre driver lines. Electrophysiological and morphological data were also accessed via the Allen Institute for Brain Science Cell Types database on June 21, 2018. The dataset includes electrophysiological recordings from 1920 cells, of which 1815 are reporter-positive, from the visual cortex of mice also expressing tdTomato driven by Cre, many of which are from the same lines represented in the RNA-seq dataset. A subset of these cells (509, of which 471 are reporter-positive) have morphological reconstruction data available. Cells in both the electrophysiology/morphology and RNA-seq datasets are annotated according to the cortical layer they reside in (for electrophysiology/morphology this is always a single layer, and for RNA-seq may be a single layer, subset of layers, or all layers), their Cre-line, and whether they express the reporter.</p>

<title>Electrophysiological and morphological measures</title>
<p>Electrophysiological data were downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://celltypes.brain-map.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://celltypes.brain-map.org/</ext-link> and summarized as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref016">16</xref>] except for the features response frequency versus stimulus intensity (input-output) curve slope, average interstimulus interval (ISI), and sag, which we did not use previously as they were not represented in the NE dataset. All three of these new features were pre-computed in the downloaded dataset. In order to include only sag values which could be meaningfully compared, any cells having a value of “vm-for-sag” (the membrane voltage at which sag values were measured) not between -90 and -110 mV, or having a resting membrane potential lower than -80 mV, were excluded from analyses of sag, but were used for analyses of other electrophysiological features. The morphological features “average_bifurcation_angle_local”, “max_branch_order”, “soma_surface”, “total_length”, and “total_volume” were pre-computed in the dataset. We defined “branchiness” according to the pre-computed feature “number_branches” divided by “total_length” as a measure of how often a given cell produces branches per unit of neurite length. For the features input resistance, tau, capacitance, rheobase, maximum firing frequency, AHP amplitude, adaptation ratio, input-output curve slope, latency, branchiness, max branch order, total length, and total volume, values were log10-transformed prior to use in order to mitigate underlying skew or non-normality in these data values. Scaling and principal component analysis (PCA) were performed using scikit-learn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref059">59</xref>] for both the electrophysiological and morphological property sets. The first four principal components for each set of properties were extracted, and the first three were used in downstream analyses.</p>

<title>Defining cell types</title>
<p>Cell types in the AIBS dataset were defined according to the Cre-line they were isolated from, whether they were excitatory or inhibitory, and in most cases either a single cortical layer or a range of layers. Where multiple layer dissections containing a sufficient number of cells were present for a Cre-line in the RNAseq data, we decided on whether and how to combine layers based on the following criteria: 1) producing the maximum number of cell types, 2) producing the most homogenous cell types possible, and 3) producing cell types containing sufficiently large numbers of cells in both the RNA-seq and electrophysiology or morphology datasets. The first two criteria favored splitting layers more finely, whereas the last favored combining layers. Only cell types where both datasets contained at least 6 cells (for the electrophysiology analysis) or at least 3 cells (for the morphology analysis) were included in the final analysis. Cell type definitions, along with the numbers of cells meeting the criteria for each type, are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007113.s004">S1 Table</xref>.</p>
<p>Splitting cells from certain Cre-lines into multiple types based on their layer location and their identity as excitatory or inhibitory allowed us to increase the number of types in our analysis. Splitting cell types in this way makes biological sense in that cells isolated from the same Cre-line but different layers often belong to different transcriptomically-defined cell types. For example, cells isolated from from the upper cortical layers of Sst-Cre mice primarily belong to the Sst Cbln4 type, whereas the majority of cells from lower layers belong to either the Sst Myh8 or Sst Th types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref019">19</xref>]. We have further justified this decision based on the fact that there are frequently electrophysiological differences between cells from the same Cre-line but from different layers (examples of three electrophysiological properties are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007113.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>After the two datasets were matched, the combined dataset contained 1359 cells belonging to 48 types with electrophysiological data, 369 cells belonging to 43 types with morphological data, and 4403 cells belonging to 50 types with RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007113.s004">S1 Table</xref>). The remaining cells in the original datasets were those whose types could not be matched, either because the Cre-line or layer they were isolated from was not sampled in the other datasets, or because the number of cells belonging to that type was below our threshold for the number of cells per type required.</p>

<title>Modeling the relationship between gene expression and electrophysiology/morphology</title>
<p>Mean expression values for each gene and mean values for each electrophysiological or morphological property were calculated for each cell type as defined above. Only genes which were expressed at a level of 1 CPM or higher in at least ten cell types were included. Out of all genes represented in the RNA-seq dataset, ~26% passed this thresholding step. For the remaining genes, and for each electrophysiological or morphological property, we fit one or more linear models relating the property (P) to expression of the gene (G) and/or cell class (C). Model 1 (P~G; “class-independent model”) attempted to explain the property based on only expression of the gene. For genes which were expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory types, we fit three additional models. Model 2 (P~C) related property to cell class, model 3 related the electrophysiological parameter to the gene and cell class (P~G+C; “class-conditional model”), and model 4 related the electrophysiological parameter to gene, cell class, and an interaction term between gene and cell class (P~G+C+G*C; “interaction model”). Models 2 and 3, as well as models 3 and 4, were compared to one another using an ANOVA in order to determine p-values for the class-conditional relationship between gene and property and for the gene-class interaction, respectively. Additionally, we ran a version of model 1 in which we only considered inhibitory cell types, as an alternative method of accounting for cross-class differences. Beta coefficients from models 1, 3, and 4 (separately for each cell type) were recorded, as well as p-values from model 1 and from both ANOVAs. Prior to filtering for significantly-correlated genes, false discovery rate (FDR) correction was performed using the Python package statsmodels.stats.multitest.fdrcorrection, which calculates the FDR-adjusted p-value (q-value) based on the Benjamini-Hochberg method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref060">60</xref>] using the formula q = p * (i/m), followed by taking the cumulative minimum starting from the highest p-value, where p is the uncorrected p-value, i is the rank of that p-value (the most significant having a rank of 1), and m is the number of comparisons. Model 2 was also used directly to test for significant differences between cell classes in the value of each property.</p>

<title>Non-projecting class-specific correlations in the NeuroElectro/NeuroExpresso dataset</title>
<p>The NeuroElectro and NeuroExpresso datasets were described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref061">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref063">63</xref>]. In order to limit the dataset to only non-projecting cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref018">18</xref>], we chose cells whose major type was annotated as anything other than “Pyramidal,” “Glutamatergic,” or “MSN”. Cells of the types “Ctx Htr3a” and “Ctx Oxtr” were excluded due to their lower transcriptomic quality compared to others in the dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref063">63</xref>]. After subsetting, 19 cell types remained. Average values were calculated for gene expression and electrophysiological properties across cells within a type, and linear models relating the property to expression of the gene were calculated for each combination of gene and electrophysiological property.</p>
<p>In order to assess cross-dataset consistency, we calculated a Spearman correlation between the beta coefficients (slopes) calculated based on the NE dataset versus those resulting from the class-independent or class-conditional model in the AIBS. If there was a significant positive correlation between the AIBS slope and the NE slope, we concluded that the results of the two analyses were consistent (although this does not imply that they were highly consistent). For those comparisons which were consistent, we considered one method to be “more consistent” than the other if the AIBS/NE correlation value was higher (p &lt; 0.05 based on 100 bootstrap resamples) than that derived using the second method.</p>

<p>Bootstrapped confidence intervals and significance between models for correlations between the NE and AIBS datasets were calculated as follows: Starting with the list of paired beta coefficients for a given electrophysiological feature and model (class-independent or class-conditional), in which each pair represented a single gene and each value in that pair was calculated using one of the two datasets, a new list of paired correlation values of the same length was calculated by resampling with replacement. A new Spearman correlation was then calculated based on the resampled list. The resampling procedure was repeated 100 times, and the upper and lower ends of the confidence intervals were calculated by finding the values at the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. Significance was determined by finding the difference between each pair of resampled correlations from the two models, and then again finding the values at the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. If this interval did not contain zero, the two consistency metrics were said to be significantly different from one another at p &lt; 0.05.</p>

Here, we made use of four previously published PatchSeq datasets that have characterized interneurons of the mouse forebrain, described in detail in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1007113.t001">Table 1</xref>.

Our analysis also includes one novel dataset of 19 Pvalb-Cre positive interneurons recorded in region CA1 of the mouse hippocampus, reported here for the first time.

<p>Datasets were processed and normalized as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref027">27</xref>] with a small number of exceptions.

Similarly, the Cadwell and Földy datasets were normalized to counts per million (CPM), to be more directly comparable with how we have normalized the AIBS datasets here. Second, because PatchSeq sampled cells varied considerably in amount of mitochondrial and other non-coding mRNAs, when normalizing cells to the total count of reads detected in each cell, we only quantified reads mapping to protein coding genes, as defined by biomaRt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007113.ref072">72</xref>].

<title>Assigning PatchSeq single cells to transcriptomically-defined cell types</title>

Specifically, for each transcriptomically-defined cluster in these reference datasets, we first calculated the mean expression level across all cells assigned to the cluster. Next, using the two thousand most variable genes amongst inhibitory cell types in the Tasic dataset (described in the section below), we calculated the Spearman correlation of each PatchSeq cell to every cluster in the dissociated cell dataset and assigned cells to the cluster that they were most correlated with (we compared all PatchSeq datasets except the striatum Muñoz dataset to the Tasic cortical dataset). For cortical and hippocampal cell types, to increase the number of cells defined per transcriptomic type, we utilized the “subclass” mappings of each transcriptomically defined cluster using mappings provided in the Tasic 2018 dataset, mapping neurons to the Pvalb, Sst, Vip, Lamp5, and Sncg major interneuron cell types. For example, a neuron mapped to the Sst Cbln4 would belong to the Sst subclass. To estimate transcriptome quality we used the “quality score” metric from our prior analysis, using the full set of “on” and “off” marker genes.</p>

where we used an anova to test for the significance of the beta associated with the gene expression term by comparison to an equivalent statistical model without the gene expression term. We used the quality score as a weight in the regression analysis, and normalized these across datasets. We used the ‘lmer’ function within the ‘lme4’ R package for fitting mixed-effects models. We performed this analysis on the top 250-most variable genes per cell type and for genes that were highly variable in at least one cell type across at least 2 (of the 5 total) PatchSeq datasets used here. In addition, we did not use PatchSeq cell types where gene expression was detected in fewer than 33% of cells and with fewer than 5 cells expressing the gene.</p>
