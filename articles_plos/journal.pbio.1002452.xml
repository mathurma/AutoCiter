<abstract>
<p>Functional residues in proteins tend to be highly conserved over evolutionary time. However, to what extent functional sites impose evolutionary constraints on nearby or even more distant residues is not known. Here, we report pervasive conservation gradients toward catalytic residues in a dataset of 524 distinct enzymes: evolutionary conservation decreases approximately linearly with increasing distance to the nearest catalytic residue in the protein structure. This trend encompasses, on average, 80% of the residues in any enzyme, and it is independent of known structural constraints on protein evolution such as residue packing or solvent accessibility. Further, the trend exists in both monomeric and multimeric enzymes and irrespective of enzyme size and/or location of the active site in the enzyme structure. By contrast, sites in protein–protein interfaces, unlike catalytic residues, are only weakly conserved and induce only minor rate gradients. In aggregate, these observations show that functional sites, and in particular catalytic residues, induce long-range evolutionary constraints in enzymes.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The basic biochemical functions of life are carried out by large molecules called enzymes. Enzymes consist of long chains of amino acids folded into a three-dimensional structure. Within that structure, a specific cluster of amino acids, known as the active site, performs the biochemical function. Substituting one amino acid for another in the active site typically results in a defective, non-functional enzyme, and therefore mutations at or near enzyme active sites are often lethal. Moreover, even mutations far from the active site have been found to disrupt function. Nonetheless, as organisms evolve, enzymes accumulate random mutations. Where in enzymes’ structures do these mutations accumulate without causing harm? Here, we observe evidence for extensive interactions between active sites and distant regions of the enzyme structure, in a comprehensive set of over 500 enzymes. We show that active sites tightly control the substitutions that an enzyme can tolerate. This control extends far beyond regions of the enzyme immediately adjacent to the active site, covering over 80% of a typical enzyme structure. Our findings have broad implications for molecular evolution, for enzyme engineering, and for the computational prediction of active-site locations in novel enzymes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Enzymes facilitate the chemical reactions necessary for life. To function properly, enzymes must reconcile two competing demands: they must fold stably into the correct three-dimensional conformation, and they must display the correct catalytic residues in their active sites. As enzymes evolve, mutations that are functionally beneficial are often deleterious for stability, and vice versa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref003">3</xref>]. Thus, the patterns of evolutionary divergence observed in enzyme evolution are shaped by the interplay of these two potentially conflicting constraints.</p>
<p>Mutations affecting fold stability can occur anywhere in the protein structure, though in general stability effects tend to be more pronounced in the interior, more densely packed regions of a structure than on the protein surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref005">5</xref>]. By contrast, where mutations affect function in a protein structure is less clear. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments demonstrate that mutations at catalytic residues, unsurprisingly, disable enzyme function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref007">7</xref>]. Accordingly, residues directly involved in protein function tend to be more conserved over evolutionary time than other residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref010">10</xref>]. Less intuitively, however, mutations 20 Å or more from a catalytic residue can attenuate catalytic activity in enzymes such as glycosidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref011">11</xref>], TEM-lactamase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref012">12</xref>], or copper nitrate reductase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref013">13</xref>]. Similarly, a study of a small set of α/β-barrel enzymes has found that evolutionary conservation decays continuously with the distance to the nearest catalytic residue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref014">14</xref>]. These results suggest that residues far from an active site may be functionally important, but that this importance may decline with distance in physical, three-dimensional space.</p>
<p>Here, we analyze a dataset of 524 distinct enzyme structures spanning the six major functional classes of enzymes. We systematically assess how site-specific evolutionary variation in these enzymes relates to the geometric location of residues relative to the nearest catalytic residue. We find that, across all six major classes of enzymes, the constraining effects of catalytic residues extend to most of an enzyme’s structure, irrespective of protein size. These effects exist regardless of whether an active site is located on the surface or in the core of a protein, and they remain even when controlling for other structural features predicting evolutionary variation. Finally, we find that we can use site-specific conservation gradients to accurately recover active sites in more than 50% of enzymes. In summary, these findings demonstrate that functional sites induce long-range evolutionary constraints in enzyme structures.</p>

<title>Functional Sites Induce Gradients of Conservation</title>
<p>To systematically explore the relationship between site-specific evolutionary rates and distance to the nearest catalytic residue, we have analyzed 524 diverse enzyme structures. We have chosen these structures as a subset of enzymes analyzed previously for their relationship between protein structure and evolutionary variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref015">15</xref>]. The structures represent all six major classes of enzymes, and no two structures in the dataset share more than 25% of their respective amino-acid sequences. The dataset includes both single subunit proteins (monomers) and multi-subunit proteins (multimers), and annotations describing the biological assembly and the location of the catalytic residues are available for each structure (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Methods</xref> for details). For each enzyme, we have constructed alignments of up to 300 homologous sequences, selected from the UniRef90 database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref017">17</xref>]. We estimate evolutionary variation at each site in each alignment by calculating a site-specific relative evolutionary rate, using the software Rate4Site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref018">18</xref>]. The relative rates are normalized such that a value of one corresponds to the average rate in a given protein, and larger or smaller values represent proportionally larger or smaller rates. For brevity, we will also refer to the relative rates simply as “rates.” In mathematical expressions, rates will be denoted by the letter <italic>K</italic>.</p>
<p>We first ask whether there is an overall trend toward increased evolutionary conservation near active sites. To address this question, we pool all sites from all structures into one combined dataset and then calculate the mean evolutionary rate as a function of Euclidean distance to the nearest catalytic residue in the respective structure. As expected, we find that evolutionary rates are, on average, the lowest at or directly near catalytically active sites. Moreover, we find that rates increase approximately linearly with increasing distance to the nearest catalytic residue, up to a distance of approximately 27.5 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002452.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Beyond this distance, rates level off. Importantly, 80% of all residues in our dataset fall within a distance of 27.5 Å to the nearest catalytic residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002452.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Thus, the vast majority of all residues in each protein appear to experience some amount of purifying selection mediated by catalytic residues.</p>

<title>Site-specific evolutionary rates increase with distance to a catalytic residue in 80% of residues.</title>
<p>(a) Site-specific evolutionary rate versus distance to the nearest catalytic residue. The curve represents the mean rate for all residues, as calculated from a generalized additive model. Standard error is shown in light gray. Individual residues are not shown. The vertical line indicates a distance of 27.5 Å. On average, rates increase almost linearly with distance, up to ∼27.5 Å. (b) Density plot of residues with a given distance to a catalytic residue. Dashed lines indicate the boundaries of shells with a thickness of 5 Å each. The vertical red line again shows a distance of 27.5 Å, and 80% of residues in the dataset fall within this distance. (c) Distribution of site-specific evolutionary rates within each shell. Violins show the distribution of rates in each shell, points represent the mean, and the shading represents the number of residues found in that shell. The red line indicates a distance of 27.5 Å, corresponding to the boundary of shell 5. When visualizing rate trends with discrete shells, rates increase from shells 0 through 6.

<p>We can think of sites in a protein as organized into shells according to their distance to the closest catalytic residue. Each shell is 5 Å in width, the approximate minimum distance between two amino acid side-chains. The boundaries between these discrete shells are indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002452.g001">Fig 1B</xref> with dashed lines, and we can see clear dips in the distribution at 2.5 Å and 7.5 Å, the boundaries between the 0th and 1st and the 1st and 2nd shells (the boundaries between shells become less precise for higher shell numbers). We can subdivide the sites of our dataset into these discrete shells and then plot the rate distribution within each shell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002452.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). We find that the mean rate for each shell increases up to shell 6 (32.5 Å) and then stabilizes. Similarly, the width of the distribution also increases up to shell 6. Thus, all shells include some proportion of conserved sites, but increasingly distant shells include an increasing fraction of moderately or highly variable sites.</p>

<sec id="sec004">
<title>Conservation Gradients Are Distinct from Known Structural Constraints on Protein Evolution</title>
<p>The broad rate distributions that we observe within individual shells, in particular within shells distant from catalytic residues, highlight that there are other factors besides distance that also influence the extent and type of selection acting on individual sites. In fact, one important evolutionary constraint is the requirement for proteins to fold stably into their active conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref019">19</xref>]. This constraint causes sites in the interior of the protein, shielded from the solvent and involved in many inter-residue contacts, to be more evolutionarily conserved than sites on the protein surface (for a recent review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref030">30</xref>]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref029">29</xref>].</p>
<p>Two structural measures are commonly used to quantify this structural constraint: relative solvent accessibility (RSA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref031">31</xref>] and weighted contact number (WCN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref032">32</xref>]. RSA measures the exposure of a given residue to a hypothetical small solvent molecule, typically water. RSA is useful for determining if a residue is on the surface or the interior of a protein structure. WCN measures the local packing density of a given residue. WCN is high in the core of the protein, where residues are tightly packed. We have calculated both WCN and RSA for each site in each protein in our dataset. We have based this calculation on the published biological assembly of each protein, so that intra-chain contacts are properly accounted for in the case of enzymes that natively function in a multimeric state. As has been reported previously, on average WCN displays higher correlations with site-specific rate than RSA does, in particular when WCN is calculated with respect to the side-chain coordinates of each residue (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002452.s004">S1 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref033">33</xref>]. However, in our dataset, correlations of rate with WCN are only moderately higher than correlations with RSA, and there are proteins for which RSA outperforms WCN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002452.s004">S1 Fig</xref>). Therefore, throughout this work, we consider both WCN and RSA as measures of structural constraints acting on site-specific protein evolution. Importantly, neither WCN nor RSA make any assumptions about catalytic residues in proteins. Both quantities are purely geometric measures of protein structure. Conversely, the distance <italic>d</italic> to the closest catalytic residue does not explicitly contain information about packing density or solvent accessibility. Yet, in our dataset, the three quantities WCN, RSA, and <italic>d</italic> are all correlated with each other (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002452.s005">S2 Fig</xref>). Therefore, we next ask to what extent the distance <italic>d</italic> captures an evolutionary constraint that is distinct from the constraints captured by WCN and RSA.</p>
<p>To address this question, we regress site-specific evolutionary rates <italic>K</italic> against WCN, RSA, and <italic>d</italic>, in all possible combinations, and separately for each enzyme in our dataset. We then record the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> for each model and each enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002452.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). We find that the best purely structural model, using both WCN and RSA as predictor variables, explains on average 39% of the variation in rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002452.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Adding distance as a third predictor to this model increases the average <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> to 44%. Thus, distance explains on average at least 5% of rate variation that cannot be attributed to purely structural factors, and possibly more than that; by itself, distance explains on average 25% of the variation in rate. Some of that variation may be accidentally captured by WCN or RSA, because active sites are frequently located closer to the interior than to the surface of the protein structure.</p>

<p>To further assess the independent contribution of distance to the pattern of site-specific rates, we compare model predictions and empirical rates as functions of distance to the active site. We compare rates predicted by the linear models <italic>K</italic> ∼ WCN + RSA and <italic>K</italic> ∼ WCN + RSA + <italic>d</italic>, which are fit for each protein individually. For visualization only, we average within shells, as explained above. We find that a linear model containing only WCN and RSA tends to overestimate site-specific evolutionary rates within the first three to four shells (green line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002452.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>). Adding distance to this model removes nearly all of the overestimation (orange line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002452.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>). These findings demonstrate that structural metrics alone are unable to accurately predict conservation patterns near active sites.</p>

<title>Functional and Structural Constraints Align for Active Sites in the Interior But Not for Those on the Surface</title>
<p>Enzymes often sequester substrates into a buried catalytic core. This sequestration allows them to facilitate chemistry that would otherwise be impossible in the broader cellular environment. For this reason, many enzymes tend to have active sites in the protein interior, where local packing density is high and solvent accessibility is low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref019">19</xref>]. For those enzymes, we expect the distance metric <italic>d</italic> to correlate with WCN and/or RSA. By contrast, if the active site is located on the protein surface, then distance should correlate very little or not at all with either WCN or RSA.</p>
<p>To further disentangle active-site effects from WCN and RSA, we can identify individual structures from our dataset in which distance is sufficiently uncorrelated (defined as <italic>r</italic> &lt; 0.25) from both WCN and RSA. Among these structures, we find four for which distance correlates strongly with evolutionary rate (defined as <italic>r</italic> ≥ 0.55) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002452.g003">Fig 3</xref>). They correspond to the enzymes dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR, protein databank identifier [PDB ID]: 1DHF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref034">34</xref>], superoxide reductase (SOR, PDB ID: 1DO6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref035">35</xref>], anti-sigma factor SpollAB (PDB ID: 1L0O) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref036">36</xref>], and the <italic>Serratia</italic> endonuclease (PDB ID: 1SMN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref037">37</xref>]. All of these enzymes perform different biological functions, and they are active in multimeric conformations. In these proteins, rate correlates more strongly with distance than it does with WCN or RSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002452.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), and the mean rate increases linearly with distance throughout the entire structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002452.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). In all four cases shown, the active sites are located near the protein surface (mean active-site RSA ranges from 0.19 to 0.25) and away from the protein center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002452.g003">Fig 3C</xref>).</p>

<p>To analyze the effect of active-site location on rate variation more systematically, we next subdivide our entire dataset into three categories based on active site location, measured by the mean RSA of all catalytic residues in the structure. We define these categories as active site in the protein interior (mean catalytic-residue RSA &lt; 0.05), active site with intermediate solvent exposure (mean catalytic-residue RSA between 0.05 and 0.25), and active site on the protein surface (mean catalytic-residue RSA ≥ 0.25). Our dataset contains 98, 367, and 59 proteins in these three categories, respectively.</p>
<p>As before, we find that the purely structural metrics RSA and WCN tend to overestimate site-specific evolutionary rates near the active site in all three groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002452.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Moreover, the structure-based models perform worse as the active site moves from the core of the enzyme to the surface. In all cases, incorporating distance into the model corrects most rate overestimation near the active site. Interestingly, all models perform better for active sites in the core than for active sites on the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002452.g004">Fig 4</xref>). We interpret this observation as follows: When the active site is located in the core of an enzyme, functional and structural constraints are aligned. The sites most conserved due to function are also the sites most conserved due to structure, and this overall trend is captured well in the linear models. By contrast, when the active site is located on the surface, functional and structural constraints are at odds with each other. The sites most conserved due to function are now the sites least conserved due to structure, and vice versa. In this case, since there are now two opposing trends within one structure, it is more difficult for any linear model to accurately capture rate variation throughout the structure.</p>

<title>Effect of active-site location on the relationship between site-specific evolutionary rates and distance to the nearest catalytic residue.</title>
<p>Enzymes are grouped into three categories, based on the mean solvent exposure of their catalytic residues: core (RSA &lt; 0.05), intermediate (0.05 &lt; RSA &lt; 0.25), and surface (RSA &gt; 0.25). Lines represent mean residuals for different structural linear models (vertical labels, right) and those same models with distance added as a variable. As the active site location moves from the core to the surface of an enzyme, structural constraints (WCN, RSA, and WCN + RSA) increasingly overestimate rates within shells 3–4. Models including distance as a variable predict rates more accurately in shells 0–6, even when the active site is located on the surface.

<title>Distance Effect Extends Further in Larger Proteins</title>
<p>We have previously seen that approximately 80% of all residues in our dataset fall within the 27.5 Å cutoff, inside of which evolutionary variation is reduced in proportion to distance to the nearest active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002452.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). However, the 80% figure may be somewhat misleading, because in that analysis we have pooled all residues from all proteins. Our dataset comprises proteins of very different sizes, from 95 to 1,287 amino acids long, and for small proteins every residue falls within 27.5 Å of an active site, while for large proteins only one-half to two-thirds of the residues lie within the 27.5 Å distance cutoff.</p>
<p>To ascertain whether the relationship between functional sites and evolutionary rates depends on enzyme size, we can re-analyze our data by protein size. We define three evenly sized groups: small proteins (95–268 sites), medium-size proteins (270–385 sites), and large proteins (386–1,287 sites). Each group contains 175, 175, and 174 structures, respectively. We observe that as enzyme size increases, the rate–distance slope decreases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002452.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Distance effects are weaker in larger proteins but also extend further out. The effect remains visible when we analyze the distance–rate relationship for individual proteins and in the context of WCN and RSA (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002452.g005">5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002452.s008">S5</xref>): purely structural models, which use only WCN and RSA to predict rate, overestimate rate up to shell 3 in small proteins, up to shell 4 in medium-sized proteins, and up to shell 5 in larger proteins.</p>

<title>Effect of protein size on the relationship between site-specific evolutionary rates and distance to the nearest catalytic residue.</title>
<p>(a) Distribution of rates within each shell, where proteins have been separated into small (95–368 sites), medium (270–385 sites), and large (386–1,287 sites) based on amino-acid sequence length. Points represent the mean rate in each shell. Shading denotes the quantity of residues in each shell. As the size of the protein increases, the distance–rate slope decreases and distance effects extend further from the active site. (b) Mean residuals in each shell for models with and without distance, again separated by protein size. The addition of distance to a structural-constraints (RSA and WCN) model increases the accuracy of rate prediction near the active site up to shell 3 (17.5 Å) in small proteins and up to shell 5 (27.5 Å) in large proteins. Thus, the constraining effects of catalytic residues depend on protein size, with stronger, more local effects in small proteins, and weaker, longer-range effects in large proteins.

<p>In summary, we see that the leveling off of rate at shell 5, around 27.5 Å, in the pooled dataset, does not represent a universal cutoff but rather an average obtained from combining many different structures into one analysis. For any individual protein, there will generally be a distance effect, but it may extend only to shell 3 or 4 in small proteins while extending to shell 6 (and possibly beyond) for very large proteins.</p>

<title>Selection Gradients Recover Catalytic Residues</title>
<p>As we have seen from the preceding analyses, active sites in enzymes impose a selection gradient that can be detected throughout the majority of the protein structure. This observation leads us to ask whether we can use this gradient to identify active sites when their location is not known. To answer this question, we blindly search for distance–rate gradients in our dataset. We systematically use one residue at a time as a reference point in the structure and fit a linear model of rate versus the distance to that reference point. We record the resulting <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> for each model, and we consider the reference point with the highest <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> as the putative active site in the structure.</p>
<p>We find that in 18% of the structures in our dataset, the putative active site coincides with a known catalytic residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002452.g006">Fig 6</xref>). In an additional 37% of structures, the putative active site falls within 7.5 Å of a catalytic residue but is not a catalytic residue itself. A distance of 7.5 Å corresponds to one shell, i.e., it captures residues in direct contact with a catalytic residue. Note that the gap visible between 0 and 2.5 Å in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002452.g006">Fig 6</xref> corresponds to the closest distance that two side chains can physically contact each other. A putative active site either is a catalytic residue, in which case it has a distance of 0 Å to the nearest catalytic residue (i.e., itself), or alternatively it has to be at least a distance of 2.5 Å away from the catalytic residue. In summary, for more than half (55%) of the 524 enzymes in our dataset, we can use the existing selection gradient to identify either a catalytic residue or an immediate neighbor.</p>

We have plotted here the distribution of distances of these putative catalytic residues to the nearest known catalytic residue. A distance of zero indicates that the putative catalytic residue is a true catalytic residue. 18% of enzymes have a putative catalytic residue that is a true catalytic residue. An additional 37% of enzymes have a putative catalytic residue within 7.5 Å (shell 1) of a catalytic residue. In total, we recover a catalytic residue or a residue in immediate contact with a catalytic residue in 55% of the enzymes.

<p>As a control, we have also considered a model that places the active site at the core of the protein, at the residue with the overall highest WCN (since, as stated above, the active site is located in the protein interior for many enzymes).

<title>Catalytic Residues Evolve More Slowly Than Protein–Protein Interface Residues</title>
<p>Many enzymes function as components of multimeric protein complexes. In fact, more than half of the enzymes in our dataset contain multiple subunits in their biological assemblies. The arrangement of and interaction between these subunits could substantially modify how protein structure and protein function shape protein evolution, especially if the active site occurs at the interface of two subunits. In our dataset, we find that residues in protein–protein interfaces are, on average, only slightly more conserved than any other residues, whereas catalytic residues are much more conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002452.g007">Fig 7A</xref>): residues in interfaces evolve, on average, at a rate of 0.91 relative to the average residue, while catalytic residues evolve, on average, at a relative rate of 0.10. To verify that the little conservation we see in interface sites is not an artifact of our enzyme dataset, we have also analyzed rates in a set of 17 non-enzymatic protein–protein complexes, consisting of 30 individual proteins total (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Methods</xref>). Again, we find that residues in protein–protein interfaces show only moderate conservation relative to all other residues (relative rate of 0.82, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002452.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Moreover, consistent with their weak conservation, protein–protein interfaces induce only very minor gradients of conservation, if any, in both enzyme and non-enzyme proteins (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002452.g007">Fig 7B–7D</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002452.g001">Fig 1</xref>).

<p>The structural metrics RSA and WCN are also sensitive to subunit arrangement, and subunit arrangement can be incorrectly annotated in the biological assembly. To assess whether subunit arrangement and/or annotation errors affect the distance–rate relationship, we re-analyze our enzyme data using three additional variations of analysis choices: (i) RSA and WCN are calculated using the biological assembly, and any residues at the interface between subunits are excluded; (ii) RSA and WCN are calculated using a single subunit, and no residues are excluded; and (iii) RSA and WCN are calculated using a single subunit, and all interface residues are excluded (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002452.s011">S8</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002452.s037">S34</xref> Figs). In all three cases, our results remain qualitatively unchanged from our prior results: rate increases with increasing distance to a catalytic residue, up to about 27.5 Å; distance has an effect on rate variation that is independent from the purely structural metrics WCN and RSA. Thus, in summary, there is a positive distance–rate relationship that is independent of WCN or RSA, and it exists regardless of how we treat multi-subunit enzymes and interface residues.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have shown that many enzymes exhibit a clear, nearly linear relationship between site-specific evolutionary rates and distance to the nearest catalytic residue. We have found this trend consistently throughout a large dataset of 524 diverse enzymes, and we have found that the relationship extends to most of the residues in any given enzyme structure. Using combined linear models containing RSA, WCN, and distance, we have found that distance explains at least 5% of the variance in rate after controlling for WCN and RSA, and potentially up to approximately 36% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002452.g003">Fig 3</xref>) in proteins in which the active site is located near the protein surface. Moreover, models containing only the structural predictors WCN and RSA consistently overestimate evolutionary variation near active sites, through shell 5 (27.5 Å) in large proteins. Finally, we have shown that in over half of the enzymes in our dataset, we can recover catalytic residues or their immediate neighbors from the evolutionary gradients they imprint throughout the protein structure.</p>
<p>For some enzymes in our dataset, we have found little evidence for functional or structural constraints on site-specific evolutionary rates. There are some proteins for which less than 10% of the variation in evolutionary rate can be accounted for with distance to a catalytic residue, RSA, or WCN. These low correlations suggest that either the rates themselves are uninformative, or that the available PDB structures are not reflective of protein structure in vivo. In the first case, the sequence alignments used to determine evolutionary rate could contain a mix of proteins with very different arrangements in vivo. We have no way of determining the biological assembly of every sequence in the alignment, so differences in corresponding subunit arrangement could bias the site-specific evolutionary rates. Additionally, the RCSB protein database may have conflicting biological assemblies. For example, the biological assembly for human dihydrofolate reductase (PDB ID: 1DHF) is classified as a homodimer, while the biological assembly for a separate structure (PDB ID: 1DRF) of the same protein is classified as a monomer. We have attempted to control for possible structural variability in the sequence alignments and biological assemblies by re-analyzing all structures as monomers and/or removing residues at the interface of subunits before computing correlations, and the overall trends observed remain the same (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002452.s011">S8</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002452.s037">S34</xref> Figs). Regardless, all of the factors mentioned here could result in rates that correlate poorly with any structural predictors.</p>
<p>The field of molecular evolution has long sought to understand the relationship between protein structure, function, and sequence evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref030">30</xref>]. Here, we have assessed this relationship by comparing distance to the nearest catalytic residue with site-specific evolutionary rates. Past work has employed covariation analyses to reveal clusters of co-evolving residues in protein structures, deemed “protein sectors” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref038">38</xref>]. In specific cases, such as in serine proteases, these protein sectors also correspond to different functional biochemical regions of the structure. A recent reanalysis of the seminal protein sector work demonstrates that, in proteins with just one sector, sequence conservation recovers clusters of functional residues just as well as covariation analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref039">39</xref>]. Our work demonstrates that not only are clusters of functional residues highly conserved, but that such residues induce gradients of conservation within a structure. This finding of long-range interactions between residues is consistent with the sector model of large regions of co-evolving residues.</p>
<p>We have found that active sites are among the most highly conserved sites in proteins, whereas residues involved in protein–protein interactions are only weakly conserved relative to the average site in a protein. Moreover, the gradients of conservation induced by protein–protein interfaces are much less marked than those induced by catalytic sites. This finding is consistent with prior work on protein–protein interactions. While several prior works have found increased conservation in interface regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref042">42</xref>], effect sizes have generally been found to be small. For example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref042">42</xref>] found that the reduction in evolutionary rate in a protein–protein interface was mostly (though not entirely) explained by the reduction in solvent accessibility induced by complex formation. Also, complementation assays and computer simulations suggest that protein–protein interfaces can experience extensive divergence without loss of function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref043">43</xref>], again supporting the notion that protein–protein interfaces are frequently not under strong purifying selection. For these reasons, we believe that the rate gradients we have found toward active sites are not strongly confounded by protein–protein binding interfaces.</p>
<p>Long-range interactions between residues in a protein have historically been studied in the context of allostery. Initially proposed in 1961, allostery describes the process by which a small molecule (ligand) binds to one area of an enzyme (allosteric site) and induces a conformational change at a distant active site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref044">44</xref>]. Studies of allosteric interactions shed light on two key aspects of our findings. First, biophysical models have been developed that explain long-range interactions. The Monod-Wyman-Changuex model, the most widely studied of allostery models, proposes that ligand binding stabilizes a biologically active or inactive quarternary structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref044">44</xref>]. Recent studies, however, demonstrate that some monomeric proteins also contain allosteric sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref044">44</xref>]. In G-protein coupled receptors, for example, a simplified model of conserved, physically connected amino-acid residues explains the long-range interactions between allosteric sites and active sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref045">45</xref>]. Our dataset contains a mix of monomeric and multimeric proteins, and we observe long-range interactions in both types of proteins. Thus, our findings suggest that allosteric-like couplings between active sites and distant residues may be more common than previously thought. The physical distance between allosteric ligand-binding sites and active sites ranges from 20 Å in hemoglobin to 60 Å in glycogen phosphorylase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref046">46</xref>]. Therefore, the selection gradients we have observed here extend to distances well within the range of experimentally observed allosteric interactions. Second, while the observed selection gradients have allowed us to recover residues in close proximity to the active site in a little over half of the proteins in our dataset, in many proteins (45%) the selection gradient points toward a residue &gt;7.5 Å from the active site. It is possible that these non-catalytic residues, which are highly predictive of the overall patterns of evolutionary rates in the structure, may be allosteric sites. Allosteric sites tend to be highly conserved, although typically not as conserved as active sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref047">47</xref>]. In summary, studies of allostery provide biophysical explanations for long-range interactions between residues and may explain why we failed to recover catalytic residues from selection gradients in some proteins in our dataset.</p>
<p>That selection gradients can recover active sites has potentially broad applications, even beyond enzymatic proteins. For example, some of us have previously used optimized distance to identify important functional sites in influenza A hemagglutinin (HA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref048">48</xref>]. HA, a viral surface protein, interacts directly with sialic acid found on the surface of human cells. Viral infection requires binding of HA to sialic acid, and antibodies bind near the sialic-acid binding region to inhibit viral infection. Residues in that region are thus under strong positive selection for immune escape, and consequently the selection gradient in HA revealed a rapidly evolving functional site. This finding suggests that selection gradients could effectively recover diverse types of functional sites, not only those that are well conserved. More broadly, evolutionary history is a useful predictor of active sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref009">9</xref>] and binding partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref010">10</xref>]. Assuming that a given structure has been crystalized, the rate gradients we have found here could improve computational predictions of active sites and binding sites.</p>

<title>Datasets and Site-Specific Evolutionary Rates</title>
<p>We selected 524 of 554 previously characterized enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref015">15</xref>] to conduct our analysis. We removed 30 structures because they contained chains with no available catalytic residue information, or because the UniRef90 database did not contain enough homologous sequences to construct a diverse alignment. These enzymes consist of 204 monomers and 320 multimers, and no two enzymes in the dataset have more than 25% sequence identity. For each enzyme, we obtained catalytic residue information from the Catalytic Site Atlas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref049">49</xref>].</p>
<p>We acquired PDB structures of the biological assemblies for these proteins from the RCSB protein database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref050">50</xref>]. A biological assembly represents the functional form of a given enzyme in vivo based on the best experimental data available. When available, we used biological assemblies that are author-provided or both author-provided and software-supported (labeled “A” and “A+S,” respectively, in the RCSB protein database). If author-provided biological assemblies were not available, we used biological assemblies predicted by PISA (protein interfaces, surfaces, and assemblies, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pisa/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pisa/</ext-link>) (labeled “S”). PISA biological assemblies are entirely predicted by software. In cases in which there were multiple author-provided biological assemblies, we chose the first of those assemblies listed in the RCSB protein database.</p>
<p>In addition to the enzyme dataset, we also compiled a non-enzyme dataset as a control. We selected 17 of 179 protein–protein complexes from the Protein–Protein Interaction Affinity Database 2.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref051">51</xref>]. We selected only non-enzymatic proteins based on interaction classification, absence of enzyme comission (EC) number, and UniProt annotations. We also excluded complexes containing antibodies, since antibodies evolve on a different time-scale and by different mechanisms than other cellular proteins. We acquired structures of the protein–protein complexes from the RCSB protein database.</p>
<p>To calculate site-specific evolutionary rates, we first extracted the amino-acid sequences from the PDB structures. Using PSI-BLAST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref052">52</xref>], we then queried the UniRef90 database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref017">17</xref>] to retrieve homologous sequences for each enzyme. Among these homologous sequences for each enzyme, we removed sequences with less than 10% pairwise divergence to any other sequence, to reduce phylogenetic bias. Next, we randomly downsampled the homologous sequences to a maximum of 300 sequences per enzyme. Then, we performed a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of the sequences with MAFFT 7.215 (Multiple Alignment using Fast Fourier Transform) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref053">53</xref>] and generated phylogenetic trees with RAxML 7.2.8 (Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref054">54</xref>] using the LG substitution matrix (named after Le and Gacuel) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref055">55</xref>] and the PROTCAT model of rate heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref056">56</xref>]. We calculated site-specific evolutionary rates with the program Rate4Site 2.01 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref018">18</xref>], using the MSAs and phylogenetic trees from the previous step as input. We used the empirical Bayes approach for rate estimation and the JTT (Jones, Taylor, and Thorton) model of amino acid replacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref057">57</xref>]. Lastly, we normalized the rates such that the rates for each protein have a mean of 1. Because these rates are measured relative to the average divergence rate of the entire protein, they are dimensionless. Throughout this work, we refer to these site-specific relative rates as <italic>K</italic>, or simply “rates.”</p>

<title>Predictor Variables</title>
<p>For each protein structure, we calculated several predictor variables at each site. First, we calculated the weighted contact number WCN for each residue <italic>i</italic> as follows:

</disp-formula>
Here, <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> is the distance between the geometric center of the side-chain atoms in residue <italic>i</italic> and the geometric center of side-chain atoms in residue <italic>j</italic>. To calculate these distances for residue pairs involving glycine, which has no side-chain, we used the location of the C<sub>α</sub> in those residues instead. Unless noted otherwise, WCN was calculated using the complete biological assembly of the protein.</p>
<p>Next, we calculated the relative solvent accessibility (RSA) at each site. To this end, we first calculated the accessible surface area (ASA) using the software mkdssp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref059">59</xref>]. We then normalized ASAs by the maximum solvent accessibility for each residue in a Gly-X-Gly tripeptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002452.ref031">31</xref>]. Peptide linkages across chains, typically disulfide bridges, were assigned an RSA of zero. Unless noted otherwise, RSA was calculated using the complete biological assembly of the protein.</p>
<p>Finally, we calculated the distance <italic>d</italic> to the nearest catalytic residue for each residue in each structure. Most enzymes have multiple catalytic residues, so we define <italic>d</italic> as distance to the nearest catalytic residue. As was the case for WCN, distances were measured from the geometric center of the side-chain of one residue to the the geometric center of the side-chain of another residue. And in the case of glycines, the position of C<sub>α</sub> was again used in place of the side-chain geometric center. Any residue with <italic>d</italic> = 0 is therefore a catalytic residue, and conversely, all catalytic residues lie at <italic>d</italic> = 0.</p>
<p>We defined interface residues as residues for which RSA differed by a minimum of 10% when calculated for the full biological assembly or for a single chain. All interface residues were included in the analyses presented in the main body of the text, but we excluded interface residues in the analyses presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002452.s020">S17</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002452.s037">S34</xref> Figs.</p>

<title>Comparison of two active-site recovery methods, one based on evolutionary-rate gradients and the other based on strictly structural properties.</title>
<p>The “Distance” column refers to the distance between the predicted catalytic residue and a true catalytic residue. “Optimized <italic>d</italic>” refers to selecting a reference residue that yields the maximum <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> between the set of distances to that residue and rates. This reference residue is predicted to be a catalytic residue. “Max. WCN” refers to a method in which the site with the maximum weighted contact number is assumed to be a catalytic residue. Evolutionary rate gradients recover active sites more often than does the site with maximum packing density (oddsratio = 2.8, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1.7 x 10<sup>−15</sup>, Fisher’s Exact Test).</p>
