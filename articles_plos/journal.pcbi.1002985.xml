      <abstract>
        <p>Neuronal activity differs between wakefulness and sleep states. In contrast, an attractor state, called self-organized critical (SOC), was proposed to govern brain dynamics because it allows for optimal information coding. But is the human brain SOC for each vigilance state despite the variations in neuronal dynamics? We characterized neuronal avalanches – spatiotemporal waves of enhanced activity - from dense intracranial depth recordings in humans. We showed that avalanche distributions closely follow a power law – the hallmark feature of SOC - for each vigilance state. However, avalanches clearly differ with vigilance states: slow wave sleep (SWS) shows large avalanches, wakefulness intermediate, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep small ones. Our SOC model, together with the data, suggested first that the differences are mediated by global but tiny changes in synaptic strength, and second, that the changes with vigilance states reflect small deviations from criticality to the subcritical regime, implying that the human brain does not operate at criticality proper but close to SOC. Independent of criticality, the analysis confirms that SWS shows increased correlations between cortical areas, and reveals that REM sleep shows more fragmented cortical dynamics.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Brain activity shows complex dynamics, even in the absence of external stimulation. In fact, most brain activity is generated internally. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the generation principles of internal activity. One hypothesis is that complex brain dynamics emerges from simple local interactions if the network is in a specific state, called “self-organized critical” (SOC). SOC indeed can account for dynamics in slices of brain tissue. However, we lack evidence that human brain dynamics is SOC. In addition, we wondered whether SOC can account for brain activity from wakefulness to deep sleep, despite clear changes in brain dynamics with vigilances states. To answer these questions, we analyzed intracranial depth recordings in humans. We found evidence that the human brain indeed operates close to criticality from wakefulness to deep sleep. However, we found deviations from criticality with vigilance states. These deviations, together with our modelling results, indicated that the human brain is close to SOC, but in a subcritical regime. In the subcritical regime complex dynamics still emerges from purely local interactions, but are more stable than the SOC state. In fact, operation the subcritical regime allows for a safety margin to supercriticality, which was linked to epilepsy.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Distinct patterns of neuronal dynamics are observed across vigilance states as the brain transitions from wakefulness to sleep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Tononi1">[1]</xref>. In contrast, a specific attractor state, called self-organized critical (SOC), has been proposed to govern brain dynamics, because models suggest that the SOC state allows the brain to operate both flexibly and reliably, and allows for optimal information coding, processing and storage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Bertschinger1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Haldeman1">[4]</xref>. But does the brain always operate in the SOC state, despite wide variations in the neuronal dynamics across vigilance states, or does the brain – in the framework of critical dynamics – undergo a state transition away from the critical to subcritical or supercritical states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Levina1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Pajevic1">[9]</xref>? The critical state may be optimal for information processing and storage; however, during sleep the brain might not be in a state of optimal processing capacities, since sleep dynamics might equally be optimized to save energy, to restore tissue, for synaptic homeostasis, for thermoregulation, or for plasticity, learning and memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Adam1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Scharf1">[14]</xref>. Thus there are many reasons why the brain might not be in a critical state during sleep.</p>
      <p>An observation of deviations from the critical state for certain vigilance states would also imply phase transitions between vigilance states in the context of SOC. Evidence for phase transitions has been found <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in silicio</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Levina1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Pajevic1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Harris1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Benayoun1">[17]</xref>. These findings demonstrate that a neural network is in principle capable to undergo such transitions. However, we have no evidence yet for phase transitions to sub- or supercriticality <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
      <p>An investigation of such phase transitions, and the critical state proper, requires sufficient temporal and spatial sampling, since SOC dynamics involves the entire system and not just a subset. As a consequence, power law relationships – the hall mark feature of SOC - are only reliably recovered under sufficient sampling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Priesemann1">[18]</xref>. Thus, classifying sub-, supercritical and critical states in heavily subsampled system becomes difficult. Therefore, we here used local field potentials (LFP) recorded with intracranial depth electrodes from epileptic patients. These recordings sampled activity with up to 61 contacts distributed across the entire brain. In contrast to conventional electroencephalography (EEG) or electrocorticography (ECoG) which sample from the surface of the head or brain, the LFP electrodes extended into deep brain structures and sample the activity locally from the surrounding tissue. These recordings allowed us to sample not only superficially (as with EEG) or locally from a single brain area (as with implanted electrode arrays), but to record activity from many brain areas in parallel.</p>
      <p>To estimate whether the neuronal dynamics in the human brain operated close to criticality, or in sub- or supercritical states, one has to extract spatio-temporal clusters of enhanced activity, called <italic>neuronal avalanches</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Beggs1">[19]</xref>. The size distribution of these neuronal avalanches reflects the spatio-temporal correlation structure between recording sites. This correlation structure can be organized in various ways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002985-g001">Figure 1A</xref>): Units can be independent or highly correlated. The correlation structure can form specific clusters (e.g. showing high correlations between brain areas of the same modality), or it can be anywhere between these extremes. For each of these classes, the event distributions over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002985-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) and the resulting avalanche size distributions <italic>f(s)</italic> look very different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002985-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Notably, only for very specific correlation structures, the avalanche distributions show a power law (black). In this case, <italic>f(s)</italic> shows more large avalanches than a system of uncorrelated units, however, it does not prefer any specific avalanche size. Therefore, power law distributions are termed scale free. A power law indicates that the activity between the units is correlated, but the units don't form strongly interconnected subgroups. Thus, only under very specific conditions, the avalanche distributions follow a power law, which is then indicative for the SOC state.</p>

      <p>To assess SOC across vigilance states in humans, we evaluated neuronal avalanches from five patients, two nights each and for each vigilance state separately. We found that neuronal avalanches across brain areas indeed were best described by a power law, indicative of the SOC state. This even held for each of the vigilance states separately, although each state is characterized by distinct neuronal dynamics. However, the avalanche distributions differed slightly but consistently between vigilance states. Slow wave sleep (SWS) showed the largest avalanches, wakefulness showed intermediate ones, and rapid eye movement sleep (REM) showed the smallest. These differences in avalanche distributions implied that not all vigilance states can be SOC. In fact, the data together with modeling results indicated that the human brain operates close to criticality but within the subcritical regime. Within the subcritical regime, the differences between vigilance states may be mediated by tiny changes in effective synaptic strength. These changes tune the brain closer to criticality (SWS) or farther away (REM). – Independent of the framework of criticality, the avalanche measures confirmed that SWS shows increased correlations between cortical areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Volgushev1">[20]</xref>, and they revealed a new phenomenon, namely that REM sleep is characterized by more fragmented cortical dynamics than SWS and wakefulness.</p>

            <p>Black traces show LFP from 44 parallel intracranial depth recording sites in one patient. For each recording site the area under the deflection lobe between two zero crossings was calculated (see green box – blue indicates the area under the deflection lobe). A binary event (red dot) was counted by selecting the biggest area values such, that each recording site during each phase of constant sleep stage had an event rate of exactly ¼ Hz (in this example). The binary events across recording sites occurred in clusters (yellow background). These clusters are called neuronal avalanches. The avalanches were separated by pauses of no activity (white background). The avalanche size <italic>s</italic> is defined as the total number of binary events in one cluster. As examples, the sizes <italic>s</italic> of three avalanches were indicated above the raw traces.</p>

Note that imposing an event rate is basically equivalent to the common application of a threshold, however, it allows for more precise control over the contribution of each site to the avalanches. The avalanche distributions extended until <italic>s</italic>≈<italic>50</italic> and showed a drop for larger <italic>s</italic>.

        <p>The above results were evaluated at one specific temporal scale or bin size (<italic>bs</italic>), namely at a bin size of one average inter event interval (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), i.e <italic>bs = 1</italic>•<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. A change of the temporal scale – in contrast to the rate – had a clear influence on the slope of <italic>f(s)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002985-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, evaluated for <italic>r = ¼ Hz</italic>). This is a trivial effect, since larger <italic>bs</italic> allowed to combine more events to a single avalanche, thereby reducing the number of small and increasing the number of large avalanches. Nonetheless, it was surprising to find that the power law behaviour was not destroyed over the more than <italic>100</italic> fold change of time scales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002985-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Fitting a power law to <italic>f(s)</italic> showed a clear decrease of the slope from τ≈<italic>3.1</italic> to τ≈<italic>1.3</italic> with the <italic>bs</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002985-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). The dependence of τ on the <italic>bs</italic> was similar across all rates for both model functions - fitting a power law proper and a power law with cutoff. This indicated again that the temporal scale has a major influence on the avalanche distribution, while the threshold has little impact. A power law distribution for the avalanche sizes across a wide range of parameters (<italic>bs</italic> and <italic>r</italic>) suggests that cortical dynamics across brain areas are close to the critical state.</p>
        <p>Another parameter which characterizes neuronal avalanches is the branching parameter σ. The branching parameter is a measure to quantify whether a process expands (σ&gt;<italic>1</italic>) or diminishes (σ&lt;<italic>1</italic>). More precisely, σ is defined as the expected number of events which are triggered by a single event <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Harris1">[15]</xref>. We found that σ clearly changed with the temporal scale (<italic>bs</italic>), while it changed only little with the rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002985-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). This is in line with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Beggs1">[19]</xref>. However, while these studies reported σ to be close to one for <italic>bs = 1</italic>·<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we here found σ to be a little smaller than one at <italic>bs = 1</italic>·<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, hinting at a slightly subcritical state of operation.</p>
        <p>As mentioned above, the electrodes were placed individually in each patient. Most contacts were placed in the neocortex (NC) while a few contacts in each patient recorded from the amygdala and the hippocampus (AH). To understand whether NC contacts contributed differently to the avalanches compared to AH contacts, we tested whether the contribution of a single contact to avalanches of size <italic>s</italic> depended on the electrode location. Or saying it differently, for the events of each contact we estimated the probability to participate in avalanches of size <italic>s</italic>. The contributions to avalanches of size <italic>s</italic> did not differ between NC and AH contacts (cluster based randomization test, <italic>p = 0.30</italic> T-metric <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Maris1">[25]</xref>). Thus the AH contacts contributed in the same way to avalanches of each size as the NC contacts. This, to our knowledge, is the first report that non- neocortical brain areas also contribute to neuronal avalanches.</p>

        <title>Comparison of the experimental results with a simple SOC model</title>
        <p>To better understand our results concerning approximate power law distributions in the brain, we simulated model avalanches to study effects of finite size and subsampling. We chose an integrate- and- fire SOC model (SOCM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Bak1">[26]</xref> that shows recurrent activity, runs in a 3D volume, has a refractory period, and is capable of reproducing neuronal avalanches recorded in monkeys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Priesemann1">[18]</xref>. In this model the activity propagates via next neighbor connections: A unit “integrates” all “energy” it receives from its next neighbors until the energy level crosses a certain threshold. It then releases the energy to its next neighbors without loss (it “fires”). The total number of subsequent “firing” events is defined as the avalanche size (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Although this SOCM is very simple, it bears similarity to the brain: first, its threshold action resembles the “integrate and fire” mechanism that characterizes neural signal generation, and second, its local connectivity resembles the dominance of local connections in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Perin1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Yu1">[28]</xref>. Most importantly, this particular model allowed us to control the signal propagation efficacy (representing effective synaptic strength), which tunes the model to sub- and supercritical states, for comparison to the data.</p>
        <p>The SOCM in its critical state produced avalanche distributions that closely resembled those observed in the data, which is, <italic>f(s)</italic> approximated a power law for avalanche sizes up to the number of sampled sites (<italic>N = 25<sup>3</sup> = 15625</italic>), then showed a drop off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002985-g004">Figure 4D</xref> black trace). This drop off is due to the finite size of the model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Bak1">[26]</xref>. To better compare the modeling results to our experimental data, where up to 61 sites were sampled, we adjusted the number of recording sites in the model, i.e. we took into account only the activity of a small subset of the model sites (<italic>4×4×4 = 64</italic>) and dismissed the activity of all the other sites (‘subsampling’). In this case, <italic>f(s)</italic> from the subsampled model had a drop off at around <italic>s</italic> = <italic>64</italic>, the total number of sampled sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002985-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, black trace). By analogy, we expect the drop off of the neuronal <italic>f(s)</italic> to be caused by the limited number of recording sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Priesemann1">[18]</xref>. With even more recording sites, we expect the distribution of the neuronal avalanches to extend over more orders of magnitude.</p>

        <p>SOC models showed power laws with cutoff for their avalanche distributions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Bak1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Drossel1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Bak2">[30]</xref>. This is well known, however, we still wanted to test this statistically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Clauset1">[24]</xref>. Indeed, we confirmed that a power law with cutoff provided a better fit than alternative functions for both, the fully sampled and the subsampled model <italic>f(s)</italic> (supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002985.s007">table S1</xref>). However, though the power law with cutoff provided the best fit, it was not sufficient to pass a statistical test proposed by Clauset and colleagues. The same results were obtained for <italic>f(s)</italic> from the human brain (supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002985.s007">table S1</xref>). Thus, neither the neuronal avalanches from the human brain, nor the avalanches from the SOC model followed a power law with cutoff in the strict sense.</p>
        <p>We here compared neuronal avalanches from LFP recordings in humans to avalanches of a spiking neuronal model, as this latter model is known to be SOC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Bak1">[26]</xref>. We may still ask, whether both scales may reflect the same phenomenon. To answer this question we sampled activity in our spiking model with virtual LFP electrodes. Each electrode sampled activity from multiple sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002985-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). We then analyzed the virtual LFP in the same way as the human LFP. Indeed, just like the spiking model, the virtual LFP activity showed a power law for its avalanche dynamics, although with a steeper slope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002985-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Hence, the simplest explanation is that scale-free LFP dynamics reflect the underlying SOC dynamics of spike avalanches.</p>

        <title>Scaling laws for neuronal avalanche and subsampled model avalanches</title>
        <p>The above mentioned avalanche size distribution <italic>f(s)</italic> is only one of a set of scaling laws that characterize the dynamics of a system near criticality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Friedman1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Sethna1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Henkel1">[33]</xref>. Thus, a statement on the putative criticality of a system should be based on more than the scaling law for avalanche sizes. Therefore, we tested whether additional scaling laws held for neural avalanches and the subsampled SOC model. If both systems are near criticality, such additional scaling laws hold for the avalanche duration <italic>d</italic>, the inter avalanche intervals (<italic>IAI</italic>), and the shape function of an avalanche <italic>F(t/d)</italic>. <italic>F(t/d)</italic> describes the <italic>scaled</italic> number of events at time <italic>t</italic> within a single avalanche of duration <italic>d</italic>, and is expected to relate to the <italic>total</italic> number of events <italic>S(t,d)</italic> within an avalanche as follows:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002985.e009"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <italic>b</italic> is the critical exponent. The critical exponents of all these scaling laws follow certain relationships (for more details about scaling laws and their interrelations see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Stanley1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Dhar1">[34]</xref>).</p>
        <p>Interestingly, the results for <italic>f(d)</italic>, <italic>f(IAI)</italic>, and <italic>S(t,d)</italic> were similar for the neuronal avalanches and the subsampled model avalanches (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002985.s002">Figures S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002985.s003">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002985.s004">S4</xref>). However, none of the distributions scaled as a power law. The deviations from power law scaling in the model were due to subsampling, since the fully sampled model follows the scaling laws <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Dhar1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Jensen1">[35]</xref>, and therefore subsampling may have caused the observed deviations from scaling laws in neuronal avalanches as well.</p>
        <p>As a consequence the observed deviation from scaling laws for the neuronal avalanches does not allow us to reject the hypothesis that the human brain operates near criticality. In contrast - since the results for the neuronal avalanches and the subsampled model avalanches were qualitatively similar - we expect the neuronal avalanches to follow the scaling laws if sampled with even more electrode contacts.</p>

        <title>Neuronal avalanche size distributions differ between vigilance states</title>
        <p>As mentioned before, the neuronal dynamics across vigilance states differed substantially (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002985.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Indeed, vigilance states are classified into wake state, REM sleep, and non-REM (NREM) sleep stages by the characteristics of their neural mass signal, e.g. the sleep spindles, the slow waves, and sawtooth waves. For each vigilance state we therefore also calculated the avalanche distribution <italic>f(s)</italic> separately. We found that each of the avalanche distributions closely followed a power law with cutoff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002985-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting that neuronal dynamics of each of the vigilance states was close to the SOC state. Fitting of <italic>f(s)</italic> of each vigilance state to a power law with cutoff (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002985.e001">eq. 1</xref>) resulted in τ = {1.52, 1.46, 1.24, 1.32} with α = {0.0064, 0.0169, 0.0573, 0.0415} from deep sleep to wakefulness.</p>
        <p>It is remarkable that the avalanche distribution <italic>f(s)</italic> approximated a power law for each of the vigilance states, given the differences in neuronal dynamics between these states. However, we also found that the avalanche distributions varied systematically across different vigilance states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002985-g004">Figure 4A,B</xref>). The distributions for REM decayed faster than those for SWS (s3/s4, and s2). This can be seen in <italic>f(s)</italic> for each single recording night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002985-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). To quantify these differences systematically, we calculated the <italic>normalized</italic> mean avalanche size <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for each of the vigilance states at each parameter combination (<italic>r, bs</italic>). We used <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as a measure, since any change in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> implies a change in <italic>f(s)</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002985-g006">Figure 6A</xref> shows <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> separately for each night and each state (colored) over the temporal scale (<italic>bs</italic>). <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was always larger during SWS, and smaller during REM sleep. The same results held for the relative mean avalanche duration <italic>đ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002985-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), and the relative branching parameter σ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002985-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). All these results held across all event rates and temporal scales (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002985.s006">Figure S6</xref>). To test these results for significance across all rates and temporal scales, we used a randomization statistic with cluster-based corrections for multiple comparisons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Maris1">[25]</xref>.

        <p>Independently of the framework of SOC, the differences in avalanche distributions with vigilance states reflected changes in the underlying correlation structure between brain areas.

        <title>Changes in neuronal avalanche distributions reflect deviations from criticality</title>
        <p>We observed changes in the neuronal avalanche measures <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <italic>đ</italic> and σ with vigilance states, implying systematic changes in the avalanche distributions. Changes in the avalanche distributions can either be caused by <italic>deviations</italic> from power law scaling or by <italic>changes in the critical exponent</italic> τ (larger τ would lead to smaller <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). While the first indicates deviations from the criticality to sub- or supercritical regimes, the second indicates different critical states. Note that this also holds for high dimensional systems with “critical manifolds” instead of critical states: On these critical manifolds power law scaling holds while deviations from the critical manifolds are reflected in deviations from power law scaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Stanley1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Henkel1">[33]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The first case, <italic>deviations</italic> from power law scaling, might occur in neural networks by changing the effective synaptic strength between units. For example, weakening the effective synaptic strength would impede avalanche propagation and tune a critical network to the subcritical regime. The second case, <italic>changes in critical exponents</italic>, can occur with changes in the topology of the model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Friedman1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Priesemann1">[18]</xref>. For example, if one changes the topology of the 2D SOC model from next neighbor connectivity to random connectivity, while keeping the number and strength of connections fixed, τ increases from <italic>1.1</italic> to <italic>1.4</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Priesemann1">[18]</xref>.</p>
        <p>To distinguish these two alternatives – deviations from power law scaling versus power law scaling with different exponents – we fitted <italic>f(s)</italic> to the following function:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002985.e023"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>If α = <italic>0</italic>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a power law proper (with its best fitting τ), while α≠<italic>0</italic> indicates deviations from a power law. In this sense, α serves as a measure of criticality, since α quantifies the deviation from a power law distribution. Thus, a systematic change in α with vigilance states indicates systematic deviations from power law scaling.</p>
        <p>We fitted <italic>f(s)</italic> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for each recording night, vigilance state, rate and bin size and found that the observed α was small (α = <italic>0.043±0.065</italic>), but it significantly depended on the vigilance state (cluster based randomization test on F-metric, <italic>p&lt;0.001</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Maris1">[25]</xref>). In detail, α was smallest for deep sleep (s3/s4 and s2), and largest for REM. These results are in line with the previous results on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <italic>đ</italic> and σ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002985-g007">Figure 7</xref>).

        <p>For the neuronal avalanche size distribution in humans, we found small deviations from power law scaling with vigilance states, which were also reflected in the avalanche measures <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <italic>đ</italic>, and σ. These deviations from power law scaling likely reflect transitions away from criticality as pointed out above. Here we want to investigate how such changes in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <italic>đ</italic>, and σ arise from a SOC model. In our model, transitions from sub- to supercriticality can be mediated by changes in effective synaptic strength <italic>dE</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Brker1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-DeCarvalho1">[37]</xref>. Such changes in <italic>dE</italic> during sleep were shown to have a direct impact on LFP dynamics in a large scale model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Esser1">[38]</xref>. In our model, we applied very tiny changes of <italic>dE</italic> around the critical state (<italic>dE = 1</italic>). Indeed, an increase in <italic>dE</italic> resulted in more large and longer avalanches with a larger branching parameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002985-g004">Figure 4C,D</xref>). We quantified these effects systematically, using the relative measures <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <italic>đ</italic>, and σ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002985-g006">Figure 6D–F</xref>). These measures all became smaller with smaller <italic>dE</italic>, independent of the bin size. Qualitatively, the changes of the relative measures in our model avalanches and in the neuronal avalanches from humans were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002985-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Thus the differences in neuronal avalanches between vigilance states may be mediated by tiny changes in the effective synaptic strength <italic>dE</italic>.</p>
        <p>Note that the changes in <italic>dE</italic> in the model were very small, less than 1%, but nevertheless caused major changes in the avalanche measures, as expected near criticality. This in turn suggests for the human brain that the effective synaptic strength remains within a very narrow range from wakefulness to deep sleep.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>For the neuronal avalanches from humans, we found on the one hand approximate power law scaling for each of the vigilance states, on the other hand we found significant differences between the <italic>f(s)</italic>, <italic>f(d)</italic> and σ with vigilances states. These differences reflected deviations from criticality rather than different critical states (see results section). This naturally leads to the question, how the vigilance states are mapped on critical, sub- and supercritical dynamics.</p>
      <p>An ad hoc hypothesis may be that SWS was slightly supercritical, because it showed the largest avalanche measures; the wake state might then be closest to criticality, and REM, which showed the smallest avalanche measures, was in the subcritical regime. Supercritical states were observed for cortical slices and manifested as increased fraction of avalanches which span all recording sites (<italic>s≈N</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Friedman1">[8]</xref>, and in SOCM and supercritical branching processes they were characterized by an increased number of large avalanches with <italic>s&gt;N</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002985-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, red traces) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Taylor1">[39]</xref>. However, for SWS we did not observe any of the characteristic features of the supercritical regime. We neither observed a peak in <italic>f(s)</italic> around <italic>s≈N≈50</italic> nor an increased number of large avalanches with <italic>s&gt;50</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002985-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Therefore, we suggest that in the context of criticality, the human brain still operates very close to the critical state but in a subcritical regime. Supporting evidence for this interpretation is provided by the subcritical branching parameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002985-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>
      <p>The above hypothesis is fully in line with results on α, a measure for the deviation from power law scaling: α was closest to zero for SWS, indicating that SWS was closest to the critical state. α was larger (and positive) for REM and wakefulness, indicating deviations from criticality to the subcritical regime. More precisely, α was largest for REM, intermediate for wakefulness and smallest for SWS, which is in agreement with the results for the avalanche measures discussed above. Based on α, the avalanche measures and the lack of evidence for supercriticality, we suggest that the human brain operates very close to the critical state but in a subcritical regime, where SWS is most close to criticality, wakefulness is slightly more subcritical, and REM sleep is even more subcritical.</p>
      <p>One may argue that biological systems are not physical models and in real world biological systems small changes between subcritical and critical states, based on putative changes in <italic>dE</italic> of ∼0.1% might be negligible. However, these small changes in <italic>dE</italic> had major impact on the avalanche dynamics in the modified SOC models (manifested in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <italic>đ</italic>, and σ). Moreover, in our data, the differences with vigilance states were highly consistent across the ten recording nights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002985-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Therefore, we do not attribute them to biological variability.</p>
      <p>The differences in avalanche measures were not caused by a trivial change in the amplitude of the LFP with vigilance states. An increase in LFP amplitude is indeed observed from wakefulness to deep sleep, and it would directly result in larger avalanches if a constant threshold across all vigilance states had been applied. However, we adjusted the threshold for each vigilance state separately such that each electrode contributed with same event rate <italic>r</italic>. Putative changes in the LFP amplitude are therefore <italic>not</italic> the cause for changes in avalanche measures with vigilance states. Instead, the avalanche measures directly reflect the global correlation structure of <italic>enhanced activity</italic> between recording sites or brain areas.</p>
      <p>Since the differences in avalanche measures were highly systematic and our results point to a slightly subcritical mode of operation, we may ask how to reconcile this with theoretical considerations that stress the computational optimality of the critical state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Bertschinger1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Haldeman1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Maass1">[40]</xref>. In this respect it is important to note that some of these studies actually argue for a mode of operation that is close to critical and thereby in line with our findings. Moreover, one recent study demonstrated optimal task performance in the subcritical regime, although network evolution started out in a critical state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Lazar1">[41]</xref>. One explanation for the differences between the theoretical models is that Lazar's model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Lazar1">[41]</xref> incorporated learning and structured input, which was missing from the earlier works. As learning and structured input are relevant to the brain, this suggest that a slightly subcritical regime for neuronal dynamics is in fact optimal.</p>
      <p>In addition, computational optimality may not have been the only evolutionary constraint, but stability might have been an additional goal. Stability is compromised in the supercritical state as the supercritical state was linked to epileptic behaviour <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Beggs1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Hsu1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Hobbs1">[43]</xref>. It may well be that the brain in all its vigilance states maintains a safety margin to the supercritical state, because supercriticality allows for runaway activity, which is pathological, energy demanding and may induce erroneous learning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Hsu1">[42]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The idea that the brain maintains a safety margin to the critical state was also brought forward by Pearlmutter and Houghton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Pearlmutter1">[44]</xref>. In addition they proposed that during wakefulness the brain approaches the critical state, while during sleep the safety margin is re-established again. This is in line with Tononi's proposal of synaptic downscaling during sleep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Tononi2">[13]</xref>. We tested on our data whether we find any evidence for synaptic re- scaling in the avalanche measures over the course of the night or within a single sleep cycle, but did not find any systematic effect across patients (results not shown). This can have a multitude of reasons, but for now our avalanche analyses could not confirm the synaptic rescaling hypothesis.</p>
      <p>Despite our claim that the brain operates in the subcritical regime, the main differences of our study to previous ones are minor regarding the main findings with respects to avalanche distributions. We found that among the available distributions a power law distribution with cutoff best described the empirical avalanche distribution - in line with previous findings <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Klaus1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Petermann1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Tagliazucchi1">[47]</xref>. However, the availability of brain states with distinct dynamics and the observation of small but consistent differences in their avalanche measures forced us to conclude that the brain cannot always operate in the critical state. Furthermore, detailed analysis of the avalanche distributions, the branching parameter and a comparison to modeling results led us to the conclusion that the brain in fact operates in the subcritical regime.</p>
      <p>Our study differs from two previous studies in rats and humans which evaluated different vigilance states but did not report differences in avalanche dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Ribeiro1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Dehghani1">[49]</xref>. The differences with vigilance states may have remained hidden in the variability of the recordings, since the number of recording sites, neurons, and their firing rates have impact on the avalanche measures, and differences only became obvious after proper normalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002985-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p>
      <p>While the differences between vigilance states were highly stable across recording nights and patients, we can only speculate about their underlying physiological mechanisms. A potential mechanism, suggested by our SOCM, is a change in effective synaptic strength. This change may well be mediated by the global action of neuromodulators, since neuromodulators, such as acetylcholine (ACh), influence vigilance states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Tsodyks1">[50]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Mark1">[52]</xref> and supposedly modify the correlation structure between brain areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-AvellaGonzalez1">[53]</xref>. In fact, basal forebrain ACh release showed the same dependence on vigilance states in other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Vazquez1">[54]</xref> as the avalanche sizes reported here: REM sleep showed the highest ACh levels and the largest avalanches, wakefulness intermediate ones, and SWS the smallest. We hypothesize that the observed fragmentation of avalanches in REM sleep was mediated by increased levels of ACh, as proposed in a model by Avella-Gonzalez and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-AvellaGonzalez1">[53]</xref>. Regarding the observed increase in avalanche sizes with SWS, this may be linked to up- and down-states, which are typically synchronized across brain areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-SIROTA1">[55]</xref>. However, the precise action and especially the interaction of various neuromodulators in sleep have not been sorted out. In fact, their precise role has not even been fully understood in small systems with less then 30 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Marder1">[56]</xref>, and it would be premature to draw strong conclusion on the relationship between neuromodulators and neuronal avalanches.</p>
      <p>Independent of the details of modulator actions, our results suggest that the effective synaptic strength <italic>dE</italic> stays tuned to a very narrow range of operation from wakefulness to deep sleep. Remember that in the model a change in <italic>dE</italic> of 0.2% resulted in changes in the avalanche measures of ∼5% - an effect of a size that was similar to what we observed in our human data. The question how the neural network maintains itself in this very narrow dynamical range remains open.</p>
      <p>Independent of the context of SOC, the analysis of neuronal avalanches serves as a very useful measure to characterize the global correlation structure in massively parallel recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002985-g001">Figure 1</xref>). It captures the spatio-temporal dynamics beyond pairwise interactions and therefore may become increasingly important for the analysis of multisite recordings. Applying these avalanche measures, we could confirm that LFP activity across brain areas shows enhanced correlations during SWS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Volgushev1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Quyen1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-BotellaSoler1">[58]</xref>. In contrast, and to our surprise, REM showed a decrease in global correlation strength compared to wakefulness. The association of REM with decreased correlations is to the best of our knowledge new. A decrease in correlation strength during some phase of sleep, however, has been proposed by theoretical studies about learning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Hinton1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Weber1">[60]</xref>. We propose that this decorrelation takes place during REM sleep. In sum, the analysis of neuronal avalanches confirmed correlated dynamics across brain areas in SWS and revealed a new phenomenon, namely the fragmented dynamics of REM sleep. Interestingly, wakefulness did not take an extreme value but its brain dynamics stayed just between the “fragmented” REM and the “correlated” SWS.</p>
      <p>To conclude, our analyses of avalanche dynamics from human intracranial depth recordings indicated that the human brain operates close to criticality from wakefulness to deep sleep, as indicated by a power-law like distribution of avalanche sizes for each vigilance state. However, the sizes of neuronal avalanches changed with vigilance states: SWS showed larger and longer avalanches, wakefulness showed intermediate ones, and REM showed smaller and shorter ones. The larger avalanches of SWS confirm the correlated character of SWS dynamics across brain areas, while the smaller avalanches of REM revealed a fragmented organization of brain dynamics compared to wakefulness and SWS. Comparisons to a SOC model composed of integrate and fire units suggest that these differences may arise from tiny changes in effective synaptic strength, and that – in the context of criticality – the brain undergoes transitions within the subcritical regime close to but not including the critical state proper.</p>

          <p>We analyzed data from five subjects (3 females (aged 21, 23, and 27), two males; (aged 25 and 48)) with refractory partial epilepsy undergoing presurgical evaluation. The subjects were hospitalized between February 2005 and March 2007 in the epilepsy unit at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital in Paris. All patients gave their informed consent and procedures were approved by the local ethical committee (CCP). Each patient was continuously recorded during several days (duration range, 9–20 days; mean duration, 16 days) with intracranial and scalp electrodes (Nicolet acquisition system, CA, US). Depth electrodes were composed of 4 to 10 cylindrical contacts 2.3-mm long, 1-mm in diameter, 10-mm apart center-to-center, mounted on a 1 mm wide flexible plastic probe. Pre and post implantation MRI scans were evaluated to anatomically locate each contact along the electrode trajectory. The placement of electrodes within each patient was determined solely by clinical criteria. Signals were digitized at 400 Hz. For sleep data, two seizure-free nights with at least two complete sleep cycles were chosen from each of the subjects; in addition, for wakefulness data, between one and four seizure free recording hours were chosen preceding or following the night (for eight out of the ten nights). For each night, sleep stages were scored using the software Somnologica Studio (Embla Systems, Inc, CO, USA) and scores were visually confirmed by a time-frequency analysis. The four sleep stages were: REM, s1, s2, and s3/s4. (Sleep stages s3 and s4 were combined to s3/s4 to adapt to the AASM standards (REM, N1, N2, N3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Iber1">[61]</xref>, and s1 could not be used for the analysis because not all patients showed sufficiently long s1 sleep intervals). These three sleep stages together with the wake state made up the four vigilance states.</p>
          <p>The five subjects were implanted with (44, 48, 50, 50, and 63) intracranial LFP recording sites. In total 7 recording sites were excluded from the analysis due to artifacts and thus we used (44, 48, 45, 50, and 61) recordings sites for data evaluation. All LFP were lowpass filtered at 40 Hz (4<sup>th</sup> order butterworth, MATLAB) to reduce the impact of line noise.</p>

          <title>Event definition for avalanches</title>
          <p>Neuronal avalanches are spatiotemporal clusters of events which are separated by phases of quiescence. In the following, we define the events, the phases of quiescence between avalanches and several avalanche measures, following closely the procedures of Beggs and Plenz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Priesemann1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Beggs1">[19]</xref>. For the event definition, we calculated the area under the positive deflection lobes between two zero crossings of the LFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002985-g002">Figure 2</xref>, box) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Priesemann1">[18]</xref>. As LFP-voltages reflect current flows via Ohm's law, this time integral, the area under the voltage curve, is proportional to the total amount of displaced charges and hence describes the departure from equilibrium (charge neutrality) quantitatively – in contrast to simple voltage peaks. To obtain binary events from the LFP, we applied a threshold to the area values under the LFP deflection lobe. The threshold was selected such that each recording site in each interval of constant vigilance state had the same event rate <italic>r</italic>. Thereby each site at each vigilance state had the same “chance” to contribute to the avalanches. We chose to fix the event rate and not the threshold, because a fixed threshold is sensitive to changes in the LFP on one electrode, while we were interested in the propagation pattern of waves of <italic>enhanced activity</italic> – independent of the precise LFP shape that depends on vigilance states and also might depend on local tissue properties. With imposing a fixed event rate, we can distinguish whether the avalanches are rather fragmented or span the entire system. To demonstrate that our results did not depend on a specific choice for the event rate, we used a range of rates <italic>r</italic> = {1/10 Hz; 1/4 Hz; 1/2 Hz; 1 Hz}.</p>

The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a function of the event rate <italic>r</italic> defined above and the total number of recording sites <italic>N</italic>:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002985.e034"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>As an example, for <italic>r</italic> = <italic>1Hz</italic> and <italic>N</italic> = <italic>50</italic> electrodes, this resulted in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 20 ms, while for <italic>r</italic> = <italic>0.1Hz</italic> and <italic>N</italic> = <italic>50</italic>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 200 ms. We applied a large range of bin sizes <italic>bs</italic> = [1/32; 1/16; 1/8; 1/4; 1/2; 1; 2; 4] <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
          <p>Using this binning, an avalanche is defined as the cluster of events in subsequent non-empty time bins, and subsequent avalanches are separated by empty time bins. The avalanche size <italic>s</italic> is then the total number of binary events in an avalanche, and the avalanche duration <italic>d</italic> is the number of time bins it covers. The avalanche size distribution <italic>f(s)</italic> is the frequency distribution of avalanche sizes, as the avalanche duration distribution <italic>f(d)</italic> is the frequency distribution of durations. The corresponding probability distributions are <italic>p(s)</italic> and <italic>p(d)</italic>.</p>
          <p>The above definitions of the bin size imposed practical limits on its range. The <italic>bs</italic> was limited on the lower end by the sampling rate resolution (<italic>2.5 ms</italic>) and on the upper end by the lack of pauses. In addition, for <italic>bs&gt;1</italic><inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, subsequent avalanches are “glued” together and one starts implicitly analyzing the temporal distribution of avalanches instead of the size distribution of single avalanches.</p>
          <p>The avalanche size distribution <italic>f(s)</italic> was calculated for each night and for each sleep stage separately. To compare <italic>f(s)</italic> between sleep stages, we calculated the normalized mean avalanche size <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for each vigilance state,<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002985.e040"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <italic>N</italic> is the number of recording sites and Ξ is the normalization factor, namely the mean avalanche size over all vigilance states of one night:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002985.e041"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula><inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denoted the mean over all vigilance states <italic>v</italic>. The normalization <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> accounted for the difference in <italic>N</italic> across patients. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was calculated for each recording night, <italic>bs</italic> and r separately. The same was done to calculate the normalized mean avalanche duration <italic>đ</italic>.</p>
          <p>In addition to the avalanche size and durations, we estimated the branching parameter σ. It describes whether activity expands (σ&gt;<italic>1</italic>) or dies out (σ&lt;<italic>1</italic>). For a single transition, σ′ was defined as the number of events in one time bin divided by the number of events in its preceding time bin. σ then is the average over all σ′ with non-zero preceding time bins. The normalized σ for each vigilance state <italic>v</italic> was calculated separately for each night, rate and <italic>bs</italic>. It was defined analog to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <italic>đ</italic> as σ/&lt;σ&gt;<italic><sub>v</sub></italic>.</p>
          <p>Further, the <italic>IEI</italic> was defined as the time interval between two subsequent events, taking into account all events across all channels. The distribution of <italic>IEI</italic> is denoted as <italic>f(IEI)</italic>. The relation between the <italic>IEI</italic> to the Inter Avalanche Interval <italic>(IAI)</italic> depends on the <italic>bs</italic> as follows: All <italic>IEI</italic> which are larger than <italic>bs</italic>·<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> contribute to the <italic>f(IAI)</italic>.</p>
          <p>Near criticality, the activity profile during a single avalanche is expected to show a characteristic shape <italic>F(t/d)</italic>, which simply scales with the avalanche duration <italic>d</italic> as follows: <italic>S(t,d) = F(t/d) d<sup>b</sup></italic>, where <italic>S(t,d)</italic> is the number of events at time <italic>t</italic> in an avalanche of duration <italic>d</italic>, and <italic>b</italic> is a critical exponent (note that in criticality literature <italic>b = 1</italic>/σν<italic>z-1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Sethna1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Henkel1">[33]</xref>, but for simplicity we use <italic>b</italic> here). To test whether this relationship holds for the experimental data, we first obtained <italic>S(t,d)</italic> for each <italic>d</italic> (applying temporal bins). From these <italic>S(t,d)</italic> we obtained a collapse of all <italic>S(t,d)</italic> by rescaling the time axes to <italic>t/d</italic>, and rescaling the amplitude with a scaling factor <italic>χ(d)</italic> which was defined such that it minimized the absolute differences between the curves. If then the scaling factor <italic>χ(d)</italic> followed a power law relationship, <italic>χ(d)</italic>∼<italic>d<sup>b</sup></italic>, this indicates that the system is close to criticality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Friedman1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Sethna1">[31]</xref>.</p>
          <p>We did the same analysis on the SOC model. For the fully sampled model it is straight forward to estimate avalanche size and duration. However, for the subsampled model a single “real” avalanche can appear, disappear and reappear on the subset of sites, leading to an observed time series of events, which showed pauses. On this time series, we applied temporal bins, just like for the experimental data, aligning the bins to random starting points to avoid any bias. We then analyzed these events the same way as for the experimental data: after applying temporal binning, we extracted the avalanche shapes <italic>S(t,d)</italic>, and estimated the scaling factor <italic>χ(d)</italic>. We analyzed this measure only for <italic>d≥8</italic> samples (which equals 20 ms at a rate of 400 Hz in the experiment), since shorter <italic>d</italic> have too few time points to derive the shape function <italic>F(t/d)</italic>.</p>
          <p>In each patient, most electrode contacts were placed in the neocortex (NC), while a few were in the amygdala or hippocampus (AH). To test whether these groups of contacts contributed differently to the avalanches, we calculated for each contact <italic>c</italic> the probability <italic>p<sub>c</sub>(s)</italic> to participated in an avalanche of size <italic>s</italic> for <italic>s = {1, N}</italic>, where <italic>N</italic> is the total number of contacts. We then tested whether <italic>p<sub>c</sub>(s)</italic> for the NC contacts differed from <italic>p<sub>c</sub>(s)</italic> for the AH contacts across patients. We applied cluster based randomization on the T-metric as described by Maris and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Maris1">[25]</xref>, (see below).</p>

          <p>The self-organized critical model (SOCM) we used here is the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Bak1">[26]</xref>. It was run on a 3D grid of 25×25×25 = 15625 sites. Each site is connected with its six next neighbors. Each site (x,y,z) carries a certain level of energy, <italic>E(x,y,z,t)</italic> at time t, and if that level exceeds a threshold of six, it distributes <italic>dE</italic> = 1 to each of its six next neighbors in a process referred to as a toppling:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002985.e048"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002985.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>with <italic>dE</italic> = 1. (x±1,y±1,z±1) denote the 6 next neighbors of <italic>(x,y,z)</italic>. In the subsequent step after the toppling the <italic>E</italic> of the next neighbors may cross threshold and this neighbor will topple. This chain reaction triggers a spatiotemporal wave or avalanche which propagates through the 3D grid. Outside the grid <italic>E</italic> = 0 holds, i.e. open boundary conditions. If all sites on the grid have energy levels below threshold the avalanche terminates. A new avalanche can be triggered by adding one energy unit to a randomly selected site.</p>
          <p>For this model, the size <italic>s</italic> of an avalanche is defined as the total number of topplings during a single avalanche. The frequency distribution <italic>f(s)</italic> of avalanche sizes shows a power law distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002985-Bak1">[26]</xref>. We modified the SOCM as follows: We systematically changed the signal propagation efficacy <italic>dE</italic> (representing synaptic strength) between the model sites. When changing <italic>dE</italic>, the next neighbors received <italic>dE&lt;1</italic> or <italic>dE&gt;1</italic>. This shifted the dynamics of the model to subcritical and supercritical states, respectively.</p>

          <title>Simulation of avalanche size distributions from 44 units with various types of correlations</title>
          <p>The avalanche size distribution in a neural network depends on the correlation structure between the units. To demonstrate this effect, we ran <italic>N = 44</italic> units with varying correlation structures between their activity.

          <p>This figure relates to the main <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002985-g006">figure 6</xref>. It shows the same measures, namely the relative mean size and duration, and the relative branching parameter, however, it shows the measures for all event rates (top to bottom: 0.1Hz, 0.25Hz 0.5Hz and 1Hz). All the three measures were here plotted for each recording night, bin size (x-axes), and rate separately. (+) indicate the mean across all recording nights. For better visualization, we plotted the <italic>relative</italic> measures, which were defined as relative change in a measure across vigilance states for each patient at a certain bin size and rate. For most parameters, SWS showed larger avalanche measures than REM sleep. Wakefulness tended to show intermediate values. (Note that for large event rates (bottom two rows), values at small bin sizes are not defined, because the bin width was smaller than the sampling rate interval.)</p>

        <label>Table S1</label>
        <caption>
          <p>This table relates to the main <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002985-g003">figure 3</xref> and to the supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002985.s001">figure S1</xref>, and provides information on the quality of fits to <italic>f(s)</italic>. To test, whether a power law or an alternative function provided the best fit to the avalanche distributions <italic>f(s)</italic>, we fitted various functions (power law, Poisson, exponential, log- normal, stretched exponential, and power law with cutoff) to <italic>f(s)</italic> from the human data and the self- organized critical model (SOCM). The fit quality relative to the power law proper is indicated by <italic>R</italic>, the log likelihood ratio. A negative <italic>R</italic> indicates a better fit than the power law proper. For each <italic>f(s)</italic>, <italic>R</italic> was smallest for the power law with cutoff (last column, marked bold), indicating that the power law with cutoff provided the best fit. However, not even the power law with cutoff provided a sufficiently good fit to <italic>f(s)</italic> (Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness of fit test (KS test), indicated in the last column: ‘none’ indicates <italic>p&lt;0.01</italic> for the KS test). This held for all <italic>f(s)</italic>, being it from the human data or the SOC model. That the SOC model did not pass the test was very much to our surprise since the SOC model is “known” to show a power law for <italic>f(s)</italic>. In principle, finding a function that would pass the KS test could have been achieved by using more functions with more free parameters. However, this might not teach us more about neuronal avalanches. To keep it simple, and since the differences between the bivariate fits were small (figure and table), we opted to use both, a power law proper and a power law with cutoff as model functions for the characterization of the avalanche distributions – keeping in mind that neither the neuronal avalanches nor the SOC model avalanches followed a power law in the strict sense.</p>
