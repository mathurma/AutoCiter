<abstract>
<p>Humans move frequently and tend to carry parasites among areas with endemic malaria and into areas where local transmission is unsustainable. Human-mediated parasite mobility can thus sustain parasite populations in areas where they would otherwise be absent. Data describing human mobility and malaria epidemiology can help classify landscapes into parasite demographic sources and sinks, ecological concepts that have parallels in malaria control discussions of transmission foci. By linking transmission to parasite flow, it is possible to stratify landscapes for malaria control and elimination, as sources are disproportionately important to the regional persistence of malaria parasites. Here, we identify putative malaria sources and sinks for pre-elimination Namibia using malaria parasite rate (PR) maps and call data records from mobile phones, using a steady-state analysis of a malaria transmission model to infer where infections most likely occurred. We also examined how the landscape of transmission and burden changed from the pre-elimination setting by comparing the location and extent of predicted pre-elimination transmission foci with modeled incidence for 2009. This comparison suggests that while transmission was spatially focal pre-elimination, the spatial distribution of cases changed as burden declined. The changing spatial distribution of burden could be due to importation, with cases focused around importation hotspots, or due to heterogeneous application of elimination effort. While this framework is an important step towards understanding progressive changes in malaria distribution and the role of subnational transmission dynamics in a policy-relevant way, future work should account for international parasite movement, utilize real time surveillance data, and relax the steady state assumption required by the presented model.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>For countries considering pursuing malaria elimination, understanding where malaria transmission occurs is crucial for intervention planning. By identifying the areas that act as sources of malaria parasites, elimination programs can target efforts to end local transmission and achieve nationwide elimination. Mapping parasite sources requires a modeling framework that integrates malaria burden and human movement information, however, as human mobility facilitates parasite spread and drives source-sink disease dynamics. In this study, we present a mathematical model that can be used to identify areas with self-sustaining malaria transmission when analyzed at equilibrium. We demonstrate how this method can inform elimination planning for countries with stable low transmission using data from Namibia. The maps of sources and sinks created using this method can be used to direct policy and target areas with self-sustaining malaria transmission in countries with stable transmission. Finally, we compare the predicted extent of transmission foci with more recent maps of incidence, to determine whether local transmission likely retreated into focal areas and the potential importance of importation.</p>

<meta-value>Malaria prevalence data are freely available from Malaria Atlas Project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.map.ox.ac.uk" xlink:type="simple">www.map.ox.ac.uk</ext-link>). Incidence data are from the published article "Estimation of malaria incidence in northern Namibia in 2009 using Bayesian conditional-autoregressive spatial-temporal models" (Spatial and Spatio-temporal Epidemiology, Alegana et al. 2013). These incidence data are available in the Spatial and Spatio-temporal Epidemiology paper as well as directly from the authors, particularly lead author Victor Alegana, who may be contacted at <email xlink:type="simple">vaa1g10@soton.ac.uk</email>. Mobile phone data are third-party data and were obtained under a data-sharing agreement with Mobile Telecommunications Limited Namibia. These data were provided to us with permission for publication through Bonita Graupe, Manager for IT Development for MTC. As this data set is owned by MTC, the appropriate contact for this data set at MTC is Ms Graupe, who can be contacted at <email xlink:type="simple">BGraupe@mtc.com.na</email>. We have provided an aggregated version of this mobile phone data as a supplement to the manuscript (aggregated flows and proportions of time spent between areas), aggregated to the constituency level in Namibia (see Supporting Information). These data can be used to reproduce the analysis presented in the manuscript and for other purposes. Because these are aggregated data, using the constituency-level data will provide results similar but not identical to those in the manuscript (which used unaggregated tower-level data). While we cannot share widely the tower-level data due to the sensitivity of tower location and number information (considered proprietary by MTC), we have set up a Data Access Committee at the University of Southampton who can provide the tower-level data explicitly for reproduction of manuscript results. To mask proprietary information, we have jittered tower locations by up to 10km to hide their actual location information. We will provide the Data Access Committee information online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worldpop.org" xlink:type="simple">www.worldpop.org</ext-link> prior to publication, and this committee consists of Nick Ruktanonchai (<email xlink:type="simple">nr1e14@soton.ac.uk</email>), Andrew J Tatem (<email xlink:type="simple">andy.tatem@gmail.com</email>), Elisabeth zu Erbach-Schoenberg (<email xlink:type="simple">ezes1m13@soton.ac.uk</email>), and Jessica Steele (<email xlink:type="simple">steele.jessica@gmail.com</email>).

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Human malaria is caused by infection with <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> and four other species of parasites, accounting for around 600,000 deaths and 100–250M febrile episodes annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref001">1</xref>]. The global burden of malaria is declining, partly due to an increase in donor funding and scaled up distribution of vector control and effective medicines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref002">2</xref>]. Many countries have set the goal of eliminating malaria in the coming decades, which involves stopping transmission, emptying the parasite reservoir, and then managing imported malaria and potential outbreaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref003">3</xref>]. To continue this progress, methods of prioritizing particular areas for targeting control efforts have been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref005">5</xref>], requiring an understanding of the spatial patterns of transmission.</p>
<p>Since mosquitoes transmit the pathogen, and since the underlying distributions of mosquitoes and humans are highly heterogeneous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref006">6</xref>], so is the intensity of transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref007">7</xref>]. Heterogeneity in transmission is observed throughout on the road to elimination, providing an opportunity for spatial targeting of control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref007">7</xref>]. This heterogeneity in malaria transmission is driven by ecological and social factors such as Anopheline mosquito density, land use and agricultural practices, bed net use, wealth and education, access to and utilization of healthcare, and urbanization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref009">9</xref>], and these factors drive heterogeneity across all spatial scales, from very local [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref005">5</xref>] to national and global landscapes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref010">10</xref>]. Because of these spatially heterogeneous processes that drive transmission, malaria tends to persist in “foci”, or localized areas of self-sustaining transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref005">5</xref>]. Malaria burden can also be relatively high outside of foci, as human and mosquitoes transport parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref011">11</xref>]. Because they are the ultimate sources of local parasites, foci drive the spatial distribution of endemic malaria, and effective targeting requires their identification and understanding how human populations interact with them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Some statistical algorithms and <italic>ad hoc</italic> methods target foci for control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref013">13</xref>] and quantify change in their spatial extents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref013">13</xref>]. Despite this, no formal mathematical or mechanistic definition of a malaria focus exists, limiting practical application and ability to explain and predict changes in focal extent over time. One possible quantitative definition regards it as a demographic source or an area where reproductive success is, on average, high enough for some population to persist and export individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref014">14</xref>]. This definition is well-established, as spatial heterogeneity in demographic success and population dynamics has been explored in detail in ecological literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref015">15</xref>]. In this context, sources are self-sustaining areas of high demographic success, or areas where birth rates exceed death rates and excess individuals are exported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref014">14</xref>]. Sinks, on the other hand, are areas where populations require a constant flow of immigrants to persist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>For malaria parasites and other pathogens, demographic success is defined by reproductive numbers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref016">16</xref>]. In this case, a source is where an infection in one host tends to be propagated to more than one host and excess parasites tend to be exported to other areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref018">18</xref>]. For malaria, the basic reproductive number <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> has been both a useful threshold criterion for endemicity and a basis for setting intervention coverage targets. If <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> &gt; 1, malaria is expected to persist locally because each case causes more than one case, whereas pathogen transmission is not sustained over time if <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> &lt; 1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>The conventional definition of <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> describes transmission in some particular place disregarding malaria importation and the spatial configuration of malaria transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref019">19</xref>]. In fact, malaria often persists in areas where <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> &lt; 1, however, due to human and mosquito movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref020">20</xref>], termed “non-endemic transmission” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref022">22</xref>]. This non-endemic transmission is driven by both importation via incoming migrants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref023">23</xref>], and by residents infected with parasites during travel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref024">24</xref>]. As humans move more frequently and further, more areas outside of foci receive parasites via mosquito and human movement. These extra-focal areas may then harbor a nonzero fraction of people infected with malaria, or a nonzero parasite rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004846.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Extra-focal areas with infected people are ultimately demographic sinks of parasites, as parasite death rates exceed birth rates locally (represented by a local <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> &lt; 1) but those parasite populations are sustained through immigration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref014">14</xref>].</p>

<p>If burden is assumed to be stable spatially and temporally, ignoring parasite mobility leads to the incorrect conclusion that all malaria-endemic areas would have self-sustaining parasite populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref025">25</xref>]. Micro-epidemiological [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref026">26</xref>] and malaria metapopulation models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref020">20</xref>] can be used to identify which of these areas are actually transmission foci (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. sources, when paired with extra-focal human movement) by quantifying migration and modelling transmission within and among populations. By applying these methods to define transmission foci, novel methods for spatial targeting of control can accurately quantify <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> and identify areas with sustainable transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004846.g002">Fig 2</xref>). These methods can then improve efficiency in achieving important policy goals such as regional malaria elimination by guiding control targeting efforts.</p>

<title>Estimating local transmission intensity using a patch-based model with human mobility and a classical model without mobility.</title>
<p>In reality, transmission only occurs inside a transmission focus, though extra-focal patches may exhibit nonzero parasite rate at equilibrium due human-mediated parasite movement (bottom panel). Using a classical model without human mobility to estimate transmission capacity from PR (assuming PR is static) leads to the incorrect conclusion that all patches with nonzero PR have a basic reproductive number above 1 (top panel; blue). By accounting for human movement, a patch-based model can accurately determine the patches where transmission occurs (top panel, red).</p>

<p>Here, we demonstrate use of a method for identifying putative sources and sinks of malaria transmission in a multipatch setting at steady state with respect to prevalence (or parasite rate). Using malaria prevalence estimates with a call record dataset from mobile phones, we calculate the transmission patterns necessary to yield observed patterns of prevalence, assuming burden was not changing over time. We discuss this method’s utility for informing future elimination efforts in countries where malaria burden is generally low but stable, as transitioning towards elimination in these settings means concentrating activities on identifying and attacking transmission foci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref003">3</xref>]. As we analyze the presented model at equilibrium, it is not appropriate in areas where burden is changing through time.</p>
<p>In this case study, we use prevalence estimates from the pre-elimination phase in Namibia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref010">10</xref>] with 2010 mobile phone call record data to identify pre-elimination transmission foci. Because the survey data informing the prevalence estimates for Namibia used originated largely from pre-2000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref010">10</xref>], we assume these estimates represent a period when burden was relatively stable (matching the steady state assumption required by our method). Overall control was relatively limited during this time as Global Fund-supported efforts began in the early 2000s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref027">27</xref>], and case numbers did not drop significantly until after 2004 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref027">27</xref>]. Stability of burden cannot be confirmed with certainty without more historical data, however, as national-level incidence data were not available from before 2001 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref001">1</xref>]. As the output maps show historical transmission foci, practical application of the presented results is limited, though these historical foci allow us to compare against more recent malaria burden estimates to examine possible change in the spatial patterns of transmission over time. We compare the predicted transmission foci map with an incidence map reflecting burden in 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref026">26</xref>] to assess how transmission patterns may have changed between these time periods. We also use this analysis to assess the possible importance of internationally imported cases into non-focal areas on overall case distribution.</p>

<p>We employed a multipatch version of the Ross-Macdonald malaria transmission model, modifying a previously published model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref020">20</xref>] to integrate human movement in a way that could be parameterized using mobile phone records.

<p>The prevalence estimates used in this study were informed using prevalence surveys from before 2000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref010">10</xref>], representing a picture of nationwide transmission before major elimination efforts began in 2004 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref034">34</xref>]. Understanding how case distribution patterns have changed since this period remains an important question, however, and comparing pre-elimination focal extent with later incidence estimates can help visualize changes in transmission patterns and the possible role of importation. Therefore, we compare the map of transmission foci using the MAP prevalence surface with a map of modeled incidence for 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref026">26</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004846.g006">Fig 6</xref>). We compared incidence within and outside of health districts, by rasterizing the transmission foci and incidence layers and comparing incidence inside and outside foci.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Human movement is a key driver of spatiotemporal vector-borne disease dynamics, as pathogen exportation out of malaria foci sustains transmission across much larger spatial extents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref022">22</xref>]. People move often and for a variety of reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref035">35</xref>], including local routines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref036">36</xref>], short-term labor-related movement, and long-term migration, and in moving they disperse parasites typically further than mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref011">11</xref>]. Targeting the areas responsible for malaria persistence across landscapes, then, requires a quantitative framework that integrates human movement information and disease burden data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref037">37</xref>].</p>
<p>The presented method identifies transmission foci in settings with temporally static and generally low levels of malaria burden, using human mobility in a modeling framework rooted in ecological literature. Generally, the results produced by this study can help inform targeting efforts when elimination efforts begin in countries where burden is unchanging over time. We demonstrate use of this method in a case study with pre-elimination prevalence estimates and mobile phone data from Namibia, generating historical estimates of transmission capacity and highly resolved maps of malaria dynamics. Importantly, vectorial capacity and basic reproductive number estimates generated using this method are in the context of the transmission setting represented by the prevalence data. If a country is undergoing active malaria control, then the basic reproductive number calculated represents <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>, or the basic reproductive number given the current level of control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref038">38</xref>]. This method then can provide guidelines for interventions in addition to the baseline represented by the input data.</p>
<p>In this case study, we used prevalence estimates informed largely by pre-2000 surveys, causing our maps of transmission foci to reflect historical transmission patterns. Namibia has been experiencing dramatic declines in malaria burden over the past decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref027">27</xref>] and therefore no longer meets the steady state assumption required. While data were not available to confirm that malaria burden was stable pre-2000, overall burden during 2000–2004 was stable relative to the following decade, as active control efforts were limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref027">27</xref>]. Though our results therefore do not represent current transmission foci, they are a useful case study for areas considering pursuing elimination, and also allow us to examine changes in focal extent over time in Namibia by comparing with more recent burden data.</p>
<p>Our method predicts that several areas that appeared to sustain endemic transmission during the pre-elimination phase actually had unsustainable levels of transmission (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004846.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004846.g005">5</xref>). This highlights the importance of accounting for movement, as this suggests parasite populations were maintained in some areas by non-endemic transmission alone, while similar steady-state analyses using classical models must conclude that these areas have local <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> &gt; 1. The transmission landscape is also more heterogeneous when taking into account human mobility (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004846.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004846.g005">5</xref>), agreeing with recent research that malaria is highly dynamic across space and time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref039">39</xref>]. Areas where <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> &gt; 1 are potentially important targets for malaria elimination planning in stable pre-elimination countries, as reducing focal transmission to locally unsustainable levels will cause the parasite population to propagate at below-replacement levels system wide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>Because this case study generates historical transmission foci maps, we compared the predicted spatial patterns of pre-elimination foci with 2009 incidence to determine how transmission patterns may have changed over time. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004846.g006">Fig 6</xref> juxtaposes incidence in 2009 from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref026">26</xref>] with pre-elimination transmission foci. Districts overlapping foci had higher incidence than those outside foci (12.5 vs 8.7), suggesting that transmission in 2009 was higher in pre-elimination focal areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004846.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Overall, however, the spatial pattern of burden in 2009 differed with predicted pre-elimination foci, and there were numerous extra-focal areas where 2009 incidence was high, such as in eastern Namibia. High incidence in these extra-focal areas could be caused by changes in transmission capacity patterns driven by climatic changes or heterogeneous application of control effort. Perhaps highlighted by its presence near national borders, high extra-focal incidence could also be driven by international importation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref022">22</xref>], causing these extra-focal areas to be importation hotspots. The possibility of extra-focal importation hotspots near-elimination agrees with recent research on cross-border parasite mobility, which suggests that parasite importation generates significant amounts of onward transmission in areas with very low malaria endemicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref024">24</xref>]. Future passively detected health facility-level case data could refine the relationship between transmission foci, case distribution, and international human movement, as malaria control programs are increasingly recording travel history information when reporting cases. Populations in importation hotspots would be expected to have disproportionately high rates of travel, and malaria infected individuals in these areas will be more likely to have traveled to areas with higher transmission rates.</p>
<p>Though we applied this method to pre-elimination Namibia, this framework may be useful elsewhere if relevant population movement data are available and if the steady state assumption is satisfied. The prevalence estimates used in our Namibia case study are available globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref010">10</xref>], and while mobile phone data are not always available to parameterize movement, short-term movement can also be estimated using data informing other typologies of movement, including travel history surveys and census data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref011">11</xref>]. These datasets should originate from the same period and should be very recent to be most useful operationally. In our case study, prevalence and movement data originated from different years (pre-elimination vs. 2010). Though this discrepancy is not ideal, recent studies suggest movement patterns are generally stable and predictable across temporal scales, potentially suggestive of temporal regularity in movement patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref041">41</xref>]. These studies also suggest that though these types of movement are fundamentally different from those captured by mobile phone data, they likely exhibit similar patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref040">40</xref>]. On the other hand, accurate and current entomological and parasitological parameters are often difficult to obtain, and in this study, estimates for these parameters originated from various entomological studies. We also assumed human recovery rates were homogeneous across all patches, though this parameter varies in reality due to differences in treatment-seeking behavior and health system coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref042">42</xref>]. Though these estimates likely do not accurately reflect current malaria dynamics in Namibia, we found that model results are robust to uncertainty in entomological and parasitological parameters (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec006">Methods</xref>). Varying recovery rates regionally based on recent studies on treatment-seeking behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref042">42</xref>] also suggests limited effect on focal extent, as only 7 patches (or 2% of the 401 total patches) changed relative to the focus-defining criterion <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> <italic>= 1</italic>.</p>
<p>Further research will be necessary to extend utility of these analyses across transmission settings, particularly for countries with rapidly changing burden, as the presented analysis applies only to countries with stable and low levels of disease burden. In these countries, this framework could help target elimination campaigns on focal areas of transmission if elimination efforts are not currently ongoing. In the presented case study, we assume the transmission setting reflected in the prevalence surface used represents a period of relative stability, though pre-2000 burden data would be needed to confirm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref001">1</xref>]. Dynamic prevalence is likely the rule rather than the exception, however, as countries with active elimination campaigns are often experiencing similar declines in transmission. Transmission is highly seasonal in many malaria endemic countries (including Namibia), as well. We did not incorporate seasonality because the Malaria Atlas Project model provided an average annual prevalence, rather than season-specific estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref010">10</xref>]. This framework therefore will not be directly applicable to much of the globe until future work relaxes the steady state assumption and can account for seasonally and annually dynamic prevalence.</p>
<p>This framework would also be applicable to more areas if extended to use other metrics of malaria burden, as prevalence surveys become rarer and more uncertain near-elimination due to needing impractically large sample sizes. In such situations, country programs rely more heavily on clinical incidence measured at facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref043">43</xref>], which could be used as an alternative source of disease burden information. As these data are a spatially heterogeneous subset of actual disease burden, using these data to reflect overall burden must account for factors such as test positivity rates and health facility catchment sizes, similar to the model used to estimate incidence in 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref042">42</xref>]. Importantly, recent research has better-defined the relationship between clinical incidence and prevalence, a useful step towards using clinical incidence data in this framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref044">44</xref>].</p>
<p>Despite these challenges applying this framework in near-elimination settings, it represents an important step towards understanding and mapping transmission foci on dynamic landscapes. The spatiotemporal dynamics of malaria are critical for elimination efforts, as transmission is known to exhibit spatial and temporal heterogeneity across multiple scales, and humans transport parasites between areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref021">21</xref>]. Prioritizing parasite sources requires a targeting algorithm that incorporates human movement and transmission heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref004">4</xref>]. This method accounts for these factors to produce maps of vectorial capacity and <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> that are operationally useful for targeting malaria control and elimination efforts. Outputs from this modeling framework can improve the outcomes of malaria control efforts and set a foundation for future targeting efforts across the spectrum of transmission for regional malaria elimination.</p>

<p>Here <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic> are the proportions of infected humans and vectors respectively. The parameters <italic>r</italic> and <italic>μ</italic> respectively represent the recovery rate of infected humans, and the death rate of infectious mosquitoes. The parameter <italic>m</italic> is the ratio of the total number of mosquitoes divided by the total number of humans, and both values are assumed constant through time. The parameter <italic>a</italic> is the rate at which mosquitoes bite humans, and <italic>b</italic> and <italic>c</italic> are the probabilities of a successfully disease-transmitting bite by an infectious mosquito on a susceptible human, and by an infectious human to a susceptible mosquito, respectively. The parameter <italic>τ</italic> is the incubation period in mosquitoes.</p>
<p>The behavior of this model is well-understood, and essentially depends on the value of the basic reproductive number <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub>, which relates the number of secondary cases expected from a single case in a completely naïve population:

<title>Pre-elimination prevalence estimates</title>
<p>To quantify <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic>,<italic>i</italic></sub> using prevalence estimates, or estimates reflecting the proportion of people infected with malaria (<italic>X</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> in our model), we used a gridded prevalence surface estimated from parasite rate surveys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref010">10</xref>]. This gridded surface is freely available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.map.ox.ac.uk/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.map.ox.ac.uk/</ext-link>. This continuous parasite rate surface was created using a collection of historical <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> parasite rate (<italic>Pf</italic>PR) surveys and remotely sensed across the globe such that surveys near a given point were weighted by distance to inform prevalence at that point. This predicted surface was validated by comparing predicted with observed prevalence in randomly selected surveys and by comparing classification accuracy based on low, intermediate, and high endemicity classes (defined as &lt;5%, 5–40%, and &gt;40% <italic>PfPR</italic>, respectively). Validation statistics were calculated using a hold-out subset of the surveys with a model specifically fitted without these held-out data. Overall, there was a global mean error of only -0.56% and 79.5% of surveys were classified as the correct endemicity class, suggesting that this surface is generally accurately predicting parasite rate.</p>
<p>In Namibia, the prevalence surveys used originated from 1985 and 1990, while data for neighboring Botswana included 1997 surveys and Angola included 2006 and 2007 surveys. Because most of the data that would inform prevalence across Namibia then originate from before 2000, we assume that this surface represents a picture of prevalence throughout Namibia before elimination efforts were scaled up in 2004.</p>
<p>Each patch was a Voronoi polygon around a settlement centroid defined as a combination of urbanized areas, yielding 402 total patches. The population within each patch <italic>H</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> was calculated using WorldPop population estimates from 2010 (freely available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worldpop.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.worldpop.org</ext-link>). We then defined prevalence in each patch as the mean PR for each polygon.</p>

<title>2009 incidence estimates</title>
<p>In this study, we compare the predicted map of transmission foci with more recent incidence estimates from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref026">26</xref>], which are presented in this manuscript as-is. These incidence estimates were modeled at the constituency level (second level administrative unit; 108 total) and modeled incidence using routinely collected health management information systems (HMIS) data. Because these estimates only reflect cases that presented at health facilities, this incidence map used a model of treatment seeking behavior to adjust observed malaria cases based on test positivity rates and health facility utilization and define health facility catchment populations. The catchment population model was calibrated using a malaria indicator survey from 2009 in Namibia. The final model was the best of several models tested compared using deviance information criterion and the conditional predictive ordinate. The authors tested overall predictive performance of the final model by calculating a Pearson correlation coefficient for the best model using a hold-out set, which was calculated to be 0.56. These incidence estimates represent a highly transient near-elimination period, as malaria burden has declined steadily since 2004 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref027">27</xref>].</p>

<title>Namibia anonymized mobile phone call data records (CDRs)</title>
<p>We pair the pre-elimination prevalence surface with individual-level movement patterns obtained from a mobile phone dataset from Namibia, originating from 2010 to map historical transmission foci. Though the time period of the movement and prevalence datasets, recent studies suggest that human movement is typically regular and predictable across temporal scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref040">40</xref>] and recently-acquired mobile phone data from Namibia (2011–2014) suggest that movement patterns have been broadly regular seasonally and stable across years. Because of this, and because of Namibia’s political stability since independence in 1990, we assume that these 2010 mobile phone data likely reflect movement patterns similar to those that would have been observed in 2000.</p>
<p>From October 2010 to September 2011, a total of 9 billion communications from 1.19 million unique SIM cards were identified in the dataset, representing 85% of the estimated 1.4 million adult (aged over 15 years old) population of Namibia United Nations, “Volume I: Comprehensive Tables.”. We obtained these data through written agreements between Mobile Telecommunications Limited (MTC), the NVDCP, and the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI). These data are owned by MTC, who provided permission for publication of this manuscript given its use of these data. A map of cell tower coverage can be found online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mtc.com.na/coverage" xlink:type="simple">http://www.mtc.com.na/coverage</ext-link>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004846.s001">S1 Fig</xref> shows population density estimates throughout Namibia obtained from the WorldPop project for comparison of population densities in areas covered by cell towers.</p>
<p>In this dataset, each of the call data records was associated with one of 402 settlements across Namibia (representing the origin tower for each call), corresponding to settlement centroids defined as a combination of urbanized areas. Using this data, we collected all the records corresponding to each SIM. When people made multiple calls or texts in a given day, we only used the last CDR event of the day, assuming that this represented the best estimate of where they spent the night. We therefore only included movement that resulted in overnight stays in a different location, as malaria vectors in Namibia generally bite at night [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004846.ref027">27</xref>]. When sequential CDR events occurred at different locations, we assumed the person moved from the location of the initial CDR to the location of the subsequent CDR at the time halfway between the two CDRs. In this way, we were able to estimate the location of individual SIMs over the one year period, and therefore determine the proportion of nights spent in service of each cell phone tower (each tower corresponding to a patch in our analysis).</p>
<p>For each SIM, we assumed that an individual’s home patch was the patch where an individual spent most of their time. The connectivity matrix was defined by calculating <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> as the mean amount of time residents of patch <italic>i</italic> spent in <italic>j</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004846.g007">Fig 7</xref> shows the connectivity of different patches in the CDR dataset.
