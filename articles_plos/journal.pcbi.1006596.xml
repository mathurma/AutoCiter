<abstract>
<p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has the worst prognosis among solid malignancies and improved therapeutic strategies are needed to improve outcomes. Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and patient-derived organoids (PDO) serve as promising tools to identify new drugs with therapeutic potential in PDAC. For these preclinical disease models to be effective, they should both recapitulate the molecular heterogeneity of PDAC and validate patient-specific therapeutic sensitivities. To date however, deep characterization of the molecular heterogeneity of PDAC PDX and PDO models and comparison with matched human tumour remains largely unaddressed at the whole genome level. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the genetic landscape of 16 whole-genome pairs of tumours and matched PDX, from primary PDAC and liver metastasis, including a unique cohort of 5 ‘trios’ of matched primary tumour, PDX, and PDO. We developed a pipeline to score concordance between PDAC models and their paired human tumours for genomic events, including mutations, structural variations, and copy number variations. Tumour-model comparisons of mutations displayed single-gene concordance across major PDAC driver genes, but relatively poor agreement across the greater mutational load. Genome-wide and chromosome-centric analysis of structural variation (SV) events highlights previously unrecognized concordance across chromosomes that demonstrate clustered SV events. We found that polyploidy presented a major challenge when assessing copy number changes; however, ploidy-corrected copy number states suggest good agreement between donor-model pairs. Collectively, our investigations highlight that while PDXs and PDOs may serve as tractable and transplantable systems for probing the molecular properties of PDAC, these models may best serve <italic>selective</italic> analyses across different levels of genomic complexity.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>PDAC is a highly lethal, therapy-resistant malignancy, whose etiology is poorly understood. PDAC PDX and PDO have emerged as important <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> preclinical platforms to study PDAC at the molecular level. However, current investigations of these models provide limited snapshots of donor-model comparisons. To date, comprehensive assessment of PDAC disease models using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has not been performed. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the genetic landscape of 16 whole-genome pairs of tumors and matched PDX, from primary PDAC and liver metastasis, including a unique cohort of 5 ‘trios’ of matched primary tumor, PDX, and PDO. Globally, our findings indicate that PDX and PDO successfully recapitulate primary and metastatic disease at the level of simple somatic mutations mainly in driver genes. Disease model fidelity is not fully retained when assessing structural variation (SV) events, based on heterogeneity we observed across donor-model pairs. Strikingly, we found that clustering of large SV events across particular chromosomes is retained when the tumors are implanted into their respective disease models. Polyploidy presents a major challenge when assessing copy number changes; however, ploidy-corrected copy number states suggest good agreement between donor-model pairs. Our work provides biological insights into PDAC disease heterogeneity and presents a tractable pipeline for future WGS research that compares donor samples with matched PDX and PDO.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal, therapy-resistant malignancy, with a dismal overall 5-year survival rate that remains minimally unchanged over the past several decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref002">2</xref>]. Multiple failed clinical trials suggest that new approaches are necessary towards understanding PDAC molecular etiology and personalizing treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref003">3</xref>]. There is continued interest in <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> preclinical models that emulate the PDAC morphologic and genomic landscape, and which can ultimately serve as platforms to select and test candidate treatments.</p>
<p>An increasing number of experimental findings demonstrate that patient-derived organoids (PDO) and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) function as important preclinical platforms for investigations into the molecular landscape of cancer. Studies on cell lines and PDX have alluded to the agreement of tumour histo-architecture between disease models and primary human PDAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref005">5</xref>]. Huang <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that PDAC PDO maintain differentiation status, recreate histo-architectural heterogeneity, and retain patient-specific physiological changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref006">6</xref>]. Recent studies emphasized the fidelity of PDAC disease models at the genomic level by focusing on mutational profiles from whole-exome sequencing (WES) data. Xie <italic>et al</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref007">7</xref>], characterized somatic SNVs (single-nucleotide variations) of paired primary tumours and metastases and PDX, focusing on the distribution of allelic frequencies and functional mutations affecting known cancer drivers or tumour suppressors. Witkiewicz et al. and Knudsen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref008">8</xref>] compared cell lines and PDX models derived from the same tumour, demonstrating their utility in recapitulating patient-specific therapeutic sensitivities. Collectively, these studies provide valuable insight on the significance of PDAC models as ‘avatars’ for precision treatment, but their singular focus on mutational patterns and morphological changes fails to capture the full spectrum of complex genomic events that underlie PDAC heterogeneity.</p>
<p>Despite progress in sequencing efforts for PDAC, comprehensive assessment of PDAC disease models using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has not been performed. Using WGS, the genomic complexity of resected PDAC tumours has been thoroughly described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref012">12</xref>]. WGS analysis of primary and metastatic tumours has also shed light on catastrophic mitotic phenomena, such as chromothripsis, that occur with high frequency in the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref012">12</xref>]. WGS analysis of PDAC preclinical models would demonstrate how such models recapitulate complex genomic events, including structural variation (SV) and copy number variation (CNV) changes that play a significant role in PDAC tumourigenesis and drug response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>A large majority of PDAC disease model literature has focused on cell lines and PDX, while genomic characterization of PDO models remains unaddressed. This is despite growing findings that suggest that PDO, compared to PDX and cell lines, may present as models that can reconstitute niches most similar to PDAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref016">16</xref>]. In particular, the 3-D architecture of organoids promotes interaction between pancreatic cells (including normal pancreatic cells, paraneoplastic cells, and neoplastic pancreatic cells) and provides improved conditions for polarization of these epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref018">18</xref>]. Organoids have also been shown to exhibit ductal- and stage-specific characteristics, and recapitulate the full spectrum of PDAC tumourigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref016">16</xref>]. These promising findings pose an opportunity for probing such PDOs at the genomic level. Genomic analysis of PDOs remains a missing link to identify whether these models recapitulate patient tumours at the molecular level, a necessary step before widespread screening therapeutics.</p>
<p>In this study, we conducted a detailed assessment of the genetic landscape of a series of paired tumours and PDX from primary PDAC and liver metastases, including WGS data from a unique set of 5 matched ‘trios’ of primary tumour, PDX, and PDO. Globally, our findings indicate that PDX and PDO successfully recapitulate primary and metastatic disease at the level of simple somatic mutations mainly in driver genes, but not across the greater expanse of annotated mutations. Disease model fidelity is not readily retained when assessing structural variation (SV) events, based on heterogeneity we observed across donor-model pairs. However, our results indicate that clustering of large SV events across particular chromosomes of the tumours is retained in matching disease models. Our work demonstrates stable consistency of <italic>ploidy-corrected</italic> copy number states between donor-model pairs, but underscores a major concern regarding ploidy changes when tumours are implanted into their respective models. Our results provide new insights into the interplay and fidelity of different disease models toward recapitulating PDAC heterogeneity and genomics.</p>

These included a series of 10 resected tumours and 6 liver metastases [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s013">S1 Table</xref>]. Of the primary tumours, five samples also had a PDO derived from the PDX, comprising a unique cohort of matched tumour-PDX-PDO, hereby referred to as ‘trios’ throughout the paper. The PDOs were derived from the PDX tissue, as opposed to the primary patient material.</p>

<p>Several structural arrangements observed in the resected tumours were recapitulated in the corresponding PDX, including deletion events and copy number loss (eg: MAP2K4 and TP53 across 80% of the primary-PDX pairs) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g003">Fig 3</xref>]. Homozygous deletions of CKDN2A were observed in several primary-PDX pairs (ex: PCSI_0590, PCSI_0642) and recapitulated in their corresponding trios [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g003">Fig 3</xref>]. There were cases of copy number discordance between primary-PDX pairs for some genes (ex: RNF43 in PCSI_0592, PCSI_0602 and KDM6A in PCSI_0592, PCSI_0602, PCSI_0633) which also extended to the trios; in the case of the trios, copy loss was observed in the PDO, even though it has not been observed in the PDX from which it was derived [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g003">Fig 3</xref>].</p>
<p>Structural rearrangements and copy state changes demonstrated consistency across the majority of the metastasis-PDX pairs and the 9 genes assessed.

<title>Simple somatic mutation</title>
<p>We conducted a comparative analysis of SSM events in tumour-PDX primaries, trios, and paired tumour-PDX metastases, to assess preservation of somatic variants between disease models and their source tumours [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s015">S3(A)–S3(E) Table</xref>]. An average of 4,500 and 5,000 mutations were identified in the resected tumours and in their matched PDX, respectively [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s015">S3(A) Table</xref>]. More than 50% of the mutations observed in the primary tumour were retained in the paired PDX [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g004">Fig 4A</xref>]. Considering all mutations, 70% of the pairs exhibited a Jaccard index ≥ 0.6 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s015">S3(D) Table</xref>], with PCSI_0355 scoring the highest (Jaccard index = 0.8). Jaccard scores of the remaining 3 pairs (PCSI_0169, PCSI_0589, PCSI_0602) ranged from 0.51 to 0.57. To assess conservation or diversity across functional and non-functional mutations, including synonymous and non-synonymous events (SNVs), we calculated the Jaccard index for each tumour-PDX pair for 12 mutation types observed in the samples [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g004">Fig 4B</xref>]. Eighty percent of the pairs exhibited an SNV Jaccard score ≥ 0.6 for functional mutations (missense, nonsense).

Pairwise-comparison of mutation categories also highlighted other mutation types, including mutations of lincRNA, for which the majority of pairs (&gt;60% of the pairs) had a Jaccard score ≥ 0.6.</p>

<p>We conducted an in-depth analysis of mutation patterns for driver genes of PDAC tumourigenesis, including PDAC oncogenes (KRAS) and tumour suppressor genes (CDKN2A, TP53, SMAD4, TGFB2) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g004">Fig 4C</xref>]. In cases of apparent discordance between tumour-PDX pairs for a given mutation, we conducted additional manual inspection of the variants to ensure that the failure to call the variant was not attributed to insufficient coverage or statistical threshold for variant calling. Despite discrepancies observed between tumour-PDX pairs across different mutation types, SNVs across the main driver genes remain conserved. KRAS and TP53 mutations were observed in 90% of the pairs, and harbored the same functional consequences (mostly missense mutations) in matched tumour-PDX samples [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g004">Fig 4C</xref>]. Detailed examination of the KRAS mutations calls in the primary tumour series revealed the presence of G12D, G12R, and G12V oncogenic mutations, with the majority of missense mutations belonging to G12D. The majority of TP53 mutations were missense mutations, but also included splice-site mutations in 2 pairs of the series [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g004">Fig 4C</xref>]. We assessed the frequency of reads carrying the variant alleles across tumour-PDX pairs. Comparable frequencies between tumours and matched PDX were also observed in larger sets of variants from genes encompassing oncogenes, tumour suppressor genes, and frequently mutated genes involved in PDAC tumourigenesis [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s003">S3(A) Fig</xref>].</p>
<p>Comparison of liver metastasis pairs [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g004">Fig 4</xref>, <bold>right column]</bold> recapitulated much of the somatic mutational landscape observed in the primary tumours. Across 5 liver metastasis samples, we observed averages of ~5,300 mutations per tumour, and ~5,500 mutations per PDX, with a range of 66–86% overlap of mutation calls in metastasis-PDX pairs [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s015">S3(B) Table</xref>]. One sample (PCSI_0489) had a strikingly high mutation load, with an average of ~45,500 mutations in both the metastasis sample and the matched PDX, due to DNA mismatch-repair (MMR) deficiency. This sample had a germline frameshift MLH1 deletion, loss of heterozygosity of MLH1 on the p-arm of chromosome 3 and elevated C&gt;T transitions, which corresponds with the diagnosis of Lynch syndrome in the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref019">19</xref>]. All of the metastasis-PDX pairs, including the MMR deficient case, demonstrated a Jaccard index ≥ 0.6 across all mutations considered [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s015">S3(E) Table</xref>], with PCSI_0606 scoring the highest (Jaccard index = 0.86). All of the pairs exhibited an SNV Jaccard score ≥ 0.6 for functional mutations (missense, nonsense), with the exception of the MMR case [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g004">Fig 4B</xref>]. Individually, 4/6 pairs had Jaccard scores ≥ 0.8 for missense mutations, and 5/6 pairs had Jaccard scores ≥ 0.8 for nonsense mutations [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g004">Fig 4B</xref>]. Missense mutations for KRAS and TP53 were conserved in the majority of the metastasis-PDX pairs; for the MMR case only non-functional variants for those genes were observed [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g004">Fig 4C</xref>]. Frequencies of reads carrying the variant allele were also comparable between liver metastasis samples and their matched PDX [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s003">S3(B) Fig</xref>].</p>
<p>Matched PDO samples demonstrated the same mutation pattern in oncogenic driver and tumour suppressor genes as that of their matched PDX and tumour [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g004">Fig 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s015">S3(C) Table</xref>].

<p>We compared the distribution of structural variation events across each chromosome, for every primary-PDX pair [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s017">S5(A) Table</xref>]. For each pair assessed, we observed a disparity of SV events across the majority of the chromosomes (Jaccard index ≤ 0.4) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s018">S6(A) Table</xref>]. We computed an overall concordance (S<sup>c</sup>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Methods</xref>) score for each primary-PDX pair, to quantify concordance across all chromosomes that harbor SV events [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g005">Fig 5B</xref>]. Only 40% of the pairs had an overall concordance S<sup>c</sup> ≥ 0.6, including highly-scoring PCSI_0633 (S<sup>c</sup> = 0.88) and PCSI_0592 (S<sup>c</sup> = 0.83). PCSI_0169 was the least concordant across the genome (S<sup>c</sup> = 0.21) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g005">Fig 5B</xref>]. Upon further investigation, we found that the PDX has more than twice as many indels as the primary tumour, and is enriched for deletions, which suggests that mutations may be accumulating due to deficiency in a DNA repair pathway.</p>
<p>Jaccard scores (scores ≥ 0.8) were observed for many chromosomes with elevated numbers of SV events (defined as ≥5 SV events in both the primary and its matching PDX) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s017">S5(A)</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s018">S6(A)</xref> Tables]. This concordance extended to chromosomes that displayed clusters of structural variants in the primary-PDX pair. Elevated counts of clustered chromosomal rearrangements in these chromosomes, compared to the rest of the genome, is suggestive of chromothripsis [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s017">S5(A) Table</xref>]. In the majority of the primary-PDX pairs, we identified particular chromosomes with clustered SV events, including PCSI_0169 (chr 4), PCSI_0589 (chr 7), PCSI_0592 (chr 17, chr 18), PCSI_0611 (chr1), PCSI_0624 (chr17), and PCSI_0642 (chr 8) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s004">S4(A) Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s017">S5(A) Table</xref>]. We also identified chromosomes that were strongly discordant, owing to a large difference in the number of SV events between the primary and matched PDX. Most notable of these was the q arm of chromosome 22 in PCSI_0611, for which a cluster of SV events was observed in the PDX but not in the primary sample [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g005">Fig 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s017">S5(A)</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s018">S6(A)</xref> Tables].</p>
<p>We computed both genome-wide and chromosome-centric scores across different categories of SV events, to identify cases of agreement or disparity in the distribution of SV breakpoints [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s005">S5 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s019">S7(A) Table</xref>].

We subsequently focused on chromosomes demonstrating chromothripsis to identify whether rearrangements of SV events in these chromosomes are typically different [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s005">S5(B) Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s019">S7(B) Table</xref>]. Clustering of SV events in the tumours were typically different from the matched PDX, with Jaccard scores ranging between 0–1 across all four SV categories assessed. PCSI_0611 (chr1) and PCSI_0642 (chr8) demonstrated greater consistency of SV breakpoints across the tumour-PDX pairs, such that Jaccard scores almost equated to 1 for all intra-chromosomal variants (deletions, duplications, inversions) [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s005">S5(B) Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s019">S7(B) Table</xref>].</p>
<p>We conducted a comparative analysis of SV events in paired metastasis and matched PDX samples [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g005">Fig 5</xref>, <bold>right column]</bold> to identify distinct chromosomal instability profiles observed in primary tumours that could also extend to liver metastasis pairs. Metastasis-PDX pairs exhibited variable counts of SV events, ranging between 16–172 events in the samples [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s016">S4(B) Table</xref>]. Not surprisingly, the MMR deficient case (PCSI_0489) had the fewest number of SV events in the pairs [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s016">S4(B) Table</xref>], and scored moderately (S<sup>c</sup> = 0.6). In contrast to the primary-PDX pairs however, the majority of the pairs (4/6) demonstrated greater agreement across the genome (S<sup>c</sup> &gt; 0.8 for PCSI_0491, PCSI_0604, PCSI_0605, and PCSI_0606). This agreement was also reflected when assessing different categories of SV events across the genome [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s005">S5(C) Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s019">S7(C) Table</xref>].</p>
<p>Chromosome-centric analyses of metastasis-PDX pairs indicated consistency of SV events across the majority of the chromosomes (Jaccard index ≥ 0.6) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s017">S5(B)</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s018">S6(B)</xref> Tables]. Jaccard scores ≥ 0.8 were observed for chromosomes with elevated counts of SV events in both the metastasis and matched PDX [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s017">S5(B)</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s018">S6(B)</xref> Tables].

These chromosomes include PCSI_0491 (chr 3), PCSI_0604 (chr 13), PCSI_0605 (chr1, chr2), and PCSI_0606 (chr1, chr9, chr11) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s004">S4(B) Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s017">S5(B)</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s018">S6(B)</xref> Tables]. Analysis of rearrangement of SV events, for these chromosomes, indicates that the clustering of SV events in the metastasis and matched PDX are typically similar, or almost identical, for the majority of the cases, with Jaccard scores ~1 for SV categories in 5 of the 7 chromosomes assessed [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s005">S5(C) and S5(D) Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s019">S7(C) and S7(D) Table</xref>].

<p>Analysis of the primary-PDX-PDO trios highlighted the extent to which structural variation of primary-PDX pairs were captured in organoid models [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g006">Fig 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s016">S4(C)</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s017">S5(C)</xref> Tables, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s006">S6(C) Fig</xref>].

By splitting the trio into matched pairs (primary-PDX, primary-PDO, and PDX-PDO), we assessed concordance in the primary tumours and each of the disease models (tumour-PDX, tumour-PDO pairs), and the interrelationship between the disease models themselves (PDX-PDO pairs) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s017">S5(C)</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s018">S6(C)</xref> Tables]. PCSI_0592 was the highest scoring trio, across tumour-pdx, tumour-PDO, and PDX-PDO comparisons [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g006">Fig 6B</xref>]. Tumour-PDX and tumour-PDO comparisons indicated lower agreement across the genome (S<sup>c</sup> &lt;0.6), and across many chromosomes (Jaccard scores ≤0.4) for the remaining 4 trios [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s018">S6(C) Table</xref>]. Interestingly, S<sup>c</sup> scores of PDX-PDO comparisons scored higher than tumour-PDX and tumour-PDO comparisons for these pairs [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g006">Fig 6B</xref>]. Despite inter-model variability observed at both genome-wide and chromosome-centric levels, there is however a stronger agreement of SV events in the trios, for chromosomes with highly clustered SV events. This concordance (S<sup>c</sup> ≥ 0.8) was observed across all tumour-PDX, tumour-PDO, and PDX-PDO pairs for several chromosomes, including PCSI_0592 (chr19), PCSI_0624 (chr11, chr14), PCSI_0642 (chr8) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g006">Fig 6B and 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s018">S6(C) Table</xref>].</p>

<p>Comparison of tumour-PDX, tumour-PDO, and PDX-PDO pairs highlighted particular cases that were discordant at both chromosome and genome-wide levels.

Further investigation into this chromosome revealed a very high count of SV events in the primary tumour, with reduced events in the matching PDX, and almost no events in the PDO [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g006">Fig 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s017">S5(C) Table</xref>].

<p>Jaccard indices were computed to quantify overall similarity between the ploidy-adjusted copy number states of primary tumours and matching PDX, across all bases of the genome, and for individual chromosomes.

Comparison of the raw (uncorrected) copy number values identifies cases of concordance that support the chromosomal score calculations (ex: PCSI_0611 chr 1, PCSI_0642 chr 8), but also highlights discrepancies in several of these chromosomes (ex: PCSI_0169 chr 4, PCSI_0624 chr 17) whose effect may have been reduced in the ploidy-adjusted copy number states [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006596.g007">Fig 7B and 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s008">S8 Fig</xref>].</p>

<title>Clonality across tumours and disease models</title>
<p>We tested for clonality of primary tumours, metastases, and matching models using PyClone [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s011">S11 Fig</xref>]. PyClone was tested only on SNVs that were called in all of the samples derived from a patient (i.e., all SNVs found in tumours and PDX in the pairs, and all SNVs found in tumours and PDX and PDO in the trios). Based on our sample size and lack of technical replicates, we cannot conclude that metastases are more clonal that the primary tumours based on the current analysis. On average, there are between 2–4 SNV cluster lines attributed to each patient sample (and matched models), whether for primary tumours or metastatic ones. Overall, for many of the resected PDAC cases and liver metastases, clonality of SNVs are preserved across the different samples belonging to a patient; SNV cluster lines are approximately horizontal as the cellular prevalence of the SNVs remain similar across the samples (for example: PCSI_0169, PCSI_0355, PCSI_0611, PCSI_0624 in PDAC, and PCSI_0605 and PCSI_0606 in metastases) [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s011">S11 Fig</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Critical evaluation of disease models is gaining importance across several cancer types that utilize these surrogates as preclinical tools for exploring tumourigenesis and drug testing. Previous investigations of PDAC provide a limited snapshot of donor-model comparisons, in terms of morphological, pathological, and mutational correlates [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006596.s012">S12 Fig</xref>]. Our histologic analysis demonstrated that PDXs and PDOs retain the main characteristics of the tumour samples from which they were derived, in agreement with previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref008">8</xref>]. It can be argued however, that sampling of multiple sites from donors and disease models can identify a spectrum of histologic and morphologic patterns that would render tumours and their matching models as dissimilar. Accordingly, donor-model comparisons of particularly heterogeneous tumours, including PDAC, will benefit from the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies that can encapsulate all facets of the disease at the molecular level. We present, to our knowledge, the first quantitative assessment of whole-genome comparisons between human PDAC (both primary and metastasis) and matched model systems. We evaluated single base-pair genomic events (SSM), larger chromosomal changes across several bases or chromosomes (SV), and genome-wide changes (CNV) in tumour-PDX pairs and tumour-PDX-PDO trios.</p>
<p>In our PDAC cohort of paired tumour-PDX-PDO trios, the organoid samples are derived from the PDX, not the original patient donors. Given this experimental setup, the overall expectation is that the PDO would demonstrate greater fidelity with the PDXs. An assessment of structural variation changes across the trios demonstrated stronger concordance between PDX-PDO pairs than patient-PDX or patient-PDO pairs (ex: PCSI_0590, PCSI_0602, PCSI_0642). Our analysis of copy number variation across 3 trios also indicated that PDX-PDO pairs scored marginally higher in terms of overall concordance, with fewer copy number changes in individual chromosomes. Collectively, these findings suggest that true PDO representation of the donor tumour would benefit from direct growth from the patient tumour itself.</p>
<p>At the single-base and gene-centric level, our findings emphasize that PDAC disease models capture many of the mutational patterns and driving events involved in PDAC tumourigenesis, up to an extent. About ~1/3 of the observed SNVs are not shared by the tumour of origin and its matching PDX, rendering an intermediate scoring of tumour-PDX agreement across the majority of the PDAC pairs, and a rather low concordance in 30% of the models. However, there is greater concordance between tumours (primary or metastases) and matched PDX for functional mutation types (missense and nonsense mutations). A more detailed evaluation also demonstrated retention of genetic features for 9 driver genes involved in PDAC tumourigenesis. As such, our study confirms and extends prior findings that the genetic mutations of key driver genes are maintained between tumour-PDX pairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref020">20</xref>], and we now demonstrate that this fidelity extends to PDOs as well. Given the complex molecular landscape of PDAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref021">21</xref>], consistency of genomic changes in oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes provides further overall support for use of PDXs and PDOs in precision medicine. PDOs are particularly attractive, as they can be readily established from small patient biopsies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref016">16</xref>]. However, our findings also posit a greater variability between tumours and disease models in terms of overall mutation load. The effects of this variability would need to be addressed further in future investigations. There remain unexplored categories of mutations (for example, mutations in lincRNA) that may warrant further exploration, to determine the effect of these mutations on genome-wide changes in PDAC.</p>
<p>Investigations into copy number variation emphasize that ploidy changes are a substantial factor that must be considered when conducting tumour-model investigations. Two of our 16 samples had undergone severe ploidy changes that resulted in their exclusion from the analysis. While many of the remaining tumour-PDX pairs and trios demonstrated comparable ploidy, our analysis also captured conspicuous cases of whole genome polyploidization events that gave rise to tetraploid genomes in matched disease models (notably across PCSI_0590 and PCSI_0633). Accordingly, measuring consistency had to be conducted on ploidy-scaled copy number events. With these corrected measurements, we were able to conclude that there is agreement of copy number events at genome-wide scales (overall concordance score) and chromosome-centric levels. However, we are cognizant that these normalized measures potentially mask discrepancies that are more readily apparent when comparing raw (uncorrected) copy number measurements. This is of import when assessing copy number changes in chromosomes that exhibit large-scale, complex genetic events, such as chromothripsis.</p>
<p>Deviation in ploidy underscores potential changes that arise when transferring portions of primary tumours to other disease model mediums, particularly across multiple passages. In our work, WGS profiling of PDX and PDOs was undertaken following third passage (P3) engraftment of tumours into mice. While the lack of profiling of earlier PDX passages prevents us from drawing conclusions about copy number aberrations (CNAs) in PDAC across multiple passages, one limitation includes the selection of subclones when different portions of the tissue are grown in future passages within PDXs and PDOs. Subclones may gain survival advantage growth in the disease models, and subsequently, tumour engraftment in PDXs may be confounded by underlying biological mechanisms that promote adaptation and growth of these tumours in a new environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref022">22</xref>]. Indeed, recent findings by Ben-David <italic>et al</italic>, based on observations from breast and hematopoietic cancers, suggest that clonal evolution of PDX occurs through directional selection of pre-existing clones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref023">23</xref>]. Interestingly, their study emphasized quick genomic divergence and rapid CNA dynamics across the first few <italic>in vivo</italic> PDX passages, such that CNAs acquired through PDX passaging differ substantially from that in their parental tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref023">23</xref>]. These revelations may explain the polyploidization events that we have observed in our PDAC PDXs, and the difficulty in attributing ploidy to some samples that were eventually excluded from the study (PCSI_0592 and PCSI_0602). We have attempted to examine the clonality of the primary tumours, metastases, and matching models with our current data. In many cases, clonality of SNVs are preserved across the different models belonging to a given patient. However, we observed differences in clonality and cellular prevalence for some clusters of SNVs, particularly for samples with ploidy changes (ex: PCSI_0602, PCSI_0633).</p>
<p>Assessment of structural variation (SV) events sheds light on biological phenomena that have not been previously described in PDAC disease models. Genome-wide scoring of SV concordance (S<sup>c</sup> score) showed poor agreement between tumours and PDX, which promoted further investigation into chromosome-specific scoring methods to efficiently depict this heterogeneity. At this deeper level, many chromosomes still scored poorly in tumour-PDX comparisons. Strikingly however, we identified cases of genomic consistency across chromosomes with clustered SV events that suggest chromothripsis. In that context, chromosomes with chromothripsis in the primary tumour exhibited similar behavior in matching PDX and matching PDO. For these particular chromosomes, in resected patients, the actual rearrangements of the SV clusters appear to be quite different between tumour and PDX. However, these rearrangements are almost identical when comparing metastases-PDX pairs. Despite evidence of overall structural heterogeneity between tumours and their matched models, these findings argue that major structural changes that occur in a tumour sample can be largely ‘transmitted’ to matched PDXs and PDOs. There remain, however, other anomalous cases where clustered SV events in specific chromosomes within tumour samples have been ‘lost in translation’ in matched PDX and PDO (the most notable case is PCSI_0624, chromosome 17). Equally difficult to rationalize are cases where clustering of SV events have arisen in the matched PDX, but not in the source tumour (PCSI_0611, chromosome 22). While these events may once again be explained as a result of subclonal events or tumour selection, our limited sample size hinders investigations as to whether those events could be recurrent events in a larger PDAC series.</p>
<p>Our study presents a comparative analysis of patient tumours and disease models for both primary PDAC and metastasis. While our samples do not allow direct comparisons of matched primary and metastatic tumours, it is possible to draw conclusions about the overall genomic profile of the metastatic samples (and their matched PDX) in comparison with the primary series (and their matched PDX). Across all types of genomic events studied (SSM, SV, CNV), we observe that metastases demonstrate higher concordance with their matched PDX compared with primary-PDX pairs. All of the pairs demonstrate higher concordance levels (Jaccard index ≥ 0.6) for both SSM and CNV. SV heterogeneity across these pairs is less pronounced than those of primary tumours, producing improved concordance scores for SV events. Concordance at the SV level is also higher in metastases than primary tumours when considering chromosome-centric analyses, or focusing on categories of SV events (that potentially may have functional implications). The rearrangement of SV events for chromosomes with chromothripsis is almost identical between metastases-PDX pairs, and there are fewer discrepancies in copy number states. One possible explanation for this behavior may reflect upon the tumour microenvironment of metastatic samples compared to primary tumours, as metastatic samples represent more stable, aggressive, and proliferative derivatives of the primary tumour. Interestingly, our cohort of metastasis-PDX pairs also includes a sample demonstrating DNA mismatch-repair (MMR) deficiency (PCSI_0489) due to a germline MLH1 mutation. Alterations in MMR genes lead to microsatellite instability (MSI), a genotype found infrequently in PDAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref025">25</xref>]. Our analysis of the MMR sample highlights a high mutation load, few SV events across chromosomes, and a stable DNA copy number across the genome; all of these observations are reflective of the genomic instability expected in tumour samples exhibiting MMR deficiency. Observing the same behavior in the matched PDX is reassuring, as it emphasizes that the PDX model succeeds in recapitulating much of the genomic behavior of these rare and striking PDAC cases.</p>
<p>Our approach presents quantifiable parameters of model fidelity; assessing molecular similarity between tumour-model pairs is necessary towards utilization of these models in future preclinical testing. For example, our analysis highlighted a discordant tumour-PDX pair (PCSI_0169) that was consistently difficult to decipher across both SSM and SV comparisons. One possible explanation for this discordance may be a mutational process that is only present in the PDX, due to a clone from the primary tumour growing as the main clone in the PDX. Further investigations would be needed to explore this phenomenon; however, this is a clear case where the PDX may not a good surrogate for preclinical testing of the donor tumour. Deciphering the extent of discordance for that PDX sample would not have been possible without scoring donor-model comparisons across genome-wide, single-base, and chromosome-centric scales.</p>
<p>This study has several potential limitations. Our limited sample size hampers investigations into subclonal events within individual samples. Due to a lack of sufficient technical replicates for each disease model studied, it is difficult to measure within-line variability in the models. We have assessed potential clonality changes between tumours and their matched models for each patient, and present findings that suggest stable clonality in tumour-model comparisons, with notable exceptions. These however, are preliminary findings, as our limited sample size precludes explanations as to the prevalence of different clones or their statistical significance. Our findings demonstrate that larger-scale investigations to assess transcriptional and clonal evolution across these disease models will be warranted in the future, similar to previous analyses highlighting genomic evolution across <italic>in-vitro</italic> models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref026">26</xref>]. Currently, our sample counts are also too few to support comprehensive identification of recurrent genomic patterns across a larger cohort of PDXs and PDOs, including, for example, recurrently affected genes. Future investigations will be necessary to estimate the number of technical replicates needed per PDX line that would be sufficient to capture variability (or stability) in a given model. This information will certainly be important when planning PDX screens for pre-clinical testing.</p>
<p>Genomic comparisons between primary tissues and disease models are necessary for future studies that focus on gene-drug associations across model systems. While we have highlighted in this manuscript examples of common and discrepant genomic aberrations between tumour-model pairs, the phenotypic relevance of these aberrations remains to be investigated. Previous work on PDAC disease models, using whole-exome sequencing, demonstrated that drug sensitivities remained stable across multiple passages of PDAC cell lines, suggesting a conservation of dominant genetic drivers and related therapeutic sensitivities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref008">8</xref>]. However, other findings highlight that successful tumour engraftment of PDXs is associated with adverse clinico-pathological features and worse recurrence-free and overall survival; this variability in PDX growth suggests limited potential for systematic use of PDX tumours for real-time chemo-sensitivity testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref022">22</xref>]. From the WGS data presented here, it is not yet possible to conclude whether concordance in genomic aberrations would imply fidelity in drug response between tumour-PDX or PDX-PDO comparisons; this remains to be determined by comparing patient outcome and drug testing in future investigations, and comparing resultant gene expression patterns across tumour-model pairs.</p>
<p>In summary, we have conducted a detailed molecular dissection of WGS data to quantify concordance of genomic events between model systems and matched human PDAC. We present the first extensive genomic evaluation of consistency and in-consistency across pre-clinical models, for different levels of genomic complexity (SNV, SV, CNV). Broadly, our findings shed light on consistency between disease models for mutations in PDAC driver genes, but highlight relatively poor agreement between tumours and their matching models across the greater spectrum of mutational load. Disease model fidelity is not retained well when assessing structural variation events, but there are striking cases of clustering of SV events across particular chromosomes that are retained when tumours are implanted into their respective disease models. Copy number comparisons suggest good agreement across tumour-model comparisons, conditional of reducing potential changes in ploidy. Across all of these platforms, our systematic comparison of tumours, PDX, and PDO also highlights several genetic aberrations that are sample-specific, and which may not be shared across donor samples and matched models. Collectively, our investigations highlight that while PDXs and PDOs may serve as tractable and transplantable systems for probing the molecular properties of PDAC, these models may best serve selective analyses across different levels of genomic complexity. We expect that our analytic pipeline may serve as a framework for future WGS research that compares donor samples and matched PDX and PDO.</p>

<title>Simple somatic mutations (SSM)</title>
<p>Germline single nucleotide variants (SNV) were called using the Genome Analysis Tool Kit (GATK, version 1.3.16), using best practice guidelines made available by the Broad Institute. Briefly, data were locally realigned around indels and the base quality values were recalibrated prior to variant calling using the Unified Genotyper. This was followed by filtering using the VariantFiltration module, and subsequent classification of germline variants as those mutations which have a QUAL score greater than 50 in the normal sample. Both tumour and matched normal samples were processed simultaneously.</p>
<p>Strelka (version 1.0.7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref032">32</xref>] and MuTect (version 1.14) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref033">33</xref>] were used to call somatic SNVs, with default parameters. Indels were also identified using Strelka. SNVs were selected based on the intersection of ‘Tier 1 SNVs’ from Strelka and ‘PASS’ filter variants from MuTect. Potential false positives caused by unfiltered mouse DNA were filtered using a blacklist of SNVs and INDELS generated by aligning model mouse DNA to hg19. Germline and somatic SSM were annotated using dbSNP 142 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref034">34</xref>], COSMIC (version 54) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref035">35</xref>], and ANNOVAR (version 2013-06-21) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref036">36</xref>] to predict coding consequences of SNVs and indels.

<p>Assessment of concordance and discordance among SV events was conducted for each chromosome individually across tumour-PDX pairs. We first tabulated the number of SV events observed across tumour, PDX, and PDO, to determine the overall distribution of SV events across tumours and their matched disease models. We identified chromosomes with ≥ 5 SV events in both tumours and their matching PDX. To count SV events per chromosome, intra-chromosomal events (deletions, inversions, duplications) were assigned a score of ‘1’ for their respective chromosomes, while a score of 0.5 was assigned to each of the chromosomes involved in a translocation event. Instances of discordance (where one sample of a pair had ≥ 10 SV events different from the other sample) were also noted.</p>
<p>Chromosome-specific concordance of structural variation events for a tumour and its matching PDX was quantified using the Jaccard Index, taking into account the genomic size (number of the genomic bases) of the SV events. For deletion (DEL), Inversion (INV), and Duplication (DUP) events, the genomic size of the event was calculated from the annotated breakpoints. For translocation (TRA) events, the total number of bases affected was set to 1.

<title>Copy number variation</title>
<p>Copy number segments were obtained using CELLULOID (version 0.11.2) to estimate gene copy number and tumour ploidy from WGS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref012">12</xref>]. Unless otherwise specified, copy number segments and parameters were extracted for the first solution (solution1) of the CELLULOID proposed solutions, for each sample.</p>
<p>Concordance of copy number state was calculated by first identifying overlapping genomic loci in tumour-PDX pairs using bedtools (version 2.24.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref047">47</xref>]. To consider the copy number state relative to ploidy, the <italic>imean</italic> scores generated by CELLULOID (which represents average integer copy-number) for the genomic loci were rescaled by the ploidy of the respective samples. Genomic loci in tumour-PDX pairs were considered identical if they shared a copy number state with a difference ≤ 0.25. Genome-wide concordance scores (G) were calculated across all bases of a tumour-PDX pair as follows:

<title>Ranking concordance or discordance between models</title>
<p>Quantitative comparison of SSM, SV, and CNV events between tumours and their corresponding PDX and PDO samples were developed by calculating Jaccard indices (J<sub>М</sub>, J<sub>Ѵ</sub>, J<sub>К</sub>) or concordance scores (S<sup>c</sup>, G, G <sub>Ѵ</sub>), as described previously. These scores follow a scale from 0 to 1. A score of 0 indicates complete <italic>discordance</italic> between a tumour and its matching model, and signifies that none of the genomic aberrations identified in the tumour could be identified in the matching model. A score of 1 indicates complete <italic>concordance</italic>, such that all genomic aberrations identified in the tumour are successfully recapitulated in the matching disease model.</p>

<title>Clonality across disease models</title>
<p>The clonality of tumours, metastases, and disease models was determined using PyClone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006596.ref049">49</xref>] on SNVs that were called in all of the samples derived from a given patient (tumour and matching PDX and PDO, as appropriate). SNVs were first filtered to exclude SNVs marked as intronic or intergenic. In PyClone, SNVs are clustered based on their common clonality and colored by cluster. Points are drawn at the cellular prevalence of the SNV in each sample (i.e., the proportion of tumour cells carrying the mutations, irrespective of the number of copies of the mutant allele).</p>
