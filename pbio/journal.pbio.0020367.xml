				<article-title>A Clear View of Mycobacterial Infection</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>Granulomas are organized host immune structures composed of tightly interposed macrophages and other cells that form in response to a variety of persistent stimuli, both infectious and noninfectious. The tuberculous granuloma is essential for host containment of mycobacterial infection, although it does not always eradicate it. Therefore, it is considered a host-beneficial, if incompletely efficacious, immune response. The <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> RD1 locus encodes a specialized secretion system that promotes mycobacterial virulence by an unknown mechanism. Using transparent zebrafish embryos to monitor the infection process in real time, we found that RD1-deficient bacteria fail to elicit efficient granuloma formation despite their ability to grow inside of infected macrophages. We showed that macrophages infected with virulent mycobacteria produce an RD1-dependent signal that directs macrophages to aggregate into granulomas. This <italic>Mycobacterium</italic>-induced macrophage aggregation in turn is tightly linked to intercellular bacterial dissemination and increased bacterial numbers. Thus, mycobacteria co-opt host granulomas for their virulence.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Infection with pathogenic mycobacteria is thought to proceed through a series of defined steps. Mononuclear cells present at or recruited to sites of infection phagocytose bacteria and migrate deeper into tissues. Then additional macrophages and other immune cells are recruited to form complex, tightly aggregated structures called granulomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Adams1">Adams 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Dannenberg1">Dannenberg 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Teitelbaum1">Teitelbaum et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Geijtenbeek1">Geijtenbeek et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Peters1">Peters and Ernst 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Tailleux1">Tailleux et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Cosma2">Cosma et al. 2004</xref>). Granuloma macrophages subsequently undergo differentiation into epithelioid cells, so called owing to their closely apposed cellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Adams1">Adams 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Dannenberg1">Dannenberg 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Cosma2">Cosma et al. 2004</xref>). Production and maintenance of granulomas is essential to the control of tuberculosis in murine models and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Kaufmann1">Kaufmann 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Flynn1">Flynn and Chan 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Lawn1">Lawn et al. 2002</xref>). However, despite residence at the site of a robust focal immune response, the bacilli within granulomas are not always eradicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Cosma1">Cosma et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Cosma2">Cosma et al. 2004</xref>). The relative contributions of host and pathogen determinants to the migration and aggregation of macrophages and the formation and maintenance of granulomas are not understood.</p>
      <p>While considerable progress has been made in identifying <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> virulence determinants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Glickman1">Glickman and Jacobs 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Cosma1">Cosma et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Smith1">Smith 2003</xref>), our overall understanding of mycobacterial pathogenesis remains rudimentary. Virulence determinants are generally studied by examining mutant bacterial strains in cultured macrophage monolayers or by static assessment of bacterial numbers and tissue pathology at different time points during in vivo infection. During in vivo infection, spatially separated individual mononuclear cells are infected, migrate into tissues, and serve as a nidus for cellular aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Teitelbaum1">Teitelbaum et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Davis1">Davis et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Geijtenbeek1">Geijtenbeek et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Tailleux1">Tailleux et al. 2003</xref>). The steps and dynamics of bacterially mediated host-cell interactions that impact the outcome of infection through production of chemokines, cytokines, adhesion molecules, and their receptors cannot be elucidated by tissue culture studies and static assessments in vivo. To address these issues, we utilize a novel model of <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> infection in zebrafish. Zebrafish embryos and larvae (henceforth we will refer to both stages as embryos) are naturally susceptible to infection by <italic>Mycobacterium marinum,</italic> and we have previously shown that their optical transparency may be used to monitor the cellular dynamics of infection in real time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Davis1">Davis et al. 2002</xref>). Using differential interference contrast (DIC) video and fluorescence microscopy, we have monitored macrophage chemotaxis to <italic>M. marinum,</italic> its phagocytosis, transit of infected macrophages into tissues, and the recruitment of additional macrophages to initiate granulomas that have the pathological hallmarks and bacterial gene expression profile characteristic of tuberculous granulomas in adult animals.</p>
      <p>In this study, we use the zebrafish infection model to probe the cellular mechanisms of virulence of the <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> RD1 locus, an approximately 10-kb region missing from all attenuated bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine strains but present in virulent <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. tuberculosis</named-content> isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Mahairas1">Mahairas et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Behr1">Behr and Small 1999</xref>). The RD1 locus encodes a specialized secretion system for the putative virulence effector proteins ESAT-6 and CFP-10, also located within the locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Tekaia1">Tekaia et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Pallen1">Pallen 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Hsu1">Hsu et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Pym2">Pym et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Stanley1">Stanley et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Guinn1">Guinn et al. 2004</xref>). The <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. tuberculosis</named-content> RD1 deletion mutant has a growth defect in the mouse model of tuberculosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Lewis1">Lewis et al. 2003</xref>), and studies using cultured macrophages and other in vitro systems have identified complex phenotypes that may account for its in vivo attenuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Hsu1">Hsu et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Stanley1">Stanley et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Guinn1">Guinn et al. 2004</xref>). In vitro assays have suggested that RD1 may contribute to mycobacterial cytotoxicity to macrophages and epithelial cells, thus enabling bacterial spread between cells or transit across epithelial barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Hsu1">Hsu et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Guinn1">Guinn et al. 2004</xref>). Others have proposed that the RD1 region mediates dampening of host innate immune responses in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Stanley1">Stanley et al. 2003</xref>). It is unclear how each of these individual in vitro phenotypes contributes to the complex sequence of events that ultimately lead to bacterial persistence in granulomas. We used the zebrafish-<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. marinum</named-content> infection model to elucidate the precise steps at which infection with wild-type (WT) and RD1 mutant bacteria differ. Our data suggest that the RD1 locus independently mediates macrophage aggregation and intercellular bacterial spread via host cell death within aggregates. These steps are associated with increased bacterial numbers and enhanced virulence, lending support to the idea that mycobacteria actually promote and exploit granuloma formation for the establishment of infection.</p>

        <p>The genes in the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. marinum</named-content> RD1 region are homologous to those in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. tuberculosis</named-content> (for instance, their ESAT-6 and CFP-10 proteins are 97% and 91% identical, respectively) and the regions in the two organisms are syntenic (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/M_marinum/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/M_marinum/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We derived an <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. marinum</named-content> RD1-deficient mutant with essentially the same deletion as the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. tuberculosis</named-content> RD1 mutant described previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g001">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Lewis1">Lewis et al. 2003</xref>). Like the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. tuberculosis</named-content> RD1 mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Lewis1">Lewis et al. 2003</xref>), the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. marinum</named-content> mutant (referred to as ΔRD1) was attenuated for growth in mouse and human monocyte/macrophage cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and unpublished data). ΔRD1 was also attenuated for growth in an adult leopard frog infection model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g002">Figure 2</xref>B) in which WT <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. marinum</named-content> causes chronic granulomatous infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Ramakrishnan2">Ramakrishnan et al. 1997</xref>). Specifically, significantly fewer ΔRD1 bacteria were recovered from spleens and livers of infected frogs at 2, 8, and 24 wk postinfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and unpublished data). ΔRD1-infected frogs also had poorly formed macrophage aggregates at 8 wk postinfection, in contrast to the well-defined granulomas resulting from WT infection (unpublished data). Thus, by previously evaluated parameters, the RD1 region plays identical roles in the virulence of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. tuberculosis</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. marinum</named-content>.</p>

        <p>To understand the cellular basis of ΔRD1 attenuation, we undertook real-time microscopic monitoring of the infection process with WT and mutant bacteria. WT infection of the embryos is characterized by the transit of infected macrophages into tissues where macrophages are recruited to form granulomas within 3–5 d postinfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g003">Figure 3</xref>D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g003">3</xref>F, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g003">3</xref>G) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Davis1">Davis et al. 2002</xref>). In contrast, while ΔRD1 infected macrophages also migrated from the circulation to the tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g003">Figure 3</xref>H), fewer, if any, aggregates formed, and the kinetics of their formation were delayed compared to the WT-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). Several highly infected individual macrophages were found scattered throughout the tissues, often close to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g003">Figure 3</xref>H and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g003">3</xref>I). This is in sharp contrast to the case of WT infection, in which infected macrophages are nearly always found in aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Davis1">Davis et al. 2002</xref>). Aggregates that formed in ΔRD1-infected embryos were more transient than those in WT-infected embryos, often dissociating into individual infected macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g003">Figure 3</xref>D and unpublished data). Also, the ΔRD1 aggregates remained small in contrast to WT aggregates, which often increased dramatically in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g004">Figure 4</xref>, compare images in [A] to those in [B]). This finding suggests that RD1 is required not only to initiate aggregate formation but for an ongoing recruitment of macrophages into the aggregate.</p>

In that case, the inability of ΔRD1 to induce macrophage aggregation would be a simple consequence of its primary replication defect in the embryos. This scenario would predict that the number of bacteria required for aggregate formation would be similar in WT and ΔRD1 infection. To investigate this possibility, we infected embryos with similar numbers of the two bacterial strains and examined them daily for aggregate formation. On the day each embryo developed an aggregate(s), it was lysed and bacterial colony-forming units (CFU) determined. The bacterial load at which macrophage aggregation first occurred was over 4-fold higher in ΔRD1- than WT-infected embryos (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g003">Figure 3</xref>E). These results show that ΔRD1 infection is associated with a primary aggregation defect that is not a consequence of its decreased replication in macrophages.</p>

        <title>The RD1 Locus Specifically Mediates Macrophage Aggregation</title>
        <p>Macrophages are rapidly recruited to the site of WT <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. marinum</named-content> infection, where they phagocytose the bacteria, migrate to the tissues, and form aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Davis1">Davis et al. 2002</xref>). Since macrophage migration and aggregation are likely mediated by as yet ill-defined chemotactic networks, we asked if the RD1 locus also affected other chemotactic macrophage functions. Macrophage recruitment is most stringently assessed by injecting bacteria into the hindbrain ventricle, an isolated cavity devoid of macrophages in the absence of bacteria (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g003">Figure 3</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Herbomel1">Herbomel et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Davis1">Davis et al. 2002</xref>). Similar numbers of macrophages migrated to the hindbrain ventricle in response to the injection of WT and ΔRD1 bacteria at 4 h postinfection, and most of the bacteria had been phagocytosed in both cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g005">Figure 5</xref>A; unpublished data). Therefore, the RD1 locus does not affect macrophage chemotaxis to the bacteria or phagocytic capabilities.</p>

        <p>The abundance of ΔRD1-infected macrophages in tissues following bloodstream infection (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g003">Figure 3</xref>H and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g003">3</xref>I) suggested that the RD1 locus is not required for tissue migration following infection. However, tissue migration can also be examined more stringently following the ventricle injection assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Davis1">Davis et al. 2002</xref>). 5 h after infection of the ventricle, many of the ΔRD1-infected macrophages had entered the brain tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). By 24 h, most of the macrophages were widely disseminated throughout the tissues (unpublished data). Indeed, the lack of aggregation by RD1-infected macrophages led to their enhanced tissue dissemination compared to WT-infected macrophages, which had often formed aggregates within the ventricle itself by 24 h postinfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). Likely as a result, the WT-infected macrophages were slower to migrate out of the ventricle than ΔRD1-infected macrophages. Even when they did migrate out of the ventricle, they often formed aggregates in the adjacent brain tissue and did not disseminate into the trunk and tail as rapidly as did the ΔRD1-infected macrophages. In summary, the ventricle infections showed that the RD1 locus is not required for macrophage chemotaxis to the site of infection, bacterial phagocytosis, or tissue migration of infected macrophages. Furthermore, this assay highlighted the difference in the aggregation of WT- and ΔRD1-infected macrophages from very early in infection.</p>

        <title>ΔRD1-Infected Macrophages Can Receive, but Not Send, Signals That Promote Aggregation</title>
        <p>The aggregation defect of ΔRD1-infected macrophages suggests that they lack the capacity to either produce or receive signals that mediate aggregation of macrophages during WT infection. To begin to dissect the nature of the missing signal(s), we infected embryos with red-fluorescent WT bacteria and allowed aggregates to form. These embryos were then superinfected with green-fluorescent ΔRD1 or WT bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g006">Figure 6</xref>).

        <p>In a reciprocal experiment, embryos were first infected with green-fluorescent ΔRD1 bacteria, and after 4 d, when there were abundant individual infected macrophages (but no aggregates) in the tissues, the embryos were superinfected with either WT or ΔRD1 red-fluorescent bacteria. As expected, both superinfecting strains were rapidly phagocytosed by uninfected macrophages. ΔRD1 superinfection did not cause aggregate formation, and individual macrophages carrying both the original or superinfecting ΔRD1 were scattered throughout the tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). In contrast, WT-infected macrophages induced the aggregation of preexisting ΔRD1-infected macrophages as early as 4 h after superinfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g006">Figure 6</xref>D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g006">6</xref>E, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g007">7</xref>). These newly formed aggregates were often composed mostly of ΔRD1-infected macrophages with only a few WT-infected macrophages in them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g007">Figure 7</xref>). All aggregates had at least some WT-infected macrophages. Furthermore, ΔRD1/WT aggregates that formed developed normally, increasing in size and recruiting both ΔRD1- and WT-infected macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g006">Figure 6</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g006">G</xref>). Thus, this experiment confirmed that ΔRD1-infected macrophages receive but do not send aggregation signals and have no intrinsic chemotactic defects. Furthermore, it appears that WT-infected macrophages are required to serve as a nidus for each aggregate, suggesting that they create a chemotactic gradient that recruits macrophages.</p>

        <title>Macrophage Aggregation Is Tightly Linked to Intercellular Bacterial Spread</title>
        <p>Having demonstrated that ΔRD1 infection results in both reduced aggregation and lower bacterial numbers, we next pursued experiments to determine the relationship between these two phenotypes. In contrast to the notion that a primary reduction in bacterial numbers obviated the need for aggregation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g003">Figure 3</xref>E), we found that more ΔRD1 than WT bacteria were required for aggregates to form. Therefore, we sought to determine if, conversely, the aggregation defect resulted in reduced bacterial numbers.</p>
        <p>One way that aggregation could impact bacterial numbers is by facilitating the spread of bacteria to uninfected macrophages that are recruited to the aggregates. If so, then aggregate formation should correlate with a dramatic increase in the number of infected macrophages and bacterial burdens. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the number of infected macrophages and bacterial numbers in relation to the time of aggregate formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g008">Figure 8</xref>). We enumerated daily by microscopy the number of infected macrophages during the course of infection starting at 1 d postinjection of bacteria and continuing up to 2 d after aggregates formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g008">Figure 8</xref>A). We counted as day 0 the first day of aggregation. During WT infection, the number of infected macrophages did not change significantly until aggregates formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g008">Figure 8</xref>A). However, upon aggregation, the number of infected macrophages increased dramatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g008">Figure 8</xref>A). Similarly, the number of viable bacteria also did not increase until after aggregation occurred 3–5 d postinfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g008">Figure 8</xref>B). Taken together, these data suggest that during WT infection, macrophage aggregation promotes intercellular bacterial spread and an increased bacterial burden.</p>

This difference could be solely due to the ongoing defect in macrophage recruitment by the ΔRD1-containing aggregates. It could also involve additional pathways that result in decreased bacterial spread to uninfected macrophages in the aggregates. In either case, this result suggests that while aggregation is required for intercellular bacterial spread, it is not sufficient. Additional RD1-mediated events must occur to facilitate spread after aggregation.</p>

        <title>WT Aggregates Have More Cell Death Than ΔRD1 Aggregates</title>
        <p>Having established that RD1 is involved in macrophage recruitment to aggregates, we sought to determine if it also affects intercellular bacterial spread by additional means. The <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. tuberculosis</named-content> RD1 locus is thought to promote intercellular bacterial spread in confluent cultured macrophage monolayers by promoting death of infected cells and subsequent phagocytosis of the released bacteria by surrounding cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Guinn1">Guinn et al. 2004</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that RD1 might operate similarly in the embryo aggregates to mediate bacterial spread by facilitating cell death. For this assessment, we achieved comparably sized aggregates with the two strains by infecting embryos with 6.6-fold more ΔRD1 than WT bacteria, and performed terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining on whole infected embryos to visualize dead and dying cells. The TUNEL reaction labels double-stranded DNA breaks that can occur during apoptosis and certain forms of necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Gavrieli1">Gavrieli et al. 1992</xref>). WT infected embryos had more aggregates with TUNEL-positive cells (15 of 23) than did ΔRD1-infected embryos (6 of 22) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g009">Figure 9</xref>).

Since both the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. tuberculosis</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. marinum</named-content> RD1 mutants exhibit a sustained attenuation during chronic infection of adult animals (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g002">Figure 2</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Lewis1">Lewis et al. 2003</xref>), we wished to determine if the early aggregation defect we had discovered using the zebrafish embryo model impacts granuloma formation and maturation later in infection. We infected embryos with low doses of either WT or ΔRD1 bacteria and confirmed infection microscopically at 6 d postfertilization. Using these low infection doses, we could raise a very few WT-infected embryos to adulthood. In contrast, the mortality of the ΔRD1-infected embryos was no different from that of uninfected embryos during a 32 d observation period (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g003">Figure 3</xref>B) (unpublished data). At 32 d, the fish were assessed by tissue histopathology. Mycobacteria were identified within the granulomas in all of the surviving fish, showing that they were chronically infected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g010">Figure 10</xref>). WT-infected fish had highly organized granulomas, both caseating and noncaseating in roughly equal proportions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g010">Figure 10</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g010">10</xref>C), with bacteria located predominantly in the caseum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g010">Figure 10</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g010">10</xref>D). These granulomas appeared identical to granulomas resulting from infection of adult zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Cosma2">Cosma et al. 2004</xref>). In contrast, ΔRD1-infected fish had only a few granulomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g010">Figure 10</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g010">10</xref>F), all of which were noncaseating and markedly different even from WT noncaseating granulomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g010">Figure 10</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g010">10</xref>E). The WT-induced granulomas were compact and were composed of tightly packed cells that displayed the indistinct cytoplasmic borders and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm characteristic of epithelioid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020367-g010">Figure 10</xref>C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Adams1">Adams 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Bouley1">Bouley et al. 2001</xref>).

        <p>In summary, the ΔRD1-induced macrophage aggregates in infected embryos raised to adulthood had the same lack of organization as the lesions resulting from infection of adult animals (unpublished data) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Sherman2">Sherman et al. 2004</xref>). These studies link our early real-time observations of phenotypes in the context of innate immunity alone to these seen later in infection. It appears that while some macrophage aggregation does occur in the absence of RD1, this locus continues to mediate aspects of macrophage chemotaxis and/or differentiation that contribute to granuloma architecture even as the infection becomes chronic.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We used the zebrafish-<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. marinum</named-content> infection model to identify the steps at which the <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> RD1 virulence locus impacts the infection process. We found that two steps are independently affected: macrophage aggregation into granulomas and intercellular spread therein. Promotion of cell death within these aggregates appears to be at least one of the means by which RD1 affects intercellular spread. By comparing WT and ΔRD1 infection in real time, we have uncovered the promotion of granuloma formation as a mechanism of <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> virulence.</p>
      <p>The RD1 locus has been the recent subject of attention following its discovery as a major factor in the attenuation of BCG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Pym1">Pym et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Lewis1">Lewis et al. 2003</xref>) and the potential of an <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. tuberculosis</named-content> RD1-defective strain as a candidate vaccine for tuberculosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Hsu1">Hsu et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Pym2">Pym et al. 2003</xref>). Subsequent studies suggested that it encodes a novel specialized secretion system for specific virulence effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Hsu1">Hsu et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Pym2">Pym et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Stanley1">Stanley et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Guinn1">Guinn et al. 2004</xref>). Deletion of the RD1 locus in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. tuberculosis</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. marinum</named-content> results in reduced bacterial numbers during infection of cultured macrophages and adult animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Hsu1">Hsu et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Lewis1">Lewis et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Stanley1">Stanley et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Guinn1">Guinn et al. 2004</xref>; this study). Different in vitro studies have implicated the RD1 locus and its effectors ESAT-6 and CFP-10 in a variety of functions including lysis of cultured macrophage in confluent monolayers to promote intercellular spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Guinn1">Guinn et al. 2004</xref>), disruption of artificial membranes (taken as a surrogate for lysis of host epithelial cell layers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Hsu1">Hsu et al. 2003</xref>), and dampening of macrophage proinflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Stanley1">Stanley et al. 2003</xref>). Whether these in vitro activities operate in vivo and how they impact virulence are not known. As is the case with virtually all <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> virulence determinants, the precise steps at which RD1 impacts virulence have not been elucidated.</p>
      <p>The <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> infection model used here allows monitoring of the earliest individual stages of infection in real-time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Davis1">Davis et al. 2002</xref>). Using this model, we were able to confirm that RD1 promotes macrophage death in vivo. Additionally, we have shown that the RD1 locus affects an unanticipated earlier step in pathogenesis, macrophage aggregation. Aggregation of infected cells is independent of bacterial replication within individual macrophages and distinct from other macrophage functions such as their chemotaxis to the bacteria and migration back to deeper tissues.</p>
      <p>We speculate that RD1 mediates aggregation via its secreted effectors, which presumably interact with components of host macrophage signaling pathways to modulate macrophage aggregation. Some combination of chemokines, cytokines, and adhesion molecules is likely to be affected. Our superinfection experiments suggest a model by which RD1 impacts cellular signaling and aggregation. Because the ΔRD1-induced aggregates that form upon superinfection with WT bacteria always have at least one WT-infected macrophage, the RD1-induced signal likely diffuses from the infected macrophage to attract other macrophages to it to form aggregates. As ΔRD1-infected macrophages can receive but not send signals for aggregation, RD1 is likely required to induce expression of a chemotactic molecule but not its receptor.</p>
      <p>The formation of the tuberculous granuloma requires a complex cascade of interrelated signals that mediate cell recruitment, adhesion, and differentiation. In our model, ΔRD1 infection results in alterations of all three processes. The initial lack of aggregation suggests a specific defect in the ability of ΔRD1-infected macrophages to recruit additional macrophages to form aggregates. Our real-time monitoring showed that ΔRD1-infected macrophages fail to aggregate even when they are in close proximity, suggesting that the primary defect in ΔRD1-infected macrophages is in the ability to send chemotactic signals for aggregation. On the other hand, our finding that ΔRD1-infected macrophage aggregates are more transient than WT ones may implicate both chemotactic and adhesion defects. This idea is further supported by the finding that the ΔRD1-induced lesions in the adult fish are composed of loosely aggregated macrophages with little epithelioid differentiation. However, a primary defect in the ability of ΔRD1-infected macrophages to send chemotactic signals could affect subsequent expression of adhesion molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Peters1">Peters and Ernst 2003</xref>). Therefore we propose that the <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> RD1 locus induces infected macrophages to send chemotactic signals for aggregation of macrophages, which in turn affect adhesion and other downstream events that result in granuloma formation. Granuloma formation is not completely blocked upon infection with a ΔRD1 strain, as has been shown previously in the murine model of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. tuberculosis</named-content> infection and in patient studies of disseminated BCG infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Emile1">Emile et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Sherman2">Sherman et al. 2004</xref>). However, our data indicate that RD1 influences early aggregation events that seem to extend into later stages of infection.</p>
      <p>Our data further suggest a model in which bacterial dissemination is facilitated by recruitment into the aggregates of uninfected macrophages that provide new habitats for further bacterial growth. Some ways in which incoming macrophages become infected could include transfer of bacteria between macrophages along membranous tethers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Davis1">Davis et al. 2002</xref>), actin-based motility of extravacuolar bacteria leading to intercellular transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Stamm1">Stamm et al. 2003</xref>), and release of bacteria from dying infected cells. These dead cells could either release bacteria for phagocytosis by neighboring cells or be engulfed in their entirety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Ramakrishnan1">Ramakrishnan and Falkow 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Davis1">Davis et al. 2002</xref>). All of these modes of bacterial transfer are likely to be enhanced by the close juxtaposition of macrophages within aggregates. Our data are consistent with earlier reports suggesting that RD1 mediates bacterially induced toxicity to host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Hsu1">Hsu et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Guinn1">Guinn et al. 2004</xref>). While TUNEL staining is not a conclusive indication of apoptosis, it is most often associated with programmed cell death. In vitro studies indicate that apoptosis leads to bacterial cell death; however, our experiments indicate a correlation between host cell death and bacterial dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Fratazzi1">Fratazzi et al. 1999</xref>). Since we did not observe TUNEL-positive infected cells prior to aggregation or outside of the aggregates, we believe that aggregation precedes cell death. Mechanistically, it is possible that RD1 effectors modulate impinge upon distinct signaling pathways for cell aggregation and death. Alternatively, RD1 may impact a common molecule, such as tumor necrosis factor, that affects both processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Locksley1">Locksley et al. 2001</xref>). Other modes of bacterial transfer may also contribute to bacterial dissemination, and these may or may not be mediated by RD1.</p>
      <p>Our examination of early infection events in vivo may serve to identify relevant findings from the in vitro studies. For instance, our data do not support the model that RD1 contains a cytolysin for epithelial cell barriers that allows mycobacteria to penetrate directly into deeper tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Hsu1">Hsu et al. 2003</xref>). Rather, these findings corroborate previous work from our laboratory and others showing that systemic dissemination of mycobacteria is effected mainly by trafficking of infected host mononuclear cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Teitelbaum1">Teitelbaum et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Davis1">Davis et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Geijtenbeek1">Geijtenbeek et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Tailleux1">Tailleux et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Cosma2">Cosma et al. 2004</xref>). We show, furthermore, that RD1 is not required for this early event. Another in vitro study describes the dampening of several macrophage innate immune responses, including the cytokine tumor necrosis factor, by WT but not RD1-mutant <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. tuberculosis</named-content> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Stanley1">Stanley et al. 2003</xref>). While this may be true in vivo as well, our functional approach shows that there is not a global dampening of chemotactic and innate immune responses by WT mycobacteria. Rather there is an RD1-mediated enhancement of macrophage aggregation and death.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, our studies reveal that <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> expresses specific virulence factors that enhance macrophage aggregation into granulomas, starting very early after infection. This effect correlates with bacterial dissemination and an increase in the bacterial burden. Granulomas are thought to be primarily protective host immune structures that provide a focused immune response to restrict mycobacteria. According to prevailing models, recruitment and activation of additional macrophages provide a concentrated source of immune effectors that thwart the bacteria. The specific differentiation of macrophages into epithelioid cells with tightly interdigitated intercellular membranes helps sequester the infection. While there is clear evidence that granulomas are necessary for protection, there is increasing evidence that they are incompletely effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Flynn1">Flynn and Chan 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Cosma1">Cosma et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Cosma2">Cosma et al. 2004</xref>). We have recently shown that superinfecting mycobacteria traffic rapidly into preestablished granulomas, yet can survive therein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020367-Cosma2">Cosma et al. 2004</xref>). The present study showing that mycobacteria promote the formation of these structures to enhance their dissemination reveals an even greater complexity in the granuloma's role in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis.</p>
