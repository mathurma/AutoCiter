<abstract>
<p>Recurrent tumors originate from cancer stem cells (CSCs) that survive conventional treatments. CSCs consist of heterogeneous subpopulations that display distinct sensitivity to anticancer drugs. Such a heterogeneity presents a significant challenge in preventing tumor recurrence. In the current study, we observed that quiescent CUB-domain–containing protein 1 (CDCP1)+ CSCs are enriched after chemotherapy in mutant Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (<italic>Kras</italic>) colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) and serve as a reservoir for recurrence. Mechanistically, glucose catabolism in CDCP1+ CSCs is routed to the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP); multiple cycling of carbon backbones in the oxidative PPP potentially maximizes NADPH reduction to counteract chemotherapy-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, thereby allowing CDCP1+ CSCs to survive chemotherapeutic attack. This is dependent on silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 5 (Sirt5)-mediated inhibition of the glycolytic enzyme triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) through demalonylation of Lys56. Blocking demalonylation of TPI at Lys56 increases chemosensitivity of CDCP1+ CSCSs and delays recurrence of mutant <italic>Kras</italic> CRCs in vivo. These findings pinpoint a new therapeutic approach for combating mutant <italic>Kras</italic> CRCs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Advances in pharmaceutical and surgical intervention have significantly improved the outcome in patients with colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref001">1</xref>]. However, recurrence eventually occurs in nearly all patients who initially respond to systemic treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref002">2</xref>]. Increasing evidence suggest that cancer stem cells (CSCs) are enriched after treatment because of resistance to anticancer cytotoxic drugs and are responsible for recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref003">3</xref>]. CSCs are an intrinsically heterogeneous population that consists of phenotypically and functionally different subsets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref004">4</xref>]. Not all CSC subpopulations play distinct roles in drug resistance. For example, only CSCs that express aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1 (ALDH1A1) in lung cancer are resistant to gefitinib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref005">5</xref>]. In murine CRC models, chemotherapeutic agents enrich epithelial-specific antigen (ESA)+ cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44)+ CD166+ CSCs in tumor xenografts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref006">6</xref>]. Therefore, treatment of relapsed tumors using the regimen that results in remission of the primary tumor is suboptimal.</p>
<p>We previously demonstrated that colon CSCs characterized by CDCP1 expression exhibit decreased sensitivity to 5-fluoropyrimidine (5-FU) when compared with other CSC subpopulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref007">7</xref>]. CDCP1 is a type I transmembrane <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoprotein" xlink:type="simple">glycoprotein</ext-link> that consists of a 29-residue amino terminal signal peptide, an extracellular domain containing three complement C1r/C1s, Uegf, Bmp1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUB_domain" xlink:type="simple">CUB) domains</ext-link>, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain containing five <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine" xlink:type="simple">tyrosine residues</ext-link>. Up-regulation of CDCP1 in a variety of solid cancers has been associated with disease progression and poor patient survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref008">8</xref>]. Recent literature shows that hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-2α is essential for induction of CDCP1 expression under hypoxic conditions, a common microenvironment for cancer cells that contributes to chemoresistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref009">9</xref>]. CDCP1 facilitates proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase SRC (SRC)-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) crosstalk and confers resistance to trastuzumab treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref010">10</xref>]. Based on the aforementioned facts, we speculated that colon CDCP1+ CSCs survive exposure to anticancer cytotoxic agents. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.4161/cc.29460 - R4#R4Of note, CRC patients harboring <italic>Kras</italic> mutations are more likely to present with or to develop lung metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref011">11</xref>]. After curative treatment, the cumulative recurrence of lung metastases was significantly higher in CRC patients with mutant <italic>Kras</italic> (mu<italic>Kras</italic>) compared with those with wild-type Kras (wt<italic>Kras</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref012">12</xref>]. Since CDCP1+ CSCs have an extremely high propensity to metastasize to the lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref007">7</xref>], selective enrichment of CDCP1+ cells following chemotherapy in mu<italic>Kras</italic> CRCs was observed in the current study, suggesting the role of CDCP1+ CSCs in eventual recurrence for that subtype of CRCs.</p>
<p>To define fundamental aspects of CDCP1+ CSC biology, which are conserved irrespective of interpatient or intrapatient heterogeneity, we investigated energy metabolism, a basic requirement of any cell type. Cancer cells appear to commonly acquire aberrancies in energy metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref013">13</xref>]. For example, cancer cells in the presence of oxygen tend to employ glycolysis instead of aerobic mitochondrial respiration to generate energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref014">14</xref>]. However, while such tumor-related metabolic adaptations characterize bulk tumor cells, it is unclear whether colon CDCP1+ CSCs exhibit a similar metabolic phenotype. Gaining further insights into the metabolic properties of CDCP1+ CSCs may reveal physiological dependencies that can be targeted for clinical therapy.</p>

<title>CDCP1+ CSCs in mu<italic>Kras</italic> CRCs are selectively enriched following chemotherapy</title>
<p>In this study, we used a panel of isogenic CRC cell lines, DLD1-derived DKs5 (<italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>G13D</italic></sup>) and DKO3 (<italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>WT</italic></sup>) cells and HCT116-derived HK2-10 (<italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>G13D</italic></sup>) and HKe3 (<italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>WT</italic></sup>) cells, in which wt<italic>Kras</italic> or mu<italic>Kras</italic> alleles have been disrupted by targeted homologous recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref015">15</xref>]. When cell lines with mu<italic>Kras</italic> were treated with 5-FU for 48 and 72 h, a gradual separation of the total population emerged into live 7-aminoactinomycin–(7AAD–) and dead 7AAD+ subpopulations. With increasing incubation time, 7AAD–cells were incrementally enriched for CDCP1+ cells, whereas 7AAD+ cells were relatively negative for CDCP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Oxaliplatin also failed to eradicate all mu<italic>Kras</italic> CRC cells and enriched for CDCP1+ cells, however, to a lesser extent than seen for 5-FU (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000425.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). By contrast, cell lines harboring wt<italic>Kras</italic> did not show such an enrichment pattern upon treatment of chemotherapeutic agents (5-FU and oxaliplatin) or anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) drugs (cetuximab) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g001">Fig 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000425.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>), indicating other potential operating mechanisms of drug resistance.</p>

<p>(A) DKs5, DKO3, HK2-10, and HKe3 cells were persistently treated with 5-FU (5 μM) and analyzed for CDCP1 expression by flow cytometry at the indicated time points. Dead cells were detected by 7AAD staining. The experiments were independently repeated three times in triplicate. (B) BALB/c-nu mice bearing CRC108 or CRC102 epidermal xenografts received FOLFOX treatment twice weekly for 2 weeks. Representative images (left panels) and quantification (right panel) of CDCP1+ cell frequency in untreated tumors (week 0; <italic>n</italic> = 3) and tumor remnants after FOLFOX (week 2; <italic>n</italic> = 3) were evaluated by IHC. (C) Comparison of immunohistochemical CDCP1 staining from 15 CRC patients before and after neoadjuvant therapy. All patients achieved a partial response (P). (D) CRC108 cells were FACS-sorted according to their CDCP1 expression, and the isolated subfractions were cultured as adherent monolayers overnight. After subsequent 5-FU treatment (5 μM) for 7 days, the frequencies of CDCP1+ and CDCP1– cells were again quantified by flow cytometry. Dead cells were detected by 7AAD staining.

<p>The in vitro observations were confirmed in mice bearing patient-derived epidermal xenografts (CRC102 with <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>WT</italic></sup>; CRC108 with <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>G12D</italic></sup>) administrated with folinic acid + fluorouracil +oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) regimen (5-FU, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin). The treatment resulted in rapid tumor shrinkage within 2 weeks. Tumors relapsed within 4 weeks of treatment cessation in all animal subjects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000425.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). Notably, CDCP1+ cells were selectively enriched in epithelial remnants of CRC108 but not CRC102 tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). In addition, we examined changes in CDCP1 staining after neoadjuvant treatment in 15 CRC patients (7 cases with mu<italic>Kras</italic>, 8 cases with wt<italic>Kras</italic>), all of whom initially achieved a partial regression to drug treatment. As compared to the pretreatment values, the score of CDCP1 staining was significantly increased in 6 out of 7 residual tumors with mu<italic>Kras</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). These data imply a universal chemoresistance of CDCP1+ CSCs in mu<italic>Kras</italic> CRCs.</p>
<p>Next, we determined whether the drug-induced enrichment of CDCP1+ cells results from selection of pre-existing cells or induction of CDCP1 expression. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, about 15.7% of sorted CDCP1+ cells turned to be CDCP1-negative within 7 days after separation, while no sorted CDCP1– cells became CDCP1-positive, indicating one-way phenotypic shift between the two subsets. After treatment with 5-FU for 7 days, we saw no substantial enrichment for CDCP1+ cells in the progeny of initially CDCP1+ cells, suggesting that no additional CDCP1+ cells were induced. Most newly developed CDCP1– cells underwent apoptosis under 5-FU treatment. Meanwhile, no apparent preference for CDCP1 induction in the progeny of CDCP1– cells was observed. Together with the results from consecutive measurements of CDCP1 mRNA under 5-FU treatment that did not show transcriptional up-regulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000425.s001">S1D Fig</xref>), we concluded that the major mechanism for the enrichment of CDCP1+ cells following chemotherapy is a selection of pre-existing CDCP1+ CSCs.</p>

<title>High CDCP1 expression in mu<italic>Kras</italic> CRCs correlates with shorter time to lung recurrence and poorer response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy</title>
<p>We further asked the value of CDCP1 expression in predicting recurrence and therapeutic responses in mu<italic>Kras</italic> CRCs. In the first cohort of 93 stage II or III primary mu<italic>Kras</italic> CRC patients receiving curative treatments, recurrence was noted in 52 subjects within 5 years (21 in the liver, 31 in the lungs, and 2 in both sites). Analyzing the data by dividing CDCP1 expression in primary CRCs prior to chemotherapy (CDCP1<sup>high</sup> versus CDCP1<sup>low/negative</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000425.s001">S1E Fig</xref>) suggested an association of high CDCP1 expression with shorter time to lung recurrence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g001">Fig 1E</xref>) and poor overall survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). High CDCP1 expression was not associated with relapse in the liver (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000425.s001">S1F Fig</xref>). After adjusting for age, gender, tumor stage, site, and standard therapy in a multivariate analysis, high CDCP1 expression was an independent risk factor for lung recurrence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000425.s007">S1 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>In a separate cohort of 52 cases with stage II or III mu<italic>Kras</italic> CRCs, we examined the relationship between patient responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and CDCP1 mRNA level using prechemotherapeutic tumor biopsies. For this purpose, residual cancer burden (RCB) was assessed at the time of surgery, which takes into account parameters such as tumor bed area, overall cellularity, and lymph node involvement. Tumors with the poorest response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (RCB III) exhibited substantially higher CDCP1 expression prior to therapy than tumors that exhibited a greater response to chemotherapy (RCB 0, I, and II) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). By stark contrast, CDCP1 expression did not portend a poorer response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in a pool of 47 stage II or III CRCs harboring wt<italic>Kras</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000425.s001">S1G Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>CDCP1+ CSCs drive post-therapeutic recurrence in mu<italic>Kras</italic> CRCs</title>

FCT mice developed tubular CRCs following 14 weeks of Dox induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000425.s002">S2E Fig</xref>). Colonoscopic monitoring showed reduced tumor burdens upon administration of intraperitoneal (IP) FOLFOX for 2 weeks (regression phase); relapse was detected in 11 out of 17 mice within 10–12 weeks after treatment cessation (relapse phase; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000425.s002">S2E Fig</xref>). To perform lineage tracing on CDCP1+ CSCs, tumor-bearing FCT mice were injected with tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) to specifically mark CDCP1+ cells with tdTomato (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000425.s002">S2F Fig</xref>). Upon FOLFOX administration and withdrawal, the lineage trace experiment showed that the frequency of marked CDCP1+ cells remained constant throughout the tracing period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), indicating that this population is self-renewing. In contrast, the percentage of tdTomato+ tumor cells increased progressively despite decreased tumor burden in the regression phase; at week 7 after drug withdrawal, nearly 90% of relapsed tumor cells were tdTomato+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>). Such a percentage was significantly higher than that in untreated control tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000425.s002">S2G Fig</xref>). To summarize, CDCP1+ cells are capable of self-renewing and differentiating into the fast-dividing cells to form relapsed tumors.</p>

<title>CDCP1+ CSCs in mu<italic>Kras</italic> CRCs define a quiescent subpopulation</title>
<p>Similar to normal stem cells, CSCs are quiescent, slow-cycling cells endowed with long-term repopulation ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref017">17</xref>]. As compared with CDCP1– cells from mu<italic>Kras</italic> tumor cells (DKs5 and HK2-10), the matched CDCP1+ fraction expressed lower levels of markers for cell proliferation, including Ki67, PCNA, and MCM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g002">Fig 2G</xref>). CDCP1+ cells were identified exclusively within the CD133+ fraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref007">7</xref>]. Analysis of mu<italic>Kras</italic> tumor cells using Hoechst plus pyronin Y staining showed that &gt;90% of the CD133+ CDCP1+ fraction was in the G0 phase, whereas most CD133+ CDCP1– and CD133– fractions were actively cell cycling (&lt;47% in the G0 phase). In contrast, cells were highly proliferative regardless of CDCP1 status in wt<italic>Kras</italic> tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g002">Fig 2H</xref>).</p>
<p>We also used a chronic thymidine analog label-chase experiment to define tumor-proliferative dynamics. NOG mice carrying CRC102 or CRC108 orthotopic xenografts received 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) through drinking water for 8 days and were killed at varying time points during a 40-day chase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g002">Fig 2I</xref>). The label-chase experiment showed that in both CRC102 and CRC108 xenografts, CD133– cells and CD133+ CDCP1– cells rapidly acquired and diluted the EdU label, confirming a high degree of cell proliferation and turnover. However, the CD133+ CDCP1+ fraction in CRC108 xenografts, but not CRC102 xenografts, acquired EdU more slowly, labeled to a lesser extent, and maintained the label throughout the chase, suggesting a state of quiescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g002">Fig 2J</xref>).</p>

<title>Intermediate metabolites are rerouted from glycolysis to PPP in CDCP1+ CSCs from mu<italic>Kras</italic> CRCs</title>
<p>It is believed that quiescent CSCs keep lower ROS level to help them survive from chemotherapy-induced ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref018">18</xref>]. As compared to the CDCP1– fraction in mu<italic>Kras</italic> tumor cells (DKs5 and HK2-10), CDCP1+ CSCs exhibited relatively lower levels of intracellular ROS, accompanied with remarkably higher levels of the [NADPH/NADP+] and [glutathione/glutathione disulfide] ([GSH/GSSG]) ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). However, the difference of the redox parameters between CDCP1– and CDCP1+ fractions was negligible in wt<italic>Kras</italic> tumor cells (DKO3 and HKe3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). GSH redox status is dependent on NADPH production from various respiratory substrates. To determine which NADPH-producing enzyme(s) may contribute to the observed redox state in CDCP1+ CSCs from mu<italic>Kras</italic> CRCs, we knocked down NADPH-producing enzymes, including glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), malic enzyme 1 (ME1), methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (MTHFD1/2), and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1/2) in DKs5-derived CDCP1+ cells. The ratio of [NADPH/NADP+] was reduced by 77% and 69% in G6PD knockdown (KD) and 6PGD KD cells, respectively, while KD of ME1, MTHFD1/2 or IDH1/2 did not exert such apparent effects on redox balance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000425.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). These data suggested that NADPH is mainly produced through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). The PPP is a metabolic pathway parallel to glycolysis. In glycolysis hexose phosphates, hexose bisphosphates, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP)/dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) were elevated in CDCP1+ cells from mu<italic>Kras</italic> tumors compared to the matched CDCP1– fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). However, concentrations of 2/3-phosphoglycerate (xPG) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), metabolites of the lower glycolysis, were significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). The strongest difference was observed for 6-phosphoglucono-D-lactone (6PGL) and 6-phosphogluconate (6PG) in the oxidative branch of the PPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). The levels of metabolites of the nonoxidative branch of PPP (i.e., erythrose 4-phosphate [E4P], sedoheptulose 7-phosphate [S7P], and pentose phosphates) showed an attenuated increase in CDCP1+ CSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). The increase in PPP metabolites was paralleled by an accumulation of the purine precursor 5-phosphoribosylamine (5PRA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), suggesting an increased purine de novo biosynthesis possibly needed for fast and efficient DNA repair mechanisms in CSCs.</p>

<p>Next, we attempted to corroborate our findings using <sup>14</sup>C-glucose. Increased flux through the oxidative PPP pathway, as measured by the amount of released <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> from [1-<sup>14</sup>C]-glucose, was indeed observed in CDCP1+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). This result was further confirmed by metabolically labeling the cells with [1,2-<sup>13</sup>C]-glucose and measuring the relative isotopic enrichment of doubly versus singly [<sup>13</sup>C]-labeled lactate, pyruvate, and 3-phosphoglycerate by liquid chromatograph-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis, an established method that directly tracks labeled glucose flux simultaneously through glycolysis and the PPP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref019">19</xref>]. Specifically, at least 2.6-fold increase in PPP flux was observed in CDCP1+ cells as compared to the matched CDCP1– fraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000425.s003">S3B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate the detailed rerouting and infer the directionality of fluxes in oxidative and nonoxidative PPP, we analyzed the metabolic response after depletion of G6PD, transketolase (TK), or transaldolase (TA) in CDCP1+ CSCs. In G6PD KDs, the levels of 6PGL and 6PG were significantly attenuated, demonstrating that their accumulation is caused by activation of the oxidative PPP involving G6PD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). The concentrations of pentose phosphates and S7P in the G6PD KDs were also reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g003">Fig 3D</xref>), suggesting that the accumulation in pentose phosphates results from an increased higher flux from 6PG but not from glycolysis via reversed TK and TA. Accordingly, single or double KDs of TK and TA led to even stronger accumulation of pentose phosphates and 5PRA pools, accompanied by a pronounced decrease of metabolites in upper glycolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Thus, the carbon flux from the oxidative branch returns to glycolysis through TA and TK, leading to accumulation of upper glycolytic metabolites.</p>
<p>Upon strong cycling of carbon through oxidative and nonoxidative PPP, a fraction of carbon backbones may be converted back to G6P by the reversible phosphoglucoisomerase (PGI) and cycle again through oxidative PPP to further increase NADPH production. Exploiting the loss of the 1-C of glucose in the oxidative PPP and the measured 6PG<sub>m+0</sub> fraction of the [1-<sup>13</sup>C] glucose experiment, we estimated the relative contribution of unlabeled hexose phosphates (f<sub>cycling</sub>) to the oxidative PPP to increase from 10.6% ± 5.9% in CDCP1– cells to 48.2% ± 12.6% in the matched CDCP1+ subpopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g003">Fig 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>To verify that metabolic rerouting in the PPP is necessary for protection of CDCP1+ CSCs against oxidative stress from chemotherapy, we investigated the change in NADPH/NADP+ ratio and ROS levels with perturbed PPP functionality. KDs of either G6PD or TK/TA in CDCP1+ cells resulted in higher ROS level and lower NADPH/NADP+ ratio (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000425.s003">S3C Fig</xref>). Stress conditions induced by 5-FU or oxaliplatin resulted in further elevated ROS levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g003">Fig 3F</xref>, upper) and subsequent apoptosis in either G6PD or TK/TA KDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g003">Fig 3F</xref>, lower).

<title>Sirt5 demalonylates TPI K56 to suppress its enzyme activity</title>
<p>The decreased concentration of xPG and PEP suggested that activities of the enzymes involved in the lower glycolysis is blocked, which can lead to an accumulation of upper glycolytic metabolites and thereby induces an increased flux into PPP through both the oxidative and nonoxidative branches. Metabolic enzyme activity is controlled by three principle levels: the amount of enzyme, the catalytic activity, and the accessibility of substrates. Of note, among the enzymes of the lower glycolysis (TPI; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [GAPDH], phosphoglycerate kinase [PGK], phosphoglucomutase [PGM], enolase, and pyruvate kinase [PK]), only activity of endogenous TPI was suppressed in CDCP1+ cells from mu<italic>Kras</italic> CRCs as compared to the matched CDCP1– fraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000425.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). No difference in the protein expression levels of TPI was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000425.s004">S4B Fig</xref>), indicating that the decrease in activity was not due to reduced TPI expression. To clarify the regulatory mechanism(s) underlying TPI activity, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments followed by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis in CRC102-derived CDCP1+ cells. This screen revealed that the most common interaction partner of TPI corresponds to Sirt5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000425.s008">S2 Table</xref>). Sirt5 coprecipitated with TPI in CDCP1+ cells from mu<italic>Kras</italic> CRCs, while the association was lost in the CDCP1– counterpart. Such an interaction was also not observed in wt<italic>Kras</italic> tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Sirt5 is a global regulator of lysine acetylation, succinylation, malonylation, and glutarylation in mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref023">23</xref>]. Upon Au-H3K9Su (gold nanoparticles tethered with H3K9Su, a selective Sirt5 inhibitor) treatment, the malonylation level of TPI was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), accompanied by significantly increased TPI enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). TPI demalonylation was only detectable in CDCP1+ CSCs from mu<italic>Kras</italic> CRCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000425.s004">S4C Fig</xref>), suggesting that demalonylation negatively regulates TP1 activity. Besides, TPI malonylation was remarkably increased by Sirt5 KD in CDCP1+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g004">Fig 4D</xref>), with concomitant activation in catalytic activity by as much as &gt;2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). Overexpression of a catalytically dead Sirt5 mutant (H158Y), which still strongly interacted with endogenous TPI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000425.s004">S4D Fig</xref>), had a similar effect on TPI malonylation and its enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g004">Fig 4D and 4E</xref>).

<p>To identify Sirt5-targeted demalonylation site(s) of TPI, we overexpressed Flag-tagged TPI in CRC108-derived CDCP1+ cells. Tandem MS analysis identified three lysine malonylation sites (K56, K122, and K231) upon Sirt5 KD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000425.s004">S4E Fig</xref>). We constructed a malonylation-resistant TPI mutant (TPI 3M) in which all three lysines were mutated to alanines (A). Immunoblotting analyses showed that TPI 3M mutation abrogated malonylation of TPI in Sirt5-depleted CDCP1+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). We further constructed single-site TPI mutants, including TPI K56A, K122A, and K231A. Among them, TPI K122A and K231A greatly increased TPI malonylation in Sirt5-depleted CDCP1+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). Unlike wild-type (WT) TPI and K122A/K231A mutants, the K56A mutant displayed a negligible response to either Sirt5 KD or Sirt5 H158Y overexpression in changing malonylation level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g004">Fig 4F</xref>), as well as enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g004">Fig 4G</xref>).

<title>K56 demalonylation impairs the formation of dimeric TPI to inhibit its enzyme activity</title>
<p>The TPI enzyme exists as a mixture of monomer and dimer, but only the dimeric form is catalytically active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref024">24</xref>]. The crystal structure of the TPI dimer showed that K56 is localized at the interface (Protein Data Bank: 4POC). Malonylation of K56 promotes the formation of hydrogen bonds at the dimer interface with D88 and Q91 and thereby stabilizes the dimerization of TPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). Next, we attempted to test whether K56 demalonylation inhibits TPI activity through impairing the integrity of dimer interface and subsequently the formation of active dimers of TPI. To test this hypothesis, we determined the interaction between two differentially tagged TPI proteins, HA-TPI and Flag-TPI, in CDCP1+ cells. Strikingly, substitution of K56A, but not K56E, primarily disrupted the interaction between TPI subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). A glutaraldehyde cross-linking assay showed that the K56A mutant displayed impaired ability to form dimers when compared to WT TPI or the K56E mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g006">Fig 6D</xref>), further suggesting that K56 demalonylation largely hinders the interaction between TPI subunits. Moreover, Sirt5 overexpression decreased the binding by approximately 85% between the two differentially tagged proteins of WT TPI but exerted no impact on the interaction between Flag-tagged and HA-tagged K56E mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g006">Fig 6E</xref>).</p>

<title>CDCP1 cleavage is essential for the Sirt5–TPI interaction in CDCP1+ CSCs from mu<italic>Kras</italic> CRCs</title>
<p>Finally, we investigated the potential mechanisms facilitating the Sirt5–TPI interaction in CDCP1+ CSCs. To become functionally active, the full-length CDCP1 (135 kDa) is cleaved by serine proteases to generate a membrane-retained 70 kDa fragment. The C-terminus of the resulting fragment acts as a docking platform for activation of downstream events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref008">8</xref>]. CDCP1 existed mainly in the full-length form in wt<italic>Kras</italic> CRCs and in a cleaved form in mu<italic>Kras</italic> tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). This phenomenon could be attributed to negligible secretion of plasmin, a major serine protease responsible for CDCP1 cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref025">25</xref>], in wt<italic>Kras</italic> tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Indeed, ectopic expression of plasminogen, the inactive precursor of plasmin, led to increased CDCP1 cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g007">Fig 7B</xref>) and decreased chemosensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g007">Fig 7C</xref>) in HKe3-derived CDCP1+ cells. The consistently higher plasmin expression in mu<italic>Kras</italic> CRCs compared with wt<italic>Kras</italic> tumors points to a correlation between <italic>Kras</italic> activation and plasmin expression. To test this, we performed mutant <italic>Kras</italic> KD, which markedly decreased plasmin expression and abolished CDCP1 cleavage in CRC108 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). The effects observed following mutant <italic>Kras</italic> KD were largely rescued by overexpression of a constitutively active Akt mutant but not a constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g007">Fig 7D</xref>), suggesting that the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (Akt) pathway mediates plasmin expression downstream of <italic>Kras</italic>. Because TPI demalonylation was only observed in CDCP1+ CSCs from mu<italic>Kras</italic> tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000425.s004">S4C Fig</xref>), we asked whether CDCP1 cleavage is essential for TPI<sup>K56</sup> malonylation. We generated and verified an antibody specifically against malonylated TPI<sup>K56</sup> (anti-TPI malonyl-K56) (S6A, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000425.s006">S6B and S6C Fig</xref>).

Because protein kinase C-delta (PKCδ) signaling lies downstream of the cleaved CDCP1, the effects of 10-D7 treatment in CDCP1+ cells were greatly rescued by constitutively activated PKCδ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g007">Fig 7F</xref>). On the contrary, we overexpressed cleaved CDCP1 (cCDCP1) in the matched CDCP1– cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g007">Fig 7G</xref>) and cocultured these cells with rottlerin (a selective inhibitor of PKCδ). Immunoblotting analyses showed that cCDCP1 promoted the association between Sirt5 and TPI and induced TPI demalonylation at K56, both of which were completely blocked by rottlerin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000425.g007">Fig 7H</xref>).</p>

We showed that despite exhibiting <italic>Kras</italic> activity, functionally defined CDCP1+ CSCs in mu<italic>Kras</italic> CRCs are characterized as quiescent and do not respond to chemotherapeutic agents. Drug sensitivity is, therefore, a functional property that varies between the heterogeneous cell types comprising mu<italic>Kras</italic> CRCs. More importantly, greater lineage traces from CDCP1+ cells following therapy suggested that this subpopulation is the unit of selection responsible for postchemotherapeutic recurrence. Because stem-cell signature expression in various tumor correlates inversely with outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref027">27</xref>], we proposed that the degree of CDCP1 at the gene or protein level relates to the size of the clinically essential pool that can cause relapse. Indeed, analysis of mu<italic>Kras</italic> CRC samples showed higher CDCP1 expression in patients with poorer response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and higher rate of lung recurrence.</p>
<p>Quiescent CSCs preferentially exhibit lower levels of intracellular ROS, which accounts for their resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref018">18</xref>]. On the other hand, stringent regulation of redox status is critical to the control of stem-cell quiescence and to the maintenance of the stem-cell pool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref029">29</xref>]. Unfortunately, how CSCs control ROS production and scavenging still remains poorly understood. GSH is one of the most important antioxidants and scavenges ROS directly or as a cofactor of the glutathione and thioredoxin systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref030">30</xref>]. Reduced NADPH—which is produced in different biochemical pathways, including the PPP, the citric acid cycle (TCA cycle), and folate metabolism—is involved in continuously replenishing the GSH pools as a cofactor of glutathione reductase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref033">33</xref>]. In the current study, analysis in CDCP1+ CSCs demonstrated that metabolic flux is rerouted from glycolysis into oxidative PPP, as indicated by an accumulation of pentose phosphate and upper glycolytic metabolites and a decrease of metabolites in lower glycolysis. Inhibition of glycolytic enzymes (e.g., GAPDH and PK M2) has been shown to lead to rerouting of glucose flux toward anabolic processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref035">35</xref>]. Our results suggest that inactivation of TPI, which functions upstream of these enzymes and is a major classical regulatory point for central carbon flow, exerts profound control over metabolism in CDCP1+ CSCs. This inactivation maximizes the flux of sugar phosphates in the oxidative PPP, potentially through multiple cycling, and thus production of NADPH to counteract chemotherapy-induced formation of ROS. It also raises a question regarding how CDCP1+ CSCs can inactivate TPI to modulate cellular NADPH homeostasis. We discovered for the first time, to our knowledge, that TPI is a direct substrate of Sirt5. Sirt5 is a member of the NAD-dependent sirtuin family that regulates acetylome signaling networks via posttranslational modifications (PTMs) involving various lysine acylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref023">23</xref>]. PTM opens up the opportunity to redirect metabolic flux in response to specific signaling pathways. Here, the interaction between Sirt5 and TPI was attributed to the presence of cleaved CDCP1 in mu<italic>Kras</italic> CRCs. CDCP1-cleavage–induced signaling cascade constituted a unique mechanism whereby proteolytically cleaved CDCP1 enhances the Sirt5–TPI protein interaction and meanwhile increases the demalonylation activity of Sirt5, thereby helping CDCP1+ CSCs to maintain NADPH homeostasis through regulating TPI malonylation status in a Sirt5-dependent manner. Sirt5 has been demonstrated to regulate metabolic enzymes by PTMs and control several cellular metabolism pathways, including TCA cycle and glycolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref022">22</xref>], the urea cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref037">37</xref>], and fatty acid oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref038">38</xref>]. We found that Sirt5-mediated lysine demalonylation at K56 causes enzymatic inhibition of TPI. K56 is located near the dimer interface, which is believed to be critical for the stability and integrity of the active form of TPI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref039">39</xref>]. K56A substitution displays a significant reduction in TPI catalysis and is defective in dimer formation. Therefore, our study provides insights into the role of K56 demalonylation in coordinating the dimer-to-monomer transition of TPI. Because blocking TPI demalonylation enhances its activity and resets the cellular metabolism toward glycolysis, therapeutics that target the metabolic “Achilles heel” of CDCP1+ CSCs by inhibiting TPI demalonylation in parallel to tumor debulking by chemotherapy may be required for optimal therapeutic specificity, yielding the most durable tumor remission in mu<italic>Kras</italic> CRCs. Last but not least, inhibiting TPI demalonylation by Sirt5 inhibitor H3K9Su is an imperfect treatment because of its low membrane permeability. This opens up increased demands for the development of more potent and more cell-permeable inhibitors specific for Sirt5 to combat mu<italic>Kras</italic> CRCs.</p>

Tumor volume was measure as normalized photon flux. When tumor reached approximately 250 units, mice were randomized into the indicated treatment groups, and the mean tumor volumes of each group were similar before the treatment started. No mice were excluded after the treatment started. To assess distant recurrence, lungs were removed from mice with recurrent tumors, and GFP-positive metastases were visualized using an Olympus MVX10 dissecting microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). For subcutaneous xenografts, the indicated cells suspended in 100 μl Hanks’ buffered saline solution were injected subcutaneously in the axillary region of the right chest in BALB/c-nu/nu mice. Tumor volume was measured every 2 days, starting from day 4 postinjection, to monitor the extent of tumor growth, regression, and recurrence.

The rate of NADH consumption was measured at various concentrations of the substrate 3-phosphoglycerate and plotted as a function of substrate concentration to extract the enzyme activity. PGM activity was assayed using a previously described protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000425.ref044">44</xref>]. Briefly, samples were sonicated and cleared by centrifugation (13,500 rpm, 4°C). Then, 20 mg total protein was mixed with assay buffer (50 mM K<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> [pH 7.5], 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM EDTA [pH 8]) containing 0.5 mM NADP+, 1.5 units/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5 mM glucose-1-phosphate, and 0.02 mM glucose 1,6-bisphosphate to a total volume of 150 μl. Reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich. Absorbance at 340 nm was measured kinetically to assess the amount of NADPH produced using a SpectraMax i3 (Molecular Devices). Enolase activity was assayed spectrophotometrically at 240 nm at room temperature as an increase in PEP concentration. The reaction was measured in 50 mM imidazole–HCl buffer (pH 6.8), containing 3 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.4 M KCl, and 1 mM 2-phosphoglycerate acid (PGA) substrate. One unit of enolase activity is defined as the amount of protein which catalyses the synthesis of 1 μM PEP min<sup>–1</sup> under these conditions. The molar absorption coefficient was taken as 1,520 cm<sup>2</sup> mol<sup>–1</sup>. PK activity assay was performed using a PK activity assay kit (BioVision, Milpitas, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells with 4 volumes of pyruvate assay buffer and spinning at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C to remove insoluble material. Cell extracts were added into a 96-well flat bottom plate. The volume was adjusted to 50 μl/well with pyruvate assay buffer. Then, 50 μl of reaction mixture (46 μl of pyruvate assay buffer, 2 μl of pyruvate probe, and 2 μl of enzyme mixture) per well were added and mixed well. The absorbance A<sub>570</sub> nm was scanned once per minute for 40 min at room temperature. At the same time, a standard curve of nmol/well versus A<sub>570</sub> nm readings was plotted. Then, the sample readings were applied to the standard curve to obtain the amount of pyruvate in the sample wells. The rate of pyruvate yield was normalized by the amount of total proteins in the lysate or the amount of PK.</p>

<p>For cell-surface–marker analysis, the indicated cells were incubated with the primary anti-CDCP1-PE antibodies (#324006; Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA) and secondary fluorescent-conjugated antibodies. All cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Fluorescent intensities were point plotted on 2-axis graphs or histograms using Cell-Quest software (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Survival plot <italic>P</italic>-value was generated using a log-rank test. The effect of CDCP1 status at the time of primary surgical resection was assessed by multivariable survival analysis according to the Cox proportional hazards regression model, adjusting for potential confounding prognostic factors. For all other comparisons, a two-tailed unpaired <italic>t</italic> test was used. <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance throughout the study. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment except for immunohistochemical analyses. For each data set, the data meet the assumptions of the statistical test used, as determined by distribution and variance. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. The sample size for all experiments (in vitro and in vivo) was not chosen with consideration of adequate power to detect a prespecified effect size. For in vitro studies, all experiments were independently repeated three times in triplicate. All completed experiments are reported. No samples were fully processed for metabolomic, western blot, or immunohistochemical analysis and then excluded. For in vivo experiments, efforts were made to achieve the scientific goals of this study with the minimum number of animals. With respect to randomization, for animal experiments, tumor-bearing mice of similar tumor burden were equally divided into the control and experimental groups for subsequent drug treatment. No experimental samples were excluded throughout this study, with the exception that animals that experienced unexpected, acute illness and/or injury were removed per the veterinarian's order.</p>
