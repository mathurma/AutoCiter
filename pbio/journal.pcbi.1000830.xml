<p>The identification of proteasome-generated spliced peptides (PSP) revealed a new unpredicted activity of the major cellular protease. However, so far characterization of PSP was entirely dependent on the availability of patient-derived cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTL) thus preventing a systematic investigation of proteasome-catalyzed peptide splicing (PCPS). For an unrestricted PSP identification we here developed SpliceMet, combining the computer-based algorithm ProteaJ with <italic>in vitro</italic> proteasomal degradation assays and mass spectrometry. By applying SpliceMet for the analysis of proteasomal processing products of four different substrate polypeptides, derived from human tumor as well as viral antigens, we identified fifteen new spliced peptides generated by PCPS either by <italic>cis</italic> or from two separate substrate molecules, i.e., by <italic>trans</italic> splicing. Our data suggest that 20S proteasomes represent a molecular machine that, due to its catalytic and structural properties, facilitates the generation of spliced peptides, thereby providing a pool of qualitatively new peptides from which functionally relevant products may be selected.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>MHC class I molecules present antigenic peptides derived from endogenously expressed foreign or aberrant protein molecules to the outside world so that they can be specifically recognised by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) at the cell surface. Responsible for the generation of these peptides is the 20S proteasome, which is the major proteolytic enzyme of the cell. These peptides were so far believed to exhibit a linear sequence identical to that found in the unprocessed parental protein. Using patient derived CTL it was previously shown that by proteasome catalyzed peptide splicing, i.e., by fusion of two proteasome generated peptide fragments in a reversed proteolysis reaction, novel spliced antigenic peptides can be generated. To resolve the CTL dependence of spliced-peptide identification we here performed experiments, which combined mass spectrometric analysis of proteasome generated peptides with a computer based algorithm that predicts the masses of all theoretically possible spliced peptides from a given substrate molecule (SpliceMet). Using this unrestricted approach we here identified several new spliced peptides of which some were derived from two distinct substrate molecules. Our data reveal that peptide splicing is an intrinsic additional catalytic property of the proteasome, which may provide a qualitatively new peptide pool for immune selection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The multiple subunit 20S proteasome is the central catalytic unit of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and catalytic core of the 26S proteasome that is built by the association of the two 19S regulator complexes with the catalytic 20S core [19S-20S-19S]. With its N-terminal threonine residues as the single active site of the β-subunits β1, β2 and β5, the 20S proteasome is a N-terminal nucleophilic hydrolase responsible for the generation of the vast majority of virus- or tumor-derived peptides presented by MHC class I molecules at the cell surface for recognition by peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000830-Kloetzel1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000830-Groll1">[2]</xref>. This function is generally aided by the interferon-γ- (IFN-γ)-induced synthesis of the alternative catalytic subunits β1i, β2i, β5i, with concomitant formation of immunoproteasome subtypes possessing altered proteolytic properties as well as by the IFN-γ-induced up-regulation of the proteasome activator subunits PA28-α and PA28-β <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000830-Kloetzel2">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000830-Kloetzel3">[4]</xref>. Peptides generated by the 20S proteasome were so far thought to exhibit a linear sequence identical to that found in the unprocessed parental protein. This view was dramatically changed by the identification of three epitope peptides derived from the melanocyte protein gp100, the SP100 nuclear phosphoprotein and fibroblast growth factor (FGF-5), which represented fusions of proteasomal cleavage products and were shown to be generated by proteasomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000830-Hanada1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000830-Dalet1">[8]</xref>. Proteasome-catalyzed peptide splicing was proposed to be a transpeptidation reaction whereby the acylester intermediate is stabilized at the active site formed by the N-terminal threonine of the catalytic subunits for a time span that is sufficient to allow the N-termini of the released peptide fragments to make a nucleophilic attack on the ester bond of the acyl-enzyme intermediate thereby forming a new peptide bond and producing the spliced peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000830-Vigneron1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000830-Borissenko1">[9]</xref>. Under physiological conditions proteolysis is normally favoured over hydrolysis. Therefore the formation of new immunologically relevant MHC class I ligands by proteasome catalyzed peptide splicing (PCPS) was exciting and raised the possibility that reverse proteolysis may be functionally more frequent and important than previously thought. Nevertheless, as only three spliced epitope peptides had been reported in the literature since their initial discovery in 2004 it was assumed that PCPS might rather be a rare event. It was also emphasized, however, that presently available database search algorithms fail to detect peptide splicing products <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000830-Schaefer1">[10]</xref>. Moreover, the fact that identification of spliced peptides remained fortuitous due to the dependence on the accidental availability of patient derived CTLs so far prevented a systematic investigation of PSP.</p>
<p>It appears reasonable to assume that, similar to conventional proteasomal cleavage products, not every spliced peptide will fulfil the quality requirements of a MHC class I ligand. Thus, considering the generation of spliced antigenic peptides recognized by patient derived CTL, one might predict that the cellular proteasomal splicing reaction, as such, must be a considerably more frequent event than so far assumed. But even if peptide splicing is a rare event, PSP may still play a crucial role within the immune response. This is due to the sensitivity of CTL cells, which are able to detect very small numbers of MHC class I peptide complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000830-Cresswell1">[11]</xref>, and in the most extreme example even a single MHC class I complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000830-Sykulev1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>To allow a systematic, CTL-independent investigation of PSP we therefore developed SpliceMet: a method that combines combinatorial computations (ProteaJ) with mass spectrometric (MS) analyses of proteasome-generated peptides. Based on a given protein or peptide sequence, ProteaJ produces a data set with the <italic>m/z</italic> value of all theoretically possible PSP that may be generated by the proteasome through the combination of any two fragments (greater than one amino acid in length) generated from the same substrate molecule (in <italic>cis</italic>) or from separate substrate molecules (in <italic>trans</italic>) and ligated in a normal or reverse order. This is followed by MS analysis of <italic>in vitro</italic> digests of the synthetic peptide substrate and by comparison of the MS signals obtained with the theoretical ProteaJ-computed <italic>m/z</italic> values. By matching the theoretical values with the experimentally obtained <italic>m/z</italic> values and verifying the peptide generation kinetics, a restricted list of candidate PSP is generated. Their presence in 20S proteasome digests of substrates is then investigated by LC-ESI-MS/MS and LC-MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS/MS leading to the final identification of the PSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000830-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

<title>SpliceMet.</title>
<p>Applying the computer program ProteaJ on a peptide sequence of choice, <italic>m/z</italic> values of all theoretically possible proteasomal cleavage (PCP) and splicing (PSP) products are calculated (1<sup>st</sup> step). This is followed by an <italic>in vitro</italic> digest of the synthetic substrate and the comparison of the obtained MS signals with the theoretical <italic>m/z</italic> values (2nd). Matching of the signals and verification of peptide generation kinetics results in an inclusion list for LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis required for identification of the PSP (3rd, 4th). For final confirmation, the MS/MS spectra (5th) and the HPLC-RT of proposed PSP (6th) are compared with those of the analogous synthetic peptides. For the identification of those PSP candidates that do not fully satisfy these requisites, the generation of PSP is up-scaled followed by HPLC fractionation with an extended gradient and the fractions are analyzed by nano-LC-MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS (7th).</p>

<p>The SpliceMet method is organized into two main experimental blocks characterized by 7 main steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000830-g001">Figure 1</xref>). To reduce the number of possible proteasome generated spliced peptides (PSP) the first block utilizes the following 4 main steps that are subsequently investigated in the second block. The first experimental block combines the computational algorithm ProteaJ with proteasome <italic>in vitro</italic> digests of a synthetic peptide of choice and mass spectrometric (MS) analyses as follows:</p>

<title>Estimation of mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) of all possible PSP</title>
<p>To list all possible PSP, in which four indices <italic>ijkn</italic> define the sequence, we computed the molecular weight (Mr, calc.) of each peptide and the corresponding <italic>m/z</italic> values for charge states z = 1, 2, 3 (<italic>m/z</italic> =  (Mr+z)/z). Since the <italic>m/z</italic> values of PSP can differ by less than the mass accuracy of 0.5 Da for the used ESI-ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ-classic &amp; DECA XP instruments), we clustered all <italic>m/z</italic> values into groups with a <italic>m/z</italic> range of 0.2 Da (accordingly to the MS instrument resolution).

<title>3) Peak detection of all the computed m/z values</title>
<p>In the LC-ESI mass chromatogram we identified the significant peaks for each theoretical <italic>m/z</italic> value. For each theoretical <italic>m/z</italic> value either no peak or several peaks could be detected and defined by their <italic>m/z</italic> and retention time (RT).</p>

<title>4) Analysis of m/z time-dependent kinetics and establishment of an inclusion list for the LC-ESI/MS measurements</title>
<p>In time-dependent processing experiments (signal intensity versus time of digestion) identified peaks that did not fulfill the following criteria were eliminated from the candidate list: i. initial intensity (t = 0) smaller than MAX (<italic>e.g.</italic> here  = 10<sup>7</sup> for measurements by DECA XP MAX instrument); ii. monotonously ascending signal intensity towards a maximum followed by a monotonous decline in case assay condition allowed re-entry of the PSP. It was assumed that the monotonous increase resulted from the continuous production of PSP and the decrease from the “re-entry” event.</p>
<p>Next, we defined t<sub>max</sub> as the digestion time when the highest amount of generated PSP was observed and sorted all pairs (<italic>m/z</italic>, RT) with respect to t<sub>max</sub> into groups indexed as g of the size D<sub>g</sub>. If D<sub>g</sub>&gt;D<sub>max</sub> (here 15 depending on MS resolution) then the corresponding group was split into subgroups g<sub>i</sub> of size smaller than D<sub>max</sub>. The number of groups determined the number of additional up-scaled processing assays in which the absolute concentration of substrate and proteasome were increased keeping the relative substrate/proteasome ratio constant, whereas the total number of subgroups represented the number of requested new MS runs.

<p>All identified PSP resulting from step 5 were manually confirmed by comparison with synthetic peptides of the same sequence. The candidate PSP and their synthetic analogues had to exhibit a similar RT (delta RT &lt;0.5 min) and fragmentation pattern in the LC–ESI-MS/MS analysis.</p>

<title>7) Validation of PSP sequences by MALDI-TOF</title>
<p>In some experiments the requirements outlined in step 5 and 6 were not fully met requesting further MS identification. In this case, we proceeded by fractionating the digestion products by reverse phase (RP)-HPLC and by analyzing each fraction by LC-ESI-MS/MS using an inclusion list with the <italic>m/z</italic> values of the PSP candidates. Their RT in the HPLC run was also compared with that of the corresponding synthetic peptides. Those fractions with MS/MS and RT that matched the PSP were lyophilized and fractionated again using a more focused HPLC method to decrease the number of peptides in each fraction. The up-scaled fractions were subsequently compared with the RT of the synthetic PSP and analyzed by nano-LC-MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS/MS.</p>

<title>SpliceMet</title>
<p>The aim of our study was to develop a method for the identification of spliced peptides which would allow the identification of any theoretically possible PSP and which was independent of adventitiously available CD8+ T cells and T-cell recognition assays permitting the detection of only a single spliced epitope peptide. The availability of such a method would greatly facilitate systematic studies required to elucidate the molecular mechanism of PCPS. Therefore we have developed and applied a method – SpliceMet – that, by combining computational and experimental methods, facilitates the identification of proteasome-generated spliced peptides.</p>
<p>Although in this investigation we have considered only polypeptide substrates up to a length of 30 amino acid residues, SpliceMet could also be applied to longer peptides or proteins to further our understanding of the mechanisms that govern PCPS and, in particular, <italic>trans</italic>-splicing. It has to be pointed out however that an increase in substrate length will lead to an exponential expansion of the ProteaJ data base as well as the number of peaks detectable by MS and therefore will require the application of restricting parameters such as size or sequence quality to match this approach with the capacity of the presently available MS technologies.</p>
<p>In our experiments we observed a substantial number of peak spectra at the 5<sup>th</sup> step of SpliceMet, which could not be identified with sufficient confidence due to the low MS/MS quality. The number of unidentified spectra depends on the size of the ProteaJ database and to technical difficulties of MS analysis. Therefore, to reduce the number of unidentifiable spectra we incorporated the 7<sup>th</sup> step into our method. Indeed, up-scaling of the digestion products by two rounds of HPLC fractionation permitted a better separation of the digestion products thereby limiting the number of overlapping peptides with similar <italic>m/z</italic> and RT and increased product concentration in this manner facilitating the identification of PSP by MS. Furthermore, at step 7 we analyzed the sample with a second MS instrument, a MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer, which has a higher resolution and sensitivity than the used ESI-ion trap mass spectrometer. Its application in other studies allowed the identification of peptides not previously detected by ESI-MS/MS, not only because of the higher sensitivity but also due to the different method of ionization and detection, which led to the identification of a complementary pool of peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000830-Bodnar1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000830-Hofmann1">[16]</xref>. Accordingly, we used both techniques to identify as many PSP as possible. LC-ESI/MS analysis was primarily adopted because it is a less time consuming technique and allowed the analyses of as large a number of samples as needed at SpliceMet step 4. Likely, a further minimization of unidentified spectra could be obtained by exploiting the high performance of the new generations of MS analyzers.</p>
<p>The computational algorithm ProteaJ is based on a combinatorial approach. Therefore the amount of calculated PSP strongly depends on parameters like substrate length L and the minimal length of a PCP L<sub>ext</sub>, as well as the kind of PSP allowed, <italic>i.e. cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic> PSP. Thus ProteaJ parameter settings were used which in preliminary experiments seemed to be most reliable; for example, we limited the PCP L<sub>ext</sub> to a minimum of 2 and accordingly we identified PSP such as gp100<sub>47–48/35–39</sub> or gag-pol<sub>45–57/48–49</sub>. In contrast, when we considered PCP L<sub>ext</sub>  = 1 in a preliminary experiment on gp100<sub>35–57</sub> we were not able to identify any new PSP (data not shown).</p>

<title>SpliceMet applications and PSP implications</title>
<p>By applying SpliceMet we here showed that 20S proteasomes possess a substantial <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing activity. Since <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments for generation of spliced and non-spliced epitope peptides are known to closely resemble the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000830-Kloetzel2">[3]</xref> our data reveal that 20S proteasomes represent a molecular machine that facilitates the generation of spliced peptides from its own cleavage products. Therefore, our data may have considerable biological implications in that they provide evidence that proteasome-dependent protein degradation results in the generation of a second, so far undetected pool of spliced peptides, from which novel potentially functionally relevant peptides can be selected. Indeed, the two previously identified PSP were shown to be MHC class I epitopes recognized by CTL of human patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000830-Vigneron1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000830-Warren1">[7]</xref>. This and the relatively high number of PSP that we identified raises the possibility that peptide splicing in general may lead to an increase in the peptide pool available for epitope selection. For example, from the melanocytic gp100<sup>PMEL17</sup> tumor antigen (661 amino acids) 1,786,862 9mers with a unique sequence could be theoretically produced. Of these, a maximum of 652 are unspliced proteasomal cleavage products while the rest (99.96%) represent theoretical PSP. At the moment we do not have any sufficient information to judge on how many of these PSP (as well as normal PCP) are really produced and which percentage of them may efficiently bind MHC class I molecules. Based on our preliminary data we are tempted to speculate that specific PCP are generated more efficiently than PSP even if the MS signal of some PSP (<italic>e.g.</italic> gp100<sub>47–55/35–39</sub>) was as high as that of many PCP (data not shown). Nevertheless, if, for example PCP were produced 1000-fold more efficiently than any given PSP, spliced peptides generated from gp100<sup>PMEL17</sup> would still represent a significant peptide pool (<italic>i.e.</italic> the 73.26% of the 9mers derived from the digestion of gp100<sup>PMEL17</sup>) from which antigenic spliced peptides could be selected.</p>
<p>This basic computational analysis assumes that the splicing of proteasomal cleavage products can occur also <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our observation that the <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing reaction not only occurs in <italic>cis</italic> but also in <italic>trans</italic> indirectly supports such an assumption. The existence of the <italic>trans</italic> PSP implies the likely situation that two or more substrate molecules are present at the same time within the proteasomal cavity as suggested by some excellent previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000830-Hutschenreiter1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000830-Sharon1">[19]</xref> or that the cleavage products of a first substrate molecule remain within the catalytic chamber while a second molecule of substrate is cleaved. Very recently, Dalet and co-workers investigated <italic>trans</italic> proteasome splicing <italic>in vivo</italic>, providing some very interesting albeit not final insights. They showed that PSP<italic><sub>trans</sub></italic> were generated <italic>in vivo</italic> when the precursor peptides of FGF-5 and gp100 were electroporated into COS cells, whereas only the FGF-5-derived PSP<italic><sub>trans</sub></italic> (and in a very small amount) could be detected by CTL assay when COS cells were transfected with FGF-5 or gp100 plasmid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000830-Dalet1">[8]</xref>. Taking into account the high number of PSP<italic><sub>trans</sub></italic> we identified within <italic>in vitro</italic> digestion products of four peptides, we are led to conclude that further studies <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> on different cellular and proteasome models are required to clarify this phenomenon.</p>
<p>An extensive application of SpliceMet on a wide range of polypeptides substrates would also help to identify putative peptide sequence motifs that facilitate the proteasomal splicing reaction. For example, in seven of the nine gp100<sub>35–57</sub>-derived PSP, the sequence VSR represents the N-terminus of those PCP, which according to the transpeptidation model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000830-Vigneron1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000830-Berkers1">[20]</xref> perform a nucleophilic attack on the acyl-enzyme intermediate, thereby forming the detected PSP. Likewise, for four PSP the sequence YPEW represents the C-terminus, which forms the acyl-enzyme intermediate that is subsequently attacked by the second PCP generating the new PSP. From these observations one might infer a higher affinity of these two peptide sequences for a transpeptidation reaction. However, only a more extensive investigation of this specific issue with SpliceMet, covering a large number of different polypeptides would allow to validate such a hypothesis.</p>
<p>For this and other aims, studies performed with the help of SpliceMet could be powered if coupled with algorithms for the prediction of proteasomal cleavages, mathematical modeling of degradation kinetics as well as of the MHC class I antigen presentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000830-Kesmir1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000830-Salimi1">[26]</xref>. Such an approach would also facilitate the reduction of the theoretical PSP number, which might represent a limitation of SpliceMet application to very long proteins such as gp100<sup>PMEL17</sup>. By combining the SpliceMet results with the estimation of these and other algorithms it would be theoretically possible to restrict the PSP identification to a group of PSP possessing features of interest (<italic>e.g.</italic> epitope-specific for a defined HLA I haplotype) and to predict their altered expression upon proteasome modification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000830-Mishto3">[24]</xref>.</p>

<title>VI. Digestion product up-scaling by RP-HPLC</title>
<p>Further identification of the PSP at step 7 of SpliceMet was performed by MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS analysis of the gp100<sub>35–57</sub> digestion products separated by two distinct rounds of RP-HPLC. In the first round 57 fractions were collected, lyophilized and analyzed by LC-ESI/MS to identify PSP candidates. The fractions containing the PSP candidates were then separated with more focused gradients (different for each selected fraction of the first round of HPLC separation) on the same column obtaining 47 fractions, which were lyophilized and investigated by MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS analysis. Each round was obtained by collecting the eluted fractions of the 5-15 runs (5–20 µl each) to maintain a good separation of the digestion products on the chromatogram. The runs were carried out on the column C18 (33×4.6 mm; ODS1 1.5 µm) by the HPLC Beckman SytemGold and different gradients of acetonitrile.</p>
