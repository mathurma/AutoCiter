We wanted to assess the statistical information potential of different DNA ‘word-sizes’ and explore how oligonucleotide frequencies differ in coding and non-coding regions. In addition, we used oligonucleotide frequencies to investigate DNA composition and how DNA sequence patterns change within and between prokaryotic organisms. Among the results found was that prokaryotic chromosomes can be described by hexanucleotide frequencies, suggesting that prokaryotic DNA is predominantly short range correlated, i.e., information in prokaryotic genomes is encoded in short oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotide usage varied more within AT-rich and host-associated genomes than in GC-rich and free-living genomes, and this variation was mainly located in non-coding regions. Bias (selectional pressure) in tetranucleotide usage correlated with GC content, and coding regions were more biased than non-coding regions. Non-coding regions were also found to be approximately 5.5% more AT-rich than coding regions, on average, in the 402 chromosomes examined. Pronounced DNA compositional differences were found both within and between AT-rich and GC-rich genomes. GC-rich genomes were more similar and biased in terms of tetranucleotide usage in non-coding regions than AT-rich genomes. The differences found between AT-rich and GC-rich genomes may possibly be attributed to lifestyle, since tetranucleotide usage within host-associated bacteria was, on average, more dissimilar and less biased than free-living archaea and bacteria.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>There are potentially many factors responsible for how archaeal and bacterial genomes are composed. Recent advances in DNA sequencing have made it possible to use computational and statistical methods to examine the interplay between evolution and genomic composition. We wished to see whether particular properties could be extracted that would provide clues on how prokaryotic DNA is composed. For instance, we wondered whether or not protein coding regions carried a greater information potential than non-coding regions, if there is a link between genome size and GC content, whether GC content is different in coding and non-coding regions, and possible associations between DNA composition and environment. Our results indicated that genomic nucleotide frequencies are a determinant of many DNA compositional properties, but also that other influences are at work. For instance, bacteria are known to frequently exchange DNA with the environment and other organisms. Acquired DNA can therefore have different compositional properties than host DNA, and since pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance in bacteria is often associated with foreign DNA, advancing the knowledge of DNA composition is of great importance.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Part of this work was funded by the Danish Center for Scientific Computing, DU is funded by grants from the Danish Research Council, and JB is funded by the Norwegian School of Veterinary Science.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Prokaryotic DNA can be considered as a long chain of overlapping oligonucleotides, and frequencies of differently sized oligonucleotides can reveal different properties and patterns of bacterial and archaeal genomes.

The distributions of oligonucleotide frequencies can reveal other properties as well.

However, many archaeal and slow replicating bacterial genomes do not have pronounced GC skews (or AT skews) on leading and lagging strands, but replication start and stop positions can be detected with increased precision by examining oligonucleotide frequency skews with progressively larger oligonucleotide sizes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000057-Worning1">[13]</xref>.</p><p>In addition to the properties described above, transcription and regulation sites are also coded by certain oligonucleotide patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000057-Karlin1">[14]</xref>.

This motivated us to explore how oligonucleotide distributions change within and between prokaryotes in coding and non-coding regions, how biased oligonucleotide frequencies are, and whether any particular trends could be detected. In order to do this a series of statistical tests were performed on all sequenced bacterial and archaeal chromosomes (up to September 2006). We found that tetranucleotide frequencies carried considerable genomic information potential, and were therefore used in all statistical tests based on oligonucleotide usage. The statistical tests included oligonucleotide usage deviation from mean (OUD, a measure of oligonucleotide frequency variations in genomes), and oligonucleotide usage variance from expected (OUV, a measure of randomness or bias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000057-Reva1">[3]</xref>). These tests were used to examine how tetranucleotide frequencies fluctuated within chromosomes (OUD), and how tetranucleotide distributions differed from random tetranucleotide frequencies calculated by mean genomic nucleotide frequencies (OUV). OUV measures GC content both globally and locally in chromosomes with a 40 kbp non-overlapping sliding window and was used to calculate expected tetranucleotide frequencies as well as GC content in coding and non-coding sequences for each chromosome tested. These tests were performed for all sequenced 402 prokaryotic chromosomes at the time, and their corresponding open reading frames. The first test, however, was concerned with statistical information potential in different oligonucleotide sizes using a different approach than <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000057-Reva1">[3]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Information Potential in Oligonucleotides</title><p>We measured the statistical information carried by the differently sized oligonucleotides from di- to octanucleotides in prokaryotes with GC contents between 47% and 53%.

It should also be added that no correlation was found between OUV values and genome size, thereby removing any link between random genome composition and genome size.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Summary</title><p>Considering prokaryotic genomes from an oligonucleotide perspective, there seemed to be little increase in information potential in oligonucleotide sizes larger than hexanucleotides.</p><p>Comparing observed to expected tetranucleotide usage (OUV), we found that coding regions are, in general, more biased than non-coding regions, and more homogeneous according to the OUD test. GC rich genomes were also found to have more biased tetranucleotide frequencies than AT rich genomes. Although AT content increased in non-coding regions in both AT rich and GC rich genomes, it did not appear to be a consequence of tetranucleotide preference. OUD was found to decrease with increasing mean genomic GC content, indicating that GC rich genomes have a more homogeneous DNA composition, especially in non-coding regions. This result was additionally supported by a ratio test based on observed and expected OUD scores indicating that coding regions varied similarly for AT and GC rich genomes alike, while non-coding regions varied more within AT rich genomes. No correlation was found between OUV and OUD scores, implying that bias in tetranucleotide usage is not connected to intra-chromosomal homogeneity in prokaryotes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>All sequenced archaea and bacteria available up to September 2006, (402 chromosomes and corresponding open reading frames, from 366 genomes in total) were downloaded from NCBI Genbank <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000057-National1">[19]</xref>.

Genomes with AT content in that range were chosen due to the increased sensitivity of the Pearson correlation method for chromosomes with similar AT/GC content. By leaving one nucleotide “free” the cumulative information in the different oligonucleotide sizes, i.e. combined information of all smaller oligonucleotides, could be measured.</p><p>GC-content in non-coding regions was calculated by finding GC-content in open reading frames and whole chromosomes with the following formula:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000057.e010" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>c</italic> = coding fraction measured by the sum of open reading frame sizes divided by corresponding chromosome size.

Since Formula 5 bases calculations of the expected value only on genomic nucleotide frequencies it can be considered as a measure of how “random” the genomic composition of the organism is. Low OUV scores can therefore be interpreted to mean that a high degree of non-directed mutations has taken place within the genome, or, alternatively, that the individual nucleotides in each tetranucleotide are more ‘loosely’ tied to each other. High OUV scores may also be taken to mean that a larger degree of bias, or order, is present in the genomic oligonucleotide usage. An additional point of view is that OUV is a measure of information potential, where low OUV values mean that the DNA sequence in question has lower statistical potential of carrying information (and vice versa).</p><p>OUV was calculated for both whole chromosomes and coding regions. Regression analysis was then carried out between OUV values (response), both coding and whole chromosomes, and global GC content (predictor). The resulting regression equations, with corresponding coefficient of determination, here denoted by <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic>, can be found in the Results/Discussion section together with the corresponding <italic>P</italic> values.</p><p>The OUD test gives an average estimate of how oligonucleotide frequencies vary within prokaryotic chromosomes. Variance is calculated between the oligonucleotide frequencies calculated from a 40 kbp non-overlapping sliding window and mean genomic oligonucleotide frequencies with the following formula:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000057.e013" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(6)</label></disp-formula>Summations are taken over all possible oligonucleotide combinations <italic>1</italic>≤<italic>i</italic>≤<italic>N</italic>, and all non-overlapping sliding windows <italic>1</italic>≤<italic>j</italic>≤<italic>M</italic> in DNA sequence <italic>x</italic>. <italic>z<sup>j</sup><sub>i</sub></italic> = <italic>F<sup>i</sup><sub>zj</sub></italic>(<italic>w<sub>1</sub>w<sub>2</sub>…w<sub>n</sub></italic>) represents the <italic>n</italic>-word frequencies for sliding window <italic>j</italic>, while μ<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> = <italic>F<sub>x</sub></italic>(<italic>w<sub>1</sub>…w<sub>n</sub></italic>) is the mean frequency of word <italic>w<sub>1</sub>…w<sub>n</sub></italic> in DNA sequence <italic>x</italic>.</p><p>Regression analysis was performed for both whole chromosomes and coding regions with OUD as response and global GC content as predictor. The resulting regression equations with corresponding coefficient of determination, <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic>, and <italic>P</italic>-values can be found in the Results/Discussion section.</p><p>The ratio of observed divided by expected OUD values was additionally used to test whether any fluctuations in tetranucleotide frequencies could be detected in coding and non-coding regions. To calculate this, the OUD values obtained for each chromosome with Formula 6 was divided by the following equation:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000057.e014" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(7)</label></disp-formula>which resulted in the formula:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000057.e015" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(8)</label></disp-formula>In this case, the variance was calculated, for each chromosome, between expected oligonucleotide frequencies from a 40 kbp sliding window and expected oligonucleotide frequencies based on Formula 5.</p><p>Variation of nucleotide frequencies within genomes was calculated for each chromosome similarly to the OUD test, but expected oligonucleotide frequencies based on Formula 5 were used instead of observed. This is the same as calculating the variance between local and global GC content (i.e. GC content) and Formula 7 was used for this as well.</p><p>Regression analysis was performed on values obtained with Formula 7 and global GC content for both coding and whole chromosomes.
