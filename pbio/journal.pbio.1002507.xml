<abstract>
<p>Mitochondria must buffer the risk of proteotoxic stress to preserve bioenergetics, but the role of these mechanisms in disease is poorly understood. Using a proteomics screen, we now show that the mitochondrial unfoldase-peptidase complex ClpXP associates with the oncoprotein survivin and the respiratory chain Complex II subunit succinate dehydrogenase B (SDHB) in mitochondria of tumor cells. Knockdown of ClpXP subunits ClpP or ClpX induces the accumulation of misfolded SDHB, impairing oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production while activating “stress” signals of 5′ adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and autophagy. Deregulated mitochondrial respiration induced by ClpXP targeting causes oxidative stress, which in turn reduces tumor cell proliferation, suppresses cell motility, and abolishes metastatic dissemination in vivo. ClpP is universally overexpressed in primary and metastatic human cancer, correlating with shortened patient survival. Therefore, tumors exploit ClpXP-directed proteostasis to maintain mitochondrial bioenergetics, buffer oxidative stress, and enable metastatic competence. This pathway may provide a “drugable” therapeutic target in cancer.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>As the powerhouse of the cell and a pivotal hub for oxidative stress, mitochondria must tightly control the state of the proteins that they contain, quickly eliminating misfolded, aggregated, or otherwise damaged proteins. Here, we show that tumor mitochondria manage their set of proteins by assembling an integrated network of protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, that controls both the folding and degradation of proteins. This protein complex is formed by the unfoldase-peptidase ClpXP, survivin, and the Hsp90-like chaperone TRAP-1, and regulates the function of the oxidative phosphorylation Complex II subunit succinate dehydrogenase B (SDHB). We find that interference with this process impairs energy production, promotes oxidative stress, and shuts down critical downstream signals important for tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and metastatic dissemination in vivo. Our results suggest that the mitochondrial proteostasis network may offer therapeutic opportunities in advanced disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The control of protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, occupies a central, evolutionary-conserved role in organismal integrity and flexible adaptation to environmental “stress” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref001">1</xref>]. This pathway involves mechanisms of chaperone-directed protein (re)folding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref002">2</xref>] as well as removal of aggregated or misfolded proteins via proteolytic degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref003">3</xref>]. Defects in either process impair organelle function, in particular the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref004">4</xref>] and mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref005">5</xref>], activating an unfolded protein response (UPR) that may culminate in cell death and tissue damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>There is also evidence that a heightened proteostatic threshold can contribute to disease, in particular cancer, by buffering the risk of proteotoxic stress associated with the biosynthetic needs of transformed cells. Accordingly, molecular chaperones of the heat shock protein-90 (Hsp90) family, including Hsp90 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref007">7</xref>] and its homolog, TNFR-associated molecule-1 (TRAP-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref008">8</xref>], become overexpressed in mitochondria of tumor cells compared to normal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref009">9</xref>] and preserve the folding and activity of key effectors of organelle homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref010">10</xref>]. In turn, the heightened proteostatic environment prevents the emergence of a mitochondrial UPR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref011">11</xref>], antagonizes cyclophilin D-dependent apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref009">9</xref>], and maintains bioenergetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref010">10</xref>], including oxidative phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref012">12</xref>], correlating with unfavorable disease outcome in cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>What has remained unclear, however, is whether chaperone-directed protein folding is the sole mechanism of mitochondrial proteostasis in cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref010">10</xref>]. In this context, mitochondria contain an evolutionary-conserved, ATP-dependent unfoldase-peptidase protein complex, ClpXP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref014">14</xref>], which mediates proteolytic removal of misfolded proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref015">15</xref>]. There is evidence that this pathway may regulate a mitochondrial UPR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref017">17</xref>] and contribute to human disease pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated mechanisms of mitochondrial proteostasis as a potential driver of tumor progression.</p>

<title>Identification of ClpXP as a Novel Survivin-Associated Molecule</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that a pool of the inhibitor-of-apoptosis (IAP) protein survivin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref019">19</xref>] localizes to mitochondria and contributes to the stability of oxidative phosphorylation Complex II subunit succinate dehydrogenase B (SDHB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref020">20</xref>]. To further characterize this pathway, we carried out a proteomics screen for additional survivin-associated molecules in mitochondria, using prostate adenocarcinoma PC3 cells as a tumor model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s021">S1 Methods</xref>). In this screen, molecules associated with mitochondrial survivin comprised regulators of organelle trafficking (Rab11), assembly of respiratory chain complexes (PTCD1), oxidative stress (GPX4), mitoribosomal transferase activity (NSUN4), ubiquinone biosynthesis (COQ7), and the AAA+ peptidase subunit of the ClpXP complex, ClpP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>Consistent with these results, survivin immune complexes precipitated from mitochondria of PC3 cells contained ClpP as well as TRAP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref020">20</xref>]. Reciprocally, ClpP co-immunoprecipitated with survivin and TRAP-1 in tumor mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). In addition, ClpX and ClpP mutually associated with each other as well as with SDHB in co-immunoprecipitation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), consistent with the assembly of a survivin-ClpXP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref014">14</xref>]-SDHB complex in tumor mitochondria. When analyzed for submitochondrial distribution, survivin, ClpP, and TRAP-1 co-localized within the organelle matrix in PC3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). In addition, a fraction of TRAP-1 and survivin localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g001">Fig 1E</xref>), in agreement with recent observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>To begin investigating the role of a survivin-ClpXP complex in mitochondria, we next exposed PC3 cells to YM155, a small molecule survivin suppressant currently examined in the clinic as an anticancer drug. In these experiments, YM155 treatment was associated with reduced expression of ClpP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). As an independent approach, we next silenced survivin using our validated small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref020">20</xref>]. Survivin knockdown significantly reduced the levels of ClpP in mitochondria of PC3 cells, especially under conditions of hypoxic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). In contrast, YM155 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g001">Fig 1F</xref>) or siRNA silencing of survivin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g001">Fig 1G</xref>) did not affect the expression of mitochondrial chaperones Hsp70 or Hsp60, or the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC). Next, we used cycloheximide block experiments to quantify changes in ClpXP stability after survivin targeting. In these experiments, YM155 treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s014">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>) or siRNA silencing of survivin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s014">S1C and S1D Fig</xref>) resulted in accelerated turnover of ClpP, compared to control siRNA transfectants. This regulation occurred at the protein level because survivin knockdown did not affect ClpP mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s014">S1E Fig</xref>). In reciprocal experiments, transfection of PC3 cells with a survivin variant engineered to selectively accumulate in mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref020">20</xref>] increased ClpP levels in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g001">Fig 1H</xref>). In contrast, targeting survivin with YM155 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g001">Fig 1F</xref>) or siRNA knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s014">S1C and S1D Fig</xref>) or, conversely, over-expression of mitochondrial survivin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g001">Fig 1H</xref>) did not appreciably affect ClpX levels. This suggests that ClpP is the primary binding partner of survivin in the ClpXP complex, consistent with the results of the proteomics screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).</p>

<title>ClpXP Regulation of Mitochondrial Complex II Folding and Activity</title>
<p>In mitochondria, survivin associates with the oxidative phosphorylation Complex II subunit, SDHB, and regulates its stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref020">20</xref>]. Therefore, a role of ClpXP in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref015">15</xref>] was next investigated. First, siRNA silencing of ClpP resulted in increased accumulation of SDHB in mitochondria, whereas COX-IV levels were not affected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s015">S2A Fig</xref>). We next looked at the folding status of SDHB in these conditions. We found that siRNA silencing of ClpP caused the accumulation of detergent-insoluble, i.e., misfolded, mitochondrial Complex II, whereas subunits of oxidative phosphorylation Complex I, III, IV, or V were not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). When individual Complex II subunits were examined, ClpP knockdown selectively induced misfolding and aggregation of SDHB at different detergent concentrations (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g002">2B, 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s015">S2B</xref>). In contrast, ClpP depletion did not affect the solubility of SDHA or other mitochondrial proteins, including COX-IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>), VDAC, or citrate synthase (CS; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s015">S2B Fig</xref>), compared to control transfectants. Aggregation and misfolding of SDHB, but not SDHA, after ClpP knockdown was observed under different detergent conditions (NP-40; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s015">S2C and S2D Fig</xref>). In addition, siRNA silencing of ClpX similarly induced accumulation of aggregated or misfolded SDHB (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g002">2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s015">S2E</xref>).</p>

<title>ClpXP Is Required for Mitochondrial Respiration</title>
<p>Next, we asked whether SDHB misfolding induced by ClpXP targeting affected mitochondrial respiration. siRNA silencing of ClpX or ClpP did not affect mitochondrial Complex I activity in PC3 cells, compared to control siRNA transfectants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). In contrast, knockdown of ClpX or ClpP significantly reduced Complex II activity in PC3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) as well as other prostate cancer cell types, including C4-2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s016">S3A Fig</xref>) and DU145 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s016">S3B Fig</xref>). This response was specific because ClpX or ClpP targeting had no effect on mitochondrial Complex III (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s016">S3C Fig</xref>) or Complex IV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s016">S3D Fig</xref>) activity, whereas Complex V function was increased in ClpP- but not ClpX-silenced PC3 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s016">S3E Fig</xref>). Functionally, impaired Complex II activity after ClpXP targeting reduced oxygen consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), increased the NAD/NADH ratio (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g003">3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s016">S3F</xref>), and lowered overall ATP production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g003">Fig 3E</xref>) in prostate cancer cells. Markers suggestive of compensatory glycolysis, including glucose consumption (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s016">S3G Fig</xref>) or lactate production (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s016">S3H Fig</xref>), were increased after ClpP- but not ClpX-silencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s016">S3G and S3H Fig</xref>). Consistent with defective bioenergetics, PC3 cells silenced for ClpP or ClpX exhibited increased phosphorylation of the energy sensor 5′ adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), whereas total AMPK levels were not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). In turn, AMPK phosphorylation coupled to downstream activation of autophagy, as determined by increased LC3-II conversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g003">Fig 3G</xref>), appearance of punctate LC3 staining by fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g003">Fig 3H and 3I</xref>), accumulation of autophagy markers p62 and Beclin-1, and increased phosphorylation of ULK1 on its AMPK target site, Ser555 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g003">Fig 3J</xref>).</p>

<title>Targeting Mitochondrial Proteases Induces Oxidative Stress</title>
<p>Based on these data, we next looked at the downstream consequences of defective mitochondrial respiration in ClpXP-targeted cells. siRNA silencing of ClpP or ClpX resulted in increased total cellular superoxide production in prostate cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g004">Fig 4A–4C</xref>). This response was also associated with heightened production of mitochondria-specific reactive oxygen species (ROS), compared to control transfectants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). To rule out potential off-target effects, we next generated clones of PC3 and DU145 cells with stable shRNA knockdown of ClpP or ClpX (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s017">S4A Fig</xref>). Stable depletion of ClpXP did not affect total mitochondrial content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s017">S4B Fig</xref>) or mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s017">S4C Fig</xref>). In contrast, stable knockdown of ClpP increased mitochondrial ROS production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g004">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>), with hyperoxidation of mitochondrial peroxiredoxin III (Prx III), a marker of oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g004">Fig 4G</xref>). Total Prx III levels were not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g004">Fig 4G</xref>). In contrast, stable shRNA silencing of ClpX did not significantly modulate mitochondrial ROS production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g004">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>) or Prx III hyperoxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g004">Fig 4G</xref>), suggesting that other mechanisms compensated for ClpX loss in the stable cell line. Treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or mitochondrial ROS scavenger MitoTempo alone did not rescue Prx III hyperoxidation after ClpXP knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s017">S4D Fig</xref>). Conversely, the combination of NAC plus MitoTempo reversed the hyperoxidation of Prx III in these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s017">S4D Fig</xref>). Functionally, we next asked if oxidative stress induced by ClpXP targeting was important for autophagy induction in these settings. Consistent with this possibility, the combination of NAC plus MitoTempo significantly attenuated LC3-II conversion in ClpP- or ClpX-silenced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g004">Fig 4H and 4I</xref>), and this response was amplified by the autophagic flux inhibitor hydroxychloroquine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g004">Fig 4H</xref>).</p>

<title>ClpXP Overexpression in Human Cancer</title>
<p>To complement the results obtained with tumor cell lines, we next looked at a potential differential expression of ClpXP in human cancer. First, ClpP was prominently upregulated in breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells, compared to non-tumorigenic breast epithelial MCF-10A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Similarly, ClpP was highly expressed in primary tissue samples of human prostatic adenocarcinoma, but not normal prostate epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). For comparison, another protease involved in mitochondrial protein quality control, LonP1, was expressed in normal prostate but not prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). When applied to tissue extracts of patient-derived tumor samples, an antibody to ClpP reacted with a predominant single band by western blotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s018">S5A Fig</xref>), reinforcing its specificity. Immunohistochemical staining of a universal cancer tissue microarray demonstrated that ClpP was overexpressed in virtually every human malignancy examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g005">Fig 5C</xref>), with intense cytoplasmic staining in the tumor cell population (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g005">5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s018">S5B</xref>). ClpP expression in cancer patients was independent of grade (colon adenocarcinoma and CNS tumors), Gleason score (prostate adenocarcinoma), histotype (lung cancer), or aggressive versus indolent lymphomas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s018">S5C Fig</xref>). Conversely, ClpP levels were increased in histotypes of breast adenocarcinoma compared to normal epithelium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s018">S5C Fig</xref>). In addition, ClpP became more prominently expressed in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), compared to non-metastatic lesions, with the highest levels in brain-metastatic NSCLC (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g005">5E, 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s018">S5D</xref>). In contrast, no difference in the percentage of ClpP-positive cells was observed in primary or metastatic NSCLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g005">Fig 5G</xref>). Consistent with these results, bioinformatics meta-analysis of public databases (PrognoScan) revealed that ClpP expression correlated with poorer outcome in 9 out of 14 analyzed datasets (64%; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s023">S2 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g005">Fig 5H–5J</xref>), whereas ClpP levels were associated with better prognosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s023">S2 Table</xref>) in only one dataset (Melbourne).

<title>Regulation of Tumor Cell Proliferation by ClpXP</title>
<p>Based on these results, we next asked how ClpXP influenced tumor progression. In a first series of experiments, knockdown of ClpP or ClpX partially reduced tumor cell proliferation (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g006">6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s019">S6A</xref>) and inhibited colony formation (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g006">6B, 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s019">S6B</xref>), a marker of tumorigenicity.

In addition, ClpP or ClpXP knockdown did not reduce Complex II activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s019">S6G Fig</xref>) or OCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s019">S6H Fig</xref>) in non-tumorigenic MCF-10A cells, further linking impaired mitochondrial respiration induced by ClpXP targeting to reduced tumor cell proliferation. Based on these results, we next asked if aberrant ROS production associated with ClpXP targeting interfered with tumor cell proliferation. Consistent with this possibility, the combination of antioxidants NAC plus MitoTempo (MT) restored tumor cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g006">Fig 6E</xref>) and colony formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g006">Fig 6F</xref>) in ClpP-silenced PC3 cells. Similarly, transfection of the ROS scavenger MnSOD rescued the defect of cell proliferation induced by ClpP knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g006">Fig 6G</xref>). Finally, ClpXP depletion further sensitized tumor cells to “stress stimuli,” with more sustained inhibition of tumor cell proliferation mediated by oxidative stress (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g006">Fig 6H</xref>), high galactose:glucose ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g006">Fig 6I</xref>), or amino acid deprivation (50% amino acids, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g006">Fig 6J</xref>). We next reconstituted ClpP-silenced PC3 cells with siRNA-insensitive ClpP cDNA to test the specificity of these findings. Re-expression of ClpP under these conditions rescued the phosphorylation of Akt, Src, and p70S6K in ClpP-silenced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g006">Fig 6K</xref>). In addition, re-expression of ClpP reversed the induction of autophagy (S555 phosphorylation of ULK1), AMPK signaling (ACC phosphorylation), and oxidative stress (Prx III hyperoxidation) induced by ClpP silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g006">Fig 6K</xref>).</p>

<title>ClpXP Regulation of Tumor Cell Invasion and Metastasis</title>
<p>A potential participation of ClpXP in other tumor traits was investigated next, and we focused on cell motility, which requires mitochondrial bioenergetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref020">20</xref>]. siRNA knockdown of ClpP or ClpX inhibited directional PC3 cell migration in a wound closure assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>), and suppressed tumor cell invasion across Matrigel-coated Transwell inserts (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g007">7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s020">S7A</xref>).

<p>Next, we mapped the signaling requirements of ClpXP regulation of tumor cell motility. In these experiments, siRNA silencing of ClpP attenuated Akt (S473) phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s020">S7B Fig</xref>) and lowered the expression of cell motility effectors Caveolin-1 (Cav1) and Axl (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s020">S7B Fig</xref>). ClpXP knockdown was marginally effective (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s020">S7B Fig</xref>), and no changes in Cav1 mRNA levels were observed in control or ClpP siRNA transfectants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g007">Fig 7F</xref>). Exposure of tumor cells to the oxidative stressor H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> mimicked this response, causing hyperoxidation of Prx III and loss of Cav1 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s020">S7C Fig</xref>). Accordingly, siRNA silencing of Cav1 in PC3 cells was sufficient to reduce the levels of phosphorylated Akt (S473) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s020">S7D Fig</xref>) and suppressed tumor cell migration and invasion, compared to control transfectants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s020">S7E Fig</xref>). To validate a role of Cav1 in this cell motility pathway, we next reconstituted ClpP- or ClpX-depleted cells with a Cav1 cDNA. Re-expression of Cav1 in these settings restored Akt phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g007">Fig 7G</xref>) and rescued the defect of tumor cell invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g007">Fig 7H</xref>) after ClpP, but not ClpX knockdown. In contrast, reconstitution of ClpXP-targeted cells with an Akt cDNA had no effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002507.s020">S7F Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we asked if ClpXP regulation of tumor cell motility was important for metastasis in vivo. Intra-splenic injection of PC3 cells transfected with control shRNA gave rise to extensive metastatic dissemination to the liver of immunocompromised mice within 11 d of injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g007">Fig 7I and 7J</xref>). In contrast, stable silencing of ClpX or ClpP in these cells suppressed the size, number, and extent of liver metastases at the same time interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002507.g007">Fig 7I and 7J</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have shown that the unfoldase-peptidase ClpXP forms a complex with survivin and the Hsp90-like chaperone TRAP-1 in mitochondria of tumor cells. This interaction maintains protein quality control and function of the oxidative phosphorylation Complex II subunit SDHB. Accordingly, genetic targeting of ClpXP causes the accumulation of misfolded SDHB, resulting in impaired bioenergetics, oxidative damage, and activation of stress signals, including autophagy. ClpXP is dramatically upregulated in primary and disseminated human tumors, correlates with shortened patient survival, and mechanistically supports tumor cell proliferation, cell motility, and heightened metastatic competence in vivo.</p>
<p>Extensively studied in bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref021">21</xref>] and proposed as a regulator of cell persistence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref022">22</xref>], the ClpXP multimolecular complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref023">23</xref>] comprises a ClpX subunit that functions as an ATPase-directed unfoldase for unstructured protein substrates and an internal caseinolytic peptidase, ClpP, which degrades the translocated, unfolded peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref014">14</xref>]. Although this proteasome-like arrangement is conserved in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref015">15</xref>], the data presented here suggest that the ClpP and ClpX subunits may not have completely overlapping function(s) in tumor mitochondria, especially with respect to Akt activation and Cav1-dependent tumor cell motility. It is possible that these different responses reflect individual mitochondrial proteins independently regulated by ClpP or ClpX, or, alternatively, the coupling of individual ClpXP subunits to separate regulators of downstream signaling.</p>
<p>The interaction between TRAP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref010">10</xref>] and ClpXP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref014">14</xref>] described here brings together the two main mechanisms of proteostasis: chaperone-regulated protein folding (TRAP-1) and proteolytic removal of misfolded molecules (ClpXP) in a single, functional continuum. A mitochondrial pool of survivin contributes to this proteostasis network, potentially as a scaffolding protein that binds both ClpP (this study) and TRAP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref020">20</xref>], and contributes to the stability of the complex. Consistent with the earlier elucidation of a TRAP-1 proteome in tumor mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref010">10</xref>], a key substrate of the proteostasis network identified here was the iron-sulfur SDHB subunit of oxidative phosphorylation Complex II. The biochemical requirements of mitochondrial respiration and electron transport chain are well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref024">24</xref>], but the possibility that these activities may depend on a carefully orchestrated balance of protein folding/protein clearance, especially in the proteotoxic-prone environment of tumor mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref005">5</xref>], has not been widely considered. Consistent with this possibility, perturbation of the mitochondrial proteostasis network by TRAP-1 targeting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref010">10</xref>] or ClpXP knockdown (this study) caused SDHB degradation or, conversely, accumulation of misfolded or aggregated SDHB. The exquisite specificity of this response, in which none of the other oxidative phosphorylation complexes are affected, highlights a potential unique propensity of SDHB to protein misfolding, especially in tumor mitochondria, or, alternatively, a more stringent requirement of protein quality control to enable efficient Complex II activity.</p>
<p>Irrespective, the loss of SDHB due to defective proteostasis profoundly affected mitochondrial bioenergetics, with decreased oxygen consumption, loss of ATP production, and a phenotype of cellular “stress,” characterized by activation of a mitochondrial and ER UPR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref011">11</xref>], AMPK phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref025">25</xref>], stimulation of autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref012">12</xref>], and loss of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref020">20</xref>]. As shown here, an important mediator of these responses was the increased production of mitochondrial ROS and the ensuing oxidative damage likely associated with a defective electron transport chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref024">24</xref>]. This model is consistent with other data in the literature that homozygous deletion of TRAP-1 caused increased ROS production, DNA damage, and reduced cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref026">26</xref>], whereas TRAP-1 overexpression is protective against oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref028">28</xref>]. Here, antioxidants that include a mitochondrial ROS scavenger, MitoTempo, prevented the activation of autophagy and rescued the defects of cell proliferation and tumor cell invasion associated with ClpXP targeting, establishing a causal role of mitochondrial oxidative stress in these tumor traits.</p>
<p>Although a role of TRAP-1 in tumor progression is recognized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref029">29</xref>], the possibility that ClpXP-directed proteostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref014">14</xref>] may be also exploited in cancer has been proposed only recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref030">30</xref>]. In that study, the ClpXP subunit ClpP was found overexpressed in a subset of human acute myeloid leukemias, and pharmacologic or genetic targeting of ClpP impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in leukemia cell killing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref030">30</xref>]. The data presented here extend these observations and demonstrate that ClpXP-directed proteostasis is exploited in most human cancers, correlating with shortened patient survival. Where the two studies diverge, however, is in the mechanistic underpinning of the proposed pathway. Here, ClpXP was recognized as a pivotal component of a proteostasis network that, together with TRAP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref010">10</xref>] and survivin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref020">20</xref>], ensures mitochondrial homeostasis in tumors. In our hands, and at variance with recent findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref030">30</xref>], targeting ClpXP only partially reduced tumor cell proliferation and in a cell-type-specific manner, with no measurable effect on tumor cell viability. Instead, we found that ClpXP was required to support directional tumor cell migration, invasion, and heightened metastatic dissemination in vivo. Mechanistically, this pathway involved increased phosphorylation of key cell motility kinases Akt and Src, and reconstitution experiments in ClpP-silenced cells identified the membrane microdomain adapter caveolin-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref031">31</xref>] as a novel, oxidative, stress-regulated mediator of tumor cell motility.</p>
<p>As most epithelial tumors rewire their metabolism toward glycolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref032">32</xref>], a role of mitochondrial bioenergetics in cancer has been controversial, and SDHB itself has been at times dubbed as a “tumor suppressor.” On the other hand, oxidative phosphorylation remains an important energy source in most cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref033">33</xref>], fueling critical disease traits such as tumor repopulation after oncogene ablation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref034">34</xref>] and drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref035">35</xref>]. The data presented here reinforce this model and establish a key requirement of mitochondrial integrity for tumor cell motility and metastatic competence in vivo. This conclusion fits well with other evidence that oxidative phosphorylation is required for membrane lamellipodia dynamics, turnover of focal adhesion complexes, and phosphorylation of cell motility kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref036">36</xref>], supporting tumor cell invasion and metastatic dissemination, in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref037">37</xref>]. In the context of a proteostasis network, ClpXP may contribute to this response by efficiently removing misfolded or aggregated SDHB molecules to preserve Complex II bioenergetics as well as buffering organelle oxidative stress.</p>
<p>In summary, we have shown that the unfoldase-peptidase complex ClpXP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref014">14</xref>] is universally exploited in human cancer and contributes to a mitochondrial proteostasis network that controls metabolic reprogramming and downstream signals of tumor cell proliferation, motility, and metastatic competence in vivo. There is now considerable interest in targeting unique features of tumor metabolism, including mitochondrial functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref038">38</xref>], as a novel approach to cancer therapy. In this context, proof-of-concept studies have demonstrated that small molecule targeting of mitochondrial Hsp90s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref025">25</xref>] or ClpXP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002507.ref030">30</xref>] is feasible and produces potent anticancer activity in preclinical models. Together, this suggests that therapeutic inhibition of the mitochondrial proteostasis network described here may provide a viable strategy to disrupt key requirements of tumor progression.</p>
