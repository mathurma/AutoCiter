<p>The evolutionarily conserved protein coronin 1 is needed for activating the cyclic AMP signaling pathway in the brain and is important for cognition and behavior.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Cognitive and behavioral disorders are thought to be a result of neuronal dysfunction, but the underlying molecular defects remain largely unknown. An important signaling pathway involved in the regulation of neuronal function is the cyclic AMP/Protein kinase A pathway. We here show an essential role for coronin 1, which is encoded in a genomic region associated with neurobehavioral dysfunction, in the modulation of cyclic AMP/PKA signaling. We found that coronin 1 is specifically expressed in excitatory but not inhibitory neurons and that coronin 1 deficiency results in loss of excitatory synapses and severe neurobehavioral disabilities, including reduced anxiety, social deficits, increased aggression, and learning defects. Electrophysiological analysis of excitatory synaptic transmission in amygdala revealed that coronin 1 was essential for cyclic–AMP–protein kinase A–dependent presynaptic plasticity. We further show that upon cell surface stimulation, coronin 1 interacted with the G protein subtype Gαs to stimulate the cAMP/PKA pathway. The absence of coronin 1 or expression of coronin 1 mutants unable to interact with Gαs resulted in a marked reduction in cAMP signaling. Strikingly, synaptic plasticity and behavioral defects of coronin 1–deficient mice were restored by <italic>in vivo</italic> infusion of a membrane-permeable cAMP analogue. Together these results identify coronin 1 as being important for cognition and behavior through its activity in promoting cAMP/PKA-dependent synaptic plasticity and may open novel avenues for the dissection of signal transduction pathways involved in neurobehavioral processes.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Memory and behavior depend on the proper transduction of signals in the brain, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Coronin 1 is a member of a highly conserved family of proteins, and although its gene lies in a chromosome region associated with neurobehavioral dysfunction in mice and men, it has never been directly ascribed a specific function in the brain. Here we show that coronin 1 plays an important role in cognition and behavior by regulating the cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling pathway. We find that when cell surface receptors are activated, coronin 1 stimulates cAMP production and activation of protein kinase A. Coronin 1 deficiency resulted in severe functional defects at excitatory synapses. Furthermore, in both mice and humans, deletion or mutation of coronin 1 causes severe neurobehavioral defects, including social deficits, increased aggression, and learning disabilities. Strikingly, treatment with a membrane-permeable analogue of cAMP restored synaptic plasticity and behavioral defects in mice lacking coronin 1. Together this work not only shows a critical role for coronin 1 in neurobehavior but also defines a role for the coronin family in regulating the transmission of signals within cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Behavioral and cognitive deficits comprise a heterogeneous collection of pathologies. Copy number variants and several single gene alterations predisposing to neurobehavioral and cognitive diseases have been identified and are believed to act either independently or in a combinatorial fashion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Abrahams1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-McCarthy1">[2]</xref>. The molecular functions of the candidate genes that are associated with cognitive and behavioral impairment are beginning to be elucidated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Abrahams1">[1]</xref>; several of these molecules were shown to be located at synapses, suggesting that synaptic dysfunction is involved in neurobehavioral disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Pinto1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Tabuchi1">[6]</xref>. However, for many of the candidate genes a direct link with neurobehavioral disorders as well an understanding of their molecular function remains unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Geschwind1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Abrahams2">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>An important neuronal signaling cascade involved in synaptic plasticity and learning occurs downstream of G protein–coupled receptors, resulting in the activation of adenylate cyclase that produces cAMP through stimulation with the Gαs subunit of trimeric G proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Choi1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Insel1">[12]</xref>. cAMP in turn activates protein kinase A (PKA), which drives long-term changes in synaptic efficacy through direct effects on the pre- or postsynapse and through CREB-dependent regulation of gene transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Huang1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Shaywitz1">[15]</xref>. However, the mechanisms regulating cAMP production remain incompletely understood.</p>
<p>In this article we describe a crucial role for the conserved WD repeat protein coronin 1 in cognition and behavior through the activity of coronin 1 in modulating the cAMP/PKA pathway. Coronin 1 is encoded in a genomic region on chromosome 16 in human and the corresponding region of mouse chromosome 7 whose copy number variations are associated with varying degrees of cognitive impairment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Horev1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Rosenfeld1">[19]</xref>. Coronin 1 is a member of the WD repeat containing protein family, and is expressed in immune cells as well as in nervous tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Ferrari1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Pieters1">[22]</xref>. In immune cells, coronin 1 is required for the transduction of cell surface signals to intracellular signaling cascades, thereby regulating a number of different processes, ranging from pathogen destruction to the survival of T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Pieters1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Mueller1">[26]</xref>. A function for coronin 1 in neuronal cells or tissues has, however, not been described.</p>
<p>We here show that mice lacking coronin 1 displayed increased aggression, social deficits, increased repetitive behavior, reduced fear/anxiety, and a severe defect in learning and memory. We found that coronin 1 was specifically expressed in excitatory synapses and required for cAMP/PKA-dependent synaptic plasticity. We further show that upon cellular stimulation, coronin 1 interacts with the G protein subunit Gαs to stimulate the cAMP/PKA pathway. Importantly, infusion of the cAMP analogue 8-Br-cAMP reversed the learning and memory deficits in coronin 1–deficient mice. These results identify coronin 1 as being important for cognition and behavior through its activity in modulating cAMP/PKA-dependent synaptic plasticity.</p>

<title>Coronin 1 Deficiency Results in Altered Behavior</title>
<p>In the course of analyzing mice harboring a targeted deletion of the coronin 1 gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Jayachandran1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Mueller1">[26]</xref> we consistently observed behavioral abnormalities. In particular, coronin 1–deficient mice showed a significantly enhanced aggressive behavior, shorter attack latency, and social dominance compared to wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001820-g001">Figure 1A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001820.s018">Table S1</xref>). Also, upon transfer to a dark versus light chamber, mice lacking coronin 1 showed an increased duration of stay in the light compartment relative to wild-type as well as an increased number of transitions between the dark and light chambers and a reduced latency to enter the light compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001820-g001">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001820.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Analysis using the elevated plus maze test revealed that coronin 1–deficient mice spent a significantly longer duration of time in the open arm of the maze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001820-g001">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001820.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). Furthermore, analysis of vocalization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Crawley1">[27]</xref> revealed a reduction in calls in coronin 1–deficient mice compared to wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001820-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Finally, we analyzed self-grooming, which in mice is assumed to be an equivalent to stereotypic behavior observed in models of behavioral abnormalities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Silverman1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Smith1">[29]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001820-g001">Figure 1F</xref>, coronin 1–deficient mice showed a drastically increased self-grooming. Together these results suggest that the absence of coronin 1 results in reduced anxiety and increased aggression.</p>

<title>Coronin 1 Deficiency Results in Defective Memory Formation and Socialization</title>
<p>Analysis of classical cued fear conditioning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Mahan1">[30]</xref> showed that coronin 1–deficient mice exhibited markedly reduced freezing levels as compared to wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001820-g001">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001820.s001">Figure S1D</xref>,E). Likewise, contextual fear conditioning, induced by exposing mice to a single unconditioned stimulus (US) in a neutral environment, was strongly impaired in the absence of coronin 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001820-g001">Figure 1H</xref>), although no defects in locomotion or pain thresholds nor perception were observed as assessed by Y-maze, grip test, rotarod, beam walking, open field, formalin pain sensitivity, hot plate, and tail flick analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001820.s001">Figure S1C</xref>,E,F and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001820.s018">Table S1</xref>), suggesting that the behavioral defects are not the result of low exploratory activity and/or impaired sensory abilities. Also, analysis of novel object recognition did not reveal any difference between wild-type and coronin 1–deficient mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001820.s001">Figure S1G</xref>). Next, we monitored the degree of socialization of both wild-type and coronin 1–deficient mice using the three-chamber socialization test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Crawley1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Silverman1">[28]</xref>. Wild-type and coronin 1–deficient mice showed similar olfactory abilities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001820.s002">Figure S2A</xref>) and did not display any side preferences or differences in the number of entries into the chambers in the absence of a companion mouse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001820.s002">Figure S2B–E</xref>). However, coronin 1–deficient mice showed a significantly reduced sociability as well as reduced preference for social novelty (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001820-g001">Figure 1I,J</xref>). A similar social defect was observed using a modified Paylor's partition analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001820.s002">Figure S2F</xref>), which, together with the three-chamber analysis, suggests defective social interaction upon coronin 1 deletion.</p>
<p>To analyze the consequences of coronin 1 depletion in human, we evaluated an individual from a consanguineous family presenting with immunodeficiency due to a homozygous missense mutation in the coronin 1 coding region, causing a valine to methionine change at the conserved amino acid position 134 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001820.s003">Figure S3A</xref>) that resulted in coronin 1 deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Moshous1">[31]</xref>. To rule out gene duplication or deletion of the 16p11.2 fragment, which is known to be associated with cognitive and behavioral dysfunction, we performed conventional karyotyping and high-resolution array CGH analysis that did not reveal genetic alterations (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Furthermore whole exome sequencing did not show any homozygous mutation in another gene that may be linked to neurocognitive impairment.

As a consequence the coronin 1<sup>V134M</sup> mutant was rapidly degraded (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001820.s003">Figure S3B,C</xref>). The neurological examination of the patient was normal, presenting no microcephaly, hypertonia, spasticity, or anomaly of cranial nerves and no facial dysmorphic features. Broad biological, metabolic, and medical screenings in order to rule out other causes for developmental delay were performed, with no abnormalities being diagnosed (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001820.s022">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001820.s019">Table S2</xref>). However, neuropsychological examination revealed that although the patient acquired gross motor milestones timely (crawling at 8 months and free walking at 12 months, respectively), he presented a severe delay in language acquisition as well as significant behavioral anomalies including increased levels of aggression (scratching and biting), attention/concentration deficit, hyperactivity, impulsivity, and sleep disturbances (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001820.s003">Figure S3D,E</xref>).

<title>Regulation of PKA-Dependent Synaptic Plasticity by Coronin 1</title>
<p>To assess the functional role of coronin 1 at excitatory synapses in anxiety-related brain regions, whole-cell current and voltage-clamp recordings were performed from lateral amygdala (LA) projection neurons, while stimulating excitatory pathways from cortex and thalamus, the two main sensory inputs onto LA principal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001820-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Baseline synaptic transmission as well as postsynaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) at thalamo-LA synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Humeau1">[38]</xref> was found to be largely normal in the absence of coronin 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001820-g003">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001820.s006">Figure S6</xref>). However, PKA-dependent presynaptic cortico-LA LTP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Fourcaudot1">[39]</xref> was completely absent in coronin 1–deficient animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001820-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). Next, to bypass upstream induction mechanisms, we applied forskolin, which directly increases the presynaptic probability of release at cortico-LA synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Fourcaudot1">[39]</xref>. Although in wild-type mice application of a brief pulse of forskolin persistently increased excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSC) amplitude and decreased the paired pulsed ratio (PPR), forskolin had no effect on synaptic transmission in coronin 1–deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001820-g003">Figure 3G</xref>). We therefore conclude that the absence of cortico-LA LTP in coronin 1–deficient amygdala results from defective cAMP/PKA signaling.</p>
<p>In neurons, as in other cells, PKA activation leads to the phosphorylation of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) at serine 133, thereby activating CREB, which is required for CREB-mediated gene transcription that is involved in the regulation of cognitive functioning, memory consolidation, and the late phase of postsynaptic LTP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Weisskopf1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Shaywitz1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Impey1">[40]</xref>. Staining of wild-type and coronin 1–deficient hippocampal neurons with antibodies directed against cAMP, a PKA consensus site, or phospho-CREB revealed strongly reduced labeling in coronin 1–deficient neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001820-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Furthermore, analysis of brain lysates revealed significantly increased CREB phosphorylation at serine-133 only in the presence of coronin 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001820-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Similarly, in brain sections, P-CREB labeling was severely reduced in neurons from coronin 1–deficient animals compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001820-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Consistent with reduced cAMP levels in coronin 1–deficient mouse brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001820-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), direct measurement of PKA activity in amygdala lysates showed a significantly reduced activity in the absence of coronin 1 compared to wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001820-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Inclusion of cAMP during the assay resulted in an elevation of the PKA activity in coronin 1–deficient brain sections comparable to that in wild-type sections, indicating that PKA is fully functional in the absence of coronin 1. A decrease in neuronal cAMP levels was recently found to be associated with increased ventricular size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Kelly1">[41]</xref>. Interestingly, when analyzing brains from wild-type and coronin 1–deficient mice using <italic>in vivo</italic> magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we observed that deletion of coronin 1 resulted in a significant enlargement of the lateral ventricles in adult but not in young mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001820-g004">Figure 4F,G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001820.s007">Figure S7A,B</xref>), corroborating a role for neuronal coronin 1 in the modulation of cAMP signaling.

To analyze whether the coronin 1–dependent cAMP production resulted from a physical interaction between coronin 1 and Gαs, cells expressing coronin 1 were activated with isoproterenol, lysed, and Gα complexes immunoprecipitated using specific antibodies. Protein complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using either anti-Gα or anti–coronin 1 antibodies. Although only low to undetectable amounts of coronin 1 were observed in anti-Gα immunoprecipitates from unstimulated cells, upon isoproterenol stimulation the coronin 1 signal drastically increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001820-g006">Figure 6A,B</xref>). In accordance with the capacity of coronin 1 to promote cAMP production in an F-actin–independent manner, depolymerization of F-actin by latrunculin B did not affect the stimulus-dependent interaction of coronin 1 with Gα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001820-g006">Figure 6C</xref>).

<p>Next, we investigated the possibility that the previously shown results could arise from a direct interaction between coronin 1 and Gα. Because the crystal structure of coronin 1 is known <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Appleton1">[33]</xref>, we generated a series of coronin 1 mutant molecules in which residues at the surface of coronin 1 (and therefore potentially involved in protein–protein interactions within a complex) were mutated to alanine (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001820.s020">Table S3</xref>). Coronin 1 mutant molecules were expressed in Mel JuSo cells, and the capacity to stimulate cAMP production following stimulation of the β2-adrenergic receptor with isoproterenol was analyzed by cAMP ELISA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001820-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, mutation of Lys-20, Arg-69, Glu-102 alone or in combination with Lys-355 strongly decreased cAMP production.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Cognitive and behavioral disorders can arise as a result of defective synaptic plasticity, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. The work presented here suggests an important role for neuronal coronin 1 in behavioral and cognitive function via regulation of cAMP/PKA-dependent signal transduction and synaptic plasticity. We found that coronin 1 deletion or expression of an unstable coronin 1 mutant is associated with severe neurobehavioral dysfunction in both mice and humans. Mice lacking coronin 1 displayed defective socialization, enhanced grooming, defective vocalization, as well as lowered anxiety and enhanced aggression. Interestingly, the normal object recognition response together with the altered fear conditioning suggests that the defective learning and memory in the absence of coronin 1 may be a result of altered anxiety <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Orsini1">[47]</xref>. One should also note that the lower level of freezing could be a consequence of altered exploratory behavior and/or locomotor traits; However, the Y-maze analysis along with the open field and beam walking suggests that coronin 1 deficiency per se does not result in lowered exploratory activity, locomotor defects, and/or novelty seeking that are potential confounds in these behavioural tests <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Yee1">[48]</xref>. Furthermore, coronin 1 deletion was associated with a reduction in the number of excitatory synapses as well as a virtual absence of PKA-dependent LTP at cortico-lateral amygdalary synapses, structures that are important for learning and memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Fourcaudot1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-LeDoux1">[49]</xref>. Together these results suggest an important function for coronin 1 in activating PKA-dependent signaling at excitatory synapses.</p>
<p>The specific role for coronin 1 in promoting anxiety-related synaptic plasticity via activation of cAMP/PKA signaling is illustrated by several of the findings presented here. First, the increase in ventricular size in mice lacking coronin 1 phenocopies mice in which neuronal cAMP levels are constitutively decreased <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Kelly1">[41]</xref>. Second, the membrane-permeable cAMP analogue 8-Br-cAMP was able to rescue cortico-LA long-term plasticity. Third, intra-amygdala infusion of 8-Br-cAMP resulted in a virtually complete restoration of the memory defect associated with coronin 1 deletion. Although application of 8-Br-cAMP might activate LTP in all the cells of the injection area, regardless of whether they were triggered or not during the fear conditioning, the results shown suggest that in the presence of extraneous 8-Br-cAMP the circuit specific for this fear conditioning is strengthened upon exposure to the context, thereby bypassing the cAMP/PKA defect because of coronin 1 deficiency. Furthermore, the behavioral defects are unlikely to be a consequence of developmental defects or neurodegeneration, as they occur well before the observed ventricular enlargement and neuronal loss, although more subtle morphological changes that are not detected by the methods used here cannot be ruled out. Finally, the coronin 1 neurobehavioral defects phenocopy cAMP signaling defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Kelly1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Blaeser1">[50]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Breuillaud1">[52]</xref>. Together these results strongly argue for a specific role for coronin 1 in the activation of cAMP signaling.</p>
<p>We found that the mechanism via which coronin 1 promotes cAMP production occurs via the association of coronin 1 with Gαs molecules: first, inclusion of pertussis toxin, which inactivates Gαi via ADP ribosylation, did not prevent coronin 1–dependent cAMP production. Second, coronin 1 was readily co-immunoprecipitated with Gαs but not with Gαi. Third, addition of cholera toxin, which locks Gαs proteins in their active state via ADP ribosylation, resulted in a level of cAMP production in coronin 1–deficient cells that was equivalent to the cAMP production in coronin 1–expressing cells. Therefore, neuronal coronin 1 may have evolved to specifically activate the adenylate cyclase pathway, as these enzymes are the predominant targets of Gαs proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Morris1">[53]</xref>. Possibly, exon shuffling during evolution might have endowed coronin 1 with sequence motifs that allow its binding to Gαs in order to promote adenylate cyclase activation, which, given the tissue-specific expression of coronin 1, occurs in a cell-type-specific manner.</p>
<p>The exact molecular mechanism by which coronin 1 modulates Gαs activity remains to be elucidated. Both coronin 1 and the Gβ subunit of the G protein heterotrimer have a seven-bladed propeller fold, sharing sequence and structural homology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Appleton1">[33]</xref>. Also, the residues of coronin 1 that we have found to be necessary for Gαs interaction are located in a region that is homologous to the Gβ–Gαs interacting surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Lambright1">[54]</xref>. Thus, one possibility is that coronin 1 binds to Gαs in a similar manner as Gβ. Interestingly, several lines of evidence suggest that following receptor activation, the components of the G protein heterotrimer rearrange rather than dissociate and are maintained in a complex with the βγ subunit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Rebois1">[55]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Lambert1">[57]</xref>. In this scenario, in coronin 1–expressing cells, upon stimulation coronin 1 might displace the Gβ subunit from the trimeric complex in order to modulate adenylate cyclase activity, similarly to the activation of downstream effectors by heterotrimeric G protein complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Bunemann1">[58]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Yuan1">[60]</xref>. Alternatively, coronin 1 may bind to Gαs in a manner that is distinct from Gβ, thereby promoting cAMP production (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001820.s013">Figure S13</xref>). In vitro reconstitution of coronin 1–dependent adenylate cyclase activation might help to further delineate the molecular details of the role for coronin 1 in stimulating cAMP production.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the here described activation of cAMP/PKA signaling occurred independent of an intact F-actin cytoskeleton. These findings are consistent with earlier work using lymphoma cells, where disruption of the F-actin cytoskeleton by cytochalasin B also failed to modulate cAMP production within the time frame analyzed here <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Insel2">[61]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Jasper1">[62]</xref>. Although relatively little is known about the regulation of G protein–mediated adenylate cyclase activation by the F-actin cytoskeleton, these data reinforce the conclusion that, <italic>in vivo</italic>, coronin 1 is unlikely to mediate its function in regulating signal transduction via inducing F-actin rearrangement as shown in leukocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Mueller2">[63]</xref>. However, whether or not coronin 1–mediated IP<sub>3</sub>/calcium signaling in naïve T cells and macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Jayachandran1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Mueller1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Combaluzier1">[64]</xref> occurs through the here described activation of adenylate cyclase remains to be established; although there are indications that both T cell activation as well as macrophage receptor triggering may involve G protein–coupled signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Ngai1">[65]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Makranz1">[66]</xref>, cAMP mediated signaling in leukocytes is still relatively poorly understood. Also, recent work showed that upon deletion of the coronin 1 homologue in the lower eukaryote <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, coronin A, the resulting developmental defect can be fully restored upon direct activation of PKA via 8-Br-cAMP incubation (Vinet et al., in press).</p>
<p>Given the importance of regulated cAMP signaling for appropriate neuronal functioning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Huang1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Weisskopf1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Pineda1">[67]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Wong1">[68]</xref>, the here described role for coronin 1 in the activation of PKA/cAMP-dependent synaptic plasticity is fully consistent with neuronal coronin 1 being involved in the activation of cAMP production. Furthermore, the restricted expression of coronin 1 within the brain as well as to excitatory neurons may allow a subset of neuronal structures to depend for the activation of cAMP/PKA-mediated synaptic plasticity on coronin 1, while maintaining coronin 1–independent regulation of neuronal activity in other regions.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the coronin 1 gene is located in a genomic region on chromosome 16 in human and 7 in mouse, whose copy number variations are associated with a wide range of neuropsychiatric conditions including behavioral dysfunction and intellectual disability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Horev1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Rosenfeld1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Smith1">[29]</xref>. Both the mouse model as well as the patient described here exclusively lack coronin 1 expression, instead of having a deletion across a larger genomic region, which suggests a strong correlation of coronin 1 deletion and/or mutation with severe neurobehavioral abnormalities such as social deficits, stereotypic behavior, aggression, and cognitive impairment. A delay in language acquisition and behavioral as well as cognitive impairment is also described for an individual that paired a de novo deletion of 16p11.2 on the maternal allele with a 2 bp deletion in the paternal coronin 1 allele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Shiow2">[69]</xref>. In the patient described here, the hypomorphic nature of the coronin 1 mutation may explain the differences in the neurobehavioral phenotype when compared with the mouse knock-out. With additional individuals being identified harboring coronin 1 mutations associated with cognitive deficits, it may be feasible to dissect the molecular details of the coronin 1–dependent signal transduction pathway(s) responsible for behavior and cognition.</p>
<p>The development of neurobehavioral and cognitive disorders is believed to result from an imbalance between inhibitory and excitatory synaptic transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Tabuchi1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Sudhof1">[37]</xref>. Interestingly, in several models of behavioral abnormalities the E/I synapse ratio was found to be altered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Ramocki1">[70]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001820-Gogolla1">[71]</xref> consistent with the selective expression of neuronal coronin 1 at excitatory synapses and the disturbed E/I synapse ratio in the absence of coronin 1.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the results presented here define coronin 1 as a regulator of behavioral processes via promoting PKA-dependent synaptic plasticity and may open novel avenues for the dissection of signal transduction pathways involved in cognitive processes.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry of Brain Sections</title>
<p>Wild-type and coronin 1–deficient mice (age 6–8 wk) were anesthetized in a 4% isoflurane chamber, decapitated, and the brains dissected out immediately and transferred stepwise into 2-methylbutane solution supercooled to −40°C. Once frozen, the sections were transferred to −80°C until sectioning. Prior to sectioning, the brains were warmed to −20°C for 30 min and mounted on a cryostat (Microm HM 560 or Leica CM1950). Thin brain sections (12 micron) were transferred onto superfrost glass slides (Thermo Scientific), air dried, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature followed by a cycle of dehydration with 70%, 95%, and 100% ethanol and rehydration in the reverse order. Alternatively, brain sections from C57BL/6 or CD1 mice (Zyagen) were used for staining. The samples were then subjected to antigen retrieval in 10 mM citrate phosphate buffer (10 mM Citric acid pH6, 0.05% Tween 20) overnight at 60°C followed by blocking with 5% FBS for 2 h. For incubation with primary antibodies, rabbit anti–coronin 1 primary antibody (serum 1002, 1∶1,000 dilution) or rat anti–coronin 1 serum (1∶100) along with mouse anti-neurofilament medium chain or chicken anti-neurofilament heavy chain antibody, rabbit anti-pCREB, and mouse anti-histone antibody in PBS with 2% fetal bovine serum were layered over the samples for 4 to 16 h. After three washes with PBS containing 2% fetal bovine serum, anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (1∶200) or anti-rat Alexa Fluor 488 (1∶200) and anti-mouse-Alexa Fluor 546 or anti-chicken Alexa Fluor 563 tagged secondary antibodies (1∶200) were added. One hour postincubation, the slides were washed three times and the slides sealed with a coverslip in the presence of antifade (BioRad) and viewed under a confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss LSM 510Meta or LSM 700).

Then slices (60 µm) were imaged using a 5× epifluorescence microscope (Leica DM5000). Mice were preserved in the analysis only if one side of bilateral injections was precisely targeted or if both saturated areas covered more than 25% of the amygdala.</p>
