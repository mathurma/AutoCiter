                <p>Many disordered proteins function via binding to a structured partner and undergo
                    a disorder-to-order transition. The coupled folding and binding can confer
                    several functional advantages such as the precise control of binding specificity
                    without increased affinity. Additionally, the inherent flexibility allows the
                    binding site to adopt various conformations and to bind to multiple partners.
                    These features explain the prevalence of such binding elements in signaling and
                    regulatory processes. In this work, we report ANCHOR, a method for the
                    prediction of disordered binding regions. ANCHOR relies on the pairwise energy
                    estimation approach that is the basis of IUPred, a previous general disorder
                    prediction method. In order to predict disordered binding regions, we seek to
                    identify segments that are in disordered regions, cannot form enough favorable
                    intrachain interactions to fold on their own, and are likely to gain stabilizing
                    energy by interacting with a globular protein partner. The performance of ANCHOR
                    was found to be largely independent from the amino acid composition and adopted
                    secondary structure. Longer binding sites generally were predicted to be
                    segmented, in agreement with available experimentally characterized examples.
                    Scanning several hundred proteomes showed that the occurrence of disordered
                    binding sites increased with the complexity of the organisms even compared to
                    disordered regions in general. Furthermore, the length distribution of binding
                    sites was different from disordered protein regions in general and was dominated
                    by shorter segments. These results underline the importance of disordered
                    proteins and protein segments in establishing new binding regions. Due to their
                    specific biophysical properties, disordered binding sites generally carry a
                    robust sequence signal, and this signal is efficiently captured by our method.
                    Through its generality, ANCHOR opens new ways to study the essential functional
                    sites of disordered proteins.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>Intrinsically unstructured/disordered proteins (IUPs/IDPs) do not adopt a stable
                    structure in isolation but exist as a highly flexible ensemble of conformations.
                    Despite the lack of a well-defined structure these proteins carry out important
                    functions. Many IUPs/IDPs function via binding specifically to other
                    macromolecules that involves a disorder-to-order transition. The molecular
                    recognition functions of IUPs/IDPs include regulatory and signaling interactions
                    where binding to multiple partners and high-specificity/low-affinity
                    interactions play a crucial role. Due to their specific functional and
                    structural properties, these binding regions have distinct properties compared
                    to both globular proteins and disordered regions in general. Here, we present a
                    general method to identify disordered binding regions from the amino acid
                    sequence. Our method targets the essential feature of these regions: they behave
                    in a characteristically different manner in isolation than bound to their
                    partner protein. This prediction method allows us to compare the binding
                    properties of short and long binding sites. The evolutionary relationship
                    between the amount of disordered binding regions and general disordered regions
                    in various organisms was also analyzed. Our results suggest that disordered
                    binding regions can be recognized even without taking into account their adopted
                    secondary structure or their specific binding partner.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>The classical point of view on protein function claims that the functionality of a
                protein requires the presence of a well-defined three dimensional structure.
                However, as the amount of experimental evidence against the generality of this
                concept grew, this paradigm had to be reassessed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Wright1">[1]</xref>. It has become evident
                that there is a large number of proteins that do not require a stable structure even
                under physiological conditions in order to fulfill their biological role <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Dyson1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Tompa1">[4]</xref>. These intrinsically
                unstructured/disordered proteins (IUPs/IDPs) lack a well defined tertiary structure
                and exhibit a multitude of conformations that dynamically change over time and
                population. The importance of protein disorder is underlined by the abundance of
                partially or fully disordered proteins encoded in higher eukaryotic genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Dunker2">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Ward1">[6]</xref>.
                Disordered proteins are involved in many important biological functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Dyson1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Xie1">[7]</xref>, which
                complement the functional repertoire of globular proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Xie1">[7]</xref>. Recent characterization of
                IUPs based on their functions shows that disorder can help these proteins to fulfill
                their functions in various ways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Tompa2">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Galea1">[9]</xref>. In the case of entropic chains, the biological
                function is directly mediated by disorder (e.g. MAP2 projection domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Chen1">[10]</xref>,
                titin's PEVK domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Linke1">[11]</xref>, NF-M and NF-H between neurofilaments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Mukhopadhyay1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Hoh1">[13]</xref>, nucleoporin complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Alber1">[14]</xref>). Furthermore,
                disordered segments often act as flexible linkers between folded domains in
                multidomain proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Dyson1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Bruschweiler1">[15]</xref>. Alternatively,
                many disordered proteins function by binding specifically to other proteins, DNA or
                RNA. This process, termed coupled folding and binding involves a transition from
                disordered state to a more ordered state with stable secondary and tertiary
                structural elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Dyson2">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Uversky1">[17]</xref>.</p>
            <p>The coupled folding and binding confers several functional advantages in certain
                types of molecular interactions. Since – at least partial –
                folding happens together with binding, the entropic penalty counterbalances the
                enthalpy gain coming from the binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Demarest1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Lacy1">[19]</xref>. This way disorder
                uncouples specificity from binding strength allowing for weak transient, still
                specific interactions that are essential for signaling processes. These properties
                enable disordered proteins to play an important role in molecular recognition
                including gene regulation, cell cycle control and other key cellular processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Uversky2">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Fuxreiter1">[23]</xref>. The kinetic and
                thermodynamic details of the binding are influenced by conformational preferences
                present prior to binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Dunker3">[24]</xref>. Although disordered proteins in general lack
                secondary and tertiary structure, some exhibit partial secondary structure at closer
                inspection. For example, CD analysis indicated that p21 and p27 possess
                α-helical segments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Lacy1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Kriwacki1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Bienkiewicz1">[26]</xref>. Detailed NMR
                characterization of p27 and other proteins showed that several segments can have a
                pronounced tendency to adopt α-helical, or even β strand
                conformations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Galea1">[9]</xref>. Upon binding, these inherent structural preferences
                can either be solidified or overwritten by the partner molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Fuxreiter2">[27]</xref>.
                Some regions can preserve flexibility even within the complex, mitigating the
                unfavorable entropy term <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Tompa3">[28]</xref>. This allows the fine-tuning of the affinity of
                interactions over a wide range. As a general rule, however, these interactions are
                driven largely enthalpically by the favorable interactions formed with the partner
                molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Demarest1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Lacy1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Spolar1">[29]</xref>.</p>
            <p>The inherent flexibility of disordered proteins offers further advantages in binding.
                It results in a malleable interface that can allow binding to several partners or to
                adopt different conformations, manifested in increased binding capability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Tompa2">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Uversky2">[20]</xref>. In
                accordance, several analyses of protein interaction networks revealed that
                disordered proteins are abundant among hub proteins, proteins with a large number of
                interacting partners <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Dosztanyi1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Haynes1">[31]</xref>. In a different scenario, the binding partners of
                an ordered protein are disordered, as shown for binding of 14-3-3 proteins, thus
                allowing a single protein to bind multiple partners <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Oldfield1">[32]</xref>. Beside their
                involvement in protein-protein interactions, these proteins are also subjects of
                various post-translational modifications that control their functions, localization
                and turnover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Iakoucheva2">[33]</xref>. In this way, these proteins can integrate and
                mediate multiple signals of various sources, and act as the central elements in
                signaling or regulatory networks. The centrality of these proteins, however, is also
                their weakness. It has been suggested that the targeted attack of hubs can cause
                serious disruption in protein interaction networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Albert1">[34]</xref>. Furthermore,
                disordered proteins are often associated with various diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Uversky3">[35]</xref>. For example, the
                primary importance of p53 originates from its involvement of 50% of
                cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Vogelstein1">[36]</xref>. In general, 79% of human cancer
                associated proteins have been classified as IUPs, compared to 47% of all
                eukaryotic proteins in SwissProt database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Iakoucheva1">[22]</xref>. Disordered
                proteins were also suggested to be common in diabetes and cardiovascular diseases
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Uversky3">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Cheng1">[37]</xref>. Several disordered proteins - such as
                Aβ, τ, α synuclein, and prion protein - are involved in
                neurodegenerative diseases and are also prone to amyloid formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Frankfort1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Marc1">[40]</xref>. On the other hand, due
                to their specific way of interactions, disordered proteins can also be attractive
                targets for drug discovery. A novel strategy for drug discovery exploiting binding
                sites within disordered regions has already been suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Cheng2">[41]</xref>. This adds further
                support to the importance of finding specific functional sites in proteins that
                undergo disorder-to-order transition upon binding or <italic>disordered binding
                    regions</italic> in short.</p>
            <p>Despite their importance, the number of well characterized examples of disordered
                proteins undergoing disorder-to-order transition is very small. The PDB also offers
                only a limited sample of proteins adopting a well defined conformation as part of a
                complex. However, recent comparisons of these structures with complexes formed
                between ordered proteins pointed out several differences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Gunasekaran1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Vacic1">[44]</xref>. In
                general, disordered proteins adopted a largely extended conformation in the complex
                exposing the majority of their residues for interacting with their partner. The
                interface of disordered proteins was enriched in hydrophobic residues compared to
                the interface of ordered proteins, but also to disordered regions in general. The
                higher number of interchain contacts was suggested to be a sign of better adaptation
                of disordered proteins to the surface of their partner. In general, the regions that
                become ordered were shorter as compared to globular domains, usually less than
                30–40 residues. While the interface of globular proteins was most often
                formed by distant segments of the amino acid sequence brought together by folding,
                disordered binding sites were much more localized in the primary structure. These
                features demonstrate that the underlying principles of molecular recognition of
                disordered binding regions are different from the complex formation of globular
                proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Meszaros1">[43]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Disordered binding sites are also expected to be distinguishable from general
                disordered sites that are not directly involved in binding. A common notion is that
                protein disorder comes in many flavors, and these should be targeted by specific
                prediction methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Vucetic1">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Schlessinger1">[46]</xref>. However,
                training specific methods would require significantly larger datasets than those
                that are available today. Nevertheless, existing general protein disorder prediction
                methods might already be equipped for this problem. It has been suggested that
                specific patterns of disorder prediction profiles can be associated with regions
                undergoing disorder-to-order transitions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Garner1">[47]</xref>. Since these regions
                can be ordered as well as disordered, there is no clear recipe whether these regions
                should be predicted ordered, disordered, or as borderline cases. A recent analysis
                compared several methods to recognize short protein-protein interaction motifs
                containing α-helical elements in their bound state, the so-called
                α-MoRFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Cheng3">[48]</xref>. As expected, the various methods showed large
                variations in predicted order/disorder tendency corresponding to binding regions.
                One of the earliest prediction method PONDR VL-XT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Romero1">[49]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Li1">[51]</xref> was quite
                consistent in predicting these regions as ordered within a broader disordered
                region, giving them the characteristic appearance of dips in the prediction output.
                Based on this specific prediction output, a method was developed to recognize
                α-MoRFs from the amino acid sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Cheng3">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Oldfield2">[52]</xref>. First, regions
                predicted with dips in the output of VL-XT were selected and were filtered further
                by a neural network using several additional properties. This prediction method is
                restricted to recognize short, α-helical binding regions within disordered
                proteins.</p>
            <p>Here we present a general method to identify specific binding regions undergoing
                disorder-to-order transition. Our method relies on the general disorder prediction
                method IUPred <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Dosztanyi2">[53]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Dosztanyi3">[54]</xref>. IUPred is based on
                the assumption that disordered proteins have a specific amino acid composition that
                does not allow the formation of a stable well-defined structure. The method utilizes
                statistical potentials that can be used to calculate the pairwise interaction energy
                from known coordinates. Using a dataset of globular proteins only, a method was
                developed to estimate the pairwise interaction energy of proteins directly from the
                amino acid sequence. By virtue of this algorithm, disordered residues can be
                predicted by having unfavorable estimated pairwise energies. The estimation of the
                energy for each residue is based on its amino acid type, and the amino acid
                composition of its sequential neighborhood. Through the amino acid composition of
                the sequential environment, IUPred can take into account that the disorder tendency
                of residues can be modulated by their environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Dosztanyi2">[53]</xref>. This property of
                IUPred is exploited in order to recognize regions that are most likely to undergo a
                disorder-to-order transition based on their estimated pairwise energies in different
                contexts. The prediction of binding sites is based on estimating the energy content
                in free and in the bound states, and identifying segments that are potentially
                sensitive to these changes. In a previous work, the ability to predict specific
                contacts was emphasized in order to recognize disordered regions that are involved
                in binding externally rather than internally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Schlessinger1">[46]</xref>. In our model,
                however, there was no attempt made to model specific interactions. Instead, the
                environment is taken into account simply at the level of amino acid composition.
                Here we show that this simple model captures the essential property of disordered
                binding regions and allows their robust prediction. We termed our disordered binding
                site prediction method ANCHOR, to reflect the primary importance of short segments
                driving the complex formation between a disordered protein and its partner.</p>

                <title>The outline of the algorithm</title>
                <p>The goal of the present work was to recognize a special class of disordered
                    segments from the amino acid sequence, namely those that are capable of
                    undergoing a disorder-to-order transition upon binding to a globular protein
                    partner. The essential feature of such binding regions is that they behave in a
                    characteristically different manner in isolation than bound to their partner
                    protein. In their free state, they behave as disordered proteins, existing as a
                    highly flexible structural ensemble. In their bound state they usually adopt a
                    rigid conformation, similar to regions within globular structures. This
                    capability to behave in drastically different ways in different environments is
                    targeted by our approach. We seek to identify segments in a generally disordered
                    region that cannot form enough favorable intrachain interactions, however they
                    have the capability to energetically gain by interacting with a globular partner
                    protein. Our prediction is based on three properties.</p>
                <list list-type="order">
                    <list-item>
                        <p>The first criterion ensures that a given residue belongs to a long
                            disordered region, and filters out globular domains.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>The second criterion corresponds to the isolated state and it ensures
                            that a residue is not able to form enough favorable contacts with its
                            own local sequential neighbors to fold, otherwise it would be prone to
                            adopt a well defined structure on its own.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>The third criterion tests the feasibility that a given residue can form
                            enough favorable interactions with globular proteins upon binding. This
                            basically ensures that there is an energy gain by interacting with
                            globular regions.</p>
                    </list-item>
                </list>
                <p>These properties are estimated individually and are combined into a single
                    predictor via optimized weights.</p>
                <p>In more detail, the prediction of these three properties relies on the energy
                    estimation framework implemented in IUPred, a general disorder prediction
                    method. The core element of IUPred is the energy predictor matrix
                    <bold>P</bold>. The parameters in <italic>P<sub>ij</sub></italic> were trained
                    on globular proteins with known structures only, without relying on any kind of
                    disordered dataset. These parameters were determined to minimize the difference
                    between the estimated energies and the energies calculated from the known
                    structures on the dataset of globular proteins. Using the energy predictor
                    matrix IUPred predicts the <italic>E</italic> interaction energy for each
                    residue based on the following formula in default:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000376.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>i</italic> denotes the type of the
                    <italic>k</italic>-th amino acid, <italic>P<sub>ij</sub></italic> is the element
                    of the energy predictor matrix that estimates the pairwise energy of residue of
                    type <italic>i</italic> in the presence of residue type <italic>j</italic>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000376.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the fraction of residue type <italic>j</italic> in the
                    sequential environment within <italic>w<sub>0</sub></italic> residues from
                    residue <italic>k</italic>. The size of neighborhood considered
                        (<italic>w<sub>0</sub></italic>) equals 100 residues in both directions and
                    the result is smoothed over a window size of 10 (also in both directions from
                    the <italic>k</italic>-th residue so in fact 21 residues are considered in
                    total). For the final prediction output, the energies are transformed into
                    probability values, denoted as <italic>s<sub>k</sub></italic>. For more details
                    see Dosztányi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Dosztanyi2">[53]</xref>.</p>
                <p>The disordered binding site prediction is based on three different scores that
                    are calculated with a slight modification of the original energy estimation
                    scheme. The parameters of <italic>P<sub>ij</sub></italic> were taken directly
                    from IUPred. The following three scores are assigned to each residue in a
                    protein according to the above described criteria (1–3):</p>
                <p>1, To measure the tendency of the neighborhood of an amino acid for being
                    disordered we use the IUPred algorithm and assign an
                    <italic>S<sub>k</sub></italic> score to the <italic>k</italic>-th residue of the
                    chain by averaging the IUPred scores in the <italic>w<sub>1</sub></italic>
                    neighborhood of the residue in question:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000376.e003" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>s<sub>j</sub></italic> is the IUPred score of the
                        <italic>j</italic>-th residue of the chain, N is the number of amino acids
                    in the averaging and <italic>b<sub>lower</sub></italic> and
                        <italic>b<sub>upper</sub></italic> are the lower and upper boundaries of the
                    neighborhood of the <italic>i</italic>-th residue, that is
                        <italic>b<sub>lower</sub></italic> = max(<italic>k</italic>−<italic>w<sub>1</sub></italic>;1)
                    and
                            <italic>b<sub>upper</sub></italic> = min(<italic>k+w<sub>1</sub></italic>;<italic>l</italic>),
                    where <italic>l</italic> is the chain length.</p>
                <p>2, We estimate the pairwise interaction energy the given residue may gain by
                    forming intrachain contacts. This is done the exact same way as in IUPred using
                    (1), only here the size of the considered neighborhood
                    (<italic>w<sub>2</sub></italic>) is left as a parameter and is set during the
                    training of the predictor:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000376.e004" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>The smaller window size corresponds to more local behavior.</p>
                <p>3, The pairwise energy that the residue may gain by interacting with a globular
                    protein is approximated using the average amino acid composition of globular proteins:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000376.e005" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000376.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the fraction of residue type <italic>j</italic> in the

                    window sizes. <italic>I<sub>k</sub></italic> is then converted into a

                    a disordered binding site. For a binary classification residues with scores
                    above 0.5 are predicted to be in a disordered binding site. Since the second and
                    third terms of (5) may vary heavily between neighboring residues, the final
                    score is smoothed in a window of 4 residues.</p>
                <p>The optimal values for the three weights (<italic>p<sub>1</sub></italic>,
                            <italic>p<sub>2</sub></italic> and <italic>p<sub>3</sub></italic>) and

                    <italic>w<sub>2</sub></italic>) are determined using a dataset of disordered
                    protein complexes and ordered monomeric proteins by three-fold cross validation
                    (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000376.s008">Figure S1</xref>
                    for a schematic representation and outline of this procedure). The small dataset
                    of known disordered proteins bound to ordered proteins represent a serious
                    bottleneck during optimization. Therefore, it is a clear advantage of our
                    approach that it greatly reduces the dependence on the existing dataset of
                    disordered complexes, and leaves us with only 5 parameters to be optimized on
                    this small dataset.</p>
                <p>The behavior of various scores is shown for an example, the N terminal domain
                    (residues 1–100) of human p53 tumor supressor protein that plays an
                    important regulatory role <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Chumakov1">[55]</xref>. Its N terminal region is completely
                    disordered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Dawson1">[56]</xref> and is known to be able to bind to (at least)
                    three different globular proteins as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000376-g001">Figure 1</xref>. The segment between residues
                    17–27 binds to MDM2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Kussie1">[57]</xref>, the other two binding sites overlap with
                    residues 33–56 binding to RPA 70N <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Bochkareva1">[58]</xref> and residues

                    The three calculated quantities for this domain are also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000376-g001">Figure 1</xref>. It is worth noting
                    that the MDM2 binding site in the N-terminal region of p53 appears to be on the
                    border of being disordered. Although the disordered prediction is part of
                    ANCHOR, the output of this prediction (<italic>E<sub>int</sub></italic>,
                    described in Theory) is linearly combined with two other quantities meaning that
                    predicted disorder is not strictly a prerequisite of a successful disordered
                    binding site prediction.</p>

                <p>Testing of the predictor was done by dividing both our negative and positive

                        complexes</italic>) into three subsets, training the predictor on two of
                    these and evaluating it on the remaining third one. This was done in all three
                    possible combinations yielding three optimal parameter sets. The parameters
                    calculated on the training sets are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000376-t002">Table 2</xref> together with the respective True
                    Positive Rates (TPR) and the fraction of the amino acids in disordered regions
                    of the Disprot dataset predicted to be in disordered binding sites (F values).
                    The optimal parameters were chosen to maximize the amount of correctly predicted
                    disordered binding sites (TPR) while minimizing predicted binding sites in
                    globular proteins (FPR) and also restricting predicted binding sites within
                    disordered regions in general (F). The fact that the three parameter sets do not
                    differ significantly implies that our method is robust.</p>

                    training sets (ie. the part of the original Globular proteins dataset that was
                    used in the training of the respective subpredictor), the FPR's are
                    also quoted (they can differ slightly from 5%). Besides the overall
                    TPR calculated on a residue basis (marked <italic>TPR<sub>AA</sub></italic>), we
                    also calculated the percentage of binding sites identified, termed
                            <italic>TPR<sub>SEG</sub></italic>. A binding site was considered to be
                    found if at least five of its amino acids are correctly classified. The results
                    show that ANCHOR performs at 62% <italic>TPR<sub>AA</sub></italic>
                    with a slightly higher <italic>TPR<sub>SEG</sub></italic> of 68% on
                    average, while maintaining a 5% FPR. ANCHOR is also specific to
                    disordered binding sites as opposed to disorder to general. If all disordered
                    proteins had approximately equal capability of binding then the fraction of
                    correctly identified disordered binding sites (TPR) could not be significantly
                    different from the fraction of disordered regions predicted to be binding sites
                    (F value). As this is not the case
                    (TPR = 62% vs.
                    F = 42%) we can conclude that common
                    features of known disordered binding sites that distinguish them from general
                    disordered protein regions are successfully recognized.</p>

                <p>Another standard way of describing prediction algorithms is by Receiver Operating
                    Characteristic (ROC) curves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Fawcett1">[60]</xref>, that is the TPR versus the FPR of the
                    algorithm. This relationship is mapped by scanning the interval between 0 and 1
                    with the score cutoff. The three ROC curves of the predictor with the three
                    different parameter sets evaluated on the respective testing sets are shown in

                <p>Since the interacting regions of a disordered and an ordered protein are
                    inherently different we expect that the predictor will only recognize binding
                    sites in disordered proteins that interact with globular proteins but are not
                    part of globular proteins themselves. In order to verify this hypothesis we
                    tested the combined final predictor on a dataset of complexes containing only
                    ordered chains (that is three-state complexes – see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). The prediction was done on the
                    short interacting chain of the complexes. This gave a false positive rate of
                    only 3.7% that is even lower than the value obtained on our testing
                    set, although this might be only a consequence of the relatively small size of
                    our ordered complex set (72 complexes). Overall, we could ensure that our
                    predictor makes very few mistakes on both globular proteins and complexes of
                    globular proteins, while it can still recognize the majority of disordered
                    binding regions. This implies that our algorithm is specific to disordered
                    binding sites as opposed to globular proteins, the interface between globular
                    proteins or disordered proteins in general.</p>
                <p>Our predictor was also tested on a completely independent dataset of
                        <italic>α-MoRFs</italic>, short disordered complexes that was
                    assembled by Cheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Cheng3">[48]</xref> and composed of 40 proteins containing
                    binding regions that adopt mostly α-helical structure upon binding. The
                    results of the prediction on this dataset can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000376-t004">Table 4</xref>. Although the residue based TPR is
                    somewhat lower than that calculated on our testing set (57.0% instead
                    of 61.8%), the segment based TPR is almost the same for the two sets
                    (67.5% and 68.3%). Overall these results are comparable to
                    the ones calculated on our training set.</p>

                <p>The specific construction of the algorithm for the prediction of interaction
                    energy implies that the method will be sensitive to amino acid compositions. The
                    differences between the composition of disordered binding sites and the amino
                    acid composition of any of the negative sets (globular proteins, ordered
                    interfaces and disordered proteins in general) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000376-g003">Figure 3A, 3B, and 3C</xref>, respectively. The
                    amino acid compositions of all three datasets are significantly different from

                <p>The final prediction is based on three different scores that combine local and
                    global disorder tendency with sensitivity to the structural environment.
                    Although the individual quantities that are combined for the final score can
                    work selectively better or worse for various types of residues, the effect of
                    these differences on the efficiency of the final prediction is not trivial. This
                    effect was tested by comparing the amount of the different amino acids in the
                    short disordered binding sites to the amount recovered from these by the
                    predictor. These data are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000376-t005">Table 5</xref> together with the calculated
                        <italic>p</italic> values quantifying their differences. As all of the
                        <italic>p</italic> values are fairly large, these differences are likely to
                    occur by chance alone. For example, proline rich binding sites are found with
                    similar accuracy as binding sites enriched in hydrophobic amino acids.
                    Therefore, one may conclude that there is no statistical evidence based on the
                    available dataset that the efficiency of the predictor depends significantly on
                    the amino acid composition of the disordered binding site in question.</p>

                    interacting residues of these structures and the interacting residues that are
                    correctly identified by the predictor are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000376-t006">Table 6</xref>. These data are represented

                    interchain contacts – they would not be able to bind to the partner in
                    the absence of their sequential neighbors. The distribution of predicted binding
                    regions for the short and long disordered chains in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000376-g005">Figure 5A</xref> shows a strong preference for
                    predicting multiple interacting regions for longer chains. This inevitably
                    yields lower residue based TPR but the segment based TPR is not expected to
                    drop. Testing the predictor on the long disordered data confirms this assumption
                    with a decreased residue based TPR of 47.7% (as opposed to
                    65.8% obtained on running the final predictor on the whole set of
                    short disordered complexes) but with a basically unchanged segment based TPR of
                    78.6% (compared to the 76.1% calculated on short
                    disordered complexes). These data suggest that the method either finds short
                    disordered binding sites as a whole or completely misses it. However, this may
                    not be true for long binding regions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000376-g005">Figure 5B</xref> shows the distribution of the
                    fraction of amino acids successfully identified during prediction in the two
                    types of binding sites. The effect can clearly be seen as about 59%
                    of short binding regions are either fully recovered or are completely missed
                    (the sum of the rightmost and leftmost columns) whereas this ratio is only about

                <p>This type of behavior is illustrated on the disordered human p27. This protein is
                    involved in controlling eukaryotic cell division through interactions with
                    cyclin-dependent kinases. Its kinase inhibitory domain binds both subunits of
                    the CDK2-cyclin A complex in an extended conformation (PDB ID: 1jsu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Russo1">[62]</xref>). It
                    is known from kinetic measurements that the binding of p27 is hierarchical
                    through its three domains: first, the D1 domain (residues 25–36) binds
                    to cyclinA which anchors the neighboring LH domain (residues 38–60)
                    that exhibits transient helical structure in monomer state as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Galea2">[63]</xref>.
                    After the binding of D1 this transient structure is stabilized and positions the
                    rest of the chain (D2 domain, residues 62–90) in the correct position
                    to bind to CDK2.</p>

                <p>The human Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASp) is a 502 residue long protein
                    that is expressed in the cells of the hematopoietic system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Ochs1">[64]</xref>. Its mutations can be
                    linked to the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS), a disease characterized by actin
                    cytoskeleton defects leading to deficiencies in blood clotting and immune
                    response. The protein is composed of various functional domains. It contains the
                    WH1 domain near the N terminus (residues 39–148), the GTPase-binding
                    domain (GBD, 230–310), a polyproline-rich region and a C-terminal
                    verpolin homology/central region/acidic region (VCA, 430–502) domain
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Kim1">[65]</xref>
                    that also contains the WH2 domain (430–447). Apart from the structured
                    WH1 domain, it is predicted to be largely disordered and contains several low
                    complexity regions (enriched in P, G and acidic amino acids). There is
                    experimental evidence that the activated WASp hubs a number of interactions with
                    partners including CDC42, RAC, NCK, FYN, SRC kinase FGR, BTK, ABL, PSTPIP1, WIP,
                    and the p85 subunit of PLC-gamma as well as the Arp2/3 complex. However, the

                <p>In its inactive state WASp exists in an autoinhibited form with the GBD domain
                    bound to the VCA domain. When WASp is activated, the GBD domain is bound to
                    CDC42 and this interaction disrupts the GBD-VCA interaction. This initiates a
                    conformational change where WASp opens up and becomes able to bind to the Arp2/3
                    complex leading to its activation and actin nucleation. Both GBD and VCA regions
                    were shown to be disordered in their free state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Kim1">[65]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Marchand1">[66]</xref>, with GBD
                    adopting a loosely packed, compact conformation. However, the structure of both
                    complexes could be determined using NMR, by covalently linking GBD to CDC42 or
                    the VCA region, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Kim1">[65]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-AbdulManan1">[67]</xref>. In these two
                    structures WASp GBD adopts related but distinct folds. The plasticity that can
                    be seen by comparing these two complexes is enabled by the absence of discrete
                    tertiary structure in isolation. As it can be seen on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000376-g007">Figure 7</xref>, ANCHOR captures these disordered
                    binding sites correctly.</p>
                <p>It is known that WASp is able to bind to SRC Homology 3 (SH3) domains through one
                    of its proline rich regions although the exact binding site is not known. The
                    interaction with SH3 domains is usually mediated by a short, linear sequence
                    motif that is present in the interaction partner. In the collection of
                    Eukaryotic Linear Motifs (ELM) database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://elm.eu.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://elm.eu.org/</ext-link>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Puntervoll1">[68]</xref>) there are five different motifs annotated as SH3
                    recognition sites. Multiple instances of the following three can be found in
                    human WASp: LIG_SH3_1, LIG_SH3_2 and LIG_SH3_3 represented by the following
                    consensus sequences: [RKY]..P..P, P..P.[KR]
                    and …[PV]..P, for interaction with Class I/ClassII
                    SH3 domains and those SH3 domains with a non-canonical Class I recognition
                    specificity, respectively. The found motifs are clustered in two separate
                    regions mainly falling into the proline-rich regions of WASp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000376-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Although there is
                    no direct evidence for the location of interaction with SH3 domains on human
                    WASp, the interaction sites have been identified for Las17 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Tong1">[69]</xref>, the yeast homologue
                    of this protein. In total, four distinct regions containing multiple binding
                    sites were identified experimentally in Las17 that interact with various SH3
                    domains. These sites correspond to the proline rich regions in WASp
                    (155–194 and 306–427) that also match with several SH3
                    binding motifs. As linear motifs were shown to have a preference to reside in
                    disordered regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Fuxreiter3">[70]</xref>, it is plausible to expect ANCHOR to be able
                    to recognize the SH3 binding region of WASp. In accordance with this, both
                    regions containing putative SH3 binding sites contain binding sites predicted by
                    ANCHOR. This prediction can restrict the candidate sequence regions for SH3
                    binding and can guide experimental studies to localize true binding sites.</p>

                    thermophile archaeas, it is adopted to the much lower living temperature of its
                    host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Preston1">[71]</xref>. This adaptation could explain the relatively
                    large amount protein disorder and disordered binding sites. In general, these
                    clear differences in the predicted disorder between various archaea organisms
                    points to different strategies to adapt to various extreme environmental
                    conditions resulting in biased amino acid compositions. However, we cannot rule
                    out the possibility that under such extreme conditions, as high salt
                    concentration or high temperature, the amount of disorder can be over- or
                    underpredicted depending how these conditions affect the presence of protein
                    disorder.</p>
                <p>Among bacterial proteomes, there are a few examples of organisms that seem to
                    utilize a surprisingly large fraction of their disordered amino acids in
                    binding. The three most extreme cases (<italic>Carsonella ruddii</italic>,
                        <italic>Sulcia muelleri</italic> and <italic>Buchnera aphidicola subsp.
                        Cinara cedri</italic>) are marked separately on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000376-g008">Figure 8</xref>. These are the three smallest
                    complete bacterial proteomes, none of them reaching the size of the smallest
                    archaea proteome. These organisms present extreme cases of streamlined genomes
                    as a result of endosymbiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-PerezBrocal1">[72]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Wu1">[74]</xref>. As these proteomes are
                    very small, the predicted amount of disorder and disordered binding sites are
                    within the false positive range, and should be treated more cautiously.</p>
                <p>Eukaryotes tend to appear more consistent both in using larger amount of
                    disordered residues and larger fraction of disordered residues for binding
                    compared to the other two kingdoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000376-g008">Figure 8</xref>). The only notable outlier both in terms of extremely low
                    amount disordered proteins and disordered binding sites is
                        <italic>Encephalitozoon cuniculi</italic>. This organism is the only
                    microsporidian parasite in our dataset and has an extremely small proteome. This
                    lack of complexity and dependence on a eukaryotic host to function might explain
                    the lack of disordered proteins.</p>
                <p>The length distributions of the predicted disordered regions and binding sites in
                    the three kingdoms of life was also analyzed and are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000376-g009">Figure 9A and 9B</xref>,
                    respectively. As complexity increases, longer disordered segments are preferred,
                    and the difference between eukaryota and lower complexity organisms becomes even
                    more apparent for longer regions (over 30 residues). A similar trend can be
                    observed in the length distribution of disordered binding sites. While in
                    archaea and bacteria predicted binding regions are generally below 30 residues,
                    longer binding sites in eukaryota organisms are much more common. There are at
                    least three different effects that can contribute to this phenomenon. First, as
                    the number of binding sites rise there is also an increasing possibility of
                    these binding sites becoming very close to each other or even overlapping with
                    each other. This scenario was demonstrated in the case of the N-terminal domain
                    of p53, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000376-g001">Figure
                    1</xref>. Second, extremely large disordered binding regions may be needed for
                    special functions. Some members of the mucin protein family provide an example
                    for this. Human MUC1 contains a large repeat region (20–120 repeats,
                    one repeat being 20 amino acids long) that enables it to aggregate and to
                    perform its function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Hanisch1">[75]</xref>. As each repeat is correctly identified as a
                    disordered binding site, the whole repeat region is predicted as one large
                    binding region. This mechanism can create binding sites up to the length of
                    several hundreds of residues in extreme cases. Third, we cannot exclude the
                    possibility that longer binding sites are not always segmented by weakly
                    interacting regions like in the case of p27, thus forming long, continuous
                    binding regions. Nevertheless, the majority of predicted binding sites is
                    shorter than 30 residues, although such restriction on the length of disordered
                    binding sites was not enforced.</p>

            <p>Regions undergoing disorder-to-order transitions upon binding are essential elements
                in the molecular recognition process involving disordered proteins. The main
                property of these binding regions is that they can exist in a disordered state as
                well as in bound state, adopting at least partially a well-defined conformation. The
                presence of these two separate states discriminates them from monomeric globular
                proteins as well as from complexes formed between globular proteins and from
                disordered proteins in general. They are also expected to differ from dual
                personality fragments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Zhang1">[76]</xref>, which occur within globular proteins, however,
                mostly as a result of perturbations of environmental conditions. In this work we
                aimed to recognize such disordered binding regions from the amino acid sequence. So
                far, the limited number of well characterized examples hindered the development of
                general prediction methods. Nevertheless, biophysical considerations suggest that in
                most cases there is a strong signal in the amino acid sequence highlighting regions
                involved in coupled folding and binding. These regions are linear in sequence,
                unlike in the case of globular proteins, where distinct sites in the amino acid
                sequence are brought together to form the interface for interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Meszaros1">[43]</xref>. An
                additional difference is that binding of disordered proteins is driven by a large
                enthalpic component to compensate for the entropy penalty due to the loss of
                conformational freedom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Galea1">[9]</xref>. These features result in a relatively short
                sequence segment containing residues with a pronounced tendency to make
                interactions, leading to a characteristic sequence signal.</p>
            <p>Our approach relies on a basic physical model of disordered binding sites and it is
                based on modeling the interaction capacity in the free disordered state and in the
                bound ordered state. Previously, it was shown that ordered proteins can be
                discriminated from disordered proteins based on estimated pairwise energy content
                and this approach was implemented in IUPred, a general disorder prediction method
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Dosztanyi2">[53]</xref>. This method takes into account that disorder/order
                tendency can be modulated by the sequential neighborhood simply at the level of
                amino acid composition, without attempting to model the specific interactions.
                Taking it one step further, the same energy estimation calculations were used to
                identify disordered binding regions in proteins. Our model assumes that the specific
                properties of disordered binding sites are dictated by the combination of
                preferences to bind to an ordered protein on the one hand, and the ability to remain
                in a disordered state in isolation, on the other. Based on this simple model, ANCHOR
                achieved approximately 67% accuracy at predicting 5% false
                positive rate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000376-t002">Tables
                    2</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000376-t003"/><xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000376-t004">4</xref>). Furthermore, this approach
                was validated by the ability to reproduce the specific amino acid composition of
                disordered binding sites, that is distinct from that of ordered proteins as well as
                disordered proteins in general (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000376-t005">Table
                    5</xref>).</p>
            <p>During binding, the formation of intermolecular contacts is accompanied by the
                formation or the stabilization of secondary structure elements. The secondary
                structure composition of the binding sites is highly unequal (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000376-t006">Table 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000376-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The most dominant secondary structure
                element adopted in the bound conformation is coil, while β strand
                conformation is rare. Helical conformations are observed as frequently in disordered
                complexes as in globular proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Fuxreiter2">[27]</xref>. It was found that
                the adopted secondary structure can be predicted from the amino acid sequence with
                similar accuracy as in the case of globular proteins, suggesting that the adopted
                secondary structure can be imprinted into the sequence of the binding motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Fuxreiter2">[27]</xref>. The
                secondary structure observed in the complex can also be dictated by the template
                structure. An extreme example of this is the C-terminal region of p53 (see
                Supporting Information), observed in all three secondary structure classes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Oldfield1">[32]</xref>. It
                is clear that not all of these conformations can be the result of inherent
                preferences. Interestingly, our prediction method does not seem to be sensitive to
                the adopted secondary structure conformation and it works with the same accuracy for
                all secondary structure conformations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000376-t006">Table 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000376-g004">Figure 4</xref>). This independence of secondary
                structure elements underlines the generality of ANCHOR. These results also suggest
                that disordered binding sites can be recognized without taking into account of the
                adopted secondary structure in the majority of cases. Nevertheless, the details of
                conformational preferences can be still crucial in selecting the specific binding
                partner, or determining the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of the
                associations.</p>
            <p>Beside our algorithm, a previously published method called α-MoRF predictor
                also exploited a general disorder prediction method to recognize short binding
                elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Cheng3">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Oldfield2">[52]</xref>. Although the direct
                comparison between the two methods was not possible, because the α-MoRF
                predictor is not yet publicly available, some basic differences between the two
                methods should be noted. First, the α-MoRF predictor directly relies on the
                prediction output of PONDR VXLT, which essentially predicts binding regions as
                ordered structural elements, and a subsequent neural network is applied to filter
                out valid disordered binding sites. Although very high accuracies were reported for
                the performance of the neural network based filtering, the complete method is
                limited by finding dips based on PONDR VLXT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Romero1">[49]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Li1">[51]</xref>. Therefore
                it should be taken into account that this program is a first generation prediction
                method that was trained on only 15 proteins. In the case of IUPred, dips
                corresponding to certain binding sites were also observed, although to a smaller
                extent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Cheng3">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Dosztanyi2">[53]</xref>. This observation,
                however, is not directly exploited in our prediction method. Instead, the core
                parameters of the energy prediction of IUPred are used to create three separate
                scores characterizing three important attributes of disordered binding regions. The
                second main difference is that ANCHOR is not restricted to a single secondary
                structure class like the α-MoRF predictor that was trained to recognize only
                α-helical segments. The example of the C-terminal region of p53 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000376.s009">Figure S2</xref>),
                where four short overlapping regions were shown to bind in different conformations
                representing all three secondary structure classes, indicates that such restriction
                can be a serious disadvantage for recognizing some extremely adaptable disordered
                binding motifs.</p>
            <p>An alternative approach for binding site identification is based on the observation
                that protein-protein interactions are often mediated through short linear motifs
                (approximately three to eight residues) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Neduva1">[77]</xref>. Such motifs are
                defined by a consensus pattern, which captures the key residues involved in function
                or binding. Prominent examples include the nuclear receptor box motif, MDM2 binding
                sites, SH2/SH3 domain recognition patterns or 14-3-3 domain binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Puntervoll1">[68]</xref>.
                Although there are known examples of motifs that reside within globular domains,
                many of them are required to be in a disordered region to function properly and it
                was suggested that such motifs share many similarities with disordered binding
                regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Fuxreiter3">[70]</xref>. Our preliminary results support previous
                observations of the partial overlap between short linear motifs and disordered
                binding segments. Nevertheless, short disordered binding sites and sequence specific
                linear motifs capture different aspects of certain binding regions. Linear motifs
                are defined on the basis of a per residue binding strength, and they are specific to
                a certain partner or to a group of partner molecules. However, such short linear
                motifs can also occur purely by chance, with no biological significance. Also,
                sequence patterns alone cannot ensure the accessibility of the site and the
                potential flexibility of the binding region that could be necessary for the complex
                formation. Complementary to sequence motifs, ANCHOR aims to capture a broader
                structural context. Based on their specific structural properties, it can recognize
                disordered binding regions that are capable of undergoing disorder-to-order
                transition. The predictions are made without taking into account the partner
                molecules and are expected to be less sensitive to sequence details. For certain
                motifs, this molecular environment can be a prerequisite of functionality and could
                help to identify biologically significant binding motifs.</p>
            <p>In our work we assumed, that short binding regions undergoing disorder-to-order
                transition can be viewed as elementary binding units that are necessary for the
                molecular recognition. Therefore, such examples were used for the optimization of
                our method. In accordance with their elementary unit picture, ANCHOR recognized them
                generally as a single continuous binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000376-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Regions undergoing disorder-to-order
                transition, however, are not limited to such short segments as there are several
                examples of longer disordered segment becoming ordered upon complex formation. Such
                segments can be as long as 100 residues. However, these longer regions can contain
                segments which bind only weakly or might not become ordered at all <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Galea2">[63]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Kiss1">[78]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Hurley1">[79]</xref>. This
                segmentation of longer binding regions can occur for structural reasons. The
                segmentation can prevent the accumulation of the critical amount of residues that
                would lead to the formation a collapsed structure or non-specific aggregates. The
                possible functional advantages of the segmented nature of a binding site were
                demonstrated for the well characterized example of p27. The kinase inhibitory domain
                of p27 can be divided into several subdomains which dock and fold in a stepwise
                manner on the surface of the Cdk2-cyclin A complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Lacy1">[19]</xref>. These segments can also
                evolve independently, increasing the repertoire for specificity for different
                cellular location or species. Intervening segments of higher flexibility are
                accessible for modifications such as phosphorylations and ubiquitinations. This way
                p27 can integrate and process various signals to regulate cell proliferation, in
                which the flexibility and modularity of p27 is essential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Galea2">[63]</xref>. The segmented nature of
                binding is reflected in the prediction output, with predicted binding sites
                corresponding to the strongly interacting regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000376-g006">Figure 6</xref> for p27, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000376.s011">Figure S4</xref> for a
                similar example, calpastatin). In the dataset of longer disordered binding segments,
                we found this segmentation to be quite general. In these cases, the predicted sites
                generally give only partial coverage of the PDB structure, and multiple binding
                sites are predicted in the majority of cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000376-g005">Figure 5</xref>). This suggests that our prediction
                method is likely to find those sites that interact more strongly, anchoring the
                disordered segments to their partner protein. While the segmented nature of binding
                is prominent in the case of long binding regions, to a smaller extent, it can also
                affect shorter binding regions. Indeed, around 20% of short disordered
                binding regions are predicted as 2 or 3 segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000376-g005">Figure 5</xref>). This could also account for the
                significantly lower per residue efficiency compared to the segment based efficiency.</p>
            <p>By looking at further individual examples, one can already see remarkable variations
                in the details of disorder-to-order transitions even within the limited collection
                that is available today. The adopted conformation in these complexes can be quite
                different, both in terms of secondary or tertiary structure. Furthermore, the
                transition to an ordered structure might not be complete <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Tompa3">[28]</xref>. This could leave
                terminal residues or linker regions flexible and inaccessible to structure
                determination. It was also suggested that specific binding can be possible even
                without adopting a well-defined conformation as in the case of the ζ-chain
                of T-cell receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Sigalov1">[80]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000376.s013">Figure S6</xref>). Differences are also present at the
                level of the sequence. Some binding regions rely largely on hydrophobic or aromatic
                residues (MDM2 binding regions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000376-g001">Figure
                    1</xref>), others use proline rich regions (WASp SH3 binding regions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000376-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Disordered binding
                regions can contain conserved linear motifs, while large divergence in sequence was
                noted in other cases (C terminal domain of histones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Hansen1">[81]</xref>). These examples
                represent multiple ways disordered regions can be utilized for binding. A single
                protein sequence can contain several distinct binding regions, however, a single
                region can be involved in binding to multiple partners, or use these regions in
                combination to hub several interactions (p53 – see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000376-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000376.s009">Figure S2</xref>, WASp
                – see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000376-g007">Figure 7</xref>). In an
                alternative scenario, disorder present in the partner molecules allows to bind a
                well-folded protein by a large number of proteins (β-catenin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Sampietro1">[82]</xref>,
                    <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000376.s010">Figure
                S3</xref>). Even further variations are expected as the number of examples will grow
                in the future. Nevertheless, the success of ANCHOR confirms our hypothesis, that
                despite these differences disordered binding regions have a common property that
                predispose them for coupled folding and binding.</p>
            <p>The occurrence of disordered binding sites is clearly tied to the presence of
                disordered protein regions. Their relationship was further analyzed at the level of
                complete proteomes. Previous studies have shown that the amount of predicted
                disordered regions increases with the complexity of organisms throughout evolution
                and reaches a high level in multicellular organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Dunker2">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Ward1">[6]</xref>. This increase can be
                mostly attributed to the appearance of long, domain-sized segments of protein
                disorder or fully disordered proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000376-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). Our analysis showed that the amount of disordered binding
                segments increases in eukaryotes in a similar way, however, their fraction is
                elevated even compared to disordered regions in general (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000376-g008">Figure 8</xref>). The observed trend is valid through a
                wide range of organisms, and occasional exceptions occur either due to adaptation to
                extreme habitat conditions, or as a result of endosymbiosis. These findings imply
                that the newly introduced disordered proteins and protein segments mainly serve as a
                carrier for new binding regions in eukaryotic organisms. The importance of
                disordered regions in protein-protein interactions is also supported by the
                increased ratio of disordered proteins among hub proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Dosztanyi1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Haynes1">[31]</xref>.
                Disordered segments are often involved for complex signaling and regulatory
                processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Uversky2">[20]</xref> such as cell cycle control, gene regulation or signal
                transduction in the intracellular region of transmembrane proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-DeBiasio1">[83]</xref>.
                These processes rely on interactions involving multiple partners and high
                specificity/low affinity interactions, that disordered binding segments can provide
                by their very nature. The disordered segments can harbor multiple binding sites
                which can act relatively independently. In other cases segmented binding sites can
                be involved in simultaneous binding to larger complexes. Overlapping binding sites
                (such in the case of p53 N and C terminal regions) suggest competition between
                binding partners. We are only beginning to comprehend how disordered binding regions
                are exploited to provide versatile interaction sites in proteins.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, disordered binding regions represent a specific subclass of disordered
                proteins that can undergo a disorder-to-order transition upon binding. These binding
                sites generally have distinct properties both structurally and functionally. Due to
                the inherent flexibility, these regions are difficult to study experimentally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Dosztanyi4">[84]</xref>,
                making specific prediction methods even more valuable. While there are several
                methods available for prediction of disordered regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Dosztanyi5">[85]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Ferron1">[86]</xref>,
                recognizing disordered binding sites was regarded as a more challenging problem
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Galea1">[9]</xref> due
                to the limited number of well-characterized examples. In this work we report a
                general method to recognize disordered binding sites based on a basic biophysical
                model. Our method relies on a simple energy estimation procedure that was developed
                earlier for the IUPred disorder prediction method. This way, the problem of small
                datasets can be largely avoided. We showed that these regions can be characterized
                by highly disordered sequential neighborhood, unfavorable intrachain energies and
                more favorable interaction energies with a globular partner. The combination of
                these properties allowed the recognition of disordered binding sites independent of
                their secondary structure or amino acid composition, underlining the generality of
                the method. As such binding sites are essential functional elements of disordered
                proteins, their prediction directly provides information about functionally
                important residues in these proteins. In this way, ANCHOR broadens the repertoire of
                prediction methods for functional sites in proteins aiming to decrease the large
                number of unannotated sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Rost1">[87]</xref>. Generally, the complete understanding of
                protein-protein interactions involving disordered binding sites requires the
                knowledge of their partners as well as possible post-translational modifications
                that can influence their binding. While predictions can be made even without taking
                the partner molecule into account, certain cases might require incorporating the
                specific feature of the partner. Nevertheless, our method can provide the starting
                point for such scientific explorations, by finding potential regions involved in
                such binding.</p>

                    requirement of the experimental verification of both the disordered status in
                    isolation and the formation of an ordered structure in complex distinguishes our
                    dataset from a previously collected dataset for disordered binding regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000376-Mohan1">[88]</xref>. The
                    length of disordered regions involved in the binding can vary on a large scale.
                    In the case of longer regions it is not guaranteed that each residue is equally
                    important for binding, therefore complexes of short disordered regions were
                    treated separately, and only these were used for tuning the method.</p>

                <p>The optimal parameters were determined by a three fold cross-validation, by
                    dividing both our negative and positive datasets (Globular proteins and Short
                    disordered complexes, respectively) into three parts. In each turn we used two
                    parts for training and the remaining part for testing. To avoid any bias, the
                    different subsets were chosen such that the distribution of chain lengths in
                    both the positive and negative sets and the distribution of secondary structure
                    types in the positive set were approximately the same. Our approach relies on
                    IUPred, a general disorder prediction method, and its energy predictor matrix.
                    These parameters (ie. the elements of the energy predictor matrix) have been

                <p>To quantify the performance of the predictor given a set of parameters we

                    5% calculated on globular proteins as the negative set. However, a
                    full characterization of the performance of the algorithm would also require a
                    set of disordered proteins that are known <italic>not</italic> to bind to
                    globular proteins. Unfortunately, such dataset cannot be constructed since there
                    is hardly any way to give evidence for a protein that it does not contain
                    binding sites. This problem was addressed by calculating the fraction of amino
                    acids that are predicted as binding sites in general disordered regions of

                    fraction was denoted as <italic>F</italic>. Optimal parameters should combine
                    high TPR with low <italic>F</italic> at the expense of very low FPR.</p>
                <p>During optimization of the algorithm, the performance on three different datasets
                    needed to be monitored at the same time (set of globular proteins, set of
                    disordered binding sites and Disprot). The best parameter set was chosen
                    manually, by reducing the parameter set in a step-wise manner based on the
                    following steps:</p>
                <p>1, Calculate TPR (at fixed FPR = 5%)
                    and F for each of the 144,000 candidate sets of parameters</p>
                <p>2, Discard all for which F&gt;50%</p>
                <p>3, Discard all for which TPR&lt;60%</p>
                <p>4, From the remainder choose the 20 for which the difference between TPR and F is
                    the largest</p>
                <p>5, Choose the one for which TPR is maximal (the TPR-F difference among these 20
                    sets vary only within a range of less then 0.02 so that is not a good measure to
                    choose the best one)</p>
                <p>The negative and positive sets were divided into three parts, resulting in three
                    different optimal parameter sets. The final predictor algorithm is constructed
                    by averaging these three outputs. As the training sets only contained binding
                    regions of at least 10 amino acids and we aim to identify at least 5 residues of
                    each region, all predicted binding sites were removed that did not exceed 5
                    consecutive residues. A schematic figure of the training procedure is given in

                    <p>Development of ANCHOR. In the first step, our Short Disordered Binding Sites
                        dataset and Globular Proteins dataset (positive and negative datasets) are
                        split up and only 2/3 is used in the subsequential steps. Then a parameter
                        set (w1, w2, p1, p2, p3) is selected from the 144,000 random ones. This
                        parameter set is used to calculate S, Eint and Egain for every position in
                        every sequence in the three input datasets using the fixed energy predictor
                        matrix P (see Theory). Based on this calculations the evaluating measures
                        are calculated: TPR is calculated on Short Disordered Binding Sites, FPR is
                        calculated on Globular Proteins and F is calculated on Disordered Proteins.
                        Based on these measures, the best parameter set out of 144,000 is chosen
                        (see Data and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Then this
                        parameter set is evaluated on the remaining one third of the datasets. These
                        results are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000376-t003">Table
                            3</xref>. This procedure is repeated for all three subsets of Short
                        Disordered Binding Sites and Globular Proteins. The output of the three
                        optimized predictors are combined into one final predictor by averaging
                        their output.</p>
