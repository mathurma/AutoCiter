      <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001042-g001"/>In the human brain, the inferior
                temporal cortex contains areas that seem to respond selectively to particular types
                of visual stimuli, such as faces or animals. One such region—the
                parahippocampal place area, or PPA—responds most strongly to images of places
                instead of faces, but how this higher-order selectivity is achieved remains unclear.
                In a new study in <italic>PLoS Biology</italic>, Rajimehr et al. identify a specific
                response property of the PPA that might underlie its selectivity for place images.
                The PPA, the authors show, responds preferentially to images with high spatial
                frequencies—that is, with a high number of contrasting elements within a given
                space on the retina—corresponding to the type of details one might see in
                natural scenes.</p>
      <p>The authors used functional MRI to investigate how images of simple three-dimensional
                shapes evoked activity in different parts of the visual cortex in humans.
                Unexpectedly, they found that the PPA responded much more strongly to a cube than a
                sphere, despite the fact that neither represented a “place” of any kind.
                The two images were carefully matched for many visual properties, but one property
                that differed was the presence of the edges and corners in the image of the cube.
                Images can be characterized by whether they contain mainly low, medium, or high
                spatial frequencies; the cube image contains more high spatial frequencies than the
                sphere.</p>
      <p>To investigate whether the presence of high spatial frequencies was indeed
                responsible for the difference in the way the PPA responded to the cube and the
                sphere, the authors used even simpler visual stimuli—flickering checkerboard
                patterns—and found that these also caused selective activation of the
                PPA—but only when they contained high spatial frequencies. Next, the authors
                used spatial filters to alter standard images of faces and places so that they
                contained only low, medium, or high spatial frequencies, and tested the ability of
                these filtered images to activate the PPA.</p>
      <p>The results showed that the PPA responded strongly to images containing high spatial
                frequencies, whether they showed faces or places. Notably, even though faces do not
                normally activate the PPA, images of faces from which low and medium spatial
                frequencies had been removed (leaving only high spatial frequencies) activated the
                PPA as strongly as did place images.</p>
      <p>It is worth noting that the PPA is defined not anatomically, but functionally, by
                comparing responses to natural images of faces and places in the inferior temporal
                cortex. Using their new data, Rajimehr et al. show that the topography of the PPA
                localized in this traditional way was mirrored by the area that showed a bias for
                high spatial frequencies.</p>
      <p>Next, the authors carried out similar studies in macaque monkeys. Although the
                inferior temporal cortex of macaques shares many functional features with that of
                humans, a place-selective homolog of the PPA has not been discovered in the macaque
                brain. Rajimehr et al. used the same stimuli that they used in the human studies to
                show that macaque inferior temporal cortex does contain a place-selective area
                homologous to the human PPA. This region also showed the same selectivity for high
                spatial frequencies as the human PPA, revealing an important parallel between the
                organization of the human and monkey cortex.</p>
      <p>Images of places or natural scenes typically contain spatial discontinuities and high
                spatial frequencies, often in the form of the edges of buildings or tree trunks.
                Thus it follows that the PPA's preference for high spatial frequencies might
                contribute to its robust response to place images. The authors point out that
                further research would benefit from quantitative comparisons between responses to
                place images and those to images containing different spatial frequency
                distributions, in addition to the qualitative comparisons carried out in this study.
                However, such experiments will require researchers to develop a way to quantify the
                “placeness” of an image. Future research will likely take advantage of
                the demonstration that macaque brains contain a PPA homolog by carrying out
                electrophysiological studies that would be impossible in humans. Such studies may
                help identify the neural mechanisms underlying place selectivity in the human brain
                and perhaps even shed light on the precursors of place recognition in our primate
                cousins.</p>
