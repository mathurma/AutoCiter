        <p>In the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary, the ecdysone signaling pathway controls the differentiation of both niche and germ line stem cell precursors.</p>
      </abstract><abstract>
        <p>Stem cells and their niches constitute units that act cooperatively to achieve adult body homeostasis. How such units form and whether stem cell and niche precursors might be coordinated already during organogenesis are unknown. In fruit flies, primordial germ cells (PGCs), the precursors of germ line stem cells (GSCs), and somatic niche precursors develop within the larval ovary. Together they form the 16–20 GSC units of the adult ovary. We show that ecdysone receptors are required to coordinate the development of niche and GSC precursors. At early third instar, ecdysone receptors repress precocious differentiation of both niches and PGCs. Early repression is required for correct morphogenesis of the ovary and for protecting future GSCs from differentiation. At mid-third instar, ecdysone signaling is required for niche formation. Finally, and concurrent with the initiation of wandering behavior, ecdysone signaling initiates PGC differentiation by allowing the expression of the differentiation gene <italic>bag of marbles</italic> in PGCs that are not protected by the newly formed niches. All the ovarian functions of ecdysone receptors are mediated through early repression, and late activation, of the ecdysone target gene <italic>broad</italic>. These results show that, similar to mammals, a brain-gland-gonad axis controls the initiation of oogenesis in insects. They further exemplify how a physiological cue coordinates the formation of a stem cell unit within an organ: it is required for niche establishment and to ensure that precursor cells to adult stem cells remain undifferentiated until the niches can accommodate them. Similar principles might govern the formation of additional stem cell units during organogenesis.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Tissue-specific stem cells reside in specialized microenvironments (niches). How the generation of niche cells and resident stem cells is coordinated, and how their correct numerical ratios are regulated, remains poorly understood. Here, we examine the potential mechanisms of this process by analyzing the formation of the fly ovary. Specifically, we uncover a role for ecdysone, which is a steroid hormone renowned for its role in insect molting but that also controls many aspects of larval development in flies and mammals. We find that ecdysone signaling in fly larvae coordinates the development of niche cells relative to their resident germ line stem cells (GSCs). Ecdysone receptors initially serve as repressors of differentiation, allowing precursor cells of both niches and GSCs time to proliferate and attain correct cell numbers. Later, ecdysone receptors allow differentiation of niches while simultaneously maintaining GSC precursors in an undifferentiated state, until the newly formed niches can accommodate them. Finally, ecdysone induces the differentiation of GSC precursors that are not incorporated in niches. Our work exemplifies one possible solution to coordinating stem cell and niche development: using a common signal to affect both cell types. A further understanding of these and other mechanisms will offer novel insights into regeneration and could help guide cell-based therapies for various diseases.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Stem cells and their niches constitute functional units that underlie adult organ homeostasis and regeneration following injury or disease. Despite their great medical importance, little is known about how stem cell units, which originate from precursor cells, form during development. Understanding the relations between stem cell precursors and niche precursors and uncovering the molecular pathways that govern the behavior of these populations are likely to enhance our potential to use stem cells in cell-based therapies. Here we use the developing ovary of the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> as a model to investigate how the formation of niches is coordinated with the development of their resident stem cells.</p>
      <p>The Drosophila ovary has been an influential model for understanding the interactions between stem cells and their niches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Fuller1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Kirilly1">[2]</xref>. Each fly ovary contains 16–20 units called ovarioles. At the anterior of each ovariole lies a niche, which is composed of Terminal Filament (TF) and Cap cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g001">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Niche cells produce the ligand Decapentaplegic (Dpp, a BMP2/4 homologue), which acts as a maintenance factor to 2–3 Germ Line Stem Cells (GSCs) that are attached to the cap cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Xie1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Xie2">[4]</xref>. Dpp signaling within GSCs is required to repress the major differentiation gene <italic>bag of marbles</italic> (<italic>bam</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Chen1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Song1">[6]</xref>. When GSCs divide, one daughter cell remains at the niche as a GSC. The second daughter, called a cystoblast, is removed from the niche and initiates the differentiation program by up-regulating <italic>bam</italic>. Germ cell differentiation can be followed by the expression of <italic>bamP</italic>-GFP, a GFP reporter construct that recapitulates Bam expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Chen2">[7]</xref>. The cystoblast divides four incomplete divisions to form a 2-, 4-, 8-, and finally a 16-cell cyst. Cyst divisions are coordinated by the fusome, an intracellular organelle that is round in GSCs and extended or branched in germ line cysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g001">Figure 1A,B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-deCuevas1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Lin1">[9]</xref>.</p>

          <p>(A) An illustration of an adult germarium. Niche cells (Terminal Filament, TF, and Cap cells) are at the anterior (magenta). Attached to cap cells are the Germ Line Stem Cells (GSCs, blue). GSC progeny (Cystoblast, Cb; and cysts, green) are posterior to GSCs. GSCs and Cbs carry a round fusome (yellow), while germ line cysts carry a branched fusome. Germ cells are also contacted by somatic Escort Cells (ECs, purple). (B) Adult germarium. TF and cap cells (barbed arrowheads) are marked by <italic>hedgehog-lacZ</italic> (anti β-Galactosidase, red). GSCs (outlined) are attached to cap cells. Fusomes within GSCs are labeled by monoclonal antibody 1B1 (magenta) and are round (arrows). Posterior to GSCs, differentiating germ cells are expressing <italic>bamP</italic>-GFP (green). Fusomes within germ line cysts are extended or branched (arrowheads). (C) An illustration of a larval ovary at mid-3<sup>rd</sup> instar (ML3). TF cells (magenta) are only beginning to form. Primordial germ cells (PGCs, green) are more posterior. Intermingled Cells (ICs, purple) are associated with PGCs. (D) An ML3 ovary. Terminal filament cells are labeled by anti-Engrailed (En, magenta). Few En expressing cells are present in very short filaments (arrows). Differentiating PGCs are labeled by <italic>bamP</italic>-GFP (anti-GFP, green). PGCs have not yet differentiated, and cannot be recognized by anti-GFP; their location is indicated by white circles. (E) An illustration of a late 3<sup>rd</sup> (LL3) ovary. Somatic niches (TF, Cap cells, magenta) are marked. GSCs (blue) are established close to TF and Cap cells. Away from niches, PGCs initiate differentiation and some have turned to cystoblasts (dark green). (F) An LL3 ovary. TF stacks and cap cells, marked by anti-En (magenta, arrows), are formed throughout the anterior of the ovary. Many PGCs that are not close to the niches are expressing <italic>bamP</italic>-GFP (anti-GFP, green). PGCs that become GSCs are close to niches. They do not express <italic>bamP</italic>-GFP and their location is indicated by white circles. (G–J) LL3 ovaries, all labeled by 1B1 antibody to outline somatic cells and fusomes within PGCs (magenta). (G) The somatic driver <italic>tj</italic>-Gal4 drives GFP expression (anti-GFP, green) in somatic cells, but not in PGCs (some PGCs are outlined, inset). PGCs in wild-type LL3 ovaries carry round fusomes (inset, arrowheads). (H–J) PGCs are labeled by anti-Vasa (green). Somatic expression of Eip75B (H) or RNAi construct against <italic>usp</italic> (I) or RNAi construct against <italic>EcR</italic> (J) results in formation of multiple cysts harboring branched fusomes (arrowheads, insets).

      <p>While much is known about how the GSC unit functions in the adult, how niche precursors and GSC precursors are controlled prior to the formation of the adult GSC unit is less clear. At early larval stages, both gonadal somatic cells (the precursors of niche cells) and Primordial Germ Cells (PGCs, the precursors of GSCs) proliferate. Somatic proliferation at this stage is required to allow correct morphogenesis of 16–20 niches, while PGC proliferation is required to generate sufficient GSC precursors that could occupy the forming niches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Gilboa1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>At mid third larval instar (ML3), TF differentiation initiates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g001">Figure 1C,D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Godt1">[11]</xref>. TF specification continues throughout the late larval period, and by the late third larval instar (LL3), 16–20 TF stacks have formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g001">Figure 1E,F</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Godt1">[11]</xref>. Cap cells form at the base of TF stacks at LL3. Once TF and Cap cells form, PGCs can attach to them via E-Cadherin, to become the adult GSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Song2">[12]</xref>. Excess PGCs that are not attached to Cap cells are not maintained, and differentiate to form the first germ line cysts and egg chambers of the female <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Zhu1">[13]</xref>. While differentiating PGCs express <italic>bam</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g001">Figure 1F</xref>), their fusomes are still round (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g001">Figure 1G</xref>, arrowheads), indicating that they have not divided to form cysts yet.</p>
      <p>To maintain PGC proliferation throughout larval development, their premature differentiation is actively repressed. Many of the repressors of PGC differentiation are later required for GSC maintenance; the translational repressors Nanos and Pumilio act in a cell-autonomous manner to repress both PGC and GSC differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Forbes1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Wang1">[16]</xref>. In addition, the somatic cells of the ovary express Dpp. Similar to GSCs, Dpp signaling within PGCs is required for their maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Zhu1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Gilboa2">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Kai1">[17]</xref>. Whether some aspects of PGC maintenance are unique to the precursor cells has not been established. In addition, since both niche and GSC precursors pass through an initial proliferation stage, followed by differentiation, it is unclear whether, or how, those two stages are coordinated between the two populations of cells. Such coordination is required for correct ratios of niches and GSCs, as well as for the correct maintenance of GSCs and their precursors.</p>
      <p>In a screen that was designed to find novel regulators of niche and PGC development, we found that target genes of the ecdysone pathway affected PGC maintenance. Ecdysone is a steroid hormone that controls many aspects of larval development, which include temporal control of molting as well as regulating cell fate specification and organ morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-KingJones1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Riddiford1">[19]</xref>. Ecdysone production in the prothoracic gland is regulated by the brain-derived neuropeptide Prothoracicotropic Hormone (PTTH) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Rewitz1">[20]</xref>. This brain-gland connection is reminiscent of the Hypothalamus-Pituitary link in mammals, which is connected to the gonad in a Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Gonadal (HPG) axis. The HPG axis and hormonal regulation play a major role in the initiation of adult reproduction in mammals. No role for the steroid hormone ecdysone has been suggested in the initiation of oogenesis in flies. However, recent reports demonstrated that ecdysone signaling is required cell autonomously within adult GSCs for their maintenance and non-cell-autonomously within Escort Cells (the somatic cells that contact early germ line cysts, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) for correct differentiation of adult GSC daughter cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Ables1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Konig1">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We demonstrate that in the fly, a brain-gland-gonad axis exists, and that ecdysone receptors regulate GSC and niche formation. In the first, proliferative, stage of gonadogenesis, ecdysone receptors are required to repress precocious PGC and niche precursor cell differentiation. Later, ecdysone signaling is required for niche differentiation. Finally somatic ecdysone signaling is required to initiate fly oogenesis in a non-autonomous manner. Combined, ecdysone receptors orchestrate the entire sequence of the formation of the GSC unit in the ovary. Other stem cell units might similarly be organized during development.</p>

        <title>Repression of Precocious Ovarian Development by Ecdysone Receptors</title>
        <p>To uncover molecular events that underlie niche formation, PGC maintenance, or their coordination, we performed an over-expression screen in larval ovaries (Supporting Information). The driver line <italic>traffic jam</italic>-Gal4 (<italic>tj</italic>-Gal4), which is expressed in the somatic cells of the ovary, but not in PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g001">Figure 1G</xref>), was used to generate non-autonomous effects in PGCs. Such effects require large populations of affected somatic cells and might have been undetected by clonal analysis screens.</p>
        <p>Over-expression of two nuclear hormone receptors, Eip75B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g001">Figure 1H</xref>) and to a lesser extent Ftz-f1 (unpublished data), in the somatic cells of the ovary resulted in precocious PGC differentiation. In contrast to wild-type ovaries, which contain spherical fusomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g001">Figure 1G</xref>, arrowheads), LL3 ovaries over-expressing Eip75B contained branched fusomes, indicating that PGCs differentiated precociously into germ line cysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g001">Figure 1H</xref>, arrowheads). Eip75B and Ftz-f1 are target genes in the ecdysone response cascade, which times various events throughout embryonic, larval, and pupal life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-KingJones1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Riddiford1">[19]</xref>. This cascade initiates when the hormone ecdysone binds to two nuclear receptors: Ecdysone Receptor (EcR) and Ultraspiracle (Usp). Following activation of the EcR/Usp heterodimer, a gene expression program is initiated. Many of the central target genes of this cascade (including <italic>ftz-F1</italic>, <italic>Eip75B</italic> and <italic>broad</italic>) encode transcription factors or nuclear receptors and are common to many tissues. The tissue-specific targets of this signaling pathway are not well characterized.</p>
        <p>To test whether precocious PGC differentiation resulted from a change in ecdysone signaling, RNAi constructs against EcR or Usp were expressed using <italic>tj</italic>-Gal4. The ovary-specific expression (henceforth termed “somatic expression”) did not change the timing of the various molting stages, pupation, and hatching. However, extensive differentiation of PGCs was observed in gonads of <italic>EcR</italic> or <italic>usp</italic> RNAi animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g001">Figure 1I,J</xref>, arrowheads). While only 2% of control <italic>tj</italic>&gt;lacZ ovaries contained branched fusomes (<italic>N</italic> = 37), 100% of either <italic>tj</italic>&gt;<italic>EcR</italic> or <italic>usp</italic> RNAi ovaries harbored germ line cysts with branched fusomes (<italic>N</italic> = 77 and <italic>N</italic> = 17, respectively). Somatic expression of different RNAi lines against <italic>EcR</italic> and <italic>usp</italic> all resulted in PGC differentiation (Experimental Procedures).</p>
        <p>Recently, ecdysone signaling was shown to maintain adult GSCs in a cell-autonomous manner. To test whether EcR and Usp or their target genes might repress PGC differentiation cell-autonomously, we removed ecdysone signaling components specifically from PGCs. No precocious PGC differentiation was observed when RNAi constructs against <italic>EcR</italic> and <italic>usp</italic>, or a dominant-negative isoform of EcRA (EcRA.W650A, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Cherbas1">[23]</xref>), were expressed using the germ-line-specific driver <italic>nos</italic>-Gal4. Nor was PGC differentiation observed in PGCs mutant for <italic>usp</italic>, <italic>Eip75B</italic>, <italic>Eip74EF</italic>, or <italic>ftz</italic>-<italic>f1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001202.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Broad-mutant ovaries also lacked germ line cysts (see below). Thus, during larval stages, ecdysone receptors in the somatic cells of the ovary are required non-autonomously to repress precocious PGC differentiation.</p>
        <p>In addition to precocious PGC differentiation, precocious niche differentiation also occurred in <italic>EcR</italic> and <italic>usp</italic> RNAi ovaries. In wild-type ML3 ovaries, only few cells express the TF markers <italic>hedgehog</italic>-LacZ (<italic>hh</italic>-lacZ) and Engrailed (En). These cells are still unorganized, and very few short filaments can be detected at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g002">Figure 2A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001202-t001">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, removal of <italic>EcR</italic> or <italic>usp</italic> from the somatic cells of the ovary by RNAi resulted in more TF cells, which were already organized into filaments by ML3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g002">Figure 2C,D</xref>, arrows, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001202-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

            <p>(A, B) Terminal filaments of wild-type ML3 ovaries are labeled either by <italic>hh</italic>-lacZ (A, green) or anti-En (B, magenta). Few TF cells which are unorganized, or organized into short filaments, can be seen. Germ cells are marked by round fusomes (A, 1B1 antibody, magenta) or by anti-Vasa (B, green). (C, D) In <italic>EcR</italic>-RNAi (C) or <italic>usp</italic>-RNAi (D) ML3 ovaries, more TF cells and more organized filaments can be seen (anti-En, magenta, arrows). Germ cells are labeled by anti-Vasa (green). (E–I) <italic>hh</italic>-lacZ (green) marks all TF and cap cells. (E) In WT LL3 ovaries TF cells are distinguished by <italic>hh</italic>-lacZ staining and oval-shaped nuclei. LaminC (red) is only apparent in older TF cells, at the anterior of each TF stack. Cap cells (arrowheads) are at the posterior base of TF, have rounder nuclei, and do not yet stain with anti-laminC. (F) Anti-Tj (magenta) labels ICs. Cap cells that form at the base of TFs are co-stained with <italic>hh</italic>-LacZ and anti-Tj (inset, arrowheads). (G) <italic>EcR</italic>-RNAi ML3 ovaries. Unlike wild-type, Cap cells appear already at ML3 (arrowheads). (H, I) Somatic cells and fusomes are labeled by 1B1 (magenta). (H) TFs are regularly spaced in the anterior half of the wild-type ovary. (I) In <italic>EcR</italic>-RNAi LL3 ovaries, TFs are mis-positioned, with fewer cells between stacks. Bars in (A), (for A–D), in E (for E, G), and in H (for F, H, I) are 10 µm.</p>

              <p>At ML3, TFs were stained with anti-En, confocal Z-stacks were acquired, and the number of TF stacks in ovaries of each genotype counted. An average of about two short TF stacks could be observed in wild-type ovaries. Precocious activation of the ecdysone signaling cascade either by removal of <italic>EcR</italic> or <italic>usp</italic> by RNAi from the somatic cells of the ovary, or by mis-expression of Br-Z2 and Br-Z3, results in more TF stacks at ML3. Very little change in TF stacks is caused by mis-expression of Br-Z4. ND: In Br-Z1 ovaries we cannot quantify TF stacks, since the anterior of the ovary is mis-organized and individual TF stacks are hard to distinguish. However, more TF cells are observed in Br-Z1 ovaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). At LL3, TF stacks were observed using 1B1 labeling. On average, 17 or 18 TFs are formed in wild type ovaries. When large mutant clones of <italic>Eip75B<sup>07401</sup></italic> or <italic>ftz-f1<sup>03649</sup></italic> are generated using <italic>C587</italic>-Gal4, <italic>UAS</italic>-Flp, less TF stacks form.</p>
            </fn>
          </table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>
        <p>To test whether all aspects of niche formation were precocious, we examined Cap cells, which appear at the larval-pupal transition stage at the posterior base of TFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Song3">[24]</xref>. Cap cells contain nuclei that are rounder than TF nuclei and also stain with <italic>hh</italic>-lacZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, arrowheads). These cells also stain with anti-Tj antibody, which at LL3 stains the Intermingled Cells (ICs, the cells that directly contact PGCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Gilboa1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Li1">[25]</xref>), indicating that cap cells may originate from anterior ICs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g002">Figure 2F</xref>, inset, arrowheads). In <italic>EcR</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g002">Figure 2G</xref>, arrowheads) and <italic>usp</italic> RNAi (unpublished data) ovaries, cells with cap cell morphology, which were labeled by <italic>hh</italic>-LacZ, appeared at the base of precocious TFs already at ML3. Thus, the development of the entire stem cell niche is precocious when either EcR or Usp are removed from the somatic cells of the ovary. Despite the precocious formation of cap cells in EcR and Usp-RNAi ovaries, we could not observe extra cap cells during larval stages, as has recently been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Konig1">[22]</xref>. However, it is possible that increased ecdysone signaling affects cap cell number during pupal or adult stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001202.s002">Figure S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001202.s007">Text S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Precocious niche development resulted in disorganization of the anterior part of the ovary. In the wild type, niches are formed as well organized TF stacks, which are regularly spaced throughout the anterior part of the LL3 ovary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g002">Figure 2H</xref>). In <italic>EcR</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g002">Figure 2I</xref>) or <italic>usp</italic> RNAi ovaries (unpublished data), TF stacks formed, but some stacks were not positioned correctly from anterior to posterior. In addition, less non-TF cells were present between stacks and anterior to them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g002">Figure 2I</xref>). Since TF and cap cells are post-mitotic, we suggest that their precocious differentiation at the expense of the proliferating precursors caused the reduction in anterior size and resulted in morphogenesis defects.</p>
        <p>Despite their spatial disorder, niches had all their cellular components; we therefore tested whether the precocious niches in <italic>EcR</italic> and <italic>usp</italic> RNAi ovaries were functional. Wild type niches secrete Dpp, which results in phosphorylation of Mothers Against Dpp (pMAD, a SMAD homologue) within germ cells that are attached to them. We used immunofluorescence labeling to compare the level of pMAD in PGCs that were close to forming niches in wild type and in <italic>EcR</italic>-RNAi LL3 ovaries. In accord with the normal, albeit early, sequence of niche development, similar levels of pMad were observed in both cases in anterior PGCs that were close to niches (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001202-t002">Table 2</xref>). Indeed, in <italic>EcR</italic> and <italic>usp</italic> RNAi ovaries, precocious PGC differentiation occurred only in posterior PGCs located away from the niches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g001">Figure 1I,J</xref>).</p>

        <p>Taken together, these data show that removing ecdysone receptors from the somatic cells of the ovary leads to precocious differentiation of both niches and PGCs. Forming niches are functional and protect PGCs that attach to them from differentiation. However, the organization of the anterior of the ovary is defective due to precocious precursor differentiation.</p>

        <title>Ecdysone Receptors Are Early Repressors and Late Activators of <italic>broad</italic> Expression</title>
        <p>To understand how ecdysone receptors repress precocious niche formation and PGC differentiation, we examined the expression of ecdysone receptors and of the transcription factor Broad, an important target of the pathway. Antibodies directed against EcR-A weakly stained all somatic nuclei in mid and late third instar. EcR-B1 was detected in all somatic nuclei during third instar. As expected, no EcR staining was observed within PGCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001202.s003">Figure S3</xref>). This finding is in accord with the somatic expression of Usp in larval ovaries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Hodin1">[26]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The <italic>broad</italic> locus encodes four different transcripts: <italic>broad-Z1</italic>, <italic>Z2</italic>, <italic>Z3</italic>, and <italic>Z4</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-DiBello1">[27]</xref>. An antibody directed against the common region of all Broad isoforms exclusively stained somatic cell nuclei. Staining levels increased as ovaries matured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g003">Figure 3A,B,C</xref>). One reason for this increase might be the difference observed in the expression of Broad-Z1. Staining with anti-Br-Z1 revealed that this isoform was not expressed until ML3. At ML3 very faint Br-Z1 staining could be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), and by LL3 it was strongly expressed in all somatic nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). In contrast, Br-Z1 expression was clearly detected already at ML3 in <italic>EcR</italic> or <italic>usp</italic> RNAi ovaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g003">Figure 3F,G</xref>), suggesting that ecdysone receptors repress early expression of Br-Z1.

        <p>Inhibition of Br-Z1 expression by EcR was previously observed in imaginal discs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Schubiger1">[28]</xref>. It was suggested that, in analogy to several mammalian nuclear hormone receptors, EcR and Usp have a dual role: in the absence of ecdysone or when associated with co-repressors, these receptors function as repressors of ecdysone target genes, while in the presence of ecdysone or specific co-activators they promote or have a permissive role in target gene activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Schubiger1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Cherbas2">[30]</xref>. To test this hypothesis, we used a dominant negative isoform of EcR-A, which cannot bind ligand, and serves as a constant repressor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Cherbas1">[23]</xref>. Indeed, Br-Z1 was not expressed, or expressed in very few cells, in LL3 ovaries expressing the dominant negative EcRA.W650A (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g003">Figure 3H to 3E</xref>). These results demonstrate that EcR and Usp act as early repressors of Br-Z1 and that ecdysone signaling is later required for Br-Z1 expression. Anti-Br-C staining was still observed in EcRA.W650A ovaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g003">Figure 3I</xref>), suggesting that Broad Complex is affected by, but not entirely dependent on, ecdysone signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Brennan1">[31]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Ecdysone Signaling and Broad Are Required for Niche Formation and PGC Differentiation</title>
        <p>Our results suggest that at early third instar, EcR/Usp mediated repression of Br-Z1 expression delays niche and PGC differentiation, while at late third instar, activation of the ecdysone pathway may promote these events by allowing Broad-Z1 expression. To test this hypothesis and determine the role of active ecdysone signaling and Broad expression in the ovary, we expressed the dominant negative form of each of the three EcR isoforms in the somatic cells of the ovary. The dominant negative form EcRA.W650A produced the strongest phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001202.s004">Figure S4</xref>).

        <p>The absence of niches in EcRA.W650A ovaries could result from a general developmental arrest, or from a particular problem in niche formation. We therefore tested whether some aspects of gonad morphogenesis did occur properly in EcRA.W650A ovaries. In wild-type ovaries, all somatic cells express the protein Traffic Jam (Tj) until ML3. At this stage the expression of Tj is being limited to ICs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Gilboa1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Li1">[25]</xref>. By LL3, only ICs, which intermingle with germ cells, express Tj at high levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g004">Figure 4E</xref>, arrowheads). In EcRA.W650A LL3 ovaries, we found Tj-positive cells in the vicinity of PGCs. These cells failed to intermingle with germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g004">Figure 4F</xref>, arrowheads). Significantly, the anterior of the ovary was devoid of Tj protein at this stage, indicating that clearance of Tj from the anterior occurred normally. The fact that not all aspects of ovarian maturation were arrested in EcRA.W650A suggests that ecdysone signaling has a more specific role in niche formation. Indeed, mosaic analysis revealed that less TFs formed in ovaries bearing large mutant clones of Eip75B and Ftz-f1, despite an otherwise normal ovarian development (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001202-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Their smaller size prompted us to investigate cell proliferation and cell death in EcRA.W650A ovaries. No cell death above wild-type background could be observed (only 0–4 dying cells are observed in WT, <italic>br</italic>-RNAi, or EcRA.W650A ML3 ovaries; <italic>N</italic> = 30, 26, and 42 ovaries, respectively). However, cell proliferation was significantly reduced in <italic>br</italic>-RNAi and EcRA.W650A ML3 ovaries. In LacZ control ovaries, an average of 17.11 cells were labeled with anti-phospho Histone H3, a mitotic marker (SD = 6.99, <italic>N</italic> = 35). Significantly less cells were in mitosis in EcRA.W650A (average of 8.8 cells, SD = 3.47, <italic>N</italic> = 35, <italic>t</italic> test <italic>p</italic> = 2.53E-8) or <italic>br</italic>-RNAi (average 14.2 cells, SD = 4.12, <italic>N</italic> = 50, <italic>t</italic> test <italic>p</italic> = 0.017).</p>
        <p>To distinguish between a primary requirement for ecdysone signaling in cell proliferation or in cell differentiation, we forced somatic cells of EcRA.W650A ovaries to proliferate by over-expression of the Insulin receptor (InR). Wild-type ovaries over-expressing InR are larger in size, but their niches are normally patterned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g004">Figure 4G</xref>, arrows). In EcRA.W650A ovaries that also expressed InR, ovarian size was similar to that of wild type, indicating that Insulin signaling can overcome the proliferation defect arising from disrupted ecdysone signaling. However, similar to EcRA.W650A, very few TF cells were observed, which were not organized in filaments (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g004">Figure 4H</xref> arrows to 4B and to wild type, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g002">Figure 2H</xref>). Together with the advanced formation of niches in <italic>EcR</italic> and <italic>usp</italic> RNAi ovaries, these results indicate that ecdysone signaling is required for differentiation of somatic niche cells. In addition, ecdysone signaling may also contribute to somatic cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Ninov1">[33]</xref>.</p>
        <p>As expected, <italic>br</italic>-RNAi phenotypes were similar to EcRA.W650A in nature but were weaker. <italic>br</italic> -RNAi ovaries were smaller than wild type and had no TFs, or shorter TFs than wild type (100% of the ovaries, <italic>N</italic> = 25, compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g004">Figure 4I</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g002">Figure 2H</xref>). Similar phenotypes were observed in ovaries from <italic>br<sup>1</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g004">Figure 4J</xref>) or <italic>br<sup>5</sup></italic> (unpublished data) mutant animals, in which Br-Z2 function is removed (100% of ovaries, <italic>N</italic> = 28 for <italic>br<sup>1</sup></italic> and <italic>N</italic> = 35 for <italic>br<sup>5</sup></italic>). Importantly, precocious niche formation and PGC differentiation could not be observed in <italic>EcR</italic> RNAi ovaries that also lacked <italic>broad</italic>. PGCs in such ovaries contained spherical fusomes and TFs were shorter than wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g004">Figure 4K,L</xref>), suggesting that Broad is an essential component in ecdysone-mediated control of ovarian morphogenesis.</p>
        <p>Our results suggest that removal of <italic>broad</italic> leads to retarded ovarian morphogenesis, while its precocious expression in <italic>EcR</italic> or <italic>usp</italic> RNAi ovaries might lead to advanced morphogenesis and to PGC differentiation. To test this directly we over-expressed each of the Broad isoforms in the somatic cells of the ovary. Niche cells were labeled by anti-Engrailed (En) and PGC differentiation was monitored using the reporter <italic>bamP</italic>-GFP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Chen2">[7]</xref>. Over-expression of all Broad isoforms led to precocious <italic>bamP</italic>-GFP expression at ML3 (100% of the ovaries, <italic>N</italic> = 20, 29, 30, and 29 for Br-Z1, Z2, Z3, and Z4, respectively; compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g005">Figure 5A to 5B</xref> for Br-Z1, 5C for Br-Z4.

In wild-type adult germaria, Orb is expressed in 8- and 16-cell cysts.

As expected, anti-Orb staining of wild type LL3 ovaries revealed no Orb labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). However, in Br-Z1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g005">Figure 5F</xref>), Br-Z2, and Br-Z4 (unpublished data) over-expressing ovaries, Orb labeling could clearly be seen. Some cysts already localized Orb into one cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g005">Figure 5F</xref>, arrowheads), indicating that PGC differentiation was advanced and could reach the oocyte determination stage.</p>

        <p>The spatial distribution of pMad labeling was somewhat different in EcRA.W650A ovaries. pMad labeled cells were located mostly next to the few specified TF cells, but some were also detected at the posterior. pMad-positive PGCs were always in contact with somatic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g006">Figure 6C,C′</xref> arrowheads). We assume this difference is due to the fact that ICs, which were shown in the adult to mediate Dpp diffusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Wang2">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Hayashi1">[37]</xref>, do not intermingle with PGCs in EcRA.W650A ovaries.

        <title>Ecdysone Signaling Is Required in Parallel for Niche Formation and PGC Differentiation</title>
        <p>The dual effect of ecdysone signaling on both somatic cells and PGCs raises the question of how these two processes are connected. One option is that ecdysone signaling, through broad, is only required for somatic niche maturation, which then triggers PGC differentiation. Alternatively, ecdysone signaling and Broad might be required first for niche formation and later, independently, for PGC differentiation. Over-expression of Broad-Z4 resulted in precocious PGC differentiation, without affecting niche formation, suggesting a separate role for ecdysone in the maturation of these two cell populations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001202-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>
        <p>To experimentally test whether PGC differentiation depends on an ecdysone-mediated event that is independent of niche formation, we used a temperature-sensitive Gal80 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-McGuire1">[38]</xref> to temporally control the expression of the dominant negative EcRA.W650A. Larvae were raised in a permissive temperature until niche formation had begun, but before PGCs differentiate (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001202.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Following a shift to the restrictive temperature, the state of niche development and PGC differentiation was examined. Under these conditions, TFs and cap cells could be observed in both control and experimental ovaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g007">Figure 7A,B</xref>, arrows). These niches were functional, since PGCs that were attached to them maintained pMAD labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g007">Figure 7A,B</xref>, arrowheads, <italic>N</italic> = 36 and <italic>N</italic> = 25, respectively).

(A, B) PGCs containing pMAD (anti-pMAD, green, arrowheads) can be seen in both control and EcRA.W650A ovaries, close to newly formed cap cells (arrows). (C, D) Differentiating PGCs express <italic>bamP</italic>-GFP (anti-GFP, green).

(D) When ecdysone signaling is blocked by expression of EcRA.W650A after niches form, but prior to PGC differentiation, PGCs fail to differentiate despite normal TF formation. No GFP expression in PGCs is observed. Faint, non-specific, GFP can be observed in a few TF cells in both control and experimental ovaries. (E) Br-Z1 (anti Br-Z1, magenta) is expressed in formed niches of EcRA.W650A temperature-shifted ovaries (arrows), but is not expressed in ICs. Bar in (A) (for A–E) is 10 µm. (F) 0–4 h prior to wandering behavior (in food), most ovaries do not carry differentiating PGCs (light bars), while 0–4 h following the initiation of wandering, most ovaries carry differentiating PGCs (black bars).</p>

        <p>To understand why PGCs failed to differentiate in EcRA.W650A temperature shifted ovaries, we examined Br-Z1 expression. Br-Z1 was expressed in the anterior of these ovaries and in the formed niches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g007">Figure 7E</xref>, arrows, <italic>N</italic> = 31). Anterior expression of Br-Z1 in the temperature shift experiments is expected, since in wild-type LL3 ovaries <italic>tj</italic>-Gal4 expression is weak in these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). Significantly, no Br-Z1 could be observed in ICs, which are located posterior to the niches, and where <italic>tj</italic>-Gal4 is strongly expressed. These results further implicate Br-Z1 expression within ICs, rather than within niches, as required for PGC differentiation at the end of larval development.</p>
        <p>We used the temperature shift approach to further test the temporal requirement of EcR in gonad morphogenesis and found that somatic expression of EcRAW650A only in the adult resulted in normal ovariole morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001202.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Likewise, a defect in ecdysone signaling during larval development could not be corrected by wild type signaling in the adult ovary. Overall, the temperature shift experiments demonstrated an absolute requirement for somatic ecdysone signaling during larval ovarian development. In particular, these experiments demonstrate that ecdysone is required in parallel for niche and PGC differentiation; even when ovarian morphogenesis is normal, and niches do form, an additional ecdysone-mediated event must occur to allow PGC differentiation.</p>

        <title>A Specific Pulse of Ecdysone Is Required for PGC Differentiation</title>
        <p>The temperature shift experiments suggest that PGCs might differentiate in response to a specific ecdysone pulse, occurring after ML3 and prior to pupation. At least one such pulse has been identified in Drosophila <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Warren1">[39]</xref>. To test this idea more directly, we timed wild-type PGC differentiation by analyzing the expression of <italic>bamP</italic>-GFP and found that PGC differentiation coincides with the initiation of wandering behavior. When insect larvae attain a critical body size, an ecdysone pulse triggers distinct behavioral changes that include cessation of feeding and seeking a location for pupation (wandering behavior) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Stern1">[40]</xref>. 0–4 h prior to the initiation of wandering only 21% of the ovaries contained very few differentiating PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g007">Figure 7F</xref>). <italic>bamP</italic>-GFP levels in these differentiating PGCs were very low, indicating very early stages of differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001202.s006">Figure S6</xref>). In contrast, 0–4 h following the initiation of wandering 85% of larval ovaries contained many differentiating PGCs with strong <italic>bamP</italic>-GFP labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g007">Figure 7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001202.s006">Figure S6</xref>). The tight temporal correlation between PGC differentiation and wandering behavior suggests that a specific ecdysone peak is required for PGC differentiation and that hormonal regulation is directly involved in initiating oogenesis in flies.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>When organized niches that contain a defined number of stem cells are established during organ development, the precursors of those niches and stem cells should be coordinated. Such coordination could manifest itself in matching numbers of both populations of cells, and in temporal coordination of proliferation and differentiation. Here we provide evidence that such coordination occurs in the developing fly ovary by ecdysone signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g008">Figure 8</xref>). To our knowledge, this is a first demonstration that niche precursors and stem cell precursors are coordinated, and that a single signaling pathway is responsible for this coordination. The parsimonious manner of controlling an entire stem cell unit could be a general principle in organogenesis. During organ regeneration, niches and stem cells might also communicate to create well-balanced and morphologically correct stem cell units. Finding the signaling pathways that underlie these processes will prove beneficial for the use of stem cells or their derivatives for organ regeneration.</p>

          <title>Coordination of niche formation with GSC establishment by ecdysone.</title>
          <p>At early third instar, ecdysone receptors repress niche formation and PGC differentiation; this allows the gonad time to grow and generate sufficient precursor cells of both cell populations that will eventually form 16–20 stem cell units. Repression of the target gene <italic>broad</italic> is a key component of this repression. At mid-third instar and later, the hormone ecdysone activates Broad-Z1 expression in the somatic cells of the ovary through EcR and Usp. This leads first to formation of niches and, later, concomitant with wandering behavior, to PGC differentiation, by an unknown mechanism. Only PGCs that are located next to niches are protected from differentiation and become the adult GSCs.</p>

        <title>The Temporal Axis of Ovary Formation</title>
        <p>In the forming Drosophila ovary, the ecdysone signaling pathway coordinates somatic niche formation with GSC establishment, leading to the formation of 16–20 stem cell units. The dual function of early repression and late activation of Broad by EcR/Usp allows this pathway to initially repress both niche and stem cell precursors. Later, ecdysone signaling sequentially initiates TF formation and then PGC differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Within the temporal framework, provided by repeated ecdysone pulses, other signaling pathways may participate in determining the specific rate of precursor cell proliferation and their differentiation. Future work will be needed to determine at what level ecdysone signaling controls these pathways. Our results show that somatic ecdysone signaling elicits a secondary signal that integrates on the major axis of GSC maintenance/differentiation. This signal is required to induce Bam expression in PGCs that are located away from the niche and to initiate their differentiation. Whether ecdysone signaling directly affects the major genes required for niche differentiation remains to be seen.</p>
        <p>Ecdysone initiates niche formation at ML3, and PGC differentiation a few hours later. These events do not occur with the earlier peaks of ecdysone, at first and second instar. Gene activation by nuclear hormone receptors is highly context-dependent, and each target gene may require particular co-repressors or co-activators. We hypothesize that the target genes required for the differentiation of niches and PGCs are different, with promoters that require different ligand concentration or different co-activators, which might only be expressed at particular developmental times. Another option (not mutually exclusive) is that the target cells for the two roles of ecdysoene (i.e., niche formation and PGC differentiation) are different; clonal analysis suggests that ecdysone signaling is required within TF precursors for their differentiation, while ICs may control PGC differentiation. Several lines of evidence suggest a parallel role of ecdysone in niche and PGC differentiation. First, over-expression of Broad-Z4 leads to PGC differentiation, without affecting niche formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g005">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001202-t001">Table 1</xref>). Second, our temporal shift experiments demonstrated that niche formation in itself is insufficient to induce PGC differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Lastly, in <italic>EcR</italic> and <italic>usp</italic>-RNAi ovaries, Broad-Z1 is over-expressed mainly in ICs, indicating that this cell population, which is in direct contact with PGCs, is a possible source for a signal inducing PGC differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g003">Figure 3</xref>). What that substance might be is currently under investigation.</p>

        <title>Changing Roles of Ecdysone Signaling in the Ovary</title>
        <p>Activation of the ecdysone signaling pathway in the larva leads to PGC differentiation. In contrast, activation of this pathway in the adult is required to maintain GSCs un-differentiated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Ables1">[21]</xref>. Thus, ecdysone signaling serves opposite functions in the adult and in the larva. We have previously demonstrated that many of the mechanisms that maintain GSCs in the adult are already required to maintain PGCs in the larva <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Gilboa2">[15]</xref>. Ecdysone signaling is therefore a first regulator that exhibits a reversal of function between a developing stem cell unit and a functional one. The distinct consequence of ecdysone signaling in adult and larval ovaries is reflected in the different manner in which the signal is transmitted. In contrast to the larva, the adult function of ecdysone is cell autonomous and does not seem to strongly rely on Broad function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Ables1">[21]</xref>. In addition, somatic ecdysone signaling in the larva is transmitted to PGCs by a signal that integrates downstream of pMad, on the <italic>bam</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g006">Figure 6</xref>), while in the adult ecdysone signaling affects GSCs upstream of pMad <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Ables1">[21]</xref>. In addition to a role within GSCs, ecdysone signaling may be required in Escort cells for correct cyst development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Konig1">[22]</xref>. Thus, the different physiological conditions during larval development and in the adult lead to very different effects on a forming versus an adult stem cell unit.</p>

        <title>An Invertebrate Brain-Gland-Gonad Axis</title>
        <p>One other difference between adult and larval ecdysone signaling is the source of ecdysone that reaches the ovary. In the adult, ecdysone is produced locally by developed egg chambers and is affecting GSCs in a physiological positive feedback loop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Ables1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Buszczak1">[41]</xref>. In the larva, developed egg chambers do not exist. The temporal correlation of PGC differentiation with the peak of ecdysone that leads to wandering behavior demonstrates that larval ovaries, similar to other larval organs, respond to ecdysone that is produced by the prothoracic gland, located near the fly's brain.</p>
        <p>This suggests a similarity to vertebrate development that was hitherto unappreciated. In verterbrates, a hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis initiates and accompanies adult reproductive responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Sower1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-AdkinsRegan1">[43]</xref>. This work shows that in fruit flies, a brain-gland-gonad axis also operates. The anatomical analogy, however, does not fully extend to the molecular messengers that convey the signals. The hypothalamus-pituitary connection can be equated with the fly neurons that release PTTH into the prothoracic gland, and elicit ecdysone production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-McBrayer1">[44]</xref>. Similar to LH and FSH, which are released from the pituitary gland, ecdysone released from the prothoracic glad affects the gonads and is required for the initial differentiation of PGCs (i.e., for the initiation of oogenesis). Later in adult life, akin to steroid hormones produced by the vertebrate gonad, ecdysone is produced by mature egg chambers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Buszczak1">[41]</xref>. It will be of interest to establish whether the testis in Drosophila males also produces ecdysone.</p>

        <title>Nuclear Hormone Receptors in Organogenesis and Regeneration</title>
        <p>Even prior to the initiation of reproduction in mammals, nuclear receptors are involved in gonadogenesis.

Interestingly, Nr5a1 is a mammalian homologue of Ftz-f1, which also has a role in Drosophila gonadogenesis. The physiological role of hormones in niche or stem cell function is not limited to the gonads. Hormones were shown to affect the hematopoietic stem cell niche <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Adams1">[47]</xref>, and the mammalian homologue of EcR promotes neurogenesis in human embryonic stem cell cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Sacchetti1">[48]</xref>. Steroid hormones are also required for the regeneration of the mammary gland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-AsselinLabat1">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001202-Joshi1">[50]</xref>. Similar to our results with ecdysone, the effects of hormones on mammary stem cells are probably indirect, through support cells. Whether the analogy could be extended, and these hormones will prove to affect niche development, remains unanswered. Future work will undoubtedly solve this issue, since understanding how niches and stem cells are coordinated by hormones, or other signals, is crucial for the understanding of regeneration and for applicative approaches in cell-based therapies.</p>

          <p>Developmental delays upon somatic expression of EcRB1 and EcRB2 dominant negative forms. In all panels, anti-Vasa (green) marks germ cells and 1B1 (magenta) outlines fusomes and somatic cells. (A–C) ML3 ovaries. (A) In wild-type ML3 ovaries, initiation of TF formation can be observed by constriction of cells destined to become TFs (arrow). EcRB1.W650A (B) or EcRB2.W650A (C) ML3 ovaries are smaller in size. In addition, no constriction of TF cells can be observed. In wild type, cells that migrate to the posterior of the ovary are at this stage located medially (A, star). This group of cells is smaller in EcRB1.W650A (B) and hard to find in EcRB2.W650A (C). (D–F) LL3 ovaries. (D) In wild type, TFs are fully formed, and so is the posterior of the ovary (star). (E) In EcRB1.W650A, the posterior group is smaller, while in EcRB2.W650A (F), it is still located medially (star). TFs are smaller and fewer in EcRB2.W650A ovaries. Bars in A (for A–C) and in D (for D–F) are 10 µm.</p>

          <p>Temporal requirement for somatic ecdysone signaling. In all panels, germ cells are labeled with anti-Vasa (green). (A–H) 1B1 monoclonal antibody labels somatic cell membranes and fusomes within germ cells (magenta). (A–D) Manipulations were performed using constant expression of <italic>tj</italic>-Gal4 during larval and adult stages (no Gal80<sup>ts</sup> present). (A) In adult EcR-RNAi ovary niches and cyst development are normal. (B) An entire ovary from EcRA.W650A flies. The somatic expression of this dominant negative construct throughout fly development results in small un-differentiated adult ovaries. No individual ovarioles or normal cyst development could be observed. (C) An entire ovary of a Br-RNAi female. Similar to EcRA.W650A, no individual ovarioles and no proper cyst development could be observed. (D) Br-RNAi is epistatic to EcR-RNAi. Removing both EcR and Br-RNAi results in ovarian phenotypes that are similar to removing Br. (E–J) Temperature shift experiments. Constructs were expressed using a <italic>tj</italic>-Gal4; Gal80<sup>ts</sup> driver. (E, F) Flies were raised at 18 degrees until adulthood (allowing normal development of niches). Adult flies were shifted to the restrictive temperature for 6 d (KD-knock down). Normal niches and normal cyst development are observed for both control LacZ (E) and EcRA.W650A (F) ovaries, indicating that somatic EcRA does not affect early cyst development in the adult. (G, H) Flies were raised in the restrictive temperature until the end of larval development. Pupae were then transferred to the permissive temperature. While control LacZ ovaries displayed normal oogenesis (G), defective ovaries and lack of oogenesis were observed in EcRA.W650A ovaries. This indicated that the requirement for somatic ecdysone signaling during larval development is absolute and cannot be rescued by normal EcR function in pupal and adult times. (I, J) TF cells are labeled by anti-En (magenta). Larvae were raised at the permissive temperature for 6 (I) or 7 (J) d. TF cells are just beginning to form (I) and first stacks can be seen (J) at these times. Following transfer to the restrictive temperature TF cells still form for several hours, until the effects of Gal80ts wear out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001202-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p>
