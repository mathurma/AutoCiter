<p>The tissue-specific IFN-λ receptor expression program can be epigenetically remodeled via HDAC inhibition to strengthen anti-viral and anti-tumor activities in the central nervous system.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Type III interferon (IFN-λ) exhibits potent antiviral activity similar to IFN-α/β, but in contrast to the ubiquitous expression of the IFN-α/β receptor, the IFN-λ receptor is restricted to cells of epithelial origin. Despite the importance of IFN-λ in tissue-specific antiviral immunity, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this confined receptor expression remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the histone deacetylase (HDAC) repression machinery mediates transcriptional silencing of the unique IFN-λ receptor subunit (IFNLR1) in a cell-type-specific manner. Importantly, HDAC inhibitors elevate receptor expression and restore sensitivity to IFN-λ in previously nonresponsive cells, thereby enhancing protection against viral pathogens. In addition, blocking HDAC activity renders nonresponsive cell types susceptible to the pro-apoptotic activity of IFN-λ, revealing the combination of HDAC inhibitors and IFN-λ to be a potential antitumor strategy. These results demonstrate that the type III IFN response may be therapeutically harnessed by epigenetic rewiring of the IFN-λ receptor expression program.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Interferons (IFNs) are important cytokines that protect the host from a broad spectrum of pathogens. IFN-λ, the most recently identified IFN, exhibits potent antiviral activity similar to IFN-α/β. In contrast to the ubiquitous presence of the IFN-α/β receptor, however, the expression of the IFN-λ receptor is restricted to epithelial cells and hepatocytes and absent from immune cells and brain cells. The molecular mechanism responsible for this tissue-specific IFN-λ receptor expression has been elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that histone acetylation mediates chromatin relaxation and transcriptional activation of IFN-λ receptor expression in a cell-type-specific manner. When IFN-λ nonresponsive cells—those that don't normally express the IFN-λ receptor—are treated with inhibitors that block histone deacetylase (HDAC) function, these cells express elevated levels of the IFN-λ receptor and gain sensitivity to IFN-λ. Importantly, rewiring the receptor expression program in this manner via use of HDAC inhibitors can protect formerly IFN-λ-insensitive cells, including primary human astrocytes, from both DNA and RNA virus infection. Additionally, treatment with HDAC inhibitors can also render previously nonresponsive cell types susceptible to the antitumor activity of IFN-λ, thereby inducing apoptosis in glioblastoma cells. This work suggests that a combination of small-molecule HDAC inhibitors and IFN-λ could be a potential antiviral and anticancer strategy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Interferons (IFNs) constitute an indispensable part of the innate immune response. Type I IFNs protect against viral infections, whereas type II IFN is essential for host defense against bacterial and parasitic pathogens. More recently, a new class of cytokines collectively known as the type III IFNs has been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001758-Kotenko1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001758-Sheppard1">[2]</xref>. In humans, the type III IFN family consists of IFN-λ1, λ2, and λ3 (encoded by <italic>IFNL1</italic>, <italic>IFNL2</italic>, and <italic>IFNL3</italic>). Similar to type I IFNs, IFN-λs are induced upon virus infection, activate IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, and display broad-spectrum antiviral activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001758-Ank1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001758-Robek1">[5]</xref>. Recent studies have demonstrated a critical role of IFN-λ in protection against viral infection at epithelial and mucosal surfaces including the lung and gut <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001758-Mordstein1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001758-Pott1">[8]</xref>. In addition, single nucleotide polymorphisms in <italic>IFNL3</italic> are strongly associated with viral clearance in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001758-Ge1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001758-Thomas1">[12]</xref>, highlighting the importance of this cytokine family in the intrahepatic immune response. Despite its significance, how IFN-λ activity is regulated remains unresolved.</p>
<p>In contrast to the ubiquitously expressed IFN-α/β receptor, the IFN-λ receptor is composed of the unique α chain (encoded by <italic>IFNLR1</italic>) and the IL-10 receptor β chain (encoded by <italic>IL10RB</italic>), and is restricted to epithelial cells and hepatocytes. We and others have previously reported that IFNLR1 but not IL10RB is differentially expressed in various cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001758-Doyle1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001758-Witte1">[16]</xref>. IFNLR1 mRNA expression is high in the lung, gut, and liver, and low in other tissues including the brain and most immune cell types, consistent with the observation that IFN-λ primarily protects the epithelium but not the central nervous system (CNS) from virus infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001758-Mordstein2">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001758-Sommereyns1">[15]</xref>. Despite the pivotal role of IFN-λ in tissue-specific immune responses, nothing is known about the molecular mechanisms that underlie its distinctive receptor expression pattern.</p>
<p>Here, we demonstrate that IFN-λ receptor expression is mechanistically regulated by coordinated epigenetic modifications and transcription factors (TFs) in a cell-type-specific fashion. Importantly, remodeling of <italic>IFNLR1</italic> promoter chromatin by HDAC inhibition increases accessibility to transcription activators and enhances receptor expression in previously nonresponsive cells, rendering them sensitive to the antiviral and antiproliferative activities of IFN-λ. We present the first case that the type III IFN response can be positively harnessed through epigenetic reprogramming of its receptor expression, thereby contributing to viral clearance and tumor growth suppression.</p>

<title>IFN-λ Receptor Expression Is Inversely Correlated with <italic>IFNLR1</italic> Promoter Methylation</title>
<p>Contrary to the broad expression of IL10RB, IFNLR1 is predominantly expressed in cells of epithelial origin. A high level of IFNLR1 mRNA is found in primary human hepatocytes (PHHs), whereas little is detected in primary human astrocytes and neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001758-Pagliaccetti1">[14]</xref>. We also observed hypersensitivity to IFN-λ in liver hepatocyte-derived cell lines such as Huh7 and HepG2, in contrast to low responsiveness in brain glia-derived cell lines such as U87 and U373 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001758-Pagliaccetti1">[14]</xref>. To determine the mechanism underlying the cell-type-specific expression pattern, we first investigated the role of epigenetic modifications in this process. Cpgplot analysis of the −3000 to +1000 genomic DNA region relative to the putative <italic>IFNLR1</italic> promoter transcription start site (TSS) identified two adjacent CpG islands (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001758.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). In the mammalian genome, DNA methylation occurs on the cytosine residues within CpG dinucleotides via the action of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). CpG islands are frequently subject to methylation for tissue-specific gene regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001758-Jones1">[17]</xref>. Therefore, we examined <italic>IFNLR1</italic> promoter methylation in Huh7 and U87 cells using <italic>McrBC</italic>, an endonuclease that specifically cleaves DNA containing methylcytosine in a GTP-dependent manner. We found that the <italic>IFNLR1</italic> promoter was more methylated in U87 cells than Huh7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001758-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). To further quantitatively characterize the DNA methylation status, we performed bisulfite conversion sequencing. The <italic>IFNLR1</italic> promoter in Huh7 and HepG2 cells exhibited hypomethylation in contrast to hypermethylation at both CpG islands in U87 and U373 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001758-g001">Figure 1B–C</xref>), revealing a strong correlation between the DNA methylation pattern and IFNLR1 expression level. Consistently, we also found low levels of DNA methylation in the <italic>IFNLR1</italic> promoter in PHHs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001758.s001">Figure S1B</xref>–C). We then asked whether the reversal of methylation would enhance IFNLR1 expression. U87 cells were cultured in the presence of 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5azadC), a nucleoside analogue that potently inhibits DNMT activity. Despite significant reduction of DNA methylation in the <italic>IFNLR1</italic> promoter in 5azadC-treated U87 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001758.s001">Figure S1D</xref>–E), there was only a marginal increase in IFNLR1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001758-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting DNA demethylation alone was insufficient to reactivate transcription.</p>

<title>Histone Deacetylases Mediate IFN-λ Receptor Silencing in Nonresponsive Cells</title>
<p>In addition to DNA methylation, histone posttranslational modifications including acetylation and methylation also influence chromatin structure and gene expression. Closed chromatin configuration, characteristic of histone H3 trimethyl lysine 9 (H3K9me3) and lysine 27 (H3K27me3), is linked to transcriptional repression. In contrast, acetylation of histone H3 and H4 is associated with active promoters. Strikingly, revealed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using anti-acetylated H3 (AcH3) or control immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, the histone acetylation levels within the <italic>IFNLR1</italic> promoter were considerably higher in Huh7 than U87 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001758-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). RNA Polymerase II (RNA Pol II), a core component of the transcription complex, was also significantly enriched at the <italic>IFNLR1</italic> promoter in Huh7 cells compared to U87 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001758-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Conversely, enrichment of H3K27me3 was only observed in U87 cells, but not Huh7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001758-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). These data collectively demonstrate that the <italic>IFNLR1</italic> promoter chromatin structure is relaxed in Huh7 cells in contrast to a more condensed state in U87 cells. Another hallmark of constitutive heterochromatin, H3K9me3, was negative in both cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001758.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). Importantly, the <italic>IFNLR1</italic> promoter was also hypoacetylated in primary human astrocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001758.s002">Figure S2B</xref>), which like U87 and U373 cells, displays low levels of IFN-λ receptor expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001758-Pagliaccetti1">[14]</xref>.</p>

IFNLR1 and IL10RB expression was measured by RT-qPCR. In all panels, data represent the mean and SEM of at least three experiments.</p>

<p>Since histone acetylation is controlled by the balance of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and deacetylases (HDACs), we next asked whether blocking HDAC function would reactivate IFN-λ receptor expression in nonresponsive cells. Consistent with a previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001758-Glaser1">[18]</xref>, SAHA and MS-275 increased global H3 acetylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001758.s002">Figure S2C</xref>). IFNLR1 expression was significantly up-regulated in U87 cells when nonspecific HDAC inhibitors such as SAHA, Trichostatin A, and sodium butyrate were used together with 5azadC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001758-g002">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001758.s002">S2D</xref>). Importantly, MS-275, a specific inhibitor of HDAC1, also increased IFN-λ receptor expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001758-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Knockdown of HDAC1 using small interfering RNA (siRNA) further confirmed its role in IFNLR1 silencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001758.s002">Figure S2E</xref>–F). In addition, functional disruption of HDAC2/3 activity by apicidin suggests the involvement for other class I HDACs in the repression machinery as well (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001758.s002">Figure S2D</xref>). In contrast, IFNLR1 expression was not altered by tubacin, which targets HDAC6, or nicotinamide, a pan-inhibitor for class III HDACs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001758-g002">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001758.s002">S2D</xref>). Of note, IFNLR1 expression was also markedly up-regulated in primary astrocytes post-5azadC and -MS-275 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001758-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). IL10RB expression was not affected by any of these treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001758-g002">Figure 2E</xref>), and no increase in IFNLR1 expression was observed in inhibitor-treated Huh7 and A549 cells, both of which have naturally high IFN-λ receptor levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001758.s002">Figure S2G</xref>–H).</p>
<p>To further test whether HDAC-mediated IFNLR1 silencing is a unique mechanism in the brain, we applied inhibitors to a variety of IFN-λ-insensitive cell types. Receptor expression was also up-regulated in Jurkat, BNL, and NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001758.s002">Figure S2I</xref>–K), suggesting a common repressive mechanism that is not tissue- or species-specific. IFNLR1 expression was also markedly increased in primary human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells following the inhibitor treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001758.s002">Figure S2L</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that IFNLR1 expression is epigenetically silenced via HDAC-mediated repression in nonresponsive cell types.</p>

<title>NF-Y, an Activating TF, Differentially Binds to the <italic>IFNLR1</italic> Promoter</title>
<p>To identify the key TFs that regulate IFNLR1 expression, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) using the −500 to −401 region of the <italic>IFNLR1</italic> promoter. Based on bioinformatics prediction, this region was likely to contain binding sites for a number of TFs with important regulatory functions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001758.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). Specific TF binding was observed in the −434 to −401 segment, but not the other areas of this region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001758.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). Further mutagenesis revealed that the TF binding motif was located within the −430∼−421 sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001758.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). <italic>In silico</italic> analysis of the sequence predicts the binding of several candidates including NF-Y and the E2F family proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001758.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). Antibody supershift confirmed a specific interaction of NF-Y but not E2F1 within this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001758-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). NF-Y is a heterotrimeric TF composed of three subunits. While NF-YA interacts with the sequence specific <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CCAAT</named-content> motif, NF-YB and NF-YC directly contact DNA through histone-fold domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001758-Nardini1">[19]</xref>. Each base of the <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CCAAT</named-content> motif is essential for NF-Y binding, with immediate flanking sequences on both ends also being critical <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001758-Kim1">[20]</xref>. NF-YA interaction with the <italic>IFNLR1</italic> promoter was verified by the complete loss of binding following mutation of the <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CCAAT</named-content> binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001758-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). We further validated that NF-YB and NF-YC also interacted with the promoter sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001758.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). In contrast, we did not observe a supershift with another member of the E2F family proteins, E2F4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001758.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). To explore the role of NF-Y in <italic>IFNLR1</italic> transcription, we examined the expression of all three subunits. Surprisingly, none of NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC were discrepantly expressed on both the mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001758.s004">Figure S4C</xref>–D), implying that NF-Y acts through mechanisms other than differential expression. Although the NF-Y binding site is located within CpG island I, the interaction was independent of DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001758.s004">Figure S4B</xref>).</p>

<p>Interestingly, ChIP analysis indicated that NF-Y was preferentially bound to the <italic>IFNLR1</italic> promoter in Huh7 cells but not U87 cells, suggesting it to be an activating TF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001758-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). To test this hypothesis, NF-Y was silenced using a pool of mixed individual siRNAs. Consistent with our prediction, accompanied with reduced NF-YA expression following siRNA transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001758-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), IFN-λ receptor expression in Huh7 cells was significantly down-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001758-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Conversely, NF-YA knockdown did not affect IFNLR1 expression in low-expressing U87 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001758.s004">Figure S4E</xref>–F). In addition to transient depletion, we also generated two stable NF-YA-silenced Huh7 cell lines using lentivirus-delivered short hairpin RNA (shRNA) specifically targeting NF-YA. We verified the specificity of the knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001758-g003">Figure 3E–F</xref>) and found pronounced selective down-regulation of IFNLR1, but not IL10RB or type I/II IFN receptor expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001758-g003">Figure 3G</xref>). In contrast, IFNLR1 expression was not altered in low-expressing U373 cells with stable NF-YA knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001758.s004">Figure S4G</xref>–H). Importantly, transduction of primary hepatocytes with lentivirus delivering NF-YA-specific shRNA resulted in a simultaneous reduction in both NF-YA and IFNLR1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001758-g003">Figure 3H–I</xref>), confirming NF-Y as an activating TF driving IFNLR1 expression in IFN-λ-responsive cells.</p>

<title>Up-Regulated IFN-λ Receptor Expression Restores Sensitivity to IFN-λ and Potentiates Antiviral Activity</title>
<p>To assess the physiological relevance of pharmacologically enhanced receptor expression, we stimulated U87 cells with IFN-λ in the presence or absence of DNMT and HDAC inhibitors, and measured downstream signaling, gene expression, and antiviral activity. IFN-λ signaling was more potently activated in inhibitor-primed U87 cells, revealed by increased STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001758-g004">Figure 4D</xref>) and ISG expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001758-g004">Figures 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001758.s005">S5C</xref>–E). Importantly, we also observed higher levels of phosphorylated STAT1 and elevated MX1 expression in inhibitor-treated astrocytes in response to IFN-λ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001758.s005">Figures S5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001758.s004">4F</xref>), whereas IFN-α induced comparable MX1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001758-g004">Figure 4F</xref>), implying 5azadC and MS-275 did not affect IFN-α/β receptor expression. To determine if increased ISG induction reinforces antiviral activity, U87 cells were cultured with or without inhibitors, exposed to IFN-λ or IFN-β, and infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing GFP. IFN-β completely blocked VSV infection, whereas IFN-λ exclusively protected inhibitor-treated U87 cells from VSV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001758-g005">Figure 5A–B</xref>). Even at the lowest concentration, IFN-λ counteracted the cytopathic effect (CPE) of VSV infection in inhibitor-treated U87 cells, whereas MS-275 alone did not confer protection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001758-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Furthermore, virus titer from infected U87 cells was decreased in the presence of inhibitors and IFN-λ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001758-g005">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>

<p>We next extended our study to primary human astrocytes. Reprogramming the <italic>IFNLR1</italic> promoter sensitized astrocytes to IFN-λ and protected against VSV infection at all MOIs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001758.s006">Figure S6A</xref>–C). We further tested the antiviral activity to herpes simplex virus–1 (HSV-1), a clinically important DNA virus that establishes latent infection in the CNS. Without inhibitors, astrocytes were efficiently infected by HSV-1, even in the presence of IFN-λ, suggesting that chromatin remodeling is required for IFN-λ signaling in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001758-g006">Figure 6A–B</xref>). Notably, we observed less viral gene expression and stronger ISG induction in inhibitor-primed, IFN-λ stimulated astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001758-g006">Figure 6C–E</xref>). We also assessed the efficacy against another neurotropic DNA virus, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV).

These results collectively demonstrate that up-regulated IFNLR1 expression in brain cells by inhibitor treatment sensitizes them to IFN-λ signaling and protects against both DNA and RNA virus infections.</p>

<title>MS-275 and IFN-λ Cooperatively Induce Apoptosis and Suppress Glioblastoma Proliferation</title>
<p>In addition to their antiviral functions, type I IFNs are also recognized for their antiproliferative activity, with IFN-α being used clinically in the treatment of multiple myeloma and metastatic melanoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001758-Belardelli1">[21]</xref>.

However, the potential clinical application of IFN-λ is limited by its restricted receptor distribution. We therefore explored whether IFNLR1 up-regulation by HDAC inhibitors renders cancer cells sensitive to the antitumor properties of IFN-λ. In accordance with our hypothesis, combined treatment of U87 glioblastoma cells with MS-275 and IFN-λ inhibited growth in culture over a 4-d time course, while IFN-λ alone had minimal effects on proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001758-g007">Figure 7A–B</xref>). Of note, the combination did not substantially affect the proliferation of primary astrocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001758.s008">Figure S8A</xref>), likely due to selective effects exerted by MS-275 on rapidly replicating tumor cells. We also employed a three-dimensional spheroid culture system to mimic physiological conditions of tumor growth. Consistently, the combined treatment reduced both the size and number of U87 spheroid formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001758-g007">Figure 7C–E</xref>). WST-1 assay in the 3D culture also revealed reduced glioblastoma proliferation following the combination treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001758-g007">Figure 7F</xref>).</p>

<p>Many factors may contribute to cancer cell growth inhibition, including senescence, cell cycle arrest, dampened survival signaling, or increased apoptosis. Senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity was comparable in all treatment groups, suggesting that the proliferation defect we observed was independent of senescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001758.s008">Figure S8B</xref>–C). Both mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and NF-κB signaling are linked with cell growth and commonly deregulated in cancers, but no disruption in these pathways was detected following treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001758.s008">Figure S8D</xref>). Intriguingly, propidium iodide staining revealed an increase in the sub-G1 cell cycle population, indicative of apoptotic cells, in U87 cells with the combined treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001758-g007">Figure 7G</xref>). Consistently, we found an elevated frequency of Annexin V<sup>+</sup> cells in combined compared to single treatment, further verifying an affirmative role of apoptosis in growth inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001758-g007">Figure 7H</xref>). Stronger activation of the intrinsic cell death pathway, represented by caspases 3 and 9 cleavage, correlated with the increased level of apoptosis with the combined treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001758.s008">Figure S8D</xref>). In addition to U87 glioblastoma, we extended our study to mouse B16 melanoma, a cancer cell type that responds to mouse IFN-λ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001758.s008">Figure S8E</xref>). As expected, either MS-275 or IFN-λ alone led to cell growth inhibition, but the combination again had the greatest effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001758.s008">Figure S8F</xref>). In conclusion, we demonstrate that mechanistically, enhanced receptor expression renders cancer cells susceptible to the pro-apoptotic activity of IFN-λ and thus restricts tumor cell expansion.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A central question to IFN-λ regulation is how the restricted distribution of its receptor is achieved. Here, we dissected the role of epigenetic modifications and TFs in determining the tissue-specificity of IFN-λ receptor expression. We identified HDAC-mediated closed chromatin conformation as the major silencing mechanism of IFNLR1 expression in IFN-λ-insensitive cells. In addition, we demonstrated that the <italic>IFNLR1</italic> promoter is exclusively accessible for the transcription activator NF-Y in IFN-λ-responsive cells. Remarkably, 5azadC and MS-275 up-regulate IFN-λ receptor expression and restore IFN-λ sensitivity in previously nonresponsive cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001758-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Taken together, these findings establish the mechanism underlying the tissue-specific regulation of the IFN-λ response and lay the foundation for the future translational use of the cytokine.</p>

<title>Molecular mechanism of differential IFNLR1 expression.</title>
<p>Epigenetic silencing is the major mechanism that restricts IFNLR1 expression in IFN-λ nonresponsive cell types. In the low-expressing cells (red background), the <italic>IFNLR1</italic> promoter is repressed through DNA hypermethylation, histone hypoacetylation, and loss of affinity for TFs and RNA Polymerase II complexes. In contrast, the <italic>IFNLR1</italic> promoter is associated with DNA hypomethylation, histone acetylation, and binding of activating TF (represented by trimeric NF-Y) and RNA Polymerase II in high-expressing cells (green background). Importantly, sensitivity to IFN-λ can be regained by blocking DNMT and HDAC activities with 5azadC and MS-275, which epigenetically reconfigure the promoter chromatin structure. Gray line, <italic>IFNLR1</italic> promoter DNA; red filled circles, H3K27 trimethylation; green filled circles, histone H3 acetylation; black filled circle, methylated CpG dinucleotides; white filled circle, unmethylated CpG dinucleotides.</p>

<p>The brain is a partially immune privileged site and protected from most virus infections by effective peripheral clearance and multilayer physical barriers. Unfortunately, some neurotropic viruses including α- and β-herpesviruses, represented by HSV-1 and HCMV, can still breach the defense and infect neurons and astrocytes. Using 5azadC and MS-275, which epigenetically rewire the IFNLR1 expression program in primary astrocytes, we demonstrated that the type III IFN response can be remodeled to protect against both DNA and RNA viruses. Notably, MS-275 is capable of penetrating the blood–brain barrier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001758-Simonini1">[25]</xref>, and therefore has the potential to be used clinically in this respect.</p>
<p>Cancer has traditionally been viewed as a disease driven by the accumulation of genetic mutations. Lately, important roles for epigenetic abnormalities in cancer have come to light <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001758-Baylin1">[26]</xref>.

Although these new therapies have proven therapeutic efficacy in a number of malignancies, better approaches are still urgently needed. MS-275 is currently in clinical trials for refractory and relapsed acute leukemia and advanced lymphoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001758-Gojo1">[30]</xref>. Nevertheless, the application of HDAC inhibitors may be limited by the presence of HDAC mutations in certain cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001758-Smith1">[32]</xref>.</p>
<p>The clinical use of IFN-λ has a unique advantage over traditional IFN-α therapy, which is accompanied by toxicity due to the ubiquitously expressed IFN-α/β receptor. In addition to induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by HDAC inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001758-Glozak1">[33]</xref>, IFN-λ exhibits potent pro-apoptotic activity, thereby limiting the proliferation of HDAC inhibitor-resistant tumors. Furthermore, the combination is also superior to IFN-λ alone due to effectiveness in cancers previously insensitive to IFN-λ, including glioblastoma, which is known for its complexity and ability to develop resistance to single agent therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001758-Minniti1">[34]</xref>. This approach will need to be evaluated in a clinically relevant <italic>in vivo</italic> model system, and would be an important area for future study. In conclusion, our study elucidates the molecular mechanisms underlying the tissue specificity of IFN-λ receptor expression and provides a basis for the future development of antiviral and anticancer therapies.</p>

Hot-start PCR was performed using GoTaq polymerase (Promega) at 95°C for 5 min, followed by a first-round amplification using 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 45°C for 40 s, and 72°C for 1 min. The conditions for the second amplification were the same as those for the first round of PCR. The PCR products were electrophoresed in 2% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide. Bands of expected sizes were excised, and the DNA was extracted using a Wizard SV Gel and PCR clean-up system (Promega). The purified DNA was cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega). At least 20 clones were selected for each CpG island per cell type and sequenced by the Keck DNA Sequencing Facility (Yale University).
