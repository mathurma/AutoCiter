				<article-title>Opposing Fat Metabolism Pathways Triggered by a Single Gene</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>Mammalian nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs), such as liver X receptor, farnesoid X receptor, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), precisely control energy metabolism. Consequently, these receptors are important targets for the treatment of metabolic diseases, including diabetes and obesity. A thorough understanding of NHR fat regulatory networks has been limited, however, by a lack of genetically tractable experimental systems. Here we show that deletion of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content> NHR gene <italic>nhr-49</italic> yielded worms with elevated fat content and shortened life span. Employing a quantitative RT-PCR screen, we found that <italic>nhr-49</italic> influenced the expression of 13 genes involved in energy metabolism. Indeed, <italic>nhr-49</italic> served as a key regulator of fat usage, modulating pathways that control the consumption of fat and maintain a normal balance of fatty acid saturation. We found that the two phenotypes of the <italic>nhr-49</italic> knockout were linked to distinct pathways and were separable: The high-fat phenotype was due to reduced expression of enzymes in fatty acid β-oxidation, and the shortened adult life span resulted from impaired expression of a stearoyl-CoA desaturase. Despite its sequence relationship with the mammalian hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 receptor, the biological activities of <italic>nhr-49</italic> were most similar to those of the mammalian PPARs, implying an evolutionarily conserved role for NHRs in modulating fat consumption and composition. Our findings in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> provide novel insights into how NHR regulatory networks are coordinated to govern fat metabolism.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Due to their ability to interact with fatty acids and other lipids, nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs), including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), liver X receptor, and farnesoid X receptor, are important regulators of mammalian fat metabolism; accordingly, these small-molecule-gated transcription factors have been favored targets for therapies designed to combat diabetes, obesity, and atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b02">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b03">3</xref>]. Although the molecular mechanisms employed by NHRs have been intensively probed, their pleiotropic effects on overall animal physiology are only partially understood. Thus, developing a broader range of experimental systems would be useful for characterizing the fat regulatory networks integrated by NHRs and for revealing the breadth of their physiological influence.</p>
      <p>The study of invertebrates, such as <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content>, has facilitated the elucidation and interpretation of biological networks, particularly in the context of the whole animal. However, despite the fact that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> contains 284 NHR genes, compared to only 48 in mammals, there is a notable absence of worm NHRs orthologous to mammalian receptors involved in fat metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b04">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b05">5</xref>]. In fact, it has been suggested that fat-regulating NHRs, along with several other NHR types, were lost from the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila</named-content> lineages as these organisms simplified their body plans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b06">6</xref>]. Conceivably, then, the biological activities associated with these NHRs may also have vanished. Therefore, it is still not clear if worm receptors mediate control over fat metabolism comparable to that of mammalian NHRs.</p>
      <p>Whether or not <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> employs NHRs to regulate fat metabolism, the evolution of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> NHR family is intrinsically interesting. Only 15 of the 284 worm NHRs are members of the broadly conserved subfamilies found in mammals and other metazoans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b04">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b05">5</xref>]. The biological activities of most of these “conserved” NHRs have been broadly defined, revealing roles in development, molting, dauer formation, and sex determination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b07">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b08">8</xref>]. The remaining 269 “divergent” NHRs have thus far been found only in nematodes and are predicted to have originated from repeated duplication of an ancestral gene that also gave rise to the hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) family of receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b06">6</xref>]. Although mammalian HNF4 receptors have been implicated in liver development and glucose homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b09">9</xref>], virtually nothing is known about the functions of these 269 <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> “nematode-specific” HNF4-like receptors. It will be interesting to determine if these divergent NHRs have adopted novel regulatory functions or whether they carry out physiological tasks similar to those of other metazoan NHRs.</p>
      <p>Elucidating the physiological responsibilities of even one of the worm HNF4-like receptors will likely advance our understanding of NHR-regulated gene networks and provide insight into the evolution and diversification of the NHR family in nematodes. To this end, we have been systematically investigating the function of HNF4-like receptors in <italic>C. elegans.</italic> In this study, we present a physiological characterization of <italic>nhr-49</italic> (K10C3.6), one of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> receptor genes most closely related to the mammalian HNF4. Our findings reveal a surprising role for this HNF4-like receptor in the regulation of fat storage and metabolism.</p>

        <title><italic>nhr-49</italic> Is Necessary for Normal Life Span</title>
        <p>In an RNA interference (RNAi) screen designed to identify the role of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> HNF4-like receptors in worm development and longevity, we found that interference of <italic>nhr-49</italic> resulted in dramatically reduced life span (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030053-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). For further characterization, we obtained a <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> strain, <italic>nhr-49(nr2041),</italic> which harbors a deletion in the <italic>nhr-49</italic> gene encompassing part of the DNA binding domain and more than half of the ligand binding domain (LBD); this deletion likely results in complete loss of function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b10">10</xref>]. At 23 °C, <italic>nhr-49(nr2041)</italic> worms lived only 6–8 d as adults, significantly shorter than the 15 to 18-d life span of N2 wild-type (WT) animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030053-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Although <italic>nhr-49</italic> deletion did not noticeably affect development or fertility, <italic>nhr-49(nr2041)</italic> worms experienced rapid decline in function beginning around day 3 of adulthood, when vacuoles appeared in the intestine and gonad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030053-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). By days 4 and 5, <italic>nhr-49(nr2041)</italic> animals were significantly smaller than WT, vacuoles were ubiquitous, and there was widespread gonadal necrosis. By days 5–7, the gonad had completely deteriorated, and the worms died shortly thereafter. Thus, <italic>nhr-49</italic> function is not required for development or fertility, but is clearly essential for normal longevity. Even though the increased vacuole formation was consistent with reported aging characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b11">11</xref>], we have not determined whether the shortened life span of <italic>nhr-49(nr2041)</italic> reflects accelerated aging or an unrelated pathology.</p>

The difference in fat content between WT and <italic>nhr-49(nr2041)</italic> animals was most pronounced in the L3 and L4 stages of larval development; by day 2 of adulthood there was only a slight change in Nile Red staining, suggesting that the effects of <italic>nhr-49</italic> on visible fat content may vary during development (data not shown).</p>

        <p>The high-fat phenotype of the <italic>nhr-49(nr2041)</italic> mutant led us to suspect that <italic>nhr-49</italic> might regulate genes involved in energy metabolism. To test this hypothesis, we identified from a survey of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> genome 65 genes predicted to participate in fatty acid synthesis, β-oxidation, desaturation, elongation, and binding/transport, in addition to 16 genes expected to function in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and glucose transport, and eight genes involved in the glyoxylate pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030053-g002">Figure 2</xref>). We then employed quantitative RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) to measure the expression of all 89 of these genes in WT and <italic>nhr-49(nr2041)</italic> mutant worms. For the purpose of our survey, gene expression was measured in all four larval stages (for a complete dataset, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref>).</p>

Mitochondrial localization of β-oxidation enzymes was predicted by TargetP and PSORT (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>); peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes all contain a carboxy-terminal peroxisomal localization signal. QRT-PCR was used to measure the expression of these 89 genes in WT and <italic>nhr-49(nr2041).</italic> Genes expressed at lower levels in <italic>nhr-49(nr2041)</italic> are shown in red (&gt;32-fold lower); orange (8- to 32-fold lower); or yellow (2- to 8-fold lower); and genes expressed at higher levels are shown in light green (2- to 8-fold higher) or dark green (&gt;8-fold higher).

        </fig>
        <p>Our screen revealed that deletion of <italic>nhr-49</italic> significantly altered the expression of 13 genes, including six genes predicted to be involved in fatty acid β-oxidation, three genes involved in fatty acid desaturation, two genes involved in fatty acid binding/transport, and two genes involved in the glyoxylate pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030053-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Similar changes in gene expression were observed when <italic>nhr-49</italic> was knocked down in WT animals using RNAi (data not shown).</p>
        <p>Overall, <italic>nhr-49</italic> deletion displayed the most dramatic effects on two metabolic pathways, mitochondrial β-oxidation and fatty acid desaturation, as the expression of multiple genes in each of these pathways was significantly compromised by loss of <italic>nhr-49</italic> function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030053-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In contrast, <italic>nhr-49</italic> deletion had smaller and mixed consequences for genes that participate in peroxisomal β-oxidation and lipid binding/transport. <italic>nhr-49</italic> knockout also marginally reduced expression of two enzymes involved in the glyoxylate pathway, a pathway that facilitates the conversion of fatty acid β-oxidation products to glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030053-g002">Figure 2</xref>). <italic>nhr-49</italic> deletion did not, however, significantly affect the expression of any genes predicted to be involved in glucose metabolism. Thus, it is clear that <italic>nhr-49</italic> is extensively involved in the control of fatty acid metabolism, with a pronounced role in the promotion of mitochondrial β-oxidation and fatty acid desaturation.</p>

        <title><italic>nhr-49(nr2041)</italic> Animals are High in Fat Due to Reduced Expression of β-Oxidation Genes</title>
        <p>Three genes predicted to participate in mitochondrial β-oxidation, <italic>ech-1</italic> (C29F3.1), F09F3.9, and an acyl-CoA synthetase gene <italic>(acs-2)</italic> (F28F8.2), were expressed at significantly lower levels in <italic>nhr-49(nr2041)</italic> animals throughout development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030053-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). <italic>acs-2</italic> is predicted to encode a mitochondrial acyl-CoA synthetase, whereas F09F3.9 likely codes for a carnitine palmitoyl transferase, and <italic>ech-1</italic> appears to encode a mitochondrial β-oxidation trifunctional enzyme. Because mitochondrial β-oxidation facilitates the degradation of stored fats for the production of energy, we suspected that <italic>nhr-49(nr2041)</italic> worms might be high in fat due to the reduced expression of these key β-oxidation enzymes. To test this hypothesis, we used RNAi to reduce separately the expression of <italic>acs-2,</italic> F09F3.9, and <italic>ech-1</italic> in WT animals. Indeed, we found that RNAi of either <italic>acs-2</italic> or <italic>ech-1</italic> resulted in worms with elevated Nile Red fat staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030053-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). <italic>acs-2</italic> was previously identified for a similar effect on fat storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b12">12</xref>]. We conclude that <italic>nhr-49</italic> promotes the expression of three β-oxidation genes, two of which, in WT worms, reduce overall fat storage. Thus, <italic>nhr-49(nr2041)</italic> mutant worms are likely to be high in fat due to the impaired expression of these genes.</p>

        <p>Studies in yeast have shown that the <italic>C. elegans fat-5, fat-6,</italic> and <italic>fat-7</italic> genes encode Δ9-desaturases, which preferentially convert saturated C16:0 and C18:0 fatty acids to monounsaturated C16:1 and C18:1 fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b14">14</xref>]. <italic>fat-5</italic> is a palmitoyl-CoA desaturase, specifically acting on palmitic acid (C16:0), and <italic>fat-6</italic> and <italic>fat-7</italic> are stearoyl-CoA desaturases (SCDs), preferentially functioning to desaturate stearic acid (C18:0). Mammalian SCDs have been shown to be important for maintaining an appropriate level of fatty acid desaturation, vital for modulating membrane fluidity and for controlling lipid metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> SCDs are also involved in catalyzing the first step in the synthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b17">17</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030053-g004">Figure 4</xref>B inset).</p>
        <p>Because the expression of these three <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> Δ9-desaturases was significantly impaired by <italic>nhr-49</italic> deletion, we used gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to determine whether overall fatty acid desaturation and PUFA synthesis were altered in <italic>nhr-49(nr2041)</italic> animals. The most significant consequence of <italic>nhr-49</italic> deletion on fatty acid composition was a marked increase in the abundance of stearic acid (C18:0) and a corresponding decrease in the level of oleic acid (C18:1n9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030053-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). This result is consistent with a reduction in SCD activity.</p>
        <p>In mammals, a primary role of SCD is to control the ratio of fully saturated stearic acid to monounsaturated oleic acid (C18:0/C18:1n9), and this ratio has been employed as an indicator of the activity of the mammalian SCD1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b16">16</xref>].

A similar but less pronounced alteration in the ratio of stearic acid to oleic acid was observed when <italic>nhr-49</italic> was knocked down in WT animals using RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030053-g004">Figure 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030053-t001">Table 1</xref>).

Therefore, despite the dramatic effect of <italic>nhr-49</italic> on SCD activity, <italic>nhr-49</italic> does not appear to play an appreciable role in overall PUFA synthesis.</p>
        <p>To determine which of the Δ9-desaturases accounted for the influence of <italic>nhr-49</italic> deletion on fatty acid composition, we used RNAi to individually knock down expression of <italic>fat-5</italic> and <italic>fat-7</italic> (because <italic>fat-6</italic> expression is only reduced by approximately 2-fold in <italic>nhr-49[nr2041],</italic> we did not examine <italic>fat-6</italic> RNAi animals). Although we did not observe a significant consequence of <italic>fat-5</italic> RNAi on fatty acid desaturation, <italic>fat-7</italic> RNAi altered fatty acid composition in a manner very similar to that of <italic>nhr-49</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030053-g004">Figure 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030053-t001">Table 1</xref>). <italic>fat-7</italic> RNAi animals displayed a significant increase in the abundance of C18:0 fatty acid, as well as a decrease in the levels of C18:1n9 and C18:2n6 fatty acids. The influence of <italic>fat-7</italic> RNAi on fatty acid composition was stronger than that of <italic>nhr-49</italic> deletion, increasing the ratio of stearic to oleic acid (C18:0/C18:1n9) to 8.0. <italic>fat-7</italic> RNAi animals also exhibited a slight lowering of PUFA abundance. The stronger effect of <italic>fat-7</italic> RNAi on fatty acid composition suggests that <italic>fat-7</italic> expression was reduced to levels even lower than those observed in <italic>nhr-49(nr2041).</italic> Because <italic>fat-7</italic> shares significant homology (approximately 85% nucleotide identity) with <italic>fat-6,</italic> it was possible that <italic>fat-7</italic> RNAi also partially interfered with <italic>fat-6</italic> expression; however, we found by QRT-PCR that the overall levels of <italic>fat-6</italic> mRNA were not noticeably reduced by <italic>fat-7</italic> RNAi. (data not shown).</p>
        <p>Therefore, we conclude that by strongly promoting SCD expression, <italic>nhr-49</italic> influences fatty acid composition in <italic>C. elegans.</italic> Although it appears that the primary effect of <italic>nhr-49</italic> deletion is a modulation of stearic and oleic acid levels, not PUFA abundance, we cannot rule out the possibility that <italic>nhr-49</italic> influences PUFA synthesis in a more localized manner, such that the changes in PUFA composition are not detectable by our whole-worm analysis.</p>

        <p>Interestingly, the effect of <italic>fat-7</italic> RNAi on life span was even more potent than <italic>nhr-49</italic> deletion, reducing adult life span to 3–5 d, as opposed to the 5- to 7-d life span of <italic>nhr-49(nr2041)</italic> (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030053-t001">Table 1</xref>). This is consistent with the finding that SCD activity is more dramatically compromised in <italic>fat-7</italic> RNAi animals than it is in the <italic>nhr-49(nr2041)</italic> mutant. In fact, we observed a striking correlation between <italic>fat-7</italic> activity, as determined by the ratio of stearic to oleic acid in our various mutants, and life span (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030053-t001">Table 1</xref>). WT animals (stearic/oleic = 1.9) lived approximately 16–18 d, <italic>nhr-49 RNAi</italic> animals (stearic/oleic = 2.3) lived approximately 10–12 d, <italic>nhr-49(nr2041)</italic> animals (stearic/oleic = 4.3) lived approximately 6–8 d, and <italic>fat-7</italic> RNAi animals (stearic/oleic = 8.0) lived approximately 3–5 d.</p>
        <p>Because <italic>fat-7</italic> expression is significantly compromised by <italic>nhr-49</italic> deletion, and because lowered <italic>fat-7</italic> expression can lead to shortened life span, we suggest that the reduced life-span phenotype of <italic>nhr-49(nr2041)</italic> likely reflects, at least in part, diminished <italic>fat-7</italic> expression.</p>

We next set out to determine whether <italic>nhr-49</italic> regulates these two pathways independently.</p>
        <p>Although RNAi of <italic>acs-2</italic> or <italic>ech-1</italic> was sufficient to cause a high-fat phenotype, <italic>acs-2</italic> or <italic>ech-1</italic> interference did not significantly impact life span, fatty acid composition, or desaturase gene expression, demonstrating that the effects of <italic>nhr-49</italic> deletion on <italic>fat-7</italic> expression and life span were not a downstream consequence of compromised β-oxidation or increased fat content (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030053-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>In contrast, RNAi of <italic>fat-7</italic> significantly impacted fat storage and β-oxidation.

        <p>Because <italic>fat-7</italic> targets some of the same β-oxidation genes as <italic>nhr-49,</italic> we wondered if the effects of <italic>fat-7</italic> on fat storage might be dependent on <italic>nhr-49;</italic> for example, perhaps <italic>fat-7</italic> represses <italic>ech-1</italic> and <italic>acs-2</italic> expression by blocking the <italic>nhr-49</italic> mediated induction of these genes.

Furthermore, RNAi of <italic>fat-7</italic> reduced fat content in <italic>nhr-49(nr2041)</italic> worms, demonstrating that the stimulation of fat storage by <italic>fat-7</italic> is also not dependent upon <italic>nhr-49</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030053-g005">Figure 5</xref>D).</p>
        <p>Taken together, our findings demonstrate that <italic>nhr-49</italic> controls two distinct circuits within a gene network: The stimulation of β-oxidation gene expression is independent of <italic>fat-7,</italic> and the promotion of <italic>fat-7</italic> expression is independent of <italic>nhr-49</italic>'s effects on β-oxidation. However, because <italic>fat-7</italic> expression inhibits the same β-oxidation genes induced by <italic>nhr-49,</italic> the regulation of <italic>fat-7</italic> by <italic>nhr-49</italic> connects these two circuits into a single regulatory network, serving to limit β-oxidation through an apparent feedback mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030053-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we demonstrated that deletion of the <italic>C. elegans nhr-49</italic> gene produced two global phenotypes: shortened life span and high fat content. Using a QRT-PCR strategy, we found 13 genes involved in energy metabolism that depend upon <italic>nhr-49</italic> for expression. The phenotypes of <italic>nhr-49(nr2041)</italic> were attributable to deficiencies in two different metabolic pathways, fatty acid β-oxidation and fatty acid desaturation. The high-fat phenotype is explained by lowered expression of β-oxidation enzymes, and the shortened life-span phenotype results from reduced expression of the <italic>fat-7</italic> SCD. Interestingly, these pathways are linked by an apparent feedback mechanism, as <italic>fat-7</italic> also serves to inhibit the expression of fatty acid β-oxidation genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030053-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p>
      <p>These results represent the first detailed characterization of a divergent HNF4-like receptor in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> and provide the first description of an NHR-controlled fat-regulatory network in invertebrates. Due to their evolutionary relationship to <italic>nhr-49,</italic> it seems conceivable that many of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> HNF4-like NHRs might participate in the regulation of fat metabolism. However, we have found that several other worm HNF4-like receptors, including those previously implicated for affecting overall fat storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b12">12</xref>], do not significantly impact the expression of fatty acid metabolism genes (M. R. Van Gilst and K. R. Yamamoto, unpublished data). Thus, the regulation of fat metabolism does not appear to be a general mechanism common to all of the divergent NHRs; whether or not <italic>nhr-49</italic> is unique in its control of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> fat metabolism remains to be determined.</p>
      <p>The mechanism by which <italic>nhr-49</italic> influences fat storage is likely to be through modulation of β-oxidation gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030053-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>acs-2</italic> alone was sufficient to suppress the high-fat phenotype of <italic>nhr-49(nr2041),</italic> indicating that <italic>acs-2</italic> expression is rate-limiting in <italic>nhr-49</italic> deletion mutants, thus leading to reduced fat breakdown and excessive fat accumulation. Acyl-CoA synthetases activate fatty acids for many different metabolic pathways; in particular, mitochondrial acyl-CoA synthetases are likely to activate fatty acids for transport into the mitochondrial matrix, where the fatty acids are then subject to β-oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b19">19</xref>]. Notably, mitochondrial acyl-CoA synthetases are commonly regulatory targets for factors that control fat consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b18">18</xref>]. We propose that by stimulating <italic>acs-2</italic> expression, <italic>nhr-49</italic> likely acts by increasing the flow of fatty acids into the mitochondria for β-oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030053-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p>
      <p>Out of 11 <italic>acs</italic> genes in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> five of which are predicted to be mitochondrial, <italic>nhr-49</italic> specifically affected the expression of only <italic>acs-2,</italic> suggesting that <italic>nhr-49</italic> may be promoting transport of a specific subset of fatty acids into mitochondria. These subsets may differ by fatty acid chain length or tissue distribution. As both <italic>acs-2</italic> and <italic>nhr-49</italic> are expressed in numerous <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> tissues, regulation of fat consumption by <italic>nhr-49</italic> may occur throughout the animal.</p>
      <p>Although <italic>acs-2</italic> is related (with approximately 25% identity) to multiple mammalian acyl-CoA synthetases, mammals contain a particular homolog with approximately 41% identity to the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> ACS-2 protein; this mammalian ACS protein is yet to be characterized. It will be interesting to determine whether the mammalian counterpart of <italic>acs-2</italic> also serves as an important focal point for gene networks that regulate fat utilization in mammals.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, we also found that <italic>nhr-49</italic> stimulates expression of a carnitine palmitoyl transferase (F09F3.9). Carnitine palmitoyl transferases execute the step immediately downstream of acyl-CoA synthetase in mitochondrial β-oxidation, directly shuttling activated acyl-CoAs into the mitochondrial matrix. Thus, <italic>nhr-49</italic> appears to target multiple enzymes involved in transporting fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane for β-oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030053-g006">Figure 6</xref>). RNAi of F09F3.9 did not detectably alter overall fat content, however, suggesting that interference of F09F3.9 expression alone is not sufficient to affect overall fat consumption under the conditions surveyed in our study.</p>
      <p>In contrast, we found that RNAi of <italic>ech-1,</italic> another β-oxidation gene targeted by <italic>nhr-49,</italic> was sufficient to increase overall fat content; thus it is likely that the reduced expression of <italic>ech-1</italic> also contributes, in some fashion, to the high-fat phenotype of <italic>nhr-49(nr2041).</italic> Thus, we have demonstrated that <italic>nhr-49</italic> strongly promotes the expression of three separate enzymes predicted to participate in mitochondrial β-oxidation. Consequently, we suggest that <italic>nhr-49</italic> plays a prominent role in promoting the breakdown of fatty acids in mitochondria, and that, through control of β-oxidation, <italic>nhr-49</italic> influences overall fat storage.</p>
      <p>In addition to its effect on β-oxidation, we found that <italic>nhr-49</italic> helps to maintain the balance of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. By stimulating the expression of three fatty acid Δ9-desaturase genes, <italic>nhr-49</italic> facilitates the conversion of saturated fatty acids to monounsaturated fatty acids, and consequently, <italic>nhr-49(nr2041)</italic> mutant animals are high in saturated fat and lower in monounsaturated fat. In <italic>C. elegans,</italic> the FAT-6 and FAT-7 SCDs may also be involved in the synthesis of PUFAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b17">17</xref>]. However, a dramatic reduction in <italic>fat-7</italic> expression, either by <italic>nhr-49(nr2041)</italic> deletion or by <italic>fat-7</italic> RNAi, did not significantly affect PUFA synthesis. This result suggests that a normal level of FAT-7 expression is not necessary for PUFA synthesis, likely because FAT-6 is the principle enzyme in this pathway, or because FAT-6 is capable of substituting for reduced FAT-7 activity. In either event, we propose that the primary effect of <italic>nhr-49</italic> on fatty acid composition is a modulation of the ratio of C18:0 to C18:1n9 fatty acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030053-g006">Figure 6</xref>). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that <italic>nhr-49</italic> and <italic>fat-7</italic> also affect PUFA synthesis in a more localized manner, for example, specific cell types, such that changes in PUFA abundance are not detected in our whole-worm analysis.</p>
      <p>Our results also indicate that the short life-span phenotype of <italic>nhr-49(nr2041)</italic> is due, at least in part, to reduced expression of <italic>fat-7.</italic> The strong correlation between the increase in C18:0 saturated fatty acid and the shortening of life span is compelling. Several reports in mammals have described changes in fatty acid composition during aging, and it has been argued that an alteration of fatty acid saturation ratios in mitochondrial membranes may affect the rate of aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b20">20</xref>]. Additionally, imbalance of fatty acid saturation has also been linked to numerous pathological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b16">16</xref>]. Although SCDs have not yet been linked to life span in mammals, studies in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> have identified <italic>fat-7</italic> as one of the targets of the mechanisms that extend longevity through the insulin pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b21">21</xref>]. Thus, it will be interesting to determine if the shortened life-span phenotype of <italic>nhr-49(nr2041)</italic> and <italic>fat-7 RNAi</italic> animals results from an improper ratio of saturated and monounsaturated fats, and if the mechanistic cause of the reduced life span is related to accelerated aging or to another pathology.</p>
      <p>Although it is clear that <italic>nhr-49</italic> independently promotes the expression of genes in fatty acid β-oxidation and desaturation, we found that downstream components of these pathways do indeed communicate with each other. By inhibiting the expression of genes involved in β-oxidation, including the <italic>nhr-49</italic>-dependent genes <italic>acs-2</italic> and <italic>ech-1, fat-7</italic> works against the actions of <italic>nhr-49,</italic> acting to hinder fat consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030053-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, our results reveal an elegant feedback mechanism: <italic>nhr-49</italic> induces the expression of β-oxidation enzymes—thus promoting fat consumption—yet by independently stimulating <italic>fat-7</italic> expression, <italic>nhr-49</italic> tempers the expression of the very same β-oxidation genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030053-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, we suggest that <italic>nhr-49</italic> serves as a key regulator of fat usage, governing pathways that consume fat for energy and partition fat for storage, potentially shifting the balance in response to changing energy needs. Indeed, we have found that in response to starvation, <italic>nhr-49</italic> selectively modulates the expression of these two pathways in order to increase fat consumption (M. R. Van Gilst and K. R. Yamamoto, unpublished data).</p>
      <p>As the predominant function of <italic>fat-7</italic> is to convert C18:0 to C18:1n9 fatty acid, it is tempting to speculate that one of these two fatty acid species serves as a signal to modulate the feedback effect of <italic>fat-7</italic> on fatty acid β-oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030053-g006">Figure 6</xref>). In this scenario, C18:0 could be serving as an activator of β-oxidation gene expression, C18:1n9 could be functioning as a repressor, or both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030053-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Although it seems reasonable to propose that an NHR would communicate this fatty acid signal, we found that the effects of <italic>fat-7</italic> on fatty acid β-oxidation were not dependent on <italic>nhr-49;</italic> hence, one of the other 283 <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> NHRs may mediate this effect.</p>
      <p>Despite its strong sequence similarity with the mammalian HNF4 receptors, the overall biological effects of <italic>nhr-49</italic> on metabolism, fat storage, and life span are remarkably similar to those of the mammalian PPARs. Perhaps most striking is the finding that <italic>nhr-49</italic> and the PPARs, particularly PPARα and PPARδ, positively influence similar genes in multiple metabolic processes, including fatty acid β-oxidation, fatty acid desaturation, and fatty acid binding/transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b23">23</xref>]. Moreover, knockout of PPARα or PPARδ can lead to high-fat phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b24">24</xref>], demonstrating that the physiological effects of these receptors on fat storage are similar to those of <italic>nhr-49.</italic></p>
      <p>The regulation of SCDs by <italic>nhr-49</italic> also parallels the regulation of the SCD1 gene by PPARα. In mammals, the Δ9-desaturase SCD1 is a lipogenic enzyme that is controlled by several key regulators of fat storage, including PPARα, leptin, and sterol response element-binding protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b26">26</xref>]. When SCD1 expression is left unchecked, as occurs in leptin knockout mice, severe obesity can result. Similar to what we found for the <italic>C. elegans fat-7</italic> gene, mammalian SCD1 affects fat storage by inhibiting β-oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b27">27</xref>]. Thus, because PPARα also promotes fat consumption by stimulating β-oxidation gene expression[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b28">28</xref>], it is clear that PPARα is independently regulating pathways that promote fat consumption and stimulate fat storage. In fact, a similar feedback mechanism to what we have described here for <italic>nhr-49</italic> has been proposed for PPARα and SCD1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b29">29</xref>]. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the multicircuited regulatory networks governing fat usage appear well conserved between <italic>C. elegans nhr-49</italic> and the mammalian PPARα.</p>
      <p>Although we have not yet determined whether or not the <italic>nhr-49</italic>-dependent genes identified in this study are direct transcriptional targets, each is homologous to known transcriptional targets of the PPARs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b23">23</xref>]. Because NHR-49 and the PPARs are clearly regulating similar physiological processes and gene networks, we believe that they are likely to be using similar molecular mechanisms, including direct transcriptional regulation. However, it is possible that <italic>nhr-49</italic> controls fatty acid β-oxidation and desaturation through an indirect mechanism, functioning upstream of the transcription factors that directly act on the <italic>nhr-49</italic>-dependent genes identified in this study. The latter possibility would also be intriguing, as it would demonstrate NHR involvement in fat regulation at a point upstream of a PPAR-like factor.</p>
      <p>As the physiological functions and regulatory targets of <italic>nhr-49</italic> are highly similar to those of the mammalian PPARs, it seems reasonable to speculate that, like the PPARs, NHR-49 may be regulated by fatty acid ligands. By binding directly to ingested lipids and/or their metabolic products, NHR-49 could serve both as a sensor of intracellular fatty acid levels and an effector, responding to changes in fatty acid composition through modulation of fatty acid β-oxidation and desaturation. Interestingly, the mammalian HNF4 receptors, whose LBDs share 33% identity with the NHR-49 LBD, can bind to several saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, including stearic and oleic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b31">31</xref>]; the mammalian PPARs also bind to many types of fatty acids, although they interact preferentially with PUFAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b22">22</xref>]. It will be interesting to determine if mammalian HNF4 receptors harbor an undiscovered capacity to regulate fat metabolism in mammals, or if PPARs have adopted their regulatory functions by evolving from an ancestral HNF4 gene that had properties similar to <italic>nhr-49</italic> and the modern PPARs. Alternatively, the PPARs and <italic>nhr-49</italic> may have acquired their activities through convergent evolution.</p>
      <p>Precise regulation of fatty acid β-oxidation and desaturation is crucial for physiological homeostasis; imbalance in these metabolic pathways in humans can lead to disorders such as diabetes, obesity, atherosclerosis, and accelerated aging. However, although NHRs are important targets for drugs that moderate these metabolic disorders, the NHR-mediated regulatory networks that govern fat usage are notably complex and poorly understood. We showed here that many features of <italic>C. elegans nhr-49</italic> regulation of fat metabolism are closely analogous to those of the mammalian PPARs, key targets for the treatment of metabolic disease. Moreover, our <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> studies revealed that <italic>nhr-49,</italic> like PPARα, oversees a branch point for two separate circuits within a network that controls fatty acid consumption and composition.</p>
      <p>The extent of the functional homology between <italic>nhr-49</italic> and PPARα remains to be determined, that is, whether or not <italic>nhr-49</italic> also functions by binding to fatty acid ligands and directly regulating gene transcription. Nevertheless, our finding that <italic>nhr-49</italic> is a key regulator of fat metabolism in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> represents a considerable advance in our understanding of NHR control of fat storage and composition in invertebrates. Consequently, we suggest that these and future studies in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> will continue to enhance our understanding of the complex roles of NHRs and their ligands on gene networks governing fat physiology.</p>

Fire). Germ-line transformation was performed following standard procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b35">35</xref>]. P<italic><sub>nhr-49</sub></italic>GFP was injected at the following concentrations: 1 ng/μl, 5 ng/μl and 20 ng/μl along with the co-injection marker pRF4 <italic>rol-6(su1006)</italic> injected at 60 ng/μl. At all three P<italic><sub>nhr-49</sub></italic>GFP concentrations, we were unable to obtain stably transmitting lines. Animals used for GFP imaging were derived from the F1 generation and were mosaic, hosting the P<italic><sub>nhr-49</sub></italic>GFP transgene in only a subset of tissues.</p>
          <p>To construct <italic>acs-2::gfp,</italic> a 4-kb genomic fragment, including the full-length <italic>acs-2</italic> gene plus 2 kb of upstream sequence, was cloned into the vector L3691. Germ-line transformation was performed using 50 ng/μl of <italic>acs:2::gfp</italic> and 50 ng/μl pRF4 <italic>rol-6(su1006).</italic> For N2/<italic>acs-2::gfp</italic> and <italic>nhr-49(nr2041)/acs-2::gfp,</italic> over ten independent transmitting lines were obtained and analyzed by GFP microscopy. GFP reporter expression was observed using a Zeiss Axiovert S100 fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, New York, United States) under a 40X objective.</p>
          <p>For rescue experiments, 50–100 ng/μl of <italic>acs-2::gfp</italic> was injected into <italic>nhr-49(nr2041)</italic> and WT animals along with 50 ng/μl of pRF4 rol-6(su1006). Transgenic adults, selected for rolling behavior, were placed on Nile Red plates and assayed for fat content as described above. pRF4 <italic>rol-6(su1006)</italic> was injected into <italic>nhr-49(nr2041)</italic> in combination with unrelated plasmids to demonstrate that the lowered fat content was not a result of hosting a transgenic array or caused by expression of the <italic>rol-6(su1006)</italic> marker gene.</p>

          <title>Raw Data for QRT-PCR Screen</title>
          <p>Data are shown as C<sub>t</sub>, the number of cycles required for amplification of a particular target gene from a cDNA preparation. Changes in gene expression in the <italic>nhr-49(nr2041)</italic> mutant were measured as ΔC<sub>t</sub>. ΔC<sub>t</sub> are obtained by subtracting <italic>nhr-49</italic>(C<sub>t</sub>) from N2(C<sub>t</sub>) and adjusting for RNA concentration differences with a correction factor (CF). The CF was determined by aligning the data to a set of standard genes. Thus the equation for ΔC<sub>t</sub> is as follows:</p>

	   </p>
          <p>Genes were designated as <italic>nhr-49</italic> dependent if the C<sub>t</sub> was &gt;1.0 in multiple developmental stages (and was greater than the standard error). <italic>nhr-49</italic> targets are marked with an X. The QRT-PCR results of the major <italic>nhr-49</italic> targets, <italic>acs-2, ech-1, fat-5,</italic> and <italic>fat-7,</italic> were confirmed with a second primer pair.</p>
