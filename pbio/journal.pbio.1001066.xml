        <p>For several decades, molecular recognition has been considered one of the most fundamental processes in biochemistry. For enzymes, substrate binding is often coupled to conformational changes that alter the local environment of the active site to align the reactive groups for efficient catalysis and to reach the transition state. Adaptive substrate recognition is a well-known concept; however, it has been poorly characterized at a structural level because of its dynamic nature. Here, we provide a detailed mechanism for an induced-fit process at atomic resolution. We take advantage of a slow, tight binding inhibitor-enzyme system, actinonin-peptide deformylase. Crystal structures of the initial open state and final closed state were solved, as well as those of several intermediate mimics captured during the process. Ligand-induced reshaping of a hydrophobic pocket drives closure of the active site, which is finally “zipped up” by additional binding interactions. Together with biochemical analyses, these data allow a coherent reconstruction of the sequence of events leading from the encounter complex to the key-lock binding state of the enzyme. A “movie” that reconstructs this entire process can be further extrapolated to catalysis.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The notion of induced fit when a protein binds its ligand—like a glove adapting to the shape of a hand—is a central concept of structural biochemistry introduced over 50 years ago. A detailed molecular demonstration of this phenomenon has eluded biochemists, however, largely due to the difficulty of capturing the steps of this very transient process: the “conformational change.” In this study, we were able to see this process by using X-ray diffraction to determine more than 10 distinct structures adopted by a single enzyme when it binds a ligand. To do this, we took advantage of the “slow, tight-binding” of a potent inhibitor to its specific target enzyme to trap intermediates in the binding process, which allowed us to monitor the action of an enzyme in real-time at atomic resolution. We showed the kinetics of the conformational change from an initial open state, including the encounter complex, to the final closed state of the enzyme. From these data and other biochemical and biophysical analyses, we make a coherent causal reconstruction of the sequence of events leading to inhibition of the enzyme's activity. We also generated a movie that reconstructs the sequence of events during the encounter. Our data provide new insights into how enzymes achieve a catalytically competent conformation in which the reactive groups are brought into close proximity, resulting in catalysis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Flexibility of proteins around their active site is a central feature of molecular biochemistry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Knowles1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Teilum1">[5]</xref>. Although this has been a central concept in biochemistry for half a century, the detailed mechanisms describing how the active enzyme conformation is achieved have remained largely elusive, as a consequence of their transient nature. Direct structural evidence and/or kinetic analyses have only recently emerged <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Sullivan1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Katona1">[10]</xref>. Three classic “textbook” models are used to describe the formation of the ligand-enzyme complex: (i) the Fischer's “lock-and key” model, (ii) the Koshland's induced-fit model, and (iii) the selected-shift model or conformational selection mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Sullivan1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Johnson1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Koshland1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Boehr1">[13]</xref>. In the Fischer's “lock-and key” model, the conformations of free and ligand-bound proteins are essentially the same. In the induced-fit model, ligand binding induces a conformational change in the protein, leading to the precise orientation of the catalytic groups and implying the existence of initial molecular matches that provide sufficient affinity prior to conformational adaptation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Bosshard1">[14]</xref>. In contrast, the selected-fit model assumes an equilibrium between multiple conformational states, in which the ligand is able to select and stabilize a complementary protein conformation. In this case, the conformational change precedes ligand binding, in contrast to the induced-fit model in which binding occurs first. The conformational selection and/or induced-fit processes have been shown to be involved in a number of enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Tummino1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Boehr1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Benkovic2">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Hammes2">[16]</xref>. For several of these studies, conformational selection is proposed because the experimental data support that, even in the absence of the ligand, the enzyme samples multiple conformational states, including the ligand-bound (active) state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Sullivan1">[6]</xref>. Although direct structural evidence and/or kinetic analyses have provided clues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Sullivan1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Johnson1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Tummino1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Boehr1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Hammes2">[16]</xref>, how we can distinguish whether a protein binds its ligand in an induced- or selected-fit mechanism remains critical and often controversial.</p>
      <p>The enzyme-inhibitor interaction is a form of molecular recognition that is more amenable to investigation than the enzyme-substrate interaction as there is no chemical transformation of the ligand during this process. In this context, slow, tight-binding inhibition is an interesting interaction process, as it closely mimics the substrate recognition process and has been shown to be commonly involved in adaptive conformational changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Tummino1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Fersht1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Morrison1">[18]</xref>. In slow, tight-binding inhibition, the degree of inhibition at a fixed concentration of compound varies over time, leading to a curvature of the reaction progress curve over time during which the uninhibited reaction progress curve is linear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Copeland1">[19]</xref>. Indeed, the slow, tight-binding inhibition is a two-step mechanism that depends on the rate and strength of inhibitor interactions with the enzyme. Binding of the inhibitor (I) to the enzyme (E) leads to the rapid formation of a non-covalent enzyme-inhibitor complex (E:I) followed by monomolecular slower step (<italic>k</italic><sub>5</sub>) in which the E:I is transformed into a more stable complex (E:I*) that relaxes and dissociates at a very slow rate, mainly inferred by the <italic>k</italic><sub>6</sub> value when <italic>k</italic><sub>6</sub>&lt;&lt;<italic>k<sub>5</sub></italic>&lt;&lt;<italic>k<sub>4</sub></italic>, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g001">Figure 1A</xref>; see also footnote f in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001066-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

Actinonin is a natural product with antibiotic activity that inhibits PDF by mimicking the structure of its natural substrates (nascent peptide chains starting with <italic>Fo</italic>-Met-Aaa, where <italic>Fo</italic> is a formyl group and Aaa is any amino acid) in their transition state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The transition state inhibitor actinonin, as well as other structurally related inhibitors, has been shown to systematically exhibit a “slow-binding” inhibition behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), regardless of the organism of origin of the PDF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-VanAller1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Nguyen1">[33]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Using structural, biocomputing, and enzymatic analyses, we were able to (i) reveal that the free enzyme is in an open conformation and that actinonin induces transition of the enzyme into a closed conformation; (ii) show that there is no evidence for the occurrence of a closed conformation in the apostructure of the open enzyme, which, together with detailed kinetic analyses, makes the closed form fully compatible with an induced-fit model; and (iii) identify the sequence of molecular events leading to the final, bound, closed complex (E:I*). Moreover, using several rationally designed point mutants of the enzyme, ligand-induced intermediates, which mimic conformational states that normally would not be expected to accumulate with the wild-type (WT) enzyme, were trapped. These conformations recapitulate physical states that the WT enzyme must pass through during its overall transition from the apo-enzyme to the E:I* complex. “Freezing” of ligand-induced intermediate states provides direct evidence for an induced-fit mechanism and allows the reconstruction of a virtual “movie” that recapitulates this mechanism. Since PDF is one example of an enzyme remaining active in the crystalline state and because actinonin closely mimics the natural substrates bound to PDF in the transition state as shown previously with the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> form (<italic>Ec</italic>PDF; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Becker1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Guilloteau1">[35]</xref>, we propose a model suggesting that induced fit also contributes to efficient catalysis.</p>

Previously reported snapshots of a series of different conformations of the enlarged and mobile loop—the so-called CD loop—of the dimeric PDF from <italic>Leptospira interrogans</italic> PDF (<italic>Li</italic>PDF) in the presence or absence of inhibitor led to the hypothesis of the existence of an equilibrium between a closed and open form of the CD-loop of PDF enzymes, suggesting a selected-shift model to the authors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Zhou1">[43]</xref>. Taken together, these data suggest that the binding of actinonin to PDF is accompanied or preceded by conformational changes within the enzyme.

        <title>Ligand-Induced Conformational Closure of <italic>At</italic>PDF in the Crystalline State</title>
        <p>Occurrence of a conformational change induced by drug binding was visualized via the resolution of several crystal structure forms of <italic>At</italic>PDF, the free form and/or in a complex with actinonin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s012">Table S2</xref>). The data reveal a structural switch between the two forms that can account for both the thermodynamic and kinetic data. The enzyme was observed in two states, a novel open apo-form and a closed, induced, actinonin-bound complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Binding of actinonin resulted in a tightening of the active site through the collective closure of the entire N-terminal portion of the protein (strands <italic>β</italic>1, <italic>β</italic>2, and <italic>β</italic>3; helix α1; and CD-loop, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s014">Movies S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s015">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The amplitude of the structural change was maximal for Pro60 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s001">Figure S1</xref>), the Cα of which was shifted 4 Å upon actinonin binding. This collective movement involved the formation of a “super β-sheet” as the result of the large rearrangement of β-strands 4 and 5 relative to the rest of the structure in which actinonin forms an additional strand bridging the two β-sheets (<italic>β</italic>1 and<italic>β</italic>2) on either side of the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g001">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). As actinonin is a peptide-like compound (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), this behavior closely mimics what occurs in the natural protein substrates of PDF, which also form this strand-bridging interaction. This phenomenon also accounts for the strong stabilization of the protein by actinonin, which was also challenged by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments: the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of <italic>At</italic>PDF increased from 61°C to 81°C upon binding of the inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, see also below).</p>
        <p>Thus far, this closure of the enzyme induced by actinonin is part of the rare structural evidence for the slow, tight-binding mechanism at an atomic scale. The open state, which has never been observed, was captured not only in the two molecules of the asymmetric subunit but also in different crystals and under two distinct crystallization conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s012">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g002">Figure 2</xref>). All r.m.s.d. values were smaller than 0.25 Å. The closure is very unlikely to result from crystal packing constraints, as soaking the apo-<italic>At</italic>PDF crystals in a solution containing actinonin induced the structural transition from the open to the closed state within the crystals without cracking them or altering their diffracting power. Thus, crystal packing is compatible with both states of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Therefore, the open structure most likely corresponds to a stable state in solution.</p>

Superimpositions were realized using “module superpose” in the CCP4i package and the “secondary structure matching” tool. The extent of aperture/closure of PDF enzymes was assessed primarily by the measurement of the aperture angle (δ<sub>ap</sub>), the angle made between the Cα of three strictly conserved residues (C, H, and I) of all PDFs, each characterizing a secondary crucial structure module of the active site crevice, namely <italic>β</italic><sub>4</sub>, <italic>α</italic><sub>2</sub>, and <italic>β</italic>1 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s001">Figure S1C</xref>).

        <title>Evidence for a Pure Induced-Fit Mechanism in the Binding of Actinonin to <italic>At</italic>PDF</title>
        <p>Recent quantitative analyses of both conformational selection and induced fit have led to an integrated continuum—a so-called “flux-description”—of these two limiting mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Hammes2">[16]</xref>. According to this model, conformation selection tends to be preferred at low ligand concentrations (µM range)—that is, using detailed kinetic studies—whereas induced fit dominates at high ligand and enzyme concentrations (mM range) obtained, for instance, in NMR or crystallographic approaches. Structural studies are most useful to reveal subpopulations of biological significance.</p>
        <p>We investigated the existence of lowly populated, alternative conformations of apoPDF.

Ringer searches for evidence of alternate rotamers by systematically sampling electron density maps—free of model bias—around the dihedral angles of protein side chains. Two independent WT open datasets of the apoenzyme, including a high-resolution set (1.3 Å), were used in the analysis. Ringer analysis revealed the existence of only one rotamer of most side chains of either molecule in the asymmetric unit, including the three main residues primarily involved in conformation change—that is, Ile 42, Phe58, and Ile130 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Ringer analysis showed evidence for unmodeled alternate conformers for very few residues, including Ile121 and Phe87, or Phe119 to a much lesser extent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s007">Figure S7</xref>). There is therefore no evidence for the occurrence of a closed conformation in the apostructure of <italic>At</italic>PDF, supporting the hypothesis that the conformational change was essentially induced by the binding of actinonin rather than from conformational selection among multiple states occurring in the crystalline state.</p>

        <title>Single Variants at Gly41 Exhibit Strongly Reduced Actinonin-Binding Potency and Catalytic Efficiency</title>
        <p>When dealing with an induced-fit mechanism, knowledge of the initial O and final C state is crucial but does not provide direct information on the position of actinonin in the encounter complex or on the sequential mechanism of the transition process. We suspected that the conserved glycine-rich motif 1 (G<sub>41</sub>IGLAAXQ) could contribute to the flexibility required for the observed structural transition. Evidence for such flexibility comes from NMR analysis of <italic>Ec</italic>PDF in which a few residues show exchange cross-peaks of an additional, alternative form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Dardel1">[38]</xref>. The most strongly affected residues are Cys90, one of the metal ligands, its neighbor Leu91, and both of the alanines within the above conserved glycine-rich motif (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s001">Figure S1B</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Ec</italic>PDF undergoes conformational dynamics in a similar region.</p>
        <p>To unravel the dynamics of the recognition process, we surmised that it should be possible to freeze the conformational change along the pathway by introducing selected, minor variations within the above-mentioned crucial residues involved in the collective motion. In this respect, site-directed mutagenesis of <italic>At</italic>PDF was performed on Gly41, Ile42, and Ile130. Single substitutions were made at Gly41 (G41A/Q/M), Ile42 (I42A/F/N/W), and Ile130 (I130A/F), and the variants were purified and characterized. These mutant proteins showed no change in overall stability, as evidenced by DSC experiments (unpublished data). However, two variants of G41, G41Q and G41M, showed dramatic effects; the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values were reduced by three orders of magnitude due to large decreases in the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> values compared to the WT enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g005">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s011">Table S1</xref>). The reduced <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values suggest an altered ability of these variants to attain the final enzyme-transition state complex and, as a result, to give rise to possible states different from the final E:I* complex. Substitutions at positions 42 and 130 only caused small reductions in the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s002">Figure S2C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s011">Table S1</xref>). The actinonin-binding potency of both G41 variants was also greatly reduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s011">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). The time-dependent inhibition by actinonin of the most active variants was then studied (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s013">Table S3</xref>). The half-lives of the final complexes—as assessed by comparison of the 1<sub>/</sub><italic>k<sub>6</sub></italic> values—were always significantly smaller (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s013">Table S3</xref>), suggesting that the conformational change induced by actinonin binding still occurred, but the C state is destabilized relative to the O state in the mutants compared to the WT. Accordingly, actinonin strongly stabilized almost all of the variants; <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> was increased by more than 20°C. This differs from the G41M and G41Q variants, which both showed increases in the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of only 12°C, consistent with reduced binding potency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s011">Table S1</xref>).</p>

(B) Schematic model for actinonin binding to <italic>At</italic>PDF in favor of an induced-fit pathway. PDF might exist in at least two conformational states, open (O) or closed (C). The relative abundance of each conformation would vary, depending on the enzyme type. With <italic>At</italic>PDF, it is likely that the most abundant form is the O one, which is the only form leading to a productive complex. The superclosed form (S) is likely to show reduced affinity for the ligand because of steric occlusion of the active site. At the initial stage, the inhibitor (shown in red) binds to <italic>At</italic>PDF (indicated in brown) in the O conformation. To reach the final key-lock state (productive closed conformation, C), two major and extreme pathways can be used. According to the conformational selection pathway, the inhibitor selects the C conformation. This pathway, which is represented by the dashed arrow, does not occur within the crystal. In contrast, the G41Q and G41M mutants, by providing the structure of the enzyme in intermediate conformations (I), prove the existence of the so-called encounter complex and confirm that the inhibitor binds to the enzyme when it is in the O conformation. The ligand-binding site is then reorganized to yield the C enzyme conformation, that is, the key-lock state. Indeed, the inhibitor binds to the enzyme through the induced-fit pathway. Each timescale was calculated using the data available in the text and corresponds to <italic>t<sub>1/2</sub></italic> values deduced from the calculation of 0.693/(kinetic constant of interest). The <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> value (<italic>k<sub>2</sub></italic>) was used to assess the timescale of catalysis in panel C, whereas, in (B), <italic>k<sub>4</sub></italic> assesses the first step of inhibition, and <italic>k<sub>6</sub></italic> is used in the case of the slow step.

(C) Schematic model for the deformylation reaction catalyzed by PDF. Since actinonin is a pseudo-peptidic inhibitor, it is likely that a peptidic substrate can bind to the PDF enzyme through an induced-fit pathway, as described in (B). The key-lock state represents a transition state in which the N-formylated substrate is deformylated to yield the final reaction product.</p>

        <title>Conformational Changes of Gly41 Variants Are Affected On-Pathway</title>
        <p>The two most interesting variants, G41Q and G41M, could be crystallized under the same conditions as the WT protein. In the case of G41Q, the structure of the apo-protein did not show any modifications compared to the WT structure and remained in an O conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g002">Figure 2B</xref>; “O” zone). In contrast, the 3D structure of the G41M variant showed that the asymmetric unit was composed of two molecules with distinct structures. One molecule (chain A) is in the O state and is similar to the structures of the WT and the G41Q variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g002">Figure 2B</xref>; zone “O”). The second molecule (chain B) is in a C state, closer to that observed for the WT chain in the presence of actinonin (“C”), a so-called “superclosed” state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g002">Figure 2B</xref>; zone “S”), suggesting that the substitution modified the equilibrium between the two states in solution either (i) at the step of protein synthesis by providing two conformers, the inter-conversions of which are blocked due to steric hindrance brought by the new bulkier side-chain at position 41, or (ii) by dramatically unbalancing the free inter-conversion between the O and S conformers towards the S state. Ringer analysis indicates that in the free G41M variant, many residues show evidence for unmodeled alternate conformers—including positions 58, 42, and 130—in keeping with the second hypothesis.</p>
        <p>For all variants of position G41, addition of actinonin to the crystal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s006">Figure S6</xref>) induced a closure of the protein within the crystal. Nevertheless, as expected from in silico graphic modeling followed by energy minimization, the occurrence of a bulky side chain at position 41 prevented the completion of the closure in the presence of the ligand and, hence, the formation of the hydrogen bond between the backbone nitrogen of Ile42 and actinonin. This finding is consistent with the strongly reduced <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of the complex of the variants with actinonin compared to WT as measured by DSC. Remarkably, both S and O forms of the G41M apo-structures in the asymmetric unit of the crystal yielded a unique intermediary structure (“I” state) upon actinonin binding (r.m.s.d. between the molecules is &lt;0.25 Å; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, zone “I”). In this case, it is likely that the induced-fit mechanism drives the equilibrium by capturing only the O population and closing it to an intermediary step, thus depleting the pool of O conformers that is shifted sequentially back from the remaining pool of S conformers and allows the complete binding of actinonin to the enzyme.</p>
        <p>In line with the rational design of the PDF mutants, the extent of the structural differences suggests that the underlying motions are dependent on the length of the side chain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s008">Figure S8</xref>). Together, these data account for the reduced catalytic rate, as the hydrogen bond is strictly required for the substrate to be efficiently cleaved by PDFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s008">Figure S8A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Meinnel2">[54]</xref>. Therefore, from both structural and kinetic analyses, each substitution most likely reproduces intermediates along the pathway that lead to the closure of PDF around its substrate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s002">Figure S2B</xref>).</p>

        <title>Conformational Changes of Gly41 Variants Recapitulate Closing Intermediates</title>
        <p>Analysis of the structures allows us to propose the following sequence of atomic events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g002">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s006">Figure S6</xref>). To name the various sites of the ligand and subsites of PDF, we will use the usual nomenclature found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Schechter1">[55]</xref>, which defines the various binding pockets of a protease, where P1' is the first side chain at the C-terminal side of the cleavage site and its binding pocket is S1', also referred to as the hydrophobic pocket in the case of PDF. First, actinonin aligns along the S1' pocket to form the encounter complex, which shifts the Ile130 side chain to avoid steric hindrance in the S1' pocket, promotes rotation of the Ile42 side chain, and finally rearranges the phenyl group of Phe58. These events achieve an optimal hydrophobic S1' pocket conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g003">Figure 3</xref>), and the concomitant closure leads to the formation of a hydrogen bond between the first carbonyl group of actinonin and the backbone nitrogen of Ile42. The initial N-O distance is reduced from 5 Å to 2.8 Å, which is an optimal value for hydrogen bonding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s015">Movie S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s008">Figure S8B</xref>). Thus, the primary driving force for the active site closure appears to be the P1':S1' hydrophobic interaction. The C state is ultimately locked by the super-β-sheet hydrogen bonds extending across the ligand, including those involving Ile42. The ΔΔG<sub>binding</sub> value (2.2–2.4 kcal/mol, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s008">Figure S8B</xref>), as calculated from the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values for actinonin binding to wild-type (WT) and G41M and G41Q, is consistent with the loss of a hydrogen bond that also contributes to the conformational stability of the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Fersht2">[56]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Takano1">[57]</xref>. Thus, this bond contributes to the major binding free energy difference between the two complexes (3.1 kcal/mol; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s008">Figure S8B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s011">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s013">S3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-VanAller1">[29]</xref>). Interestingly, the above ΔΔG<sub>binding</sub> values also correlate with the ΔΔG<sub>ES</sub> values derived from the <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic>/<italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> and <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> measurements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Copeland1">[19]</xref>. This dataset strongly correlates with the gyration and van der Waals radii of the side chain at position 41 as well as the N-O distance between the first carbonyl group of actinonin and the backbone nitrogen of Ile42 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s008">Figure S8</xref>). These results suggest that the capacity of both G41M and G41Q variants to form the transition state is a consequence of their inability to reach the fully closed state.</p>
        <p>Thus, our study of the designed Gly41 mutant enzymes reveals that, in addition to the initial and final states observed for the WT enzyme, the conformations of the Gly41 variants correspond indeed to on-pathway intermediates, thus providing snapshots along the trajectory from the O to the C state of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g002">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g003">3</xref>). The 3D structure of the variants in the absence of ligand is similar to that of WT, and a strict correlation exists between the completeness of the conformational change and both binding potency and catalytic efficiency. This suggests that both events require complete protein closure to generate a productive complex. The strong stabilization of <italic>At</italic>PDF by actinonin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) closely mimics what occurs with its natural substrates when it reaches the transition state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Becker1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Yuan1">[58]</xref>. Indeed, as expected, the enzyme facilitates the final C conformation by lowering its final energy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Sullivan1">[6]</xref>. Optimal arrangement of the S1' pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g003">Figure 3</xref>) proceeds along the reaction process towards the final C conformation, triggering the alignment of reactive groups in an optimal arrangement for ligand recognition. Upon binding, actinonin alters the thermodynamic landscape for the structural transition between the O and C states. This ligand is a potent inhibitor because it can trigger the above sequence of events similar to the substrate, but unlike the substrate, it is non-hydrolyzable. Thus, by mimicking the transition state and being non-hydrolyzable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), the final C complex is long lasting.</p>

        <title>Ligand-Induced Conformational Closure Is Initially Triggered by the Binding of the P1' Group in the S1' Pocket</title>
        <p>Given the similarity between actinonin and natural substrate binding, the very slow kinetics of inhibitor binding (10-s time-scale) remains puzzling compared to the 10 ms required for catalysis (deduced from the <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic>). This finding could be explained as a conformational effect during the formation of the hydrogen bond, aligning the substrate as an additional beta-sheet and eventually stabilizing the entire enzyme-ligand complex. The significantly longer time needed to reach the most stable state compared to the substrate would most likely be due to the presence of the flexible and one carbon longer metal-binding group in actinonin (i.e., hydroxamate versus formyl, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). This suggestion is in line with the overall data obtained when we investigated more deeply the role of the first carbonyl group of the ligand. This group is well known to exert a crucial effect in both productive and unproductive ligand binding (i.e., substrate and inhibitor) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Meinnel2">[54]</xref>. In this respect, we studied the binding of compound <bold><italic>6b</italic></bold> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s005">Figure S5B</xref>), a PDF ligand that does not exhibit a reactive group at this position <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Boularot1">[49]</xref>. We observed that this compound binds strongly to both <italic>Ec</italic>PDF (<italic>K<sub>I*</sub></italic>  = 63±6 nM) and <italic>At</italic>PDF (<italic>K<sub>I*</sub></italic>  = 400±35 nM) but, unlike actinonin, does not display slow, tight binding as <italic>K<sub>I*</sub></italic>  =  <italic>K<sub>I</sub></italic>. This impact on binding is consistent with the absence of the hydrogen bond involving the first carbonyl group of the ligand. The 3D structure of <italic>At</italic>PDF was determined after soaking the compound in crystals of the free, open <italic>At</italic>PDF form. Upon binding, <bold><italic>6b</italic></bold> induced a complete conformational change, identical to that observed with actinonin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g002">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g006">6A</xref>; “O” state). This result further suggests that the conformational change is not induced initially by the formation of this hydrogen bond and that the encounter complex is primarily driven by the fit within the S1' pocket. This also reveals that the timescale of the large conformational change is several orders of magnitude faster than the kinetics of slow binding and fully compatible with both the first step of actinonin binding (<italic>k<sub>4</sub></italic>  = 140 s<sup>−1</sup>; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001066-t001">Table 1</xref>) and the catalytic rate of the substrate (<italic>k<sub>ca</sub></italic><sub>t</sub>  = 37 s<sup>−1</sup>; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001066-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s013">Table S3</xref>). The 3D structure also revealed that both the P1' and the hydroxamate groups are bound similarly to the corresponding groups of actinonin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).

        <p>Taken together, these data allow us to conclude that the conformational change observed upon ligand binding is triggered primarily by binding in the S1' pocket. As revealed by the binding of <bold><italic>6b</italic></bold>, the one carbon longer metal-binding group fits, immediately upon recognition of the P1' group, in the S1' pocket and forms a bidentate complex with the metal cation, mimicking the transition state as a result. Thus, the active site is very confined and rigid due to the presence and length of the hydroxamate group (compare right and left panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). As a result, compared to the complex made with the substrate, it is likely that the formation of the hydrogen bond involving the carbonyl of actinonin and the backbone nitrogen of Ile42 becomes strongly rate-limiting (<italic>k<sub>5</sub></italic>  = 0.044 s<sup>−1</sup>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001066-t001">Table 1</xref>). Once this hydrogen link is locked, the uncleavable bond, mimicking the labile formyl group at the transition state, stabilizes the enzyme-inhibitor complex, making it long-lasting (<italic>k<sub>6</sub></italic>  = 0.0006 s<sup>−1</sup>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001066-t001">Table 1</xref>) and providing a mechanistic explanation for the slow-binding effect that involves both large and fine conformational changes. The large conformational change is similar to the one occurring with the substrate, whereas the second is more subtle and locks the hydrogen bond involving the backbone nitrogen of Ile42. The second step is rate-limiting with some transition state analogs such as actinonin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g005">Figure 5B and C</xref>).</p>

        <p>The aforementioned data indicate that the occurrence of a S1'-binding group placed in the unfavorable context of a reverse peptide bond does not stably promote binding at the active site of <italic>At</italic>PDF. Upon binding of <bold><italic>21</italic></bold>, the 3D structure of both molecules of the asymmetric unit remain in an O conformation (r.m.s.d. &lt;0.2 Å with respect to the apo-structures in the “O” state). This finding suggests that only the binding of compounds entering the S1' pocket, such as actinonin or <bold><italic>6b</italic></bold>, induces conformational change, in keeping with the crucial role of the P1' group if located in the frame of a classic peptide bond. Moreover, we noticed that the binding pocket of <bold><italic>21</italic></bold> was located on the rear side of the true S1' pocket and induced a weak modification of the P1' hosting platform (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s009">Figure S9D</xref>). Indeed, when crystals of the <bold><italic>21</italic></bold>:<italic>At</italic>PDF complex were soaked in actinonin, the final 3D structure no longer showed evidence of compound <bold><italic>21</italic></bold> occupancy greater than 5%. Instead, this structure revealed both actinonin and closing of the protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s012">Table S2</xref>).

      <p>Although PDF catalysis has been extensively studied and the mechanism has been elucidated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Becker1">[34]</xref>, how the enzyme achieves the catalytically competent state remains unknown. Here, we provide insight on how the enzyme might reach a catalytically competent conformation, demonstrating that the reactive groups move into proximity to promote catalysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g002">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g005">5C</xref>). We suggest that the motions of the catalytic centre starting with free ligand-PDF favor a final configuration that is optimal for binding and/or catalysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g001">Figures 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g002">2B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g005">5B and C</xref>). In our model, we propose that free PDF might exist in at least two conformational states, that is, open (O) or super-closed (S). The relative abundance of each conformation varies by enzyme type and incubation conditions, explaining why both conformations have not been trapped thus far. In the case of <italic>At</italic>PDF, it is likely that the most abundant form corresponds to an O state, which is the form that leads to a productive complex. Indeed, in the NMR spectra for <italic>Ec</italic>PDF, a few residues show exchange cross-peaks from an additional, alternative form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Dardel1">[38]</xref>. The most strongly affected residues are Cys90, one of the metal ligands, its neighbor Leu91, as well as Ala47 and Ala48 on the facing strand. This suggests that <italic>Ec</italic>PDF exists in at least two conformations (“S” and “C”; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), which undergo slow interconversion on the NMR timescale. The 3D structure of the major conformation (75%, lifetime 300 ms) could be solved at high resolution, but the structure of the minor form (25%, lifetime 100 ms), which exhibits very weak signals, could not be solved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Dardel1">[38]</xref>. This conformation appears to correspond to that of the complex obtained with the product of the reaction (Met-Ala-Ser). A very similar situation—although more balanced between the two states—appears to occur in the case of variant G41M, suggesting that a mechanism involving conformational selection followed by induced fit is a general model for PDF and that <italic>At</italic>PDF is a specific case where population shift virtually does not occur as the free enzyme is completely in the O conformation. This is also in line with data obtained with <italic>L. interrogans</italic> PDF (<italic>Li</italic>PDF), which reveal conformers in both the S and C states (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) and suggest a population-shift mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Zhou1">[43]</xref>. It is interesting to note that <italic>Li</italic>PDF is a poorly active PDF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Li1">[60]</xref>. According to the representation shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> PDF (<italic>Pf</italic>PDF), a poorly active PDF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-BracchiRicard1">[61]</xref>, was retrieved only in the S state. Finally, weak decompaction of the structure of <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> PDFs in the presence of actinonin have been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Yoon1">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Moon1">[46]</xref>. These examples suggest that the enzyme is trapped in the S conformer in the free state and converts to the C conformer when bound to actinonin, suggesting that the S conformer is overrepresented in solution compared to the O state, unlike <italic>At</italic>PDF.</p>
      <p>This study of <italic>At</italic>PDF—including 10 different crystal structures of apo- and complexed enzyme variants—reveals the 3D structure of a PDF in at least four distinct states. This includes the O form, the occurrence of which is crucial for catalysis, as it is the active form. Here, we propose that the transition from the O to the C state is directly induced by the ligand. Indeed, the O form, which is captured in the crystal, undergoes closure directly upon ligand binding in our soaking experiments. Progression to this closure involves intermediary states (“I”) similar to those observed with variants G41Q and G41M in the presence of actinonin (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Extrapolating the situation to catalysis, which occurs in the crystalline states of PDF, it is likely that hydrolysis of the substrate frees the enzyme in its S state, which in turn needs to open to accommodate a new substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g002">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g005">5C</xref>). This is well illustrated in the 3D structure of <italic>Ec</italic>PDF complexed with a product of the reaction, obtained after co-crystallization of the enzyme with the substrate in a closed conformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Becker1">[34]</xref>. The S free form is likely to exhibit a slower on-rate for the ligand (<italic>k<sub>3</sub></italic>) compared to the O form because of steric occlusion of the active site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s010">Figure S10</xref>). In support of this hypothesis, recent data show that the 3D structure of a C-terminally truncated, poorly active version of <italic>At</italic>PDF is in the C conformation in the unbound state, although crystallized under conditions identical to ours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Dirk1">[62]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Dirk2">[63]</xref>. This structure is similar to that of chain B, one of the two molecules of the asymmetric subunit of variant G41M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This suggests that alterations remote from the active site significantly unbalance the equilibrium between the two conformers, thus altering the efficiency of the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). As the S version corresponds to a significantly less active version of <italic>At</italic>PDF compared to that reported in our present work, this further confirms that, compared to the O state, the S state has a significantly weaker propensity to bind substrate or a close mimic ligand, such as actinonin. Comparison of the 3D structures of the free-closed and the ligand-bound-closed forms reveals some differences responsible for the slight steric reduction of the active site of free-closed <italic>At</italic>PDF1B with respect to that of the actinonin-<italic>At</italic>PDF1B complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s010">Figure S10A</xref>), including the side chain of Ile42 burying the S1' binding pocket (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001066.s010">Figure S10B</xref>). Overall, these data suggest that an S form might exist under the free state but that it would feature a <italic>k<sub>3</sub></italic> value with respect to the ligand that is significantly weaker than that of the O form, which would strongly slow down the reaction or the binding as a result.</p>
      <p>With the interaction scheme proposed in our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g005">Figure 5B and C</xref>), the ligand/substrate binds more easily to the O form and induces the optimal conformation of the enzyme to reach the transition state, thus allowing the reaction to be efficiently catalyzed. In the final model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), there is both conformational selection and induced fit subsequently involved in line with the recently proposed existence of such mixed mechanisms for other enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Benkovic2">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Hammes2">[16]</xref>. Nevertheless, in our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), we suggest that induced fit is the primary mechanism, as it provides energy input from the ligand, which eventually drives the enzyme towards the productive key-lock complex. Unambiguous distinction between the relative contributions of the two mechanisms is deduced from the observation that <italic>k<sub>ob</sub></italic><sub>s</sub> is a saturable function of actinonin with various PDF, including <italic>Ec</italic>PDF, <italic>Bs</italic>PDF, <italic>At</italic>PDF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001066-g004">Figure 4B and C</xref>), and <italic>S. aureus</italic> PDF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Tummino1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Hammes2">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-VanAller1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Boularot1">[49]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Using crystallographic reconstruction analysis involving enzyme variants, motions of small mobile loops and movie reconstructions of snapshots of catalytic events have been previously documented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Knowles1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Benkovic1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Lee1">[64]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Parker1">[66]</xref>, often by visualizing the binding of unnatural inhibitors and not necessarily mimicking closely the substrate and transition state as actinonin does <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Towler1">[67]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Teague1">[68]</xref>. However, only a few examples make use of soaking conditions of a crystal to promote the motion and show the importance of induced fit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Knowles1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Geremia1">[69]</xref>. None of these data show a motion of the amplitude revealed here with PDF and a large stabilization of the complex involving the formation of the four-stranded β-sheet superstructure and the entire N-domain of the enzyme. Compared to previous crystallographic analyses, our work integrates biophysical, computational, and kinetic analyses to reconstruct the whole picture, allowing a better understanding of the slow-binding mechanism.</p>
      <p>While our work primarily focused on an induced-fit mechanism of enzyme inhibition and catalysis, it should be emphasized that this phenomenon is also applicable to the broader area of receptor-ligand interactions. For example, in all cases where conformational change mechanisms have been proposed for kinase inhibitors without supporting experimental data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Tummino1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Copeland2">[26]</xref>, further experimental work must be provided to clarify the precise mechanism. We expect this will have important implications on how one conducts future drug-discovery efforts against such enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Pargellis1">[70]</xref>.</p>

The ten final models were obtained by manual rebuilding using TURBO-FRODO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Roussel1">[77]</xref> and combined with refinement of only calculated phases using CNS and Refmac <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Murshudov1">[78]</xref> software. No non-crystallographic symmetries were used. Quality control of the three models was performed using the PROCHECK program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Laskowski1">[79]</xref>. To probe for alternative conformers, Ringer was used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Lang1">[53]</xref>.

          <p>Alignment of PDF sequences and secondary structures. (A) PDF1B from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<italic>At</italic>PDF1B) is compared with bacterial type 1B (<italic>Ec</italic>PDF and <italic>Li</italic>PDF), pathogenic protozoa (<italic>Pf</italic>PDF1B), eukaryotic mitochondrial PDF1A from <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<italic>At</italic>PDF1A), and bacterial type 2 (<italic>Bs</italic>PDF2). This figure was created with ENDscript <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Gouet1">[80]</xref>. The sequence alignment was realized with the algorithm muscle included in ENDscript, and modified according to the superimposition of structures. The blue frames indicate conserved residues, white characters in red boxes indicate strict identity, and red characters in yellow boxes indicate homology. The secondary structures at the top (α-helices, 3<sub>10</sub> helices, <italic>β</italic>-strands, and <italic>β</italic>-turns are shown by medium squiggles, small squiggles, arrows, and TT letters, respectively) were predicted by DSSP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Kabsch2">[81]</xref>. Relative accessibility (acc) of subunit A is shown by a blue-colored bar below sequence. White is buried, cyan is intermediate, and blue with red borders is highly exposed. A red box means that relative accessibility is not calculated for the residue, because it is truncated. Hydropathy (hyd) is calculated from the sequence according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001066-Kyte1">[82]</xref>. It is shown by a second bar below accessibility: pink is hydrophobic, grey is intermediate, and cyan is hydrophilic. Motifs 1 (<sub>41</sub>G<italic>φ</italic>G<italic>φ</italic>AA<italic>X</italic>Q<sub>48</sub>), 2 (<sub>89</sub>EGCLS<sub>93</sub>), and 3 (<sub>133</sub>HE<italic>φ</italic>DH<sub>137</sub>), where <italic>φ</italic> is a hydrophobic amino acid, are labeled by red stars below the sequence alignment. To simplify the nomenclature, <italic>At</italic>PDF1B is referred to as <italic>At</italic>PDF throughout the text. (B) Topology cartoon of <italic>At</italic>PDF, free (left) or actinonin bound (right), in the same color code as (A). Actinonin (represented by the yellow arrow) binding to the ligand binding site allows the linkage of the two distinct <italic>β</italic>-sheets into one single <italic>β</italic>-sheet, by mimicking an additional <italic>β</italic>-strand.

(A) Crystal pack of the two complexes: open, free complex (left) and bound to actinonin (right) (B). Non-crystallographic contacts into asymmetric unit are not modified by closing movement of the protein due to actinonin binding, except for zinc atom number 6. This metal ion is coordinated by side chains of Asp40 and Glu63, and water molecules, Asp40 and Glu63 being hydrogen bonded by side chain of Lys38 of the other subunit of the asymmetric unit. With the closing movement of the protein into the crystal, Cα of Asp40 shifted by 3.1 Å and its side chain flipped by 90°. Therefore, it does no longer participate to the coordination shell of this Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion. However, it is still hydrogen bonded by Lys38 from chain B.</p>
