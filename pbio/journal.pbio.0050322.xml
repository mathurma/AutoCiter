				<article-title>Secretory Protein mRNA Finds Another Way Out</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>In eukaryotic cells, most mRNAs are exported from the nucleus by the transcription export (TREX) complex, which is loaded onto mRNAs after their splicing and capping. We have studied in mammalian cells the nuclear export of mRNAs that code for secretory proteins, which are targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by hydrophobic signal sequences. The mRNAs were injected into the nucleus or synthesized from injected or transfected DNA, and their export was followed by fluorescent in situ hybridization. We made the surprising observation that the signal sequence coding region (SSCR) can serve as a nuclear export signal of an mRNA that lacks an intron or functional cap. Even the export of an intron-containing natural mRNA was enhanced by its SSCR. Like conventional export, the SSCR-dependent pathway required the factor TAP, but depletion of the TREX components had only moderate effects. The SSCR export signal appears to be characterized in vertebrates by a low content of adenines, as demonstrated by genome-wide sequence analysis and by the inhibitory effect of silent adenine mutations in SSCRs. The discovery of an SSCR-mediated pathway explains the previously noted amino acid bias in signal sequences and suggests a link between nuclear export and membrane targeting of mRNAs.</p>

          <title/>
          <p>In eukaryotic cells, precursors of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are synthesized and processed in the nucleus. During processing, noncoding introns are spliced out, and a cap and poly-adenosine sequence are added to the beginning and end of the transcript, respectively. The resulting mature mRNA is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by crossing the nuclear pore. Both the introns and the cap help to recruit factors that are necessary for nuclear export of an mRNA. Here we provide evidence for a novel mRNA export pathway that is specific for transcripts coding for secretory proteins. These proteins contain signal sequences that target them for translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. We made the surprising observation that the signal sequence coding region (SSCR) can serve as a nuclear export signal of an mRNA that lacks an intron or functional cap.

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In eukaryotes, mRNAs are synthesized and processed in the nucleus before they are transported through the nuclear pores into the cytoplasm, where they are translated into proteins. Nuclear export of most mRNAs is mediated by the conserved transcription export (TREX) complex that is comprised of the Tho complex, UAP56, and Aly. In vertebrates, the TREX components are recruited to the 5′ end of newly synthesized transcripts by the combined action of the 5′ cap binding complex, CBP80/20, and factors that are loaded during the splicing of the intron closest to the 5′ cap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b004">4</xref>]. Once assembled, the TREX complex recruits the heterodimer TAP/p15 as an export factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b006">6</xref>]. TAP interacts with nucleoporins directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b009">9</xref>] or through the factor Rae1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b011">11</xref>] and may thus allow bound transcripts to enter and eventually pass through the nuclear pores. It remains unclear how mRNAs exit the pores on the cytoplasmic side, but RNA helicases, such as Dbp5, may be involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b013">13</xref>]. Although many details of the export mechanism remain to be clarified, it seems clear that the efficient export of most mRNAs requires both splicing and a functional cap.</p>
      <p>Not all mRNAs follow this canonical export pathway. In higher eukaryotes, transcripts coding for cyclin D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b014">14</xref>] and other regulators of cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b015">15</xref>] use elements in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) as well as the cap binding protein eIF4E to engage the exportin protein Crm1. A Crm1-dependent pathway is also used for the export of the intron-containing RNA genome of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b016">16</xref>]. In macrophages, the export of interferon-induced transcripts is sensitive to the levels of Nup96, a component of the nuclear pore, whereas other transcripts are insensitive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b017">17</xref>]. In <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content>, the export of some mRNAs requires either the Aly ortholog Yra1p or the TAP ortholog Mex67p, but not both [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b018">18</xref>]. Transcripts coding for heat-shock proteins, such as Hsp70p, are also exported by an Aly-independent pathway that is stimulated under stress conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b019">19</xref>]. Together, these data indicate that there may be distinct export pathways for certain classes of mRNAs, which may be related to the different functions of the final translation products.</p>
      <p>One specialized class of mRNAs codes for secretory proteins. These mRNAs are often translated by ribosomes that are targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. As a result, the mRNAs also become membrane-bound. In addition, it is possible that these mRNAs associate with the ER membrane in a ribosome-independent manner by interacting with RNA-binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b022">22</xref>]. These proteins may be loaded onto the mRNAs in the nucleus, during their passage through the nuclear pores, or in the cytoplasm. Thus, the membrane localization of these mRNAs may require factors that mediate nuclear export and distribution in the cytoplasm, which are distinct from factors used by mRNAs translated on free ribosomes in the cytoplasm.</p>
      <p>A major characteristic of a secretory protein is a hydrophobic signal sequence close to its N terminus. The signal sequence is first recognized by the signal-recognition particle (SRP) as it emerges from the translating ribosome and is then transferred into the protein-conducting channel formed by the Sec61p complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b025">25</xref>]. In most cases, the signal sequence is cleaved during or shortly after the polypeptide is transferred into the ER. Although the major requirement for a signal sequence is a stretch of at least 6–7 hydrophobic amino acids, there appear to be other, poorly defined properties that may distinguish different signal sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b027">27</xref>]. For example, some signal sequences require auxiliary translocation components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b029">29</xref>] or are sensitive to the drug cotransin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b030">30</xref>]. In addition, signal sequences have other unexplained characteristics. For example, it has been noted that signal sequences in humans tend to be rich in leucine and poor in isoleucine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b031">31</xref>], despite the fact that these two amino acids have similar hydrophobicities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b032">32</xref>] and would thus be expected to function equally well to promote translocation. This leucine/isoleucine bias is not seen in prokaryotes. Another puzzling feature is that signal sequences are often conserved across species to a higher degree than expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b033">33</xref>]. These observations raise the possibility that not only the signal sequence per se, but also the encoding nucleotide sequence (signal sequence coding region or SSCR) may have a function.</p>
      <p>We report here on the nuclear export of mRNAs coding for secretory proteins. We used microinjection of mRNAs and DNAs as well as transfection of DNA to demonstrate that the SSCR can promote the export of mRNAs that cannot use the conventional pathway because they lack an intron or a functional cap. By using large-scale sequence analysis, we found that vertebrate SSCRs have a low content of adenine, a feature that may in part be responsible for the preference of leucine versus isoleucine in signal sequences. Consistent with these observations, the incorporation of silent adenine mutations within the SSCR inhibits its nuclear export activity. Even the export of a natural RNA containing introns is facilitated by its SSCR. The discovery of an SSCR-mediated mRNA export pathway thus explains the previously noted amino acid bias in signal sequences and suggests a link between nuclear export and membrane targeting of mRNAs.</p>

        <title>Efficient Splicing and Translation of Microinjected t-ftz RNA</title>
        <p>To study the nuclear export of mRNA coding for a secretory protein, we used a model mRNA that is derived from a fragment of the <italic>fushi tarazu</italic> (<italic>ftz</italic>) gene. The original construct contains an intron and was previously used to monitor mRNA splicing and nuclear export in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b034">34</xref>]. The construct was modified by adding a Kozak consensus sequence to allow efficient expression in mammalian cells. Sequences encoding FLAG and hemagglutinin (HA) epitopes were included at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the open reading frame (ORF), respectively, to monitor translation of the mRNA. Because the intron contains in-frame stop codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g001">Figure 1</xref>A; asterisks), the HA epitope will only be synthesized if the mRNA is spliced. To target the translation product to the ER, we attached an SSCR derived from the mouse major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class 2 molecule H2-K1. The final construct is called t-ftz-i (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.0050322.sg001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

            <p>(B) The indicated transcripts were translated in vitro using reticulocyte lysate in the presence of <sup>35</sup>S-methionine. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and newly synthesized proteins were detected by autoradiography.</p>
            <p>(C) t-ftz-i was microinjected into either the nuclei (lanes 2–4) or cytoplasm (lane 5) of 20 NIH 3T3 cells, which were then incubated for the indicated times. RT-PCR was performed on the cell extracts using the intron flanking oligonucleotides indicated in (A). The lower band represents the spliced product, and the upper band represents the unspliced product. 18S rRNA was amplified and used as a loading control. Molecular weight markers (M) were loaded in lane 1.</p>
            <p>(D and E) NIH 3T3 cells were microinjected with t-ftz-i mRNA. FITC-conjugated 70-kDa dextran was co-injected to mark the injected compartment (insets). Cells were incubated for 4 h, fixed and immunostained for either FLAG (D) or HA (E) epitopes and for TRAPα. Overlays of the expressed epitope (green) and TRAPα (red) are shown in the last panel. Scale bar = 10 μm.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>We first tested the translation of the t-ftz-i mRNA in vitro. When translated in reticulocyte lysate, a polypeptide of 13 kDa was generated, consistent with the size expected from the location of the in-frame stop codon in the intron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, lane 3). When the intron was deleted, the resulting mRNA (t-ftz-Δi) gave rise to a 17-kDa translation product (lane 4), again in agreement with the expected size of the ORF. With the original ftz constructs that lacked translation initiation signals, no translational products were detected (lanes 1, 2).</p>
        <p>When t-ftz-i mRNA was microinjected into nuclei of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, it was efficiently spliced within 15 min, as shown by reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g001">Figure 1</xref>C; lanes 2–4). As expected, no detectable splicing was observed when t-ftz-i was microinjected into the cytoplasm (lane 5). Next, we tested the translation of t-ftz-i transcripts that were microinjected into the nuclei of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Nuclear injection was confirmed by co-injecting fluorescently labeled 70-kDa dextran, which is too large to passively cross the nuclear pores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g001">Figure 1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g001">1</xref>E; see insets). After 4 h, the FLAG and HA epitopes could be detected by immunofluorescence microscopy in over 90% of the injected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g001">Figure 1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g001">1</xref>E). In addition, both epitopes co-localized with the ER resident protein TRAPα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g001">Figure 1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g001">1</xref>E), indicating that the translation product was translocated into the ER. The protein is probably not secreted efficiently, because it contains only a fragment of ftz and therefore may not be properly folded. When t-ftz-i transcripts were injected into the cytoplasm, the expression of the FLAG but not of the HA epitope was observed (unpublished data), as expected from the presence of the unspliced intron. Both the FLAG and HA epitopes were expressed when t-ftz-Δi transcripts were injected into nuclei or cytoplasm (unpublished data).</p>

        <title>Nuclear mRNA Export Requires Splicing or the SSCR</title>
        <p>To monitor the nuclear export of t-ftz-i mRNA, transcripts were microinjected into nuclei of NIH 3T3 cells. The cells were fixed at various time points, and the localization of the injected RNA was probed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We optimized the FISH procedure, omitting harsh acid and ethanol treatments, such that intracellular morphology was largely maintained. We estimate that 20,000 to 50,000 transcripts were injected per cell, which is a small number compared with the total number of transcripts in a typical mammalian cell (400,000 to 850,000 molecules) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b035">35</xref>]. Again, fluorescent 70-kDa dextran was co-injected to identify nuclear-injected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g002">Figure 2</xref>, insets). Immediately after injection, the transcripts were confined to the nucleus. Over time, however, the majority of t-ftz-i transcripts (∼80%) accumulated in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Quantitation showed that the half-time of mRNA export was ∼15 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g002">Figure 2</xref>C), similar to previous estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b037">37</xref>].

        </fig>
        <p>Surprisingly, when we injected t-ftz-Δi mRNA into nuclei, we also observed efficient export into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g002">Figure 2</xref>B; quantitation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g002">Figure 2</xref>C), despite the fact that the absence of an intron should have prevented the recruitment of TREX components and thus nuclear export [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b004">4</xref>]. The kinetics of mRNA export was about the same for transcripts containing or lacking the intron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). In contrast to a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b038">38</xref>], a large fraction of the intron-less transcripts remained stable over the time of analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g002">Figure 2</xref>D).</p>
        <p>To exclude the possibility that the nuclear export of the intron-less transcript is caused by the introduction of exogenously synthesized mRNAs, we tested the export of mRNA after its synthesis in the nucleus. To this end, we microinjected plasmids containing the t-ftz-Δi or t-ftz-i genes into NIH 3T3 nuclei. After 30 min, the RNA Polymerase II inhibitor α-amanitin was added to inhibit further transcription, and then the distribution of mRNA over time was monitored using FISH. Immediately after α-amanitin addition, most transcripts were in the nucleus, but ∼20% were already found in the cytoplasm. Over time, the nuclear fraction was efficiently exported to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g002">Figure 2</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g002">2</xref>F) with a rate that was slightly lower than that of microinjected RNA. As before, we observed only minor differences between intron-containing and intron-lacking t-ftz transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g002">Figure 2</xref>F). Pretreatment of cells with α-amanitin 5 min prior to DNA microinjection completely inhibited mRNA synthesis, as assayed by FISH (unpublished data). From these results, we conclude that export of an intron-lacking mRNA can occur efficiently, regardless of whether or not export is coupled to transcription.</p>
        <p>Our results are in apparent contradiction to previous observations showing that ftz constructs lacking introns are not exported from nuclei of <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b001">1</xref>]. A major difference to the transcripts tested in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes is the presence of an SSCR in t-ftz-Δi. We therefore tested whether the SSCR was required to promote nuclear export of this mRNA. Indeed, a transcript that lacked the SSCR, and thus encoded a cytoplasmic version of ftz (c-ftz-Δi), remained in the nucleus 30 min after injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g002">Figure 2</xref>G, quantitation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g002">Figure 2</xref>C), a time during which most of the control t-ftz-Δi mRNA was exported. At later time points, much of the c-ftz-Δi mRNA was degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). Because c-ftz-Δi mRNA was stable when injected directly into the cytoplasm (unpublished data), it is unlikely that nuclear-injected c-ftz-Δi mRNA was exported and then rapidly degraded in the cytoplasm. The addition of an intron into c-ftz-Δi mRNA (resulting in c-ftz-i mRNA) restored nuclear export and stability of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g002">Figure 2</xref>H, quantitation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g002">Figure 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g002">2</xref>D). A fraction of the exported c-ftz-i transcripts accumulated in stress granules (unpublished data). Together, these experiments suggest that either an SSCR or an intron can serve as a nuclear export signal.</p>
        <p>To exclude the possibility that the SSCR-mediated export pathway is a peculiarity of NIH 3T3 cells, we microinjected mRNA precursors into the nuclei of COS-7 cells. As before, t-ftz-i mRNA containing both the splicing and the SSCR signals—as well as t-ftz-Δi and c-ftz-i mRNAs, which each contain only one of the two signals—were exported efficiently into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.0050322.sg002">Figure S2</xref>; quantitation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). In contrast, c-ftz-Δi mRNA lacking both signals was not exported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.0050322.sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Again, the c-ftz-Δi mRNA was significantly less stable than the other mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). These data suggest that the SSCR-mediated nuclear export pathway may be present in many mammalian cell types.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>In COS-7 cells, we were able to visualize the targeting of the mRNAs to the ER membrane. All mRNAs containing an SSCR gave a typical reticular staining in the cytoplasm and co-localized with TRAPα, a marker of the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.0050322.sg002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>To test whether other SSCRs could promote mRNA export, we replaced the SSCR of the MHC class 2 molecule H2-K1 with that of human insulin in the t-ftz-Δi construct (ins-ftz-Δi, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.0050322.sg003">Figure S3</xref>). When injected into COS-7 cell nuclei, ins-ftz-Δi mRNA was efficiently exported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.0050322.sg002">Figure S2</xref>). In fact, the export kinetics was faster than with t-ftz-Δi mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). Again, the mRNA was targeted to the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.0050322.sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that the SSCR-mediated pathway may be quite general.</p>
        <p>Finally, we performed transfection experiments in COS-7 cells with plasmids coding for t-ftz and c-ftz mRNAs containing or lacking an intron. The steady-state distribution of the mRNAs between the nucleus and cytoplasm was determined by FISH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.0050322.sg004">Figure S4</xref>, quantitation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). The SSCR-containing mRNAs (t-ftz-i and t-ftz-Δi) were mostly found in the cytoplasm, indicating that they are efficiently exported from the nucleus. A significant fraction of mRNAs lacking an SSCR (c-ftz-i and c-ftz-Δi) were found in the nucleus, despite the fact that one contained an intron. In the cytoplasm, the SSCR-containing ftz constructs were targeted to the ER membrane, whereas c-ftz constructs partially co-localized with TIA-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.0050322.sg004">Figure S4</xref>), a marker of stress granules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b039">39</xref>]. These data confirm the presence of an SSCR-mediated mRNA export pathway and suggest that, at least under certain conditions, it may be more efficient than the splicing-mediated export pathway.</p>

        <title>Characterization of SSCR-Mediated mRNA Export</title>
        <p>Next we characterized SSCR-mediated mRNA export, using t-ftz-Δi mRNA that contains the SSCR signal but lacks an intron. When this mRNA was injected into nuclei of NIH 3T3 cells that had been depleted of ATP by treatment with azide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b040">40</xref>], no export into the cytoplasm was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). This treatment did not compromise the viability of the cells as judged by phase microscopy or immunostaining of the microtubule network (unpublished data). Blocking the nuclear pores by pre-injecting wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b042">42</xref>] also inhibited the nuclear export of microinjected t-ftz-Δi mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Thus the export of t-ftz-Δi mRNA requires energy and functional nuclear pores.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>As expected, nuclear mRNA export was unidirectional. When transcripts were injected into one of the nuclei of a binucleated cell, 80% of the mRNA was transported into the cytoplasm, but no fluorescence was detected in the uninjected nucleus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.0050322.sg005">Figure S5</xref>), indicating that there is no re-uptake of exported mRNA.</p>
        <p>Next we attempted to define the components required for t-ftz-Δi mRNA export. To test whether the export factor TAP is required, we took advantage of the viral constitutive transport element (CTE), which binds to and sequesters TAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b043">43</xref>]. Nuclear export of t-ftz-Δi mRNA was inhibited in cells pre-injected with CTE RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, arrow indicates a cell pre-injected with CTE, quantitation is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). In contrast, cells that were not pre-injected with CTE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, arrowhead), or cells pre-injected with control buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g004">Figure 4</xref>D), exported t-ftz-Δi mRNA. Previously, it was demonstrated that short mRNAs use the TAP-independent snRNA export pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b044">44</xref>], but our results demonstrate that the t-ftz-Δi transcripts exclusively follow the TAP-dependent pathway used by most mRNAs.</p>
        <p>We then tested the involvement of the TREX complex. To deplete the TREX complex, we incubated HeLa cells with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against the TREX component UAP56 and its ortholog URH49, a treatment that has been shown to inhibit the majority of mRNA export in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b045">45</xref>]. After one day of RNA interference (RNAi) treatment, UAP56 levels were effectively reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g004">Figure 4</xref>E). Although siRNA-treated cells were compromised for the export of c-ftz-i transcript, these cells exported both t-ftz-Δi and t-ftz-i mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g004">Figure 4</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g004">4</xref>G), suggesting that the SSCR-mediated export pathway is less sensitive to TREX complex depletion than the splicing-mediated pathway. In some cells depleted of UAP56/URH49, t-ftz-Δi and t-ftz-i transcripts became enriched in the nuclear rim, perhaps due to a pleiotropic effect that inhibits the movement of mRNAs from the nuclear pores into the cytoplasm. Cells treated with siRNA for two days showed even more nuclear rim localization of t-ftz-Δi and t-ftz-i transcripts, and their export was inhibited. Although c-ftz-i mRNA was also not exported, it only accumulated in the nucleoplasm (unpublished data), supporting the idea that different export pathways are used.</p>
        <p>As expected, the export of the intron-lacking RNA t-ftz-Δi was not reduced when a component of the exon junction complex (EJC), the RNA helicase eIF4AIII, was depleted by RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g004">Figure 4</xref>G and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.0050322.sg006">Figure S6</xref>). However, even the export of the intron-containing mRNAs t-ftz-i and c-ftz-i remained unaffected, in agreement with previous results that indicated that the EJC is not a main factor in recruiting TREX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b046">46</xref>].</p>
        <p>Finally, we tested whether the SSCR-mediated export requires a 5′ end cap, as in splicing-dependent export [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b003">3</xref>]. Because uncapped transcripts were rapidly degraded after microinjection into NIH 3T3 nuclei (unpublished data), we used mRNAs that were capped with the cap analogs ApppG or trimethyl-2,3,7-GpppG (3mGpppG). These modified caps do not associate with the cap binding complex CPB80/20 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b047">47</xref>], which is essential for the subsequent recruitment of the TREX complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b003">3</xref>] and for efficient splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b047">47</xref>]. Capping of t-ftz-Δi mRNAs with the cap analogs did not inhibit nuclear export (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g004">Figure 4</xref>H). In addition, the mRNAs were as stable as transcripts containing the natural cap, methyl-7-GpppG (mGpppG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g004">Figure 4</xref>I). In contrast, the c-ftz-i transcripts that use the splicing-dependent pathway were not exported when capped with ApppG, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g004">Figure 4</xref>H). Thus, we conclude that unlike the splicing-mediated mRNA export, the SSCR-mediated pathway does not require a natural cap.</p>

        <title>The SSCR Nuclear Export Signal Is an RNA Element</title>
        <p>In principle, the SSCR nuclear export signal could either be an RNA element or its translated amino acid sequence, the signal sequence.

        <p>To further ensure that the translation product of the SSCR did not determine mRNA export from the nucleus, we altered the ORF of the SSCR. We added a nucleotide at the beginning of the sequence and deleted a nucleotide at the end, such that the coding region following the SSCR remained unchanged. The altered SSCR codes for a less hydrophobic sequence. The frame-shifted ftz transcript (fs-ftz-Δi, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.0050322.sg003">Figure S3</xref>) was again efficiently exported into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g005">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g005">5</xref>B). As expected, it was not targeted to the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g005">Figure 5</xref>A), and its translation product remained in the cytoplasm (unpublished data). Transcripts that lacked a translation start codon at the beginning of the SSCR (UUG-ftz-Δi, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.0050322.sg003">Figure S3</xref>) were also efficiently exported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g005">Figure 5</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.0050322.sg002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>To further confirm that translation of the t-ftz-Δi transcript was not required for its export, cells were pretreated with pactamycin, an inhibitor of translation initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b049">49</xref>], before being microinjected. Although translation was effectively inhibited after 15 min of drug treatment, as assayed by <sup>35</sup>S-methionine incorporation (unpublished data), an even longer pretreatment with pactamycin (20 min) did not inhibit t-ftz-Δi mRNA export or affect t-ftz-Δi stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g005">Figure 5</xref>C–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g005">5</xref>E). Interestingly, after 1 h of pactamycin pretreatment, mRNA export was inhibited and nuclear rim staining was seen, as in cells depleted of the TREX components UAP56 and URH49, which suggests that in both conditions, the synthesis of a factor required for the movement of the mRNA from the nuclear pores into the cytoplasm is impaired.</p>
        <p>From these experiments, we conclude that the nuclear export signal of the SSCR does not require translation and is thus likely an RNA element.</p>

        <title>SSCRs in Vertebrates Are Deficient in Adenines</title>
        <p>To identify features in SSCRs that might function as nuclear export signals, we performed a large-scale sequence analysis of various genomes. We confined our analysis to the first 69 base pairs (bp) following the initiator methionine codon, a length that covers most SSCRs. We used the annotation in Ensembl and PSORTdb to classify genes into SSCR-containing and SSCR-lacking ORFs in genomes ranging from bacteria to humans. As an additional control, we analyzed 69 bp in the central region of each ORF, which should reflect the overall base composition of the coding region. This analysis showed that the SSCRs in all eukaryotes have a marked deficiency of adenines, in contrast to those in bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). Consistent with this observation, eukaryotic SSCRs have long nucleotide stretches devoid of adenines (no-A tracts) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). The no-A tracks were longer in vertebrates than in invertebrates.</p>

        <p>Several factors account for the adenine deficiency in SSCRs. First, hydrophobic amino acids, which are enriched in the signal sequence, have codons that contain few adenines. Another factor is bias among amino acids with similar biochemical properties, such that amino acids encoded by codons with fewer adenines are used. This is illustrated by leucine, which has few adenine-containing codons, and isoleucine, which has at least one adenine in each of its codons. As previously noted, human signal sequences have significantly more leucine residues than equally hydrophobic isoleucine residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b031">31</xref>]. We confirmed this leucine-versus-isoleucine bias for SSCRs in all vertebrates analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). A similar analysis was performed on positively charged amino acids that are frequently found in the amino acid sequence preceding the hydrophobic core of a signal sequence. Arginine is encoded by codons containing relatively few adenines, whereas lysine is encoded by AAA and AAG, and arginines were significantly more frequent than lysines in vertebrate, but not invertebrate, SSCRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g006">Figure 6</xref>D). In total, about 15% to 25% of the adenine deficiency in SSCRs in vertebrates is caused by selection between similar amino acids for those encoded by codons with lower adenine content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.0050322.sg007">Figure S7</xref>). The third factor that contributes to the adenine deficiency is a bias toward codons lacking adenine for amino acids that are encoded by multiple codons (e.g., CUC versus CUA). This is illustrated by the usage of codons for leucine and serine. In vertebrates, the adenine-lacking codons for both amino acids are more frequently used than the ones containing adenines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g006">Figure 6</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g006">6</xref>F). The bias against adenine-containing codons in vertebrate SSCRs could also be seen when the analysis was extended to all amino acids that are encoded by both adenine-lacking and -containing codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g006">Figure 6</xref>G). In total, bias between synonymous codons accounts for an additional 15% to 25% of the adenine deficiency in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.0050322.sg007">Figure S7</xref>). In humans, the bias between similar amino acids and between synonymous codons together account for almost half of the total adenine deficiency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.0050322.sg007">Figure S7</xref>). Our analysis suggests that over the course of evolution, there was a strong selection against adenines that was likely caused by some requirement of the nucleotide sequence, rather than of the encoded amino acid sequence.</p>
        <p>It should be noted that the two SSCRs that were tested experimentally, completely follow the rules established in the large-scale sequence analysis. The longest no-A track in the SSCRs derived from H2-K1 and insulin were 35 and 40 nucleotides, respectively. Both SSCRs contain leucines and arginines, but no isoleucines or lysines, and both have a high bias against adenine-containing codons.</p>

        <title>Adenine-Containing SSCRs Do Not Promote Efficient mRNA Export</title>
        <p>To test whether the bias against adenines within SSCRs is important for promoting mRNA export, we mutated seven nucleotides of the SSCR that were derived from the MHC class 2 molecule H2-K1 to adenines, without altering the encoded amino acid sequence (7A-ftz-Δi, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.0050322.sg003">Figure S3</xref>). Upon injection into COS-7 cell nuclei, the export of 7A-ftz-Δi mRNA into the cytoplasm was significantly less efficient than that mediated by the original SSCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g007">Figure 7</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g007">7</xref>B). The nuclear export of an intron-containing version (7A-ftz-i) was not inhibited by the mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g007">Figure 7</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g007">7</xref>B), which is consistent with the expectation that this transcript can use the splicing-dependent pathway. The exported 7A-ftz-Δi and 7A-ftz-i mRNAs were targeted to the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g007">Figure 7</xref>A) and resulted in the expression of ER-bound t-ftz protein (unpublished data), indicating that translation of the mRNAs was largely unaffected by the silent mutations. The mutations also did not grossly affect the stability of the mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g007">Figure 7</xref>C). The nuclear export of 7A-ftz-Δi mRNA was also significantly less efficient than that of t-ftz-Δi mRNA when tested in transfection experiments with plasmids coding for these RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g003">Figure 3</xref>D and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.0050322.sg004">Figure S4</xref>). In fact, the export was as inefficient as with RNA lacking an SSCR altogether, indicating that the adenine mutations severely affected the SSCR-export signal. In addition, a portion of the cytoplasmic fraction of the 7A-ftz-Δi mRNAs was localized to stress granules, as determined by co-staining with the stress granule marker TIA-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.0050322.sg004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>

        <p>An inhibitory effect of adenines on the nuclear export function of an SSCR could also be demonstrated for human insulin mRNA. We first used intronless transcripts, generated by in vitro transcription of human insulin cDNA. Upon injection into COS-7 cell nuclei, insulin mRNA with a wild-type SSCR was efficiently exported into the cytoplasm, whereas mutant mRNA, in which five silent adenine mutations were introduced into its SSCR, was significantly delayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g007">Figure 7</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g007">7</xref>E). Again, the mutations did not significantly affect the stability of the mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g007">Figure 7</xref>F).</p>
        <p>To address whether the SSCR contributed to the export of a physiologically transcribed and spliced mRNA, we microinjected plasmids that contained the insulin gene with its two introns under the control of the CMV promoter (insulin-2i). After 30 min, transcription was blocked with α-amanitin, and nuclear export of the newly synthesized transcripts was followed over the course of 2 h. The rate of mRNA export was significantly decreased when silent adenine mutations were incorporated into the SSCR of intron-containing or -lacking mRNAs (5A-insulin-2i and 5A-insulin-Δi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g007">Figure 7</xref>G). On the other hand, deletion of the introns (insulin-Δi) had no effect. All the tested transcripts were stable over the tested time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g007">Figure 7</xref>H). From these experiments we conclude that a functional SSCR can enhance the export of mRNAs, regardless of whether they contain or lack introns. These results provide evidence that the SSCR-mediated pathway operates within the context of a natural gene.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we describe the surprising discovery of a nuclear export pathway in mammalian cells that appears to be specific for mRNAs coding for secretory proteins. We found that mRNAs lacking an intron or functional cap, which cannot use the canonical, splicing-dependent pathway, can efficiently be exported into the cytoplasm by means of a signal in the SSCR. The signal is an RNA element that is deficient in adenines. Thus, the SSCR not only codes for the hydrophobic amino acid sequence that targets the translation product to the ER membrane, but also functions at the nucleotide level to promote the export of the mRNA from the nucleus. The SSCR even enhances the export of natural transcripts containing introns. Like the splicing-dependent pathway, the SSCR-mediated export pathway requires the export factor TAP, but it is less dependent, or perhaps even independent, of the TREX complex. Our sequence analysis suggests that the SSCR-mediated pathway may exist in all vertebrates.</p>
      <p>Why would mRNAs coding for secretory proteins use a separate nuclear export pathway? One possibility is that nuclear export of these mRNAs might be coupled with some downstream event in the cytoplasm. For example, it is possible that the mRNAs emerging from the nuclear pores are initially associated with proteins that keep them translationally silenced and promote their distribution in the cytoplasm. These factors could be distinct from those used by mRNAs coding for cytoplasmic proteins. For example, factors associated with SSCR containing transcripts could have affinity for ER membrane proteins or molecular motors. The recent observation of an association of the TAP homolog, NXF2, with kinesin lends support to the idea that the export and cytoplasmic distribution of mRNAs may be coupled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b050">50</xref>]. Our own data show that in transfection experiments in which the steady-state distribution of mRNAs was investigated, transcripts with defective or lacking SSCRs were not only inefficiently exported but also often accumulated in cytoplasmic stress granules, indicating that their normal cytoplasmic distribution was disrupted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.0050322.sg004">Figure S4</xref>). How nuclear mRNA export would be coupled with downstream events remains to be elucidated. It is also possible that the export of mRNAs coding for secretory proteins is regulated differently from other mRNAs in certain situations. However, we have not found any changes of SSCR-mediated mRNA export upon accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER (unpublished data). In yeast, a block in secretion results in the relocalization of certain nuclear pore components to the cytoplasm and leads to the inhibition of protein transport between the nucleus and the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b052">52</xref>]. Conceivably, this mechanism may also provide a feedback signal between the demand of secretory protein synthesis in the cytoplasm and the nuclear export of the corresponding SSCR-containing mRNAs.</p>
      <p>The mechanism by which SSCRs are recognized and trigger nuclear mRNA export also remains to be investigated. A clear nucleotide motif that is common among all SSCRs is not obvious. One possibility is that a negative export regulator would bind to all adenine-containing, non-SSCR sequences. However, we favor models in which either the paucity of adenines per se is recognized by an export-mediating protein with a similar RNA-binding specificity as the Muscleblind family of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b053">53</xref>], or that the adenine-lacking segment of an SSCR folds into a conformation that would recruit an export factor. Regardless of the precise signal, its position at the 5′ end of the mRNA would allow this part of the mRNA to emerge into the cytoplasm first, in the same direction of mRNA export used in the splicing-dependent pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b054">54</xref>]. Although many SSCR-containing mRNAs also contain introns, the 5′ end localization of the SSCR signal might allow it to recruit factors to the newly synthesized transcript before the introns are synthesized and thereby overrule the splicing-dependent signals.</p>
      <p>Our data indicate that the SSCR recruits TAP, likely without involvement of TREX. One possibility is that the serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins serve as adaptors for TAP binding. SR proteins associate with mRNAs during transcription and/or splicing. They are required for splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b055">55</xref>], can associate with TAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b056">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b057">57</xref>], and are involved in the export of intron-lacking histone H2A mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b058">58</xref>]. We have not been able to prevent SSCR-dependent mRNA export by pre-injection of an SR antibody that inhibits splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b055">55</xref>] (unpublished results), but further work is required to test the possible role of the SR proteins in SSCR-mediated export.</p>
      <p>Our analysis shows that the SSCRs have a nucleotide bias that cannot be explained solely by the encoded amino acid sequence. Although these results indicate that the nucleotide sequence itself is important, there may be additional variability of signal sequences at the level of amino acids, as suggested by experiments in which different signal sequences responded differently to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b027">27</xref>]. One would assume that the SSCR-mediated mRNA export pathway operates in all eukaryotic cells, but our large-scale sequence analysis showed a clear bias against adenine-containing codons only in vertebrate SSCRs. A slight bias against adenines was seen in lower eukaryotes, but it is possible that SSCRs have additional properties that are found in all eukaryotes, for example, a common folded structure. The same argument might explain the absence of any obvious adenine bias at the 5′ end of genes coding for membrane proteins that lack a signal sequence (unpublished data), even though the corresponding mRNAs also need to be targeted to the ER and would likely take the same pathway as those coding for secretory proteins. Obviously, the surprising discovery of an SSCR-dependent export pathway for mRNAs raises a large number of interesting questions that need to be addressed in the future.</p>

        <p>Microinjections were performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b060">60</xref>]. mRNA was microinjected at 200 μg/ml along with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–conjugated 70-kDa dextran (1 mg/ml; Invitrogen). Insulin mRNA was heated to 70 °C for 10 min prior to injections. DNA was injected at 50 μg/ml along with FITC-conjugated 70-kDa dextran, and translation was inhibited with 50 μg/ml α-amanitin (Sigma). For export inhibition experiments, cells were first microinjected with WGA (3 mg/ml; Sigma) or CTE RNA (200 μg/ml) along with cascade-blue–conjugated 10-kDa dextran (Invitrogen), and then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C prior to mRNA microinjection. For azide treatments, microinjected cells were washed three times with Dulbecco's modified PBS (D-PBS; 10 mM phosphate, pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 0.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.7 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) and incubated in D-PBS supplemented with 10 mM azide (Sigma) or 10 mM D-glucose (Sigma). For pactamycin treatments, cells were incubated in DMEM (10% fetal bovine serum) with 200 nM pactamycin 20 min before microinjections.</p>

        <p>Microinjected cells were washed with D-PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscope Sciences) in D-PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X100 (Peirce) in PBS. For immunostaining, fixed samples were first incubated with primary antibodies (rabbit polyclonal against TRAPα [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050322-b061">61</xref>], goat polyclonal antibody against TIA-1 [Santa Cruz Biotechnology], 12CA5 monoclonal antibody against HA [Roche Applied Sciences], and M2 monoclonal antibody against FLAG [Sigma]) diluted 1:200 in immunostain solution (PBS, 0.1% Triton X100, 2 mg/ml RNAse free BSA; Ambion) for 30 min, washed three times with PBS, and incubated with various Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen), diluted 1:200 in immunostain solution. For FISH, fixed cells were washed with 50% formamide in 1X SSC (150 mM NaCl, 15 mM NaCitrate, pH 7.10) and then incubated overnight at 37 °C in 200-ml hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 100 mg/ml dextran sulphate, 0.02 mg/ml RNAse free BSA, 1 mg/ml <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Escherichia coli</named-content> tRNA, 5 mM VRC, 1X SSC) containing 30–50 ng oligonucleotide probe (GTCGAGCCTGCCTTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCACAACAGCCGGGACAACACCCCAT for ftz, GGTCCTCTGCCTCCCGGCGGGTCTTGGGTGTGTAGAAGAAGCCTCGTTCCCCGCACACTA for insulin) labeled at their 5′ end with Alexa-546 (Integrated DNA Technologies). Cells were washed in five times with 50% formamide in 1X SSC and images were captured using an EM-CCD Camera, Model C9100–12 (Hamamatsu) on an inverted microscope (200M, Carl Zeiss) using Metamorph software (Molecular Devices Corporation). Unaltered 14-bit images were quantified in Metamorph and analyzed in Excel (Microsoft). For each image the area (<italic>A</italic>) and the average intensity (<italic>I</italic>) of each injected nuclei (<italic>n</italic>) and cell body (<italic>b</italic>) were recorded. For the background intensity, the average intensity of an un-injected cell (<italic>u</italic>) was used. The cytoplasmic fluorescence was equal to (<italic>Ab</italic>)(<italic>Ib</italic> – <italic>Iu</italic>) – (<italic>An</italic>)(<italic>In</italic> – <italic>Iu</italic>). The ratio of cytoplasmic/total fluorescence equals [(<italic>Ab</italic>)(<italic>Ib</italic> – <italic>Iu</italic>) – (<italic>An</italic>)(<italic>In</italic> – <italic>Iu</italic>)]/[(<italic>Ab</italic>)(<italic>Ib</italic> – <italic>Iu</italic>)]. For figure production, the contrast and brightness of the aquired 14-bit micrographs were adjusted to optimize the ability to view the fluorescence. The resulting images were converted to 8-bit files using Metamorph.</p>

A Perl script (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.0050322.sd001">Protocol S1</xref>) was written to count the nucleotide content, amino acid content, and codon content, of the first 69 nucleotides, middle 69 nucleotides (offset toward the start to maintain frame as needed), and last 69 nucleotides. The script also determined the longest no-adenine and one-adenine tracks completely contained in the first 69 nucleotides. Tabulated results were examined in Excel to determine nucleotide content, codon bias, and amino acid bias. Percent of adenine bias explained by codon bias (e.g., CUC versus CUA) and similar amino acid bias (e.g., isoleucine versus leucine) was calculated by comparing the number of adenines in non–signal sequence containing proteins to the number of adenines found in signal sequence containing proteins normalized for the number of proteins.</p>

          <title>The Percent Adenine Deficiency in the SSCR Ascribed to Codon Bias and Similar Amino Acid Bias</title>
          <p>To calculate the decrease in adenine percentage in the first 69 nucleotides of SSCR-containing ORFs due to codon bias, the difference between the expected number of adenines in the SSCR, and the actual number of adenines caused by codon bias in the SSCR (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g006">Figure 6</xref>G) was divided by the total decrease in adenines (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). To calculate the decrease in adenine due to similar amino acid bias, the drop in adenine levels caused by various amino acid substitutions in the SSCR (leucine for isoleucine [see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g006">Figure 6</xref>C], arginine for lysine [see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050322-g006">Figure 6</xref>D], serine for threonine, aspartate for glutamate, glutamine for asparagine, and cystein for methionine [excluding the start codon]) was divided by the total decrease in adenines. The remaining drop in adenine percentage was ascribed to the prevalence of hydrophobic amino acids in the SSCR.</p>
