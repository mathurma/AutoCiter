        <p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a stimulation method in which a magnetic coil generates a magnetic field in an area of interest in the brain. This magnetic field induces an electric field that modulates neuronal activity. The spatial distribution of the induced electric field is determined by the geometry and location of the coil relative to the brain. Although TMS has been used for several decades, the biophysical basis underlying the stimulation of neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) is still unknown. To address this problem we developed a numerical scheme enabling us to combine realistic magnetic stimulation (MS) with compartmental modeling of neurons with arbitrary morphology. The induced electric field for each location in space was combined with standard compartmental modeling software to calculate the membrane current generated by the electromagnetic field for each segment of the neuron. In agreement with previous studies, the simulations suggested that peripheral axons were excited by the spatial gradients of the induced electric field. In both peripheral and central neurons, MS amplitude required for action potential generation was inversely proportional to the square of the diameter of the stimulated compartment. Due to the importance of the fiber's diameter, magnetic stimulation of CNS neurons depolarized the soma followed by initiation of an action potential in the initial segment of the axon. Passive dendrites affect this process primarily as current sinks, not sources. The simulations predict that neurons with low current threshold are more susceptible to magnetic stimulation. Moreover, they suggest that MS does not directly trigger dendritic regenerative mechanisms. These insights into the mechanism of MS may be relevant for the design of multi-intensity TMS protocols, may facilitate the construction of magnetic stimulators, and may aid the interpretation of results of TMS of the CNS.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a widely applied tool for probing cognitive function in humans and is one of the best tools for clinical treatments and interfering with cognitive tasks. Surprisingly, while TMS has been commercially available for decades, the cellular mechanisms underlying magnetic stimulation remain unclear. Here we investigate these mechanisms using compartmental modeling. We generated a numerical scheme allowing simulation of the physiological response to magnetic stimulation of neurons with arbitrary morphologies and active properties. Computational experiments using this scheme suggested that TMS affects neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) primarily by somatic stimulation. Since magnetic stimulation appears to cause somatic depolarization, its effects are highly correlated with the neuron's current threshold. Our simulations therefore predict that subpopulations of CNS neurons with different firing thresholds will respond differently to magnetic stimulation. For example, low-intensity TMS may be used to stimulate low-threshold cortical inhibitory interneurons. At higher intensities we predict that both inhibitory and excitatory neurons are activated. These predictions may be tested at the cellular level and may impact cognitive experiments in humans. Furthermore, our simulations may be used to design TMS coils, devices and protocols.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Noninvasive methods, such as electroencephalography (EEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), are commonly used to study the nervous system. Unlike these methods for passively recording neuronal activity, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) actively stimulates neurons. A TMS coil is placed above the skull over a region of interest, for example, above the motor cortex. When a changing electric current flows through the coil, an electromagnetic field is created <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Barker1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Polson1">[2]</xref>. According to Faraday's law, this induces an electric field in the brain that can stimulate cortical neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Walsh1">[3]</xref>. The effects of TMS are often measured by behavioral observation, for example, involuntary, brief movement of the hand following stimulation over the motor cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Rothwell1">[4]</xref>. Thus, TMS differs from other noninvasive methods in that it can interfere with behavior, making it a powerful tool for investigating the relation between human behavior and brain activity.</p>
      <p>TMS is characterized by many parameters: stimulus amplitude, pulse waveform, pulse duration, and the diameter and shape of the coil <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Reilly1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Rossini1">[6]</xref>. The technique is commercially available and has been used in many cognitive psychology studies. Commercial magnetic stimulators use coils with an outer diameter of 50‚Äì150 mm and produce magnetic fields of 1‚Äì2.5 Tesla with a field rise time of 50‚Äì200 ¬µsec <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Rossini1">[6]</xref>. Coil shapes, other than the ordinary round shape, have been developed to improve the behavioral response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Salinas1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Cohen1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Despite the wide use of TMS in cognitive research, the mechanism of neuronal excitation by TMS is largely unknown. To date there have been no direct recordings of the membrane potential from single neurons during a TMS pulse. Furthermore, most theoretical investigations of the TMS effect on single neurons have been limited to simple neurons. Most of the simulations have described the impact of magnetic stimulation (MS) on peripheral neurons, linear or bent, using either an analytical approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Abdeen1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Rotem1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Hsu1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Basser1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Davey1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Ravazzani1">[14]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Silva1">[15]</xref> or a numerical approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Roth1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Basser2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Hsu2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Nagarajan1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Ruohonen1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Roth2">[21]</xref>. Only one previous investigation has applied compartmental modeling to simulate the impact of magnetic stimulation on neurons with arbitrary morphology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Kamitani1">[22]</xref>. This study assumed that the induced electric field was spatially uniform and that the stimulus had a simple pulse shape. Thus, a complete description of the impact of MS on cortical neurons is still lacking, leaving important questions unanswered. What role does neuronal morphology play in MS? Which element of CNS neurons is most likely to be activated by MS? Will MS activate dendritic regenerative mechanisms? What is the magnetic threshold of different neurons in the cortex?</p>
      <p>Here we attempt to address these questions by numerical modeling of the excitation of neurons in the central nervous system by a magnetic field. Clearly, the results of any modeling study should be subject to experimental verification. Our lab has substantial experience in recording from brain slices using the patch-clamp technique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-BarYehuda1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-BarYehuda2">[24]</xref>, . Thus, to allow simpler transformation of the simulations into possible future in-vitro experiments, we simulated the case where a round coil is placed parallel to a neuron. The electric field induced by the magnetic field was calculated and integrated into a compartmental simulation using the simulation environment NEURON <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Carnevale1">[29]</xref>. This allowed us to simulate the response of neurons with arbitrary morphologies to the magnetic field. We verified the accuracy of the simulation using simple neuronal structures and compared the results to previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Roth1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Basser2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Roth2">[21]</xref>. We then demonstrated the effect of magnetic stimulation on simplified neurons and on full models of cortical neurons. Our simulations suggest that TMS differently activates CNS neurons and peripheral neurons. The largest impact on peripheral neurons was found at the location along the axon experiencing the largest gradient of the induced electric field. However, in CNS neurons, TMS was found to directly depolarize the soma, leading to initiation of an action potential (AP) in the initial segment of the axon.</p>

        <p>The magnetic pulse from a TMS device induces an electric field in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Hallett1">[30]</xref>, which can generate transmembrane currents when it falls across the cell membrane of a neuron. However, as experimental studies have shown that neurons are insensitive to transverse field stimulation relative to axial stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Reilly1">[5]</xref>, we neglected the electric field perpendicular to the membrane. The induced electric field can also generate an axial current when it interacts with the cytoplasmic resistor. This can be expressed as:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002022.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002022.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>is the axial resistance per unit length, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002022.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the induced electric field, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002022.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a unit vector parallel to the axial direction of the segment.

        <p>The above generic numerical approach allows simulation of MS for arbitrary morphologies.

        <p>We first simulated the effect of subthreshold MS on the axon using an underdamped current pulse (eqn 22). The axon responded by hyperpolarization on one side of the coil and depolarization on the other side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). As the polarity of the current pulse changed the axon underwent smaller opposing depolarization and hyperpolarization, due to pulse behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). When MS amplitude was further increased, the depolarization induced by the stimulation was large enough to cross AP threshold. The two APs that were generated propagated along the axon in opposite directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). The site of AP initiation corresponded to the location of the maximal gradient of the induced electric field. Since the axon fiber had spatially homogenous passive parameters, this location corresponded to that of the maximal activating function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Rattay2">[33]</xref>.

        <title>The impact of basic neuronal morphology on magnetic stimulation</title>
        <p>When a structurally homogenous axon is longer than the coil radius, the gradient of the induced electric field creates membrane potential gradients along the fiber. In contrast, CNS neurons are likely to be shorter than the radius of the coil in a standard TMS setup. Thus, a neuron may experience different gradients of the induced electric field depending on its location relative to the coil. The complex morphology of CNS neurons may cause further differences. Eqn. 4 predicts that changes in the electrotonic structure of the neuron modify the neuron's response to MS. Changes in the diameter of the fiber, the axial resistance and membrane resistance lead to changes in the space constant (Œª) of the neuron. Such changes are expected to alter the contribution of the induced electric field to the membrane potential of a given compartment. Furthermore, changes in the diameter or orientation of the neuron has been predicted to affect the neuronal response to MS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Kamitani1">[22]</xref>.</p>
        <p>We investigated the effect of MS on several simplified structures commonly found in CNS neurons. These were a bend, a bifurcation, and a diameter change, all of which may be located at different positions in the dendritic and axonal trees of CNS neurons. We investigated the case where a neuron contained an excitable soma and passive dendrites. We generated simplified artificial neurons containing a soma into which we inserted the Hodgkin-Huxley model to generate neuronal excitability. A single passive dendrite originated from this soma. This dendrite was allowed to bend at one point along its length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g004">Figure 4A</xref>i), to bifurcate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g004">Figure 4B</xref>i), or to change diameter at a single point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g004">Figure 4C</xref>i).

To further investigate the role of the dendrites we progressively added passive dendrites to the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g005">Figure 5B</xref> insert). As the number of dendrites increased, so did the magnetic threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), each added dendrite serving as a current sink drawing current from the soma. To substantiate this explanation we measured the current threshold for the same cells as a function of the number of dendrites projecting from the soma. To do this we simulated a current-clamp electrode placed at the soma through which a square current pulse was injected. The amplitude of this current pulse was increased until an AP was generated. The current threshold obtained was highly correlated with the magnetic threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). An increase in the somatic input resistance generated a decrease in magnetic threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g005">Figure 5D</xref>).

In agreement with the activating function (eqn. 4), the compartment with the largest diameter (i.e. the soma) and, therefore, the largest passive space constant, undergoes the largest depolarization. The larger the diameter of the segment, the larger will be the depolarization for a given stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g003">Figs. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g005">5A</xref>), leading to a lower magnetic threshold. This depolarization is attenuated by current escape into the dendrites, which, because of their smaller diameter, are less affected by the magnetic pulse.</p>

The initial impact of the MS was visible 0.2 ms after stimulus onset as a depolarization of the soma. Then, due to the oscillating nature of the underdamped waveform, the soma hyperpolarized (0.3 ms) and then depolarized again (0.4 ms). Because of the lower AP threshold in the axon, the initial somatic depolarization generated an AP in the axon initial segment 0.3 ms after the onset of the MS. This AP then back-propagated into the soma and dendrites and forward-propagated into the axon generating additional APs at the nodes of Ranvier along the axon.</p>

        <p>To investigate the contribution of cellular excitability to the response of CNS neurons to MS, the activation and inactivation curves of the voltage-gated sodium channels in the axon initial segment and nodes of Ranvier were shifted to more negative potentials. This reduced the current threshold as measured by somatic current injections. The magnetic threshold was linearly correlated to the current threshold also in this experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g008">Figure 8</xref>).

        <p>Commercial TMS devices commonly generate a 0.4 ms underdamped pulse. We used our simulated model of L5 pyramidal neurons to investigate whether this pulse selection is optimal. We varied the duration of the underdamped pulse by changing the capacitance in the RLC circuit and measured the magnetic threshold for AP generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). As pulse duration increased, the magnetic threshold decreased, resembling a strength-duration curve. This result suggests that it may be better to use longer stimulation times in TMS devices, since this allows the use of weaker magnetic fields. However, it is important to note that increasing pulse duration by increasing the capacitance requires that the MS device generate more energy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g009">Figure 9B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Davey1">[13]</xref>.

        <p>It has been suggested that a likely site for MS to cause AP generation in neocortical pyramidal neurons is where their axons bend as they enter the white matter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Tranchina1">[39]</xref>. This may be an additional mechanism by which MS generates APs in cortical neurons. To investigate this suggestion we performed numerical simulation on a full model of a neocortical pyramidal neuron and introduced a bend in the axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g010">Figure 10A</xref>). Contrary to the previous suggestion, this bend did not change the magnetic threshold at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g010">Figure 10B</xref>). In all simulations the AP was generated at the axonal initial segment following somatic depolarization. Although the bend in the axon did induce a larger depolarization at the bend, it was too small to generate an AP in any of the nodes of Ranvier along the axon.</p>

        <p>To further emphasize the distinction between MS of peripheral and cortical neurons we investigated the case shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g011">figure 11A</xref>. A soma with a long myelinated axon was first located parallel to the center of the coil with a shift in the y-axis equal to one coil radius. The artificial neuron was then shifted along the x-axis and the magnetic threshold measured for each location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g011">Figure 11B</xref>). When the soma was close to the vertical midline of the coil (Œîx&lt;0.05 cm, marked in green), the maximal activating function was located c. 1.6 cm from the center of the coil. This location underwent the largest depolarization and was where a suprathreshold stimulus initiated an action potential. As the soma was moved away from the center of the coil, the location of the maximum activating function, and hence the maximum depolarization, shifted to the soma. As predicted from eq. 4, the lowest magnetic threshold was achieved when the soma, which has the largest Œª, was located where the gradient of the induced electric field is largest. This figure suggests that, while an AP can be initiated in the axon of CNS neurons, AP initiation is more likely at the soma and will occur there at lower MS intensities.</p>

        <p>The cell membrane is rarely at rest. Excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs, IPSPs) increase or decrease the membrane potential, respectively. A depolarization would be expected to reduce magnetic threshold for it is easier to stimulate a cell closer to its AP threshold. We tested this by evoking an EPSP in the cell a few milliseconds before the magnetic stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g012">Figure 12A</xref>). The magnetic threshold decreased, when the EPSP coincided with the MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g012">Figure 12B</xref>). We also investigated the impact of AP generation on the response of the simulated neuron to MS using an AP evoked before the magnetic stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g012">Figure 12C</xref>). In the models used for the current simulation there is a pronounced afterhyperpolarization lasting several tens of milliseconds after the AP. This period is often referred to as the refractory period. During this period an AP is harder to obtain due to the inactivation of sodium channels and activation of potassium channels. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g012">Figure 12D</xref> shows the magnetic threshold as a function of the time interval between the AP and MS.

      <p>We have presented a numerical scheme allowing computation of the effect of magnetic stimulation (MS) on neurons with arbitrary morphology. By combining numerical simulations in Matlab and NEURON we were able to calculate the induced electric field for any arbitrary coil geometry and stimulus shape. We validated this approach by comparing our simulations to previous simulations of the impact of MS on peripheral neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Abdeen1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Rotem1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Hsu1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Basser1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Davey1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Ravazzani1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Roth1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Basser2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Hsu2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Nagarajan1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Ruohonen1">[20]</xref>. We then simulated the effect of MS on simple neuronal structures. These simulations suggested that the soma of CNS neurons is the primary locus of their response to MS. Finally, we simulated MS using realistic morphologies. Our simulations give rise to several predictions useful for designing electrophysiological experiments both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo.</italic></p>
      <p>Several assumptions were made during the construction of the numerical simulation scheme. First, we assumed that only the component of the electric field parallel to the neuronal compartment was responsible for neuronal excitation, as in other simulations of MS of peripheral and central neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Rotem1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Hsu1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Basser1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Roth1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Basser2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Rotem2">[49]</xref>. Thus, the induced electric field induced currents in the axial resistor, the cytoplasm. Current flowing axially in the cytoplasm is linked by passive cable theory to the membrane current (eqn. 4). The component of the induced electric field that is normal to the membrane alters the membrane potential, expressed as <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002022.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>E<sub>m</sub></italic> is the electric field in the direction of the membrane (normal to the direction of the segment) and <italic>d</italic> is the thickness of the membrane. Since the membrane is about 3‚Äì10 nm thick, the contribution of the perpendicular electric field is negligible. Alternatively, <italic>d</italic> can be viewed as the combined thickness of the cytoplasm and the membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Roth2">[21]</xref>. In this case the normal component of the electric field generates a larger current <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Roth2">[21]</xref>. However, in thin CNS dendrites and axons even this current will still be much smaller than the axial current. Furthermore, for a neuron lying in a plane parallel to the coil, symmetry can also be taken into account. The perpendicular electric field hyperpolarizes one side of the cell, while the other side is depolarized, the symmetry canceling out the overall change <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Reilly1">[5]</xref>. Some experimental evidence from stimulating the human median nerve suggests that the contribution of the electric field normal to the membrane is not negligible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Ruohonen2">[34]</xref>. However, the median nerve inside a human arm does not run entirely parallel to the coil, which may cause problems in separating the normal from the parallel component of the electric field. This observation requires further investigation with <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. A second assumption was that the neuron is two dimensional, lying in a plane parallel to the coil. This allowed us to neglect calculating the decay in the magnetic field as a function of distance from the coil. This assumption simplifies the calculation of the induced electric field at the cost of potential errors due to the three-dimensional structure of the neuron. Obviously, the validity of this assumption must be reassessed for simulations of MS in whole brain tissue.</p>
      <p>To validate our numerical approach we repeated several simulations of the effect of MS on peripheral axons. All the results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g002">Figures 2</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g003">3</xref>) resembled previously published simulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Hsu1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Basser1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Roth1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Basser2">[17]</xref>. The similarity extended to the temporal and spatial pattern of excitability in the axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), to the location of AP initiation relative to the coil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Maccabee1">[50]</xref>, to the relationship between the position of the coil and the magnetic threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) as previously suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Ruohonen1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Ruohonen2">[34]</xref>, and to the relationship between the axon diameter and the magnetic threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) that was previously simulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Basser2">[17]</xref>. Our results conflict with a minority of the published simulations which claim that the strongest stimulation occurs at the maximum of the electric field, meaning, in this case, the middle of the fiber <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Barker2">[51]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It has been previously suggested, both theoretically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Kamitani1">[22]</xref> and experimentally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Rotem1">[10]</xref>, that the magnetic threshold for the generation of an AP is dependant on neuronal morphology. Uniform electric fields have been suggested, both theoretically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Tranchina1">[39]</xref> and experimentally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Radman1">[52]</xref>, to stimulate somata of CNS neurons. In addition, it was proposed that bends in the axons of cortical neurons might be possible locations for AP generation during stimulation with uniform electric fields <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Tranchina1">[39]</xref>. Experiments on frog sciatic nerve have shown that MS can excite a nerve only where there are endings or where the nerve course curves, the curvature magnifying the effect of the magnetic field <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Rotem1">[10]</xref>. Compartmental modeling has suggested that an AP is generated only if there is a difference between the influence of the stimulation on adjacent compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Kamitani1">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our simulations here suggest that the impact of bends, bifurcations and diameter changes is secondary to changes in the diameter of the soma (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g004">figs 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g005">5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g010">10</xref>). For neurons smaller than the radius of the magnetic coil, the simulations presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g004">figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g005">5</xref> show that the compartment with the largest diameter (i.e. the soma) undergoes the largest depolarization. This result can be directly extracted from the activating function (eqn. 4). Given homogenous passive parameters and a relatively shallow electric field gradient, the major difference between the soma and the other compartments in the neuron is their diameter. Since the effect of the induced electric field is scaled in eqn. 4 by the passive space constant, it is largest at the soma. This somatic depolarization is attenuated by current escape into the dendrites that are less affected by the magnetic pulse due to their smaller diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). For example, with a soma of 20 ¬µm diameter and a dendrite 2 ¬µm in diameter, MS induces 100 times more depolarization at the soma. This ratio is even larger for sub-micron axons and nodes. Note that MS of long peripheral neurons follows a different mechanism since the axons are longer than the coil radius and excitation is obtained using the mechanism presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g002">figure 2</xref>, as already described in the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Hsu1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Basser1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Roth1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Basser2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Roth2">[21]</xref>. This difference in possible excitation mechanisms between peripheral and central neurons warrants caution when interpreting results of TMS of the central nervous system using stimulation rules based on MS of peripheral neurons.</p>
      <p>It is interesting to compare MS to stimulation of CNS neurons using an extracellular microelectrode, the latter case having undergone considerable investigation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Rattay1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Rattay2">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-McIntyre1">[53]</xref>. It is clear that both MS and electrical microstimulation induce an electric field in the brain tissue that stimulates neuronal elements according to equation 4. Therefore the major difference between the two stimulation methods does not stem from physical principles but from geometrical ones. Microstimulation generates a spherical electric field that is maximal at the electrode and decays as a function of distance. That is, microstimulation has the largest impact close to the electrode, depending on the excitability of adjacent neural elements, the strength of the stimulation and the orientation of the induced electric field to the neural element <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Rattay1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Rattay2">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-McIntyre1">[53]</xref>. Indeed, microstimulation has been shown in countless reports to stimulate all types of excitable compartments in the CNS ‚Äì dendrites, somata and axons. Neural elements with lower excitation threshold that are further away from the stimulating electrode are not stimulated due to the decay of the electric field.</p>
      <p>It is harder to verbally describe the distributed geometry of the electric field induced in brain tissue by a magnetic coil. Basically, the most striking difference between this field and that induced by a microelectrode is its spatial distribution. Since MS coils are usually a few centimeters in diameter the induced electric field spans much larger areas of the brain. Thus, it first excites neural elements with low excitation threshold and may lead to generation of AP at the axon initial segment due to somatic depolarization. Furthermore, our simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g008">Figure 8</xref>) suggest that neurons with low current threshold, such as inhibitory interneurons, will be stimulated at lower MS intensities. This notion of initiating cells has been proposed recently following imaging experiments during MS in tissue cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Rotem2">[49]</xref>. In conclusion, we predict that, within the same brain region, microstimulation and MS will stimulate different populations of neurons.</p>
      <p>Simulating MS of realistic neuronal models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g006">Figs 6</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g007"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g008"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g009"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g010"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g011"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g012"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g013">13</xref>), we observed similar trends to those obtained using artificial neurons. The simulations tightly linked the current threshold for AP firing to the magnetic threshold, further indicating that the soma is the primary element in the neuron's response to a magnetic stimulus. The current threshold could be modified by using dendrites as current sinks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g005">Figure 5</xref>) or by shifting the activation kinetics of the voltage-gated sodium channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g008">Figure 8</xref>). These simulations lead to a prediction that can be investigated experimentally. As various classes of cortical neurons display either low or high current thresholds, we predict that the current threshold, measured using intracellular recordings from neurons in brain slices or tissue culture, is correlated with the magnetic threshold of these neurons. As some inhibitory cortical interneurons are known to have low current thresholds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Ascoli1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Markram1">[55]</xref>, it is tempting to speculate that these neurons will also have a low magnetic threshold. If this is the case, it is even more tempting to hypothesize that low intensity TMS may selectively activate inhibitory cortical interneurons, while higher intensity TMS may activate both inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Our simulations also predict that the magnetic threshold will fall when excitatory synaptic activity coincides with MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g012">Figure 12A</xref>) and rise when an AP is generated coincident with MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g012">Figure 12B</xref>). Furthermore, our simulations predict that dendritic calcium spikes are not activated directly by MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g013">Figure 13</xref>).</p>
      <p>A recent imaging experiment with primary cultures of hippocampus neurons has provided some support for the relationship between magnetic threshold and intrinsic neuronal excitability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Rotem2">[49]</xref>. This elegant study reported that a small group of neurons responded with higher sensitivity to MS. Possibly, some of the neurons from the hippocampal culture had lower electric, and therefore lower magnetic, thresholds. Since the study recorded only the intracellular calcium concentration, it was possible only to observe the excitation of the neuron and not its current threshold. Another recent study, stimulating neurons in brain slices by uniform electric fields, has shown that neuronal morphology correlated with somatic subthreshold deflection of the membrane potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Radman1">[52]</xref>. This study also observed, in agreement with our predictions, larger somatic depolarization in L5 pyramidal neurons than in interneurons with smaller somata.</p>
      <p>Some predictions arising from our work can be verified using intracellular recordings of membrane potential, for example the correlation between the magnetic threshold and the current threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). Magnetic threshold for different cell types can be measured and compared to our theoretical predictions. Furthermore, intracellular recordings may verify our predicted effect of synaptic input or AP generation on magnetic threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g012">Fig 12</xref>) and the preferred activation of the axon initial segment over dendritic spikes in pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002022-g013">Figure 13</xref>). Simultaneous recordings of the membrane potential from the soma and dendrites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-BarYehuda1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-BarYehuda2">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-BarYehuda3">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Schaefer1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Schaefer2">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002022-Korngreen1">[28]</xref> can test our prediction that MS induces the largest depolarization at the soma. Moreover, simultaneous recordings from soma and axon during MS should also indicate which is excited first. Finally, combining our simulation environment with intracellular recordings will allow probing many features of MS (including pulse shape, pulse duration, coil shape and properties, etc.) currently unavailable in commercial TMS devices, eventually leading to the design of improved TMS devices and stimulation protocols.</p>
