        <p>The ability of spiking neurons to synchronize their activity in a network depends on the response behavior of these neurons as quantified by the phase response curve (PRC) and on coupling properties. The PRC characterizes the effects of transient inputs on spike timing and can be measured experimentally. Here we use the adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire (aEIF) neuron model to determine how subthreshold and spike-triggered slow adaptation currents shape the PRC. Based on that, we predict how synchrony and phase locked states of coupled neurons change in presence of synaptic delays and unequal coupling strengths. We find that increased subthreshold adaptation currents cause a transition of the PRC from only phase advances to phase advances and delays in response to excitatory perturbations. Increased spike-triggered adaptation currents on the other hand predominantly skew the PRC to the right. Both adaptation induced changes of the PRC are modulated by spike frequency, being more prominent at lower frequencies. Applying phase reduction theory, we show that subthreshold adaptation stabilizes synchrony for pairs of coupled excitatory neurons, while spike-triggered adaptation causes locking with a small phase difference, as long as synaptic heterogeneities are negligible. For inhibitory pairs synchrony is stable and robust against conduction delays, and adaptation can mediate bistability of in-phase and anti-phase locking. We further demonstrate that stable synchrony and bistable in/anti-phase locking of pairs carry over to synchronization and clustering of larger networks. The effects of adaptation in aEIF neurons on PRCs and network dynamics qualitatively reflect those of biophysical adaptation currents in detailed Hodgkin-Huxley-based neurons, which underscores the utility of the aEIF model for investigating the dynamical behavior of networks. Our results suggest neuronal spike frequency adaptation as a mechanism synchronizing low frequency oscillations in local excitatory networks, but indicate that inhibition rather than excitation generates coherent rhythms at higher frequencies.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Synchronization of neuronal spiking in the brain is related to cognitive functions, such as perception, attention, and memory. It is therefore important to determine which properties of neurons influence their collective behavior in a network and to understand how. A prominent feature of many cortical neurons is spike frequency adaptation, which is caused by slow transmembrane currents. We investigated how these adaptation currents affect the synchronization tendency of coupled model neurons. Using the efficient adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire (aEIF) model and a biophysically detailed neuron model for validation, we found that increased adaptation currents promote synchronization of coupled excitatory neurons at lower spike frequencies, as long as the conduction delays between the neurons are negligible. Inhibitory neurons on the other hand synchronize in presence of conduction delays, with or without adaptation currents. Our results emphasize the utility of the aEIF model for computational studies of neuronal network dynamics. We conclude that adaptation currents provide a mechanism to generate low frequency oscillations in local populations of excitatory neurons, while faster rhythms seem to be caused by inhibition rather than excitation.</p>

      <p>Synchronized oscillating neural activity has been shown to be involved in a variety of cognitive functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Singer1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Wang1">[2]</xref> such as multisensory integration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Roelfsema1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Ghazanfar1">[4]</xref>, conscious perception <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Melloni1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Hipp1">[6]</xref>, selective attention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Fries1">[7]</xref>,  and memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Herrmann1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Lengyel1">[10]</xref>, as well as in pathological states including Parkinson's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Hammond1">[11]</xref>, schizophrenia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Uhlhaas1">[12]</xref>, and epilepsy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Zijlmans1">[13]</xref>. These observations have led to a great interest in understanding the mechanisms of neuronal synchronization, how synchronous oscillations are initiated, maintained, and destabilized.</p>
      <p>The phase response curve (PRC) provides a powerful tool to study neuronal synchronization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Smeal1">[14]</xref>. The PRC is an experimentally obtainable measure that characterizes the effects of transient inputs to a periodically spiking neuron on the timing of its subsequent spike. PRC based techniques have been applied widely to analyze rhythms of neuronal populations and have yielded valuable insights into, for example, motor pattern generation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Ermentrout1">[15]</xref>, the hippocampal theta rhythm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Netoff1">[16]</xref>, and memory retrieval <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Lengyel1">[10]</xref>. The shape of the PRC is strongly affected by ionic currents that mediate spike frequency adaptation (SFA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Crook1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Ermentrout2">[18]</xref>, a prominent feature of neuronal dynamics shown by a decrease in instantaneous spike rate during a sustained current injection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-McCormick1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-LaCamera1">[21]</xref>. These adaptation currents modify the PRC in distinct ways, depending on whether they operate near rest or during the spike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Ermentrout2">[18]</xref>. Using biophysical neuron models, it has been shown that a low threshold outward current, such as the muscarinic voltage-dependent <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-current (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), can produce a type II PRC, characterized by phase advances and delays in response to excitatory stimuli, in contrast to only phase advances, defining a type I PRC. A high threshold outward current on the other hand, such as the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-dependent afterhyperpolarization <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-current (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), flattens the PRC at early phases and skews its peak towards the end of the period <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Ermentrout2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Ermentrout3">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Stiefel1">[23]</xref>. Both changes of the PRC indicate an increased propensity for synchronization of coupled excitatory cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Ermentrout3">[22]</xref>, and can be controlled selectively through cholinergic neuromodulation. In particular, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are reduced by acetylcholine with different sensitivities, which modifies the PRC shape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Stiefel1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Stiefel2">[25]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In recent years substantial efforts have been exerted to develop single neuron models of reduced complexity that can reproduce a large repertoire of observed neuronal behavior, while being computationally less demanding and, more importantly, easier to understand and analyze than detailed biophysical models. Two-dimensional variants of the leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model have been proposed which take into consideration an adaptation mechanism that is spike triggered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Treves1">[26]</xref> or subthreshold, capturing resonance properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Richardson1">[27]</xref>, as well as an improved description of spike initiation by an exponential term <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-FourcaudTrocm1">[28]</xref>. A popular example is the adaptive exponential leaky integrate-and-fire (aEIF) model by Brette and Gerstner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Brette1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Gerstner1">[30]</xref>. The aEIF model is similar to the two-variable model of Izhikevich <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Izhikevich1">[31]</xref>, such that both models include a sub-threshold as well as a spike-triggered adaptation component in one adaptation current. The advantages of the aEIF model, as opposed to the Izhikevich model, are the exponential description of spike initiation instead of a quadratic nonlinearity, and more importantly, that its parameters are of physiological relevance. Despite their simplicity, these two models (aEIF and Izhikevich) can capture a broad range of neuronal dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Izhikevich2">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Naud1">[34]</xref> which renders them appropriate for application in large-scale network models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Izhikevich3">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Destexhe1">[36]</xref>. Furthermore, the aEIF model has been successfully fit to Hodgkin-Huxley-type neurons as well as to recordings from cortical neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Brette1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Clopath1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Jolivet1">[38]</xref>. Since lately, this model is also implemented in neuromorphic hardware systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Brderle1">[39]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Because of subthreshold and spike-triggered contributions to the adaptation current, the aEIF model exhibits a rich dynamical structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Touboul1">[33]</xref>, and can be tuned to reproduce the behavior of all major classes of neurons, as defined electrophysiologically in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Naud1">[34]</xref>. Here, we use the aEIF model to study the influence of adaptation on network dynamics, particularly synchronization and phase locking, taking into account conduction delays and unequal synaptic strengths. First, we show how both subthreshold and spike-triggered adaptation affect the PRC as a function of spike frequency. Then, we apply phase reduction theory, assuming weak coupling, to explain how the changes in phase response behavior determine phase locking of neuronal pairs, considering conduction delays and heterogeneous synaptic strengths. We next present numerical simulations of networks which support the findings from our analysis of phase locking in neuronal pairs, and show their robustness against heterogeneities. Finally, to validate the biophysical implication of the adaptation parameters in the aEIF model, we relate and compare the results using this model to the effects of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on synchronization in Hodgkin-Huxley-type conductance based neurons. Thereby, we demonstrate that the basic description of an adaptation current in the low-dimensional aEIF model suffices to capture the characteristic changes of PRCs, and consequently the effects on phase locking and network behavior, mediated by biophysical adaptation currents in a complex neuron model. The aEIF model thus represents a useful and efficient tool to examine the dynamical behavior of neuronal networks.</p>

In practice, integration of the model equations is stopped when <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> reaches a finite “cutoff” value <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is reset to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (3).

        <p>The dynamics of the model relevant to our study is outlined as follows. When the input current <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to the neuron at rest is slowly increased, at some critical current the resting state is destabilized which leads to repetitive spiking for large regions in parameter space <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Naud1">[34]</xref>. This onset of spiking corresponds to a saddle-node (SN) bifurcation if <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and a subcritical Andronov-Hopf (AH) bifurcation if <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> at current values <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> respectively which can be calculated explicitly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Touboul1">[33]</xref>. In the former case a stable fixed point (the neuronal resting state) and an unstable fixed point (the saddle) merge and disappear, in the latter case the stable fixed point becomes unstable before merging with the saddle. In the limiting case <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, both bifurcations (SN and AH) meet and the system undergoes a Bogdanov-Takens (BT) bifurcation. The sets of points with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are called <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-nullcline and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-nullcline, respectively. It is obvious that all fixed points in the two-dimensional state space can be identified as intersections of these two nullclines. Spiking can occur at a constant input current lower than <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> depending on whether the sequence of reset points lies exterior to the basin of attraction of the stable fixed point. This means, the system just below the bifurcation current can be bistable; periodic spiking and constant membrane potential are possible at the same input current. Thus, periodic spiking trajectories do not necessarily emerge from a SN or AH bifurcation. We determined the lowest input current that produces repetitive spiking (the rheobase current, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) numerically by delivering long-lasting rectangular current pulses to the model neurons at rest. Note that in general <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> depends on <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, such that in case of bistability, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> can be reduced by decreasing <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Touboul1">[33]</xref>.</p>

All model parametrizations in this study lead to periodic spiking for sufficiently large <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e062" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, possibly including transient adaptation.

        <p>The dynamics of interest is described below. Starting from a resting state, as <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is increased, the model goes to repetitive spiking. Depending on the level of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, this (rest-spiking) transition occurs through a SN bifurcation for low values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e123" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or a subcritical AH bifurcation for high values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, at input currents <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, respectively. The SN bifurcation gives rise to a branch of stable periodic solutions (limit cycles) with arbitrarily low frequency. Larger values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> cause the stable fixed point to lose its stability by an AH bifurcation (at <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). In this case, a branch of unstable periodic orbits emerges, which collides with a branch of stable limit cycles with finite frequency in a fold limit cycle bifurcation at current <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e129" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The branch of stable periodic spiking trajectories extends for currents larger than <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e130" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e131" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This means that in the AH bifurcation regime, the model exhibits hysteresis. That is, for an input current between <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e132" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> a stable equilibrium point and a stable limit cycle coexist.

Indeed, if <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e354" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the PRC must be type I, since in this case the component <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e355" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the solution of the adjoint system, eqs.

        <p>To provide an intuitive explanation for the effects of adaptation on the PRC, we show the vector fields, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e371" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>- and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e372" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-nullclines, and periodic spiking trajectories of four aEIF neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002478-g002">Fig. 2C–F</xref>). One neuron does not have an adaptation current (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e373" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), two neurons possess only one adaptation mechanism (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e374" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e375" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e376" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e377" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, respectively) and for one both adaptation parameters are increased (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e378" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e379" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). An excitatory perturbation to the non-adapting neuron at any point of its trajectory, i.e. at any phase, shifts this point closer to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e380" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> along the trajectory, which means the phase is shifted closer to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e381" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, hence the advancing effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002478-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). The phase advance is strongest if the perturbing input is received at the position along the trajectory around which the vector field has the smallest magnitude, i.e. where the trajectory is “slowest”. In case of subthreshold adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002478-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>), the adapted periodic spiking trajectory starts at a certain level of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e382" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> which decreases during the early part of the oscillation cycle and increases again during the late part, after the trajectory has passed the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e383" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-nullcline. A small transient excitatory input at an early phase pushes the respective point of the trajectory to the right (along the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e384" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-axis) causing the perturbed trajectory to pass through a region above the unperturbed trajectory, somewhat closer to the fixed point around which the vector field is almost null. Consequently, the neuron is slowed down and the subsequent spike delayed. An excitatory perturbation received at a later phase (to the right of the dashed arrow) causes phase advances, since the perturbed trajectory either remains nearly unchanged, however with a shorter path to the end of the cycle, compared to the unperturbed trajectory, or it passes below the unperturbed one where the magnitude of the vector field (pointing to the right) is larger. Note that for the parametrization in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002478-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>, both, the resting state as well as the spiking trajectory are stable. In this case, a strong depolarizing input at an early phase can push the corresponding trajectory point into the domain of attraction of the fixed point, encircled by the dashed line in the figure, which would cause the resulting trajectory to spiral towards the fixed point and the neuron would stop spiking. On the other hand, increasing <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e385" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> would shrink the domain of attraction of the fixed point and at <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e386" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, it would be destabilized by a subcritical AH bifurcation. When <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e387" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e388" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we obtain a type I PRC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002478-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>), as explained above. The advancing effect of an excitatory perturbation is strongest late in the oscillation cycle, indicated by the red arrow, where the perturbation pushes a trajectory point from a “slow” towards a “fast” region closer to the end of the cycle, as shown by the vector field. When <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e389" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as well as <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e390" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are increased, the PRC exhibits both adaptation mediated features (type II and skewness), see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002478-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>. A push to the right along the corresponding trajectory experienced early in the cycle brings the perturbed trajectory closer to the fixed point and causes a delayed next spike. Such an effect persists even if the fixed point has disappeared due to a larger input current. In this case, the region where the fixed point used to be prior to the bifurcation, known as “ghost” of the fixed point, the vector field is still very small. This means that type II PRCs can exist for larger input currents <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e391" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Note that differences of the vector fields and the shift of the nullclines relative to each other in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002478-g002">Fig. 2C,D</xref> as well as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002478-g002">Fig. 2E,F</xref> are due to different input current values (as an increase of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e392" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> moves the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e393" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-nullcline upwards). The maximal phase advances, indicated by solid arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002478-g002">Fig. 2A,B</xref>, are close to the threshold potential <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e394" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (where the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e395" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-nullcline has its minimum) in all four cases.</p>
        <p>We next investigate how the changes in PRCs caused by either adaptation component are affected by the spike frequency. Bifurcation currents, rheobase currents and corresponding frequencies, in dependence of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e396" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e397" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, as well as regions in parameter space where PRCs are type I and II, are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002478-g003">Fig. 3A–D</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002478-g003">Fig. 3E,F</xref> shows how individual PRCs are modulated by spike frequency (input current). Both PRC characteristics, caused by <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e398" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e399" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, respectively, are more pronounced at low frequencies. Increasing <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e400" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> changes a type II PRC to type I and shifts its peak towards an earlier phase. The input current which separates type I and type II PRC regions (in parameter space) increases with both, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e401" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e402" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002478-g003">Fig. 3A,B</xref>). That is, an increase of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e403" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> can also turn a type I into a type II PRC, by bringing the spiking trajectory closer to the fixed point or its “ghost”. This is however only possible if the system is in the AH bifurcation regime (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e404" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) or close to it. Spike-triggered adaptation thereby considerably influences the range of input currents for which the PRCs are type II. The spike frequency according to the input current, at which a type II PRC turns into type I increases substantially with increasing <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e405" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, but only slighly with an increase of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e406" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002478-g003">Fig. 3C,D</xref>). The latter can be recognized by the similarity of the respective (green) curves in the subfigures C and D. Type II PRCs thus only exist in the lower frequency band whose width increases with increasing subthreshold adaptation.</p>

Note that the left and right sided limits are not equal if <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e445" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is not differentiable at <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e446" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, due to the discontinuity of the PRC of an aEIF neuron.</p>
          <p>First, consider a synaptic current with infinitely fast rise and decay. In this case we use a positive (or negative) <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e447" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-function in eq. (21) instead of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e448" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to describe the transient excitatory (or inhibitory) pulse. <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e449" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is then given by<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e450" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(24)</label></disp-formula>that is, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e451" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> becomes the PRC, mirrored at <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e452" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, rightwards shifted by the delay <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e453" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and scaled by <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e454" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The sign of the slope of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e455" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is thus given by the negative (positive) sign of the PRC slope at <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e456" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e457" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, for excitatory (inhibitory) synapses respectively. For the aEIF model, the case <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e458" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> requires a distinction, because <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e459" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e460" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are discontinuous at <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e461" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Let <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e462" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> be the distance between <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e463" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the closest root of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e464" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Since <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e465" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is odd and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e466" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-periodic, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e467" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> implies stability of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e468" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, in the sense that <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e469" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> increases on the interval <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e470" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and decreases over <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e471" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Thus, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e472" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> can be considered an attractor. <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e473" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is equivalent to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e474" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> which in turn is equivalent to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e475" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for excitatory coupling and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e476" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for inhibitory coupling. Hence, it is the discontinuity of the PRC which determines the stability of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e477" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in this case.</p>
          <p>A synaptic current with finite rise and decay times causes an additional rightwards shift and a smoothing of the interaction function. The stability of the fixed point <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e478" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is then determined by the slope of the PRC and its discontinuity on the interval <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e479" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e480" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is on the order of the synaptic timescale. If the PRC slope is negative on this interval and its discontinuity (if occurring in the interval) is also negative, i.e. <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e481" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, then <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e482" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is stable for excitatory coupling and unstable for inhibitory coupling. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002478-g004">Fig. 4A</xref> we show the effect of the synaptic timescale, i.e. <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e483" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e484" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, on the interaction function for a given PRC. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002478-g004">Fig. 4B,C</xref> illustrates how the stability of the synchronous state of a neuronal pair is given by the slope of the PRC, for three different delays. The slope of the PRC is positive at <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e485" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e486" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and negative at <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e487" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and remains positive (negative) until <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e488" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> has decayed to a small value. Therefore, synchrony is unstable for delays <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e489" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e490" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and stable for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e491" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, indicated by the slope of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e492" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> at <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e493" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which is negative for the first two and positive for the third delay.</p>

          <title>Effects of adaptation on phase locking of coupled aEIF pairs</title>
          <p>First, consider pairs of identical aEIF neurons with the PRCs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002478-g002">Fig. 2A,B</xref>, symmetrically coupled through instantaneous synapses (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e527" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e528" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and without conduction delays (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e529" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). When the coupling is excitatory, the in-phase locked state (synchrony) is unstable in case of type I PRCs, since they have a positive “jump” at <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e530" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, i.e. <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e531" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Synchrony is stable for pairs with type II PRCs however, as <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e532" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The anti-phase locked state on the other hand is unstable because of the positive PRC slopes at <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e533" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In case of inhibitory coupling, synchrony is stable for type I pairs and the anti-phase locked state is stable for all pairs. This means, bistability of in-phase and anti-phase locking occurs for inhibitory neurons with type I PRCs.</p>
          <p>Next, we consider pairs that are coupled through synaptic currents <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e534" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with finite rise and decay times, as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref> section. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002478-g005">Fig. 5</xref> we show how the stable (and unstable) phase locked states of pairs of neurons with symmetric excitatory (A, B) and inhibitory (C, D) synaptic interactions and without conduction delays change, when the PRCs are modified by the adaptation components <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e535" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e536" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. For excitatory pairs, stable fixed points shift towards synchrony, when <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e537" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e538" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is increased. The phase differences become vanishinly small, when the PRCs switch from type I to type II due to subthreshold adaptation. Perfect synchrony is stabilized, where the PRC slopes at <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e539" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for small <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e540" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> become negative, due to even larger values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e541" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (not shown) or lower spike frequency (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002478-g003">Fig. 3C–F</xref>). Neurons that have type I PRCs with a pronounced skew, as caused by spike-triggered adaptation, lock almost but not completely in-phase, if the adaptation is sufficiently strong. Inhibitory pairs on the other hand show stable synchrony independent of PRC type and skewness. Larger values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e542" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e543" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> lead to additional stabilization of the anti-phase locked state. That is, strong adaptation in inhibitory pairs mediates bistability of in-phase and anti-phase locking. All phase locking predictions from the phase reduction approach are in good agreement with the results of numerically simulated coupled aEIF pairs.</p>

          <title>Phase locking of aEIF pairs coupled with delays</title>
          <p>We next investigate how phase locked states of excitatory and inhibitory pairs are affected by synaptic currents that involve conduction delays, considering the PRC of a neuron without adaptation, and two PRCs that represent adaptation induced by either <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e556" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e557" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Neurons symmetrically coupled through excitatory synapses with a conduction delay do not synchronize irrespective of whether adaptation is present or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002478-g006">Fig. 6A–C</xref>). Instead, stable states shift towards anti-phase locking with increasing mutual delays. Inhibitory pairs on the other hand synchronize for all conduction delays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002478-g006">Fig. 6D–F</xref>), but the anti-phase locked states of coupled inhibitory neurons with type II PRCs or skewed type I PRCs are destabilized by the delays. The bistable region is larger in case of spike-triggered adaptation compared to subthreshold adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002478-g006">Fig. 6E,F</xref>). Again, all stable phase locked states obtained using phase reduction are verified by numerical simulations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002478-g007">Fig. 7</xref> illustrates the phenomenon that synchronous spiking of excitatory pairs is destabilized by the delay, while synchrony remains stable for inhibitory pairs. Consider two neurons oscillating with a small phase difference <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e558" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (neuron 1 slightly ahead of neuron 2). Then, a synaptic input received by neuron 2 at a delay <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e559" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> after neuron 1 has spiked, arrives at an earlier phase (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e560" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) compared to the phase at which neuron 1 receives its input (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e561" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Consequently, if the synapses are excitatory and the PRCs type I, the leader neuron 1 advances its next spike by a larger amount than the follower neuron 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002478-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). In case of excitatory neurons and type II PRCs, depending on <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e562" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e563" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the phase of neuron 1 is advanced by a larger amount or delayed by a smaller amount than the phase of neuron 2, the latter of which is shown by the changed spike times in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002478-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>. It is also possible that the phase of the leader neuron is advanced while that of the follower neuron is delayed. Hence, for either PRC type, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e564" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> increases due to delayed excitatory coupling, that is, synchrony is destabilized. For inhibitory synapses and type I PRCs, the leader neuron 1 delays its subsequent spike by a larger amount than the follower neuron 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002478-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>). In case of type II PRCs, neuron 1 experiences a weaker phase advance or stronger phase delay than neuron 1, or else the phase of neuron 1 is delayed while that of neuron 1 is advanced, depending on <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e565" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e566" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002478-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>). Thus, delayed inhibitory coupling causes <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e567" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to decrease towards zero for either PRC type, that is, synchrony is stabilized.</p>

This upper bound primarily depends on the type of the PRCs and the synaptic time constants.

This means, the spike frequency of one neuron becomes faster than that of the other neuron. Neurons with type II PRCs on the other hand have stable phase locked states even for diverging coupling strengths. Bistability of two phase locked states can occur for a ratio <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e600" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> close to one (equal coupling strengths), depending on the PRC and the delay. Synchronization of excitatory-inhibitory pairs is not considered in this paper. It should be noted however, that if both neurons have type I PRCs, phase locking is not possible, irrespective of the ratio of coupling strengths. In this case, one interaction function is strictly positive and the other strictly negative and thus, the condition (26) for fixed points of eq. (25) cannot be fulfilled.</p>

For equal synaptic strengths, these networks settle into splay states where the neurons are pairwise phase locked, with uniformly distributed phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002478-g009">Fig. 9B,D</xref>). When the delays are large enough and the synaptic strengths equal, splay states also occur in networks of neurons with large <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e623" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, indicated by low <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e624" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and high <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e625" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002478-g009">Fig. 9A,B</xref>. As far as inhibitory networks are concerned, non-adapting neurons synchronize, without delays or with random delays of up to 10 ms. Furthermore, synchrony in these networks is largely robust against heterogeneities in the coupling strengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002478-g009">Fig. 9A</xref>). Networks of inhibitory neurons with subthreshold adaptation only show synchronization and pairwise locking for larger delays (i.e. <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e626" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> random in <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e627" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or larger). Spike-triggered adaptation promotes clustering of the network into two clusters, where the neurons within a cluster are in synchrony, as long as the delays are small. These cluster states seem to be most robust against heterogeneous synaptic strengths when the delays are small but not zero. For larger delays, inhibitory neurons of all three types (with or without adaptation) synchronize, in a robust way against unequal synaptic strengths. The behaviors of inhibitory networks are consistent with the phase locked states found in pairs of inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002478-g006">Fig. 6D–F</xref>). Particularly, stable synchronization of pairs with larger conduction delays and the bistability of in-phase and anti-phase locking of pairs with spike-triggered adaptation for smaller delays, nicely carry over to networks. In the former case, synchrony of pairs relates to network synchrony, in the latter case, bistability of in-phase and anti-phase locking of individual pairs can explain the observed two cluster states. Note that bistability of in-phase and anti-phase locking is also shown for inhibitory pairs with subthreshold adaptation and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e628" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In this case however, the slope of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e629" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> at <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e630" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is almost zero (not shown), which might explain why the corresponding networks do not develop two-cluster states. The behavior of all simulated networks does not critically depend on the number of neurons in the network, as we obtain qualitatively similar results for network sizes changed to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e631" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e632" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (not shown). The numerical simulations demonstrate that stable phase locked states of neural pairs can be used to predict the behavior of larger networks.</p>

The exact conductance values at which this change, i.e. the BT bifurcation, occurs, differ (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e724" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the Traub model and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e725" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the aEIF model).</p>

These two-cluster states of networks can be explained by the bistability of synchrony and anti-synchrony of individual pairs.

      <p>In this work we studied the role of adaptation in the aEIF model as an endogenous neuronal mechanism that controls network dynamics. We described the effects of subthreshold and spike-triggered adaptation currents on the PRC in dependence of spike frequency. To provide insight into the synchronization tendencies of coupled neurons, we applied a common phase reduction technique and used the PRC to describe neuronal interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Ermentrout5">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Kuramoto1">[55]</xref>. For pairs of coupled oscillating neurons we analyzed synchrony and phase locking under consideration of conduction delays and heterogeneous synaptic strengths. We then performed numerical simulations of aEIF networks to examine whether the predicted behavior of coupled pairs relates to the activity of larger networks. Finally, to express the biophysical relevance of the elementary subthreshold and spike-triggered adaptation mechanisms in the aEIF model, we compared their effects with those of the adaptation currents <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e769" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e770" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the high-dimensional Traub neuron model, on single neuron as well as network behavior.</p>
      <p>Conductance <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e771" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which mostly determines the amount of adaptation current in absence of spikes, that is, subthreshold, qualitatively changes the rest-spiking transition of an aEIF neuron, from a SN to an AH via a BT bifurcation as <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e772" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> increases. Thereby the neuron's excitability, as defined by the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e773" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e774" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> curve, and its PRC, are turned from class I to class II, and type I to type II, respectively. A similar effect of a slow outward current that acts in the subthreshold regime on the PRC has recently been shown for a two-dimensional quadratic non-leaky integrate-and-fire (QIF) model derived from a normal form of a dynamical model that undergoes a BT bifurcation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Ermentrout2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Ermentrout5">[48]</xref>. The relation between the PRC and the bifurcation types has further been emphasized by Brown et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Brown1">[47]</xref> who analytically determined PRCs for bifurcation normal forms and found type I and II PRC characteristics for the SN and AH bifurcations, respectively. A spike-triggered increment <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e775" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of adaptation current does not affect the bifurcation structure of the aEIF model and leaves the excitability class unchanged. When <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e776" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is small such that the model is in the SN bifurcation regime, an increase of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e777" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> cannot change the PRC type. In the AH bifurcation regime, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e778" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> substantially affects the range of input current for which the PRC is type II but causes only a small change in the corresponding frequency range. Furthermore, spike-triggered adaptation strongly influences the skew of the PRC, shifting its peak towards the end of the ISI for larger values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e779" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Such a right-skewed PRC implies that the neuron is most sensitive to synaptic inputs that are received just before it spikes. Similar effects of spike-triggered negative feedback with slow decay on the skew of the PRC have been reported for an extended QIF model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Ermentrout2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Ermentrout3">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Ermentrout5">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Gutkin1">[58]</xref>.</p>
      <p>PRCs determine synchronization properties of coupled oscillating neurons. When the synapses are fast compared to the oscillation period, the stability of the in-phase and anti-phase locked states (which always exist for pairs of identical neurons) can be “read off” the PRC for any mutual conduction delay, as we have demonstrated. A similar stability criterion that depends on the slopes of the PRCs at the phases at which the inputs are received has recently been derived for pairs of pulse-coupled oscillators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Woodman1">[59]</xref>. Under the assumption of pulsatile coupling, the effect of a synaptic input is required to dissipate before the next input is received. In principle, the synaptic current can be strong, but it must be brief such that the perturbed trajectory returns to the limit cycle before the next perturbation occurs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Smeal1">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We have shown that, as long as synaptic delays are negligible and synaptic strengths equal, excitatory pairs synchronize if their PRCs are type II, as caused by <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e780" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and lock almost in-phase if their PRCs are type I with a strong skew, as mediated by <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e781" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Inhibitory pairs synchronize in presence of conduction delays and show bistability of in-phase and anti-phase locking for small delays, particularly in case of skewed PRCs. Conduction delays and synaptic time constants can affect the stability of synchrony in a similar way, by producing a lateral shift of the interaction function <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e782" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002478-g004">Fig. 4</xref>. Note however, that the synaptic timescale has an additional effect on the shape of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e783" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, smoothing it for slower synaptic rise and decay times. We have further demonstrated that heterogeneity in synaptic strengths desynchronizes excitatory and inhibitory pairs and leads to phase locking with a small phase difference in case of type II PRCs and small delays. While neurons with type II PRCs have stable phase locked states even for large differences in synaptic strengths, pairs of coupled neurons with type I PRCs are only guaranteed to phase lock when the synaptic strengths are equal. Similar effects of heterogeneous synaptic conductances have recently been observed in a computational study of weakly coupled Wang-Buszaki and Hodgkin-Huxley neurons (with class I and II excitability, respectively) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Bradley1">[60]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The activity of larger aEIF networks, simulated numerically, is consistent with the predictions of the behavior of pairs. In fact, knowledge on phase locking of coupled pairs helps to explain the observed network states. Both adaptation mediated PRC characteristics, i.e. a negative lobe or a pronounced right skew, favor synchronization in networks of excitatory neurons, in agreement with previous findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Crook1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Ermentrout3">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Hansel1">[61]</xref>. This phenomenon only occurs when the conduction delays are negligible. It has been shown previously that synchrony in networks of excitatory oscillators becomes unstable when considering coupling with delays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Ernst1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Ermentrout7">[63]</xref>. We have demonstrated that increased conduction delays promote asynchrony in excitatory networks, with or without adaptation currents. Inhibitory neurons on the other hand are able to synchronize spiking in larger networks for a range of conduction delays. This provides support to the hypothesis that inhibitory networks play an essential role in generating coherent brain rhythms, as has been proposed earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Wang2">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Bartos1">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Wang1">[2]</xref> for review. Inhibition rather than excitation has been found to generate neuronal synchrony particularly in case of slow synaptic rise and decay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Jeong1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Hansel1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-vanVreeswijk1">[65]</xref>, and in the presence of conduction delays as has recently been shown experimentally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Wang3">[66]</xref>. In regimes that lead to bistability of in-phase and anti-phase locking according to our analysis of pairs, the simulated networks break up into two clusters of synchronized neurons. Recently it has been shown that a stable two cluster state of pulse coupled neural oscillators can exist even when synchrony of individual pairs is unstable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Chandrasekaran1">[67]</xref>. Such cluster states have been invoked to explain population rhythms measured in vitro, where the involved neurons spike at about half of the population frequency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Pervouchine1">[68]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Spike frequency has been shown to affect the skewness of PRCs, using type I integrate-and-fire neurons with adaptation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Gutkin1">[58]</xref>, and to modulate the negative lobe in type II PRCs of conductance based model neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Fink1">[45]</xref>. Using the aEIF model we have demonstrated that the spike frequency strongly attenuates the effect of either adaptation mechanism on the PRC. At high frequency, unphysiologically large adaptation parameter values are necessary to produce a negative lobe or a significant right-skew in the PRC. This means, for a given degree of adaptation in excitatory neurons, synchronization is possible at frequencies up to a certain value. The stronger the adaptation, the larger this upper frequency limit. It has been previously suggested that the degree of adaptation can determine a preferred frequency range for synchronization of excitatory neurons, based on the observation (in vitro and in silico) that the neurons tend to spike in phase with injected currents oscillating at certain frequencies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Fuhrmann1">[69]</xref>. This preferred oscillation frequency increases with increasing degree of SFA. According to our results, at low frequencies synchronization of local circuits through excitatory synapses is possible, provided that the neurons are adapting and delays are short. At higher frequencies, adaptation much less affects the synchronization tendency of excitatory neurons and inhibition may play the dominant role in generating coherent rhythms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Wang2">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Bartos1">[64]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The adaptation currents <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e784" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e785" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> have previously been found to influence the phase response characteristics of the biophysical Traub neuron model, turning a type I PRC to type II (through <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e786" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and modulating its skew (through <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e787" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Ermentrout2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Ermentrout3">[22]</xref>. We have shown that these changes of the PRC are reflected in the aEIF model by its two adaptation parameters and that in both models (aEIF and Traub) these changes are modulated by the spike frequency. As a consequence, the adaptation induced effects on synchronization of pairs and networks of oscillating neurons are qualitatively similar in both models. Quantitative differences with respect to these effects may well be reduced by fitting the aEIF model parameters to Traub neuron features.</p>
      <p>Our analysis of phase locked states is based on the assumption that synaptic interactions are weak. Experimental work lending support to this assumption has been reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Smeal1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Hoppenstaedt1">[50]</xref>. Particularly for stellate cells of the entorhinal cortex, synaptic coupling has been found to be weak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Netoff2">[70]</xref>. Another assumption in this study is that the neurons spike with the same frequency. Considering a pair of neurons spiking at different frequencies, equation (23) needs to be augmented by a scalar <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e788" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which accounts for the constant frequency mismatch between the two neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002478-Izhikevich4">[71]</xref>: <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e789" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In this case, the condition for the existence of phase locked states is <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e790" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Due to the assumption of weak synaptic strengths however, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e791" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> must be small, which means that the above condition can only be met if <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478.e792" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is small. In other words, in the limit of weak coupling phase locking is only possible if the spike frequencies are identical or differ only slightly. The phase reduction technique considered here, and PRCs in general, are of limited applicability for studying network dynamics in a regime where individual neurons spike at different frequencies, or even irregularly. How adaptation currents affect network synchronization and rhythm in such a regime nevertheless remains an interesting question to be addressed in the future.</p>
