Demand grew stronger each year for an umbrella organization that extended its reach beyond a once-a-year conference. The International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) was formed in 1997 to provide computational biologists and bioinformaticians worldwide with a community of peers with whom they could interact year-round in their mutual quest to advance the understanding of living systems through computation. Over the past 13 years, the ISCB has grown and evolved along with the fields of computational biology and bioinformatics. As the society's president, I am proud to report that our membership now comprises nearly 2,000 members in over 50 countries.</p><p>Each year, <italic>PLoS Computational Biology,</italic> as the official journal of the ISCB, will publish the bylaws of the society. These are the legally registered rules by which the elected and appointed leaders of the society, along with the membership at large, must abide. It is my hope that ISCB members will take the time to read these rules, and to understand, thereby, the legal framework in which ISCB operates. Clearly, as ISCB grows, these rules will be adapted to changing circumstances—knowing the current rules is a first step to making any improvements to them. We also believe that our bylaws may be useful to other groups trying to form similar organizations.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>International Society for Computational Biology Bylaws</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Article I: Office</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>Section 1: Principal office.</title><p>The principal office of the Corporation shall be at San Diego Supercomputer Center, UCSD, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093-0505</p></sec><sec id="s2a2"><title>Section 2: Other offices.</title><p>The Corporation may also have an office or offices in such other place or places as the business of the Corporation may require and the Board of Directors may from time to time appoint.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Article II: Members</title><sec id="s2b1"><title>Section 1:Annual meeting.</title><p>The annual meeting of the members of the Corporation shall be held on a day duly designated by the Board of Directors either within or without the United States if not a legal holiday, and if a legal holiday then the next succeeding day not a legal holiday, for the transaction of such corporate business as may come before the meeting.</p></sec><sec id="s2b2"><title>Section 2: Special meetings.</title><p>Special meetings of the members may be called at any time for any purpose or purposes by the Chairman of the Board, the President, a Vice President, or a majority of the Board of Directors, and shall be called forthwith by the Chairman of the Board, the President, a Vice President, the Secretary or any Director of the Corporation upon the request in writing of a majority of all the members entitled to vote on the business to be transacted at such meeting.
