        <p>Genome-wide rhythms in RNA polymerase II loading and dynamic chromatin remodeling underlie periodic gene expression during diurnal cycles in the mouse liver.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Interactions of cell-autonomous circadian oscillators with diurnal cycles govern the temporal compartmentalization of cell physiology in mammals. To understand the transcriptional and epigenetic basis of diurnal rhythms in mouse liver genome-wide, we generated temporal DNA occupancy profiles by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) as well as profiles of the histone modifications H3K4me3 and H3K36me3. We used these data to quantify the relationships of phases and amplitudes between different marks. We found that rhythmic Pol II recruitment at promoters rather than rhythmic transition from paused to productive elongation underlies diurnal gene transcription, a conclusion further supported by modeling. Moreover, Pol II occupancy preceded mRNA accumulation by 3 hours, consistent with mRNA half-lives. Both methylation marks showed that the epigenetic landscape is highly dynamic and globally remodeled during the 24-hour cycle. While promoters of transcribed genes had tri-methylated H3K4 even at their trough activity times, tri-methylation levels reached their peak, on average, 1 hour after Pol II. Meanwhile, rhythms in tri-methylation of H3K36 lagged transcription by 3 hours. Finally, modeling profiles of Pol II occupancy and mRNA accumulation identified three classes of genes: one showing rhythmicity both in transcriptional and mRNA accumulation, a second class with rhythmic transcription but flat mRNA levels, and a third with constant transcription but rhythmic mRNAs. The latter class emphasizes widespread temporally gated posttranscriptional regulation in the mouse liver.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>In mammalian organs such as the liver, many metabolic and physiological processes occur preferentially at specific times during the 24-hour daily cycle. The timing of these rhythmic functions depends on a complex interplay between the endogenous circadian clock and environmental timing cues relayed through the master circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or via feeding rhythms. These rhythms can be implemented on several regulatory levels, and here we aimed at a better understanding of the transcriptional and epigenetic changes that regulate diurnal rhythms. We performed genome-wide analysis of the locations of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and the epigenetic histone modifications H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 at specific times of day, relating these data to mRNA expression levels. Our analyses show that Pol II transcriptional rhythms are biphasic in mouse liver, having predominant peak activities in the morning and evening. Moreover, dynamic changes in histone marks lag transcription rhythms genome-wide, indicating that the epigenetic landscape can be remodeled during the 24-hour cycle. Finally, a quantitative analysis of temporal Pol II and mRNA accumulation profiles indicates that posttranscriptional regulation significantly contributes to the amplitude and phase of mRNA accumulation profiles. While many studies have analyzed how transcription and chromatin states are modified during irreversible cell differentiation processes, our work highlights how these states can evolve reversibly in a system exhibiting periodicity in time.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In most mammalian organs, widespread diurnal rhythms in mRNA expression underlie the temporal compartmentalization of cellular and physiological processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Bass1">[1]</xref>. In liver, these rhythms reflect the combined effects of regulation by time-varying systemic signals and by the autonomous circadian oscillator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Kornmann1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Lamia1">[3]</xref>. Pol II–dependent gene expression in the liver exhibits widespread and large-amplitude daily rhythms in transcript accumulation that temporally compartmentalize key hepatic functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Huang1">[4]</xref> such as lipid and carbohydrate metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Rudic1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Gachon1">[6]</xref>, sterol biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-LeMartelot1">[7]</xref>, or detoxification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Gachon2">[8]</xref>. In liver, chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP) studies on key circadian transcription factors are shedding light on how the clock achieves phase-specific transcription rhythms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Ripperger1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Cho1">[14]</xref>. Studies on many individual genes have shown that circadian transcription is accompanied by temporally varying epigenetic modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Ripperger1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Etchegaray1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Padmanabhan1">[19]</xref>, but it is only recently that this question is being addressed genome-wide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Koike1">[20]</xref>. Such studies are important as they can reveal the relationships between the kinetics of transcription and related histone modifications in a system that returns to the same state every 24 h.</p>
      <p>Here we quantified in time the recruitment of Pol II to gene promoters, the loading of Pol II in gene bodies, the levels of H3K4 and H3K36 trimethylation, as well as the accumulation of mRNAs at six time points around a 24-h cycle. We mapped H3K4 and H3K36 trimethylation because these marks are known to accumulate to high levels just downstream of active TSSs in the first case <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Barski1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Schneider1">[23]</xref>, and within the body of transcribed genes, with higher accumulation toward the end of the transcription unit, in the second case <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Barski1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Guenther1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-KolasinskaZwierz1">[25]</xref>. Comparison of these marks with Pol II accumulation provides us with two independent ways to assess location of active TSSs and transcription units. We used these data to provide a comprehensive view on how these quantities are dynamically related in terms of phases and amplitudes. Moreover, a mathematical model relating transcription and mRNA accumulation profiles, which enforces the associated quantitative constraints on phases and amplitudes, reveals a role for posttranscriptional processes in cyclic mRNA accumulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Kojima1">[26]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Analysis of ChIP-seq profiles for Pol II (RPB2 subunit), H3K4me3, and H3K36me3 in mouse liver revealed that Pol II occupancy correlated well with known transcription phases of core clock and clock-control genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001442.s001">S1</xref>). For example, the master clock regulator <italic>Bmal1</italic> was maximally occupied by Pol II, both at the promoter and within the gene body, at Zeitgeber Time (ZT) 22 (ZT0 corresponds to light on and ZT12 to light off), whereas its direct target and repressor, the nuclear receptor <italic>RevErbα</italic>, reached peak occupancy levels at ZT6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g001">Figure 1A,B</xref>), consistent with the known temporal transcription pattern of these genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Preitner1">[27]</xref>. The temporal variation of these profiles indicates that Pol II is loaded dynamically to the gene promoters and that productive elongation as reflected by Pol II occupancy in the gene bodies varies in phase with the promoter signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001442.s011">Movies S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001442.s012">S2</xref>).

        <title>The Spatial Organization of Pol II and Associated Chromatin Modifications Along the Genome</title>
        <p>Pol II transcription starts with recruitment of the polymerase complex to gene promoters to form closed complexes. This initial step is followed by the isomerization to the open complex, abortive transcription, promoter escape, release from possible proximal pausing, elongation, and transcript termination (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Sims1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Nechaev1">[31]</xref>). The transition kinetics from one phase to the next can lead to distinct genomic Pol II occupation profiles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-GloverCutter1">[32]</xref>. We analyzed the Pol II spatial profiles around transcript start sites (TSSs) and polyadenylation sites (PASs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g002">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Near TSSs, we obtained profiles consistent with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Barski1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Sultan1">[33]</xref>, although high read coverage enabled us to resolve three bumps located approximately at positions −200, +1, and +80 bp. The Pol II signal trailed downstream of the TSS, reflecting productive elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-GloverCutter1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Rahl1">[34]</xref>. At PASs, we observed a dip in the Pol II signal followed by an increase above the level observed upstream of the PASs, suggesting a slowing down of the polymerase after transcript cleavage and before transcription termination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Nechaev1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-GloverCutter1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Rahl1">[34]</xref>. The H3K4me3 mark peaked about 200 nucleotides downstream of the TSS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Barski1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Yamashita1">[35]</xref> and was absent around the PAS. In contrast, the H3K36me3 mark was absent near the TSS but accumulated increasingly toward the 3′-proximal end of genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Guenther1">[24]</xref> to dip just before the PAS, rebound, and then slowly decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g002">Figure 2A,B</xref>). We then stratified our data into quartiles according to mRNA accumulation levels obtained from the same samples. Pol II occupancy as well as the two histone marks clearly scaled with mRNA accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g002">Figures 2C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001442.s002">S2A–D</xref>), and Pol II occupancy scaled with increased CpG content in promoters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001442.s002">Figure S2E</xref>,F). This suggests that in mouse liver, the genes most highly occupied by Pol II are in general genes with promoter-associated CpG islands.</p>

        <title>Promoter Proximal Pol II Occupancy Is Rhythmic in Liver and Predicts Transcription</title>
        <p>The results above reveal the spatial arrangement of Pol II, H3K4me3, and H3K36me3 along genes as well as the dynamic changes of these marks during a diurnal cycle. We further analyzed the genome-wide relationship between Pol II density at promoters, probably reflecting polymerases with the C-terminal domain (CTD) either hypophosphorylated or phosphorylated on Serine (Ser) 5 in the closed complex, open complex, and paused states, and that of Pol II density within gene bodies, likely to represent elongating enzymes with CTDs increasingly phosphorylated on Ser 2 in addition to Ser 5 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Brookes1">[36]</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Rahl1">[34]</xref> and references therein). We found two main populations of genes: those with low Pol II in both promoters and gene bodies and those with higher Pol II in both regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Our mRNA expression data indicated that the first group corresponds to genes transcribed at background levels and the second to actively transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001442.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). The lower Pol II density observed in gene bodies relative to promoter regions (by a factor of 3 to 10; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) likely reflects polymerases elongating at a typical speed of ∼60 nt/s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Singh1">[37]</xref>, thus diluting the read signals as compared to the nearly static polymerases proximal to promoters. The Pol II densities in the gene bodies and downstream of the PAS correlated well; nevertheless, the latter showed an increased signal compared to the former, perhaps due to Pol II pausing downstream of the PAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g002">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g003">3B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-GloverCutter1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Rosonina1">[38]</xref>.</p>

            <p>(A) Pol II occupancy at ZT2 in promoters (mean in ±1 kb regions around TSSs) versus gene bodies (mean over the regions from +1 kb to the PAS) for all genes in logarithmic scale. Color intensity indicates population density. One transcription unit per gene is shown (the selection is based on H3K4me3 and Pol II signals at promoters and PAS, as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Two main populations can be distinguished: one with low Pol II occupancy in both promoter and gene body regions (lower left cloud), corresponding to silent or weakly transcribed genes, and one with higher Pol II occupancy within promoter regions and, to a lower extent, gene body regions (fainter cloud shifted slightly up and to the right). The bimodality of the promoter signal is clearly seen in the projection (histogram above the horizontal axis), whereas the signal in the gene body (elongating polymerases) has a lower dynamic range (histogram on the vertical axis shown in panel B). The cross sign, also shown in panels C and D, indicates background levels estimated from the lower maxima of the histograms. (B) Pol II occupancy at ZT2 in the first 1 kb window after the PAS (PAS1K) versus gene bodies (as in A). The two measures show high correlation, but PAS1K has a larger dynamic range (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In (A) and (B), data are shown for ZT2, but all time points looked virtually identical.

        <p>The net transcription rate can be controlled on several levels: at the level of Pol II recruitment to promoters by transcription factors as studied in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Rosonina1">[38]</xref> as well as at a postrecruitment stage through the release of Pol II from promoter proximal pausing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Guenther1">[24]</xref>. The relative importance of these two regulation steps seems to vary in different biological settings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Rahl1">[34]</xref>. Our time series allowed us to examine the temporal relationships between Pol II occupancy in promoters, in gene bodies, and downstream of the PASs. For both core clock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) and circadian output genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), we found that, at the measured time resolution, the three quantities varied in phase. This is seen both in the overlaid temporal profiles (left rows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g003">Figure 3C,D</xref>) and in the temporally correlated promoter and gene body signals (right rows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g003">Figure 3C,D</xref>). The tendency of Pol II occupancy in promoters and gene bodies to vary in phase was confirmed genome-wide as indicated by the averaged orientation of temporal promoter and gene body signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g003">Figures 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001442.s003">S3D</xref>–G) and similarly for the relationship between promoter and PAS signals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001442.s003">Figure S3H</xref>). As supported by a simulation of a mathematical model of transcription describing the Pol II recruitment step, isomerization to the open complex, promoter escape, release from promoter proximal pausing, and elongation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001442.s004">Figure S4</xref>), this argues that rhythmic loading of Pol II to gene promoters, rather than a rhythmic transition from a paused state to productive elongation, primarily underlies diurnal transcription rhythms for the vast majority of transcripts expressed above background levels. Indeed, the scenario of a temporally regulated pausing release would lead to anticorrelated promoter and gene body signals traces (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001442.s004">Figure S4</xref>), which is not observed.</p>

        <title>The Chromatin Landscape Is Dynamically Remodeled During Diurnal Cycles</title>
        <p>A similar analysis of the levels of Pol II and H3K4me3 at gene promoters identified two well-separated populations exhibiting either both low H3K4me3 and Pol II levels or high H3K4me3 and Pol II levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Most likely, H3K4me3 separates nonactive from active genes in the liver, consistent with previous data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Barski1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Schneider1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Wang1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Ernst1">[40]</xref>. Similarly, the comparison of H3K36me3 with Pol II in gene bodies, both indicative of active transcription, revealed that the H3K36me3 signals split into populations with low and high gene body Pol II occupancy, probably reflecting non- or lowly transcribed and actively transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). This was even more obvious when H3K36me3 was compared with Pol II density at promoters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001442.s003">Figure S3A</xref>), again reflecting the lower Pol II sampling depth in gene bodies. Comparing H3K4me3 at promoters and H3K36me3 in gene bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) showed that the populations identified by either mark were highly correlated, indicating that, in the liver, H3K4me3-marked promoters are often actively transcribed. While this holds strictly for constitutively transcribed genes, rhythmically transcribed genes are among the exceptions as the promoters of both core clock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g004">Figure 4D</xref>) and clock output genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g004">Figure 4E</xref>) harbored relatively high levels of H3K4me3 even at times of lowest Pol II occupancy. Thus the amplitude of the H3K4me3 rhythm was damped compared to that of Pol II. For example, Pol II occupancy for the <italic>Per2</italic> gene dropped close to background levels at nadir time ZT2, whereas H3K4me3 levels remained relatively high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g004">Figure 4D–F</xref>). H3K36me3 rhythms exhibited a similarly compressed cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g004">Figures 4D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001442.s005">S5C</xref>,D). The compressed amplitudes of the methylation mark levels as compared to Pol II occupancy suggest firstly that histone modifications may saturate before maximal transcription is reached and secondly that in a system where transcription levels oscillate on the scale of 24 h, methylation marks may not be removed completely before transcription increases again. Thus, in a situation of fast changing transcription, methylation marks do not provide linear measures of transcription.</p>

Even at this permissive false discovery rate (FDR), this set shows excellent overlap with previously published transcriptome data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001442.s006">Figure S6A</xref>,B; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001442.s016">Table S4</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Hughes1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Hughes3">[43]</xref>, and an extended selection (<italic>n</italic> = 752) shows equally convincing overlap (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001442.s006">Figure S6C</xref>–E). These genes clearly showed a bimodal distribution in peak Pol II phase with maxima at ZT9 and ZT21 both for the promoter and gene body signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), consistent with models of phase-specific circadian transcription in which E-box elements drive the transcription of morning genes and RORE elements that of evening genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Ueda1">[44]</xref>. In fact, the transcription phases of promoter found to be bound by the E-box activator BMAL1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Rey1">[11]</xref> and the repressor of RORE elements RevErbα <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Cho1">[14]</xref> support this interpretation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001442.s007">Figure S7A</xref>). Since we found a strong correlation between Pol II loadings at promoters and CpG content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001442.s002">Figure S2E</xref>), we stratified our analysis accordingly. While the phase distributions did not show a significant difference in promoters with low versus high CpG content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001442.s007">Figure S7B</xref>), the rhythms of high CpG content promoters show slightly damped amplitudes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001442.s007">Figure S7C</xref>). These two waves of transcription preceded biphasic mRNA accumulation, albeit not as sharp, centered on ZT15 and ZT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, mRNA). Both the delay and less sharp bimodality are expected from mRNA processing and turnover times, the latter ranging from minutes to days with a mean of a few hours in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Ross1">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Dolken1">[46]</xref>.

A selection of 284 genes (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.004, FDR = 0.3) showing cyclic patterns in all marks (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) were fitted with a cosine function and the phase (peak time of the fit) was computed. These phases show a bimodal distribution for Pol II occupancy in promoters and gene bodies with maxima around ZT9 and ZT21, as well as in mRNA accumulation with a phase delay of approximately 3 h. (B) Phases for the same genes are represented in pairs, with color shade indicating <italic>p</italic> value (lower <italic>p</italic> values are darker) for the 24-h rhythm of the Pol II promoter signal. Relative to the phase of Pol II in promoters, we find high concordance for Pol II occupancy phases in gene bodies, an average delay of 1.3 h for H3K4me3 phases, and more spread H3K36me3 and mRNA phases with an average delay of about 3 h. Colored lines are mean-square regressions with intercepts corresponding to the average delays, as indicated in color. The thin dashed lines indicate ±2 h delays. (C) Temporal cross-correlation analysis.

Pol II occupancies in promoters and gene bodies are well-correlated and simultaneous, and H3K4me3 lags by about 1 h on average, whereas mRNA and H3K36me3 are phase-delayed by about 3 h.

        <title>Temporal Relationships of Pol II Occupancy and mRNA Accumulation Suggest Widespread Posttranscriptional Control</title>
        <p>To establish whether rhythmically accumulating mRNA can be explained from rhythmic transcription, we quantitatively compared phases and amplitudes of Pol II occupancy with mRNA levels. While the relative importance of transcriptional amplitudes and mRNA stability leads to a continuum of mRNA phases and amplitudes (cf., Kinetic model for mRNA accumulation, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), we chose to discuss qualitatively different outcomes by distinguishing three classes of genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001442.s016">Table S4</xref>; Materials and Methods). Class 1 genes (<italic>n</italic> = 675) were rhythmic with regard to both transcription and mRNA accumulation. Class 2 genes (<italic>n</italic> = 668) were transcribed rhythmically, but their RNAs accumulated at almost constant levels. Finally, class 3 genes (<italic>n</italic> = 217) were constitutively transcribed, but their RNAs accumulated in a rhythmic manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Cases of class 2 genes have been described previously and include the serum albumin (<italic>Alb</italic>) gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Wuarin1">[47]</xref>, whose mature transcripts are relatively stable. Thus, mRNAs issued from class 2 genes are probably longer lived than mRNAs specified by class 1 genes, consistent with mRNA half-life measurements in mouse fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Dolken1">[46]</xref>. The rhythmic accumulation of mRNAs produced by class 3 genes is probably driven by posttranscriptional mechanisms, such as oscillating processing efficiencies and degradation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). The comparison of class 1 and class 3 genes—that is, those with rhythmic mRNAs—overlapped highly with previous transcriptome analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001442.s009">Figure S9</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Hughes1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Hughes3">[43]</xref>. Gene Ontology analysis indicated that class 1 genes are strongly enriched in rhythmic hepatic function (e.g., involving carbohydrate and lipid metabolism). On the other hand, class 2 and class 3 genes were not associated with these canonical diurnal functions, showing no obvious functional themes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001442.s017">Tables S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001442.s018">S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001442.s019">S7</xref>). A kinetic model that considers a cosine-shaped synthesis rate with a 24-h period and constant degradation predicted that the mRNA accumulation can be delayed maximally by 6 h for very long-lived transcripts, which is consistent for the majority of the transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Delays outside this range must thus reflect the cyclic control of posttranscriptional events. A further prediction is that the ratio of relative amplitudes in mRNA accumulation versus transcription follows a cosine function of the delay, which is consistent with the bulk of our data, emphasizing that, on average, our Pol II amplitudes from ChIP-seq are in quantitative relationship with the measured microarray mRNA accumulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). The study of individual transcripts showed that some class 2 genes (with damped mRNA amplitudes) indeed show accumulation phases that are consistent with constant long-lived transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g006">Figure 6E</xref>, light gray region), while others have compressed mRNA amplitudes but only small phase delays, suggesting a nonconstant transcript half-live that buffers rhythmic transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g006">Figure 6E</xref>, orange region). On the opposite end, temporally varying half-lives may enhance diurnal amplitudes in mRNA accumulation beyond what is expected from transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g006">Figure 6E</xref>, red region). Examples of the latter case (class 3 genes) were <italic>Fus</italic>, <italic>Tfrc</italic>, and <italic>Spon2</italic>, whose cyclic accumulation was confirmed by a quantitative RT-PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g006">Figure 6F–H</xref>).

            <p>(A) Relative amplitudes (maximum minus minimum, divided by twice the mean after background subtraction; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) of oscillations in Pol II promoter signals and mRNA accumulation identify rhythmic mRNAs with relative amplitudes comparable to that of transcription (class 1, gray, 675 genes), long-lived transcripts with damped mRNA rhythms (class 2, orange, 668 genes), and mRNAs where posttranscriptional regulation increases rhythmic amplitude (class 3, red, 217 genes). Light gray genes are all genes that cycle robustly in either Pol II or mRNA accumulation (3,446 genes). <italic>Fus</italic>, <italic>Tfrc</italic>, and <italic>Spon2</italic> are representative of class 3 and <italic>Rdbp</italic> of class 2 (see panels F–I for qRT-PCR validations). The few values larger than 1 are due to low signals when background subtraction makes trough values negative. (B) Half-lives of the three classes taken from NIH-3T3 fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Dolken1">[46]</xref> show a significant difference (TukeyHSD <italic>p</italic> value &lt;10<sup>−6</sup> for class 2 versus class 1, and class 2 versus class 3). (C) Delays in peak mRNA accumulation versus peak Pol II promoter loading for the union of class 1, class 2, and class 3 genes. The dark gray region delimits the range predicted for a model with constant half-lives (0 h delay for very short-lived up to 6 h for very long-lived transcripts). (D–E) For the same genes the ratio of relative amplitudes (<italic>B</italic> = relative amplitude of Pol II, <italic>b</italic> = relative amplitude of mRNA) is plotted against the phase delay, together with the prediction for a constant half-life (red line). The trend (in D, median is the blue line and 25% and 75% percentiles are shown as light blue shading) shows that the ratio is centered on one at short delays and decreases for larger delays. The scatter plot (E) highlights genes for which transcript accumulation is explained by a constant half-life (dark gray area represents short and light gray long half-lives), and genes where nonconstant half-lives either suppress (light orange) or enhance (light red) amplitudes in mRNA accumulation. Triangles show core circadian clock genes. (F–I) Transcription and mRNA accumulation for representative genes. Comparison of (i) mRNA levels as measured by gene expression arrays, (ii) promoter Pol II occupancy as measured by ChIP-Seq, and (iii) pre-mRNA and (iv) mRNA levels as measured by qRT-PCR with intronic and exonic probes, respectively. Symbols and lines indicate measurements and cosine fits, respectively. Open symbols and dashed lines show qRT-PCR data (cDNA from <italic>n</italic> = 4 animals where pooled) with circles for the pre-mRNA and triangles for the mRNA. Continuous lines and filled symbols represent Pol II ChIP-seq (circles) and mRNA Affymetrix data (triangles). Each temporal profile has been scaled to an arbitrary mean for visualization. Pre-mRNA levels closely follow Pol II promoter occupancy, as expected (given the short half-lives of pre-mRNAs). <italic>Fus</italic> and <italic>Spon2</italic> (F and H) show higher amplitude in mRNA compared to transcription; <italic>Tfrc</italic> (G) is transcribed at similar rates around the clock but shows rhythmic mRNA accumulation; <italic>Rdbp</italic> (I) shows rhythmic transcription but dampened mRNA accumulation.</p>

        <title>Rhythmic Recruitment of Pol II Rather Than Rhythmic Pol II Release Underlies Diurnal Transcription</title>
        <p>In mammalian in vitro Pol II transcription systems, in which the rate for de novo assembly of the transcriptional machinery at gene promoters is extremely low <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Hawley1">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Hawley2">[49]</xref>, the net transcription rate is thus set by Pol II recruitment to the DNA template. This has led to the idea that transcription in vivo is similarly controlled by Pol II recruitment to promoters by specific DNA binding factors. On the other hand, it has long been known that on certain promoters, an important regulation occurs after the recruitment and initiation steps by controlling the transition from a promoter proximal paused state to active elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Bentley1">[50]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Sawado1">[52]</xref>. In fact, recent results suggest that the regulation of this transition determines transcription output in up to one-third of the genes actively transcribed in ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Rahl1">[34]</xref>. Our finding that the temporal accumulation of Pol II at promoter proximal regions was in phase with Pol II occupancy within gene bodies strongly suggests that the rhythmic recruitment of Pol II to gene promoters is the principal step determining diurnal transcription rhythms in mouse liver. That is, the subsequent transitions, mainly initiation and de-pausing, do not significantly influence those rhythms. This hypothesis was supported by a simplified mathematical model of transcription assuming cyclic variation of either Pol II recruitment or elongation rates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001442.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Indeed, the genes displaying a profile consistent with an elongation-limited scenario (i.e., showing either profile with low amplitude in the Pol II levels at promoters compared to those in gene bodies or anticorrelated Pol II profiles at promoters and in gene bodies) were a minority of genes expressed at background levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001442.s003">Figure S3G</xref>). This is in contrast with the situation in proliferating ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Rahl1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Core1">[53]</xref>, where c-Myc controls a large fraction of genes by activating transcription elongation, and probably reflects a different mode by which transcription factors control daily transcription rhythms in a differentiated tissue. It will be interesting to compare our total Pol II occupancy (as detected by our ChIPs with antibodies directed against the second subunit of Pol II) with occupancies of Pol II phosphorylated either on Ser 5, or on both Ser 5 and 2, of the CTD. Of note, a recent study performed under constant darkness conditions (circadian CT times) reported that, unlike our bimodal transcription phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g005">Figure 5</xref>), promoter proximal Ser5-phosphorylated Pol II ChIP signals show a single dominating peak phased around CT1, while hypophosphorylated Pol II sharply peaked at the different CT16 phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Koike1">[20]</xref>. Further experiments, including localization of Ser2 phosphorylated Pol II, will be necessary to understand the dynamic progression of Pol II states during ZT conditions and may reveal differences between ZT and CT sampling. Such differences, as well as differential experimental methodologies and reagents, may also explain why our analysis did not reveal the antiphasic accumulation of Pol II downstream the PASs of the negative core clock regulators Per1 and Cry2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g004">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001442.s010">S10</xref>), as reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Padmanabhan1">[19]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Dynamic Changes in Histone Marks Indicate Daily Remodeling of Epigenetic Landscapes</title>
        <p>Our temporal analysis of Pol II occupancy and H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 histone marks in mouse liver revealed that the maxima in Pol II occupancy in promoters (or gene bodies) preceded peaks of H3K4me3 by 1 h, H3K36me3 by 3 h, and mRNA accumulation by 3 h. While this was unknown for the H3K36me3 mark, a similar finding for H3K4me3 was previously reported for the <italic>Dbp</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Ripperger1">[9]</xref>. Such a lag would be consistent with the mechanism of transcription-activation-linked H3K4 trimethylation in yeast, where the responsible Set1 histone methyltransferase is recruited through binding to the Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD) phosphorylated on serine 5 (i.e., after Pol II recruitment to the DNA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Ng1">[54]</xref>. In mammalian cells, however, the recruitment of the corresponding H3K4 methyltransferase (MLL1) occurs at least in part through binding to transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Ernst2">[55]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Milne1">[57]</xref> and indeed through the circadian CLOCK-BMAL1 complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Katada1">[17]</xref>, conceivably before Pol II recruitment. On the other hand, H3K4 trimethylation has been shown to be dependent on H2BK120 ubiquitination, itself dependent on assembly of the basal transcription machinery and transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Pavri1">[58]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Sims2">[59]</xref>, again suggesting that Pol II might need to be present for trimethylation to occur. The delay in peak accumulation may also reflect a relatively low clearance rate of H3K4me3 as observed in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Ng1">[54]</xref>. The H3K36me3 mark accumulated toward the end of genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Guenther1">[24]</xref>, consistent with the H3K36 methylase associating with the Pol II CTD phosphorylated on serine 2, the phosphorylation mark of elongating polymerase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Kizer1">[60]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Li2">[64]</xref>. Both H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 levels oscillated with shallower daily amplitudes compared to that of transcription, and H3K36me3 was even shallower than H3K4me3. The kinetics of maximum accumulation of the mark depend on both the kinetics of addition and removal from histone H3, but although H3K36 demethylases have been identified, the mechanisms regulating the H3K36me3 mark turnover are not well understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-deAlmeida1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Edmunds1">[65]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Berger1">[67]</xref>.

        <title>Posttranscriptional Regulation Significantly Contributes to Rhythmic Gene Accumulation</title>
        <p>The comparison between mRNA accumulation and Pol II occupation indicated that posttranscriptional mechanisms could strongly contribute to rhythmic diurnal gene expression. Thus, for class 2 genes, Pol II occupancy was cyclic, whereas mRNA accumulation was nearly flat. This would be expected for long-lived transcripts whose syntheses were diurnally rhythmic or, alternatively, in situations where a temporally varying mRNA degradation rate worked against transcription. For class 3 genes, mRNA abundance oscillated in spite of virtually constant polymerase occupancy, suggesting that cyclic pre-mRNA processing efficiency or mRNA decay was subject to diurnal regulation. Consistent with this notion, a rhythmic regulation of Drosophila <italic>per</italic> mRNA decay has previously been shown to contribute to the high amplitude accumulation of Drosophila <italic>per</italic> mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-So1">[68]</xref>. We should emphasize that our proposed class sizes and class membership may contain significant false positives and negatives owing to our low sampling rate. Nevertheless, the current definitions are rather consistent with the literature (i.e., class 1 contains most core circadian clock genes, class 2 genes contains several long-lived genes such as Albumin, and we validated several class 3 genes by qPCR). Also we were pleased that Pol II and mRNA amplitude were in quantitative relationship, indicating that there is no systematic bias when assessing diurnal rhythms by either method. While denser sampling might be applied in the future to increase statistical confidence, new methods to analyze multiple rhythmic data types will also be required.</p>

        <title>Transcriptional Regulation of Diurnal Protein Accumulation</title>
        <p>We have limited our analysis to transcription and mRNA accumulation and can thus not address to what extent the proteins issued by the investigated genes also accumulate in a cyclic fashion. However, the same arguments we have made about RNA synthesis and accumulation also apply for protein synthesis and accumulation. Thus, mRNAs with accumulation rhythms can only produce strongly oscillating proteins if these proteins are short-lived. For example, <italic>Bmal1</italic> mRNA accumulates with an about 30-fold amplitude, while due to a long half-life, BMAL1 protein levels only fluctuate about 3-fold in abundance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Preitner1">[27]</xref>. Surprisingly, a large fraction of liver proteins found to be cyclic in liver appear to be encoded by nonoscillating mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Reddy1">[69]</xref>. Hence, diurnally controlled translation and/or decay rates must account for the rhythmic accumulation of these proteins. We considered a scenario in which diurnal transcription might result in rhythmic translation of stably accumulating mRNAs. Since polyA length is an important mRNA element in the regulation of translation efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Gebauer1">[70]</xref>, it is conceivable that newly synthesized mRNA with longer poly(A) tails are more efficiently translated than older mRNAs. Hence, protein synthesis would follow transcription rather than mRNA accumulation. At least for two genes, <italic>Gstm1</italic> and <italic>Bhmt</italic>, which encode relatively stable mRNAs but oscillating proteins, the phases of Pol II occupancy and protein accumulation would be compatible with such a mechanism. Conceivably, the proposed scenario could apply to additional proteins that, due to their low abundance, have escaped detection in reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Reddy1">[69]</xref>. Further work will be required to examine whether cyclic transcription rates can lead to rhythmic translation rates in spite of compressed total mRNA accumulation profiles and, more generally, to study the contributions of cyclic protein degradation rates to the diurnally rhythmic proteome.</p>

        <p>About 100 mg of snap-frozen liver tissue were used for RNA preparation with the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and purified with a miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). For each time point, 500 ng of total RNA from each of the five mouse livers were pooled and analyzed on Mouse Gene 1.0ST arrays according to the manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix). All statistical analyses were performed with the statistical language R and various Bioconductor packages (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.Bioconductor.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.Bioconductor.org</ext-link>). Normalized expression signals were calculated from Affymetrix CEL files using RMA normalization method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001442-Irizarry1">[72]</xref>.</p>

        <p>cDNA was synthesized from 2 µg of liver whole-cell RNA using random hexamers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (RT) (Invitrogen) following the supplier's instructions. Five percent of this cDNA was PCR amplified (7900HT Sequence Detection Systems, Applied Biosystems) with the Sybr Green master mix (Applied Biosystems), and raw threshold-cycle (Ct) values were calculated with SDS 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems).

When computing genomic read densities, each alignment contributed 1/(total number of hits) to the local density. If several reads coming from the same library mapped at the same genomic position and on the same strand (redundant tags), we considered this as a PCR artifact and kept only one read for the rest of the analysis.

        <p>A set of 11,217 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001442.s014">Table S2</xref>) transcription units was selected for analysis as follows: for each Ensembl gene, the most upstream TSS and the most downstream PAS were selected. To ensure that spatial profiles collected around TSS and PAS were not distorted by signals from other genes, we selected TSSs and PASs removed by at least 1.5 kb from documented TSSs and PASs from any other gene. We further limited our analysis to genes for which we could unambiguously assign an Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST microarray probe set, to permit stratification of our spatial profiles by expression levels.</p>

        <title>Normalization and Quantification of ChIP-Seq Data</title>
        <p>To normalize for differences in sequencing depth among the time points, the number of tags per genomic position in each ChIP-Seq library was first rescaled by the total number of mapped tags. Annotated Ensembl genes were used to quantify the Pol II signals in promoters (window of ±1 kb around annotated TSSs), gene bodies (windows from +1 kb after the TSS to the PAS excluding any ±1 kb regions around internal promoters) and immediately downstream of the PASs (PAS to +1 kb). The H3K4me3 signals were quantified in a region extending from ±1 kb around TSSs. As the H3K36me3 signal was found mostly in the gene bodies towards the end of the genes, the last 40% of gene bodies were used for quantification. For each of these features, the signal densities were then quantile normalized across time points (data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001442.s015">Table S3</xref>). For the genomic profiles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001442-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001442.s001">S1</xref>, the densities at each genomic position were normalized according to those quantile normalizations.
