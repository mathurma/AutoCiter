<abstract>
<p>Damaged acinar cells play a passive role in activating pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) via recruitment of immune cells that subsequently activate PSCs. However, whether acinar cells directly contribute to PSC activation is unknown. Here, we report that the Hippo pathway, a well-known regulator of proliferation, is essential for suppression of expression of inflammation and fibrosis-associated genes in adult pancreatic acinar cells. Hippo inactivation in acinar cells induced yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1)/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ binding motif (TAZ)-dependent, irreversible fibrosis and inflammation, which was initiated by Hippo-mediated acinar-stromal communications and ameliorated by blocking YAP1/TAZ target connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). Hippo disruption promotes acinar cells to secrete fibroinflammatory factors and induce stromal activation, which precedes acinar proliferation and metaplasia. We found that Hippo disruption did not induce cell-autonomous proliferation but primed acinar cells to exogenous pro-proliferative stimuli, implying a well-orchestrated scenario in which Hippo signaling acts as an intrinsic link to coordinate fibroinflammatory response and proliferation for maintenance of the tissue integrity. Our findings suggest that the fibroinflammatory program in pancreatic acinar cells is suppressed under normal physiological conditions. While transient activation of inflammatory gene expression during tissue injury may contribute to the control of damage and tissue repair, its persistent activation may result in tissue fibrosis and failure of regeneration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tissue damage and repair is a complicated process involving interactions among epithelial, stromal, and immune cells, enabling well-coordinated inflammatory response to control damage and proliferation of epithelial cells to regenerate tissues. It is well established that the tightly controlled fibroinflammatory program in epithelial cells is transiently activated during organ damage to assist repair of injured tissues. However, the mechanisms by which epithelial cells orchestrate the intrinsic fibroinflammatory response and cell proliferation largely remain unclear. Deregulation of these processes contributes to persistent tissue damage and the development of fibrotic diseases.</p>
<p>As digestive enzyme production factories, when acinar cells are damaged, they may release enzymes that can cause severe detrimental effects in the abdominal cavity. It is plausible to speculate that acinar cells should have an intrinsic mechanism to quickly sense these changes and modulate their microenvironment to contain the damage and promote regeneration. Increasing numbers of studies have begun to investigate the active roles of acinar cells in regulating the inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref003">3</xref>]. Considering the fact that the Hippo pathway is regulated by soluble factors, cell-cell contact, and extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref004">4</xref>], it is tempting to speculate that acinar cells may utilize this pathway to sense these exogenous stimuli and actively translate them into signals to orchestrate the surrounding microenvironment.</p>
<p>The central kinases of the Hippo signaling pathway in mammals, large tumor suppressor 1 and 2 (LATS1/2), play important roles in inhibiting proliferation, promoting apoptosis, and inhibiting F-actin polymerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref005">5</xref>]. LATS1/2 directly phosphorylate downstream effectors yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) or transcriptional coactivator with PDZ binding motif (TAZ) and restrict their activity via both cytoplasmic retention and ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation. Once LATS1/2 are inactivated, unphosphorylated YAP1/TAZ translocate to the nucleus to initiate the transcription of many genes, including pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref006">6</xref>]. The Hippo pathway is frequently inactivated during acute tissue damage as well as in a broad range of fibrotic diseases, which has generally been believed to support tissue repair via promoting cell-autonomous proliferation through YAP1/TAZ. However, recent studies suggest that functions of the Hippo pathway are more diverse than expected. Enforced expression of constitutively activated mutants of YAP1/TAZ in cancer cells frequently induces expression of inflammatory cytokines, raising the possibility that the Hippo pathway might be a key player to link epithelial fibroinflammatory response and proliferation during tissue repair. However, whether the Hippo pathway is a physiological repressor for the intrinsic fibroinflammatory program in epithelia cells remains an unanswered question.</p>
<p>Recent clinical data support the existence of a continuum between recurrent acute pancreatitis (AP) and chronic pancreatitis (CP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref007">7</xref>]. CP is caused by a persistent inflammatory response that eventually leads to fibrosis and pancreatic failure. Currently, there are no specific treatments or prevention strategies for this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref008">8</xref>]. Although premature intra-acinar trypsinogen activation has been considered a major pathogenic factor contributing to AP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref009">9</xref>], the mechanisms driving pancreatic fibrosis—the characteristic feature of CP—during the progression from AP to CP remain unclear[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref010">10</xref>]. The fact that the nuclear expression of YAP1 and TAZ has been found in human pancreatic cancer and pancreatitis samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref012">12</xref>] strongly suggests that the Hippo pathway may play important roles in the pathogenesis of pancreatic disease.</p>
<p>Extensive evidence suggests that stromal cell activation state plays a central role in determining the outcome of tissue repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref013">13</xref>]. Although a number of studies have shown a passive role of damaged acinar cells in activating pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) via recruitment of immune cells, the possibility that acinar cells may actively modulate the microenvironment to support sustained PSC activation has not been well studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref001">1</xref>]. Indeed, several key PSC activators such as transforming growth factor, beta (TGFβ) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) are up-regulated in acinar cells adjacent to the areas of fibrosis in pancreata of CP patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref016">16</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms mediating acinar-cell–PSC communication and to investigate their contribution to the pathogenesis of CP.</p>
<p>In this study, we used the Ptf1a<sup>Cre-ER</sup>/LoxP system in mouse pancreas and found that mice with acinar-specific deletion of Lats1/2 developed strong inflammation and surprisingly rapid and severe fibrosis in a YAP1/TAZ-dependent manner. We demonstrated that Hippo disruption induces expression of inflammation and fibrosis-associated genes in acinar cells, which directly contributes to stromal activation. In contrast to previous studies that focused on YAP1/TAZ-mediated cell proliferation and differentiation, we found that acinar fibroinflammatory activation occurs before YAP1/TAZ-driven cell proliferation. Our results grant new perspective of the physiological functions of the Hippo pathway and add an additional layer of complexity to the current model for the roles of Hippo signaling in tissue regeneration. We further identified a number of up-regulated pro-inflammatory and profibrotic genes in Lats1/2-deficient acinar cells, suggesting that these identified genes might be targets of YAP1/TAZ. Our data suggest that the Hippo pathway, in addition to its well-known function to control cell proliferation, plays an essential role in the inhibition of fibroinflammatory response in epithelial cells.</p>

Through multiple steps of breeding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000418.s001">S1A Fig</xref>), we generated <italic>Lats1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> double knockout mice (PL: <italic>Ptf1a</italic><sup><italic>CreER</italic></sup><italic>Lats1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup><italic>Lats2</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup><italic>Rosa26</italic><sup><italic>LSL-YFP</italic></sup>), <italic>Lats1</italic> and <italic>Lats2</italic> single knockout mice (PL1KO: <italic>Ptf1a</italic><sup><italic>CreER</italic></sup><italic>Lats1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup><italic>Lats2</italic><sup><italic>fl/+</italic></sup><italic>Rosa26</italic><sup><italic>LSL-YFP</italic></sup>; PL2KO: <italic>Ptf1a</italic><sup><italic>CreER</italic></sup><italic>Lats1</italic><sup><italic>fl/+</italic></sup><italic>Lats2</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup><italic>Rosa26</italic><sup><italic>LSL-YFP</italic></sup>), and flox-alleles–alone mice (Lats1/2: <italic>Ptf1a</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup><italic>Lats1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup><italic>Lats2</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup><italic>Rosa26</italic><sup><italic>LSL-YFP</italic></sup>). We used Cre alone (P: <italic>Ptf1a</italic><sup><italic>CreER</italic></sup><italic>Rosa26</italic><sup><italic>LSL-YFP</italic></sup>) mice as controls. We administered 180 mg/kg/d of tamoxifen (TAM) to 6- to 12-week-old mice via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection for 5 consecutive days. We found that PL mice became lethargic and started losing weight by 7 days after the last TAM injection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000418.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). At day 10, PL mice had a weight loss of 19.2%. We found a significant reduction of blood glucose levels in PL mice, suggesting a starvation phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000418.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). We observed a continuous loss of acinar tissue and replacement by fibrous tissue over 14 days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000418.s001">S1D Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Histologically, PL mice exhibited severe damage in the pancreas, including acinar cell atrophy, inflammatory cell infiltration, and acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) at Day 5 after the last injection of TAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). No such defects were observed in the pancreata of control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Successful <italic>Lats1/2</italic> deletions in the pancreas were determined by PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000418.s002">S2A Fig</xref>) and western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The protein levels of downstream effectors YAP1/TAZ were increased dramatically in PL mice, while phospho-YAP1 levels were lower in PL mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). YAP1 and TAZ nuclear translocations were detected in PL mice by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000418.s002">S2B Fig</xref>), suggesting that loss of LATS1/2 in pancreatic acinar cells induced YAP1/TAZ activation, similarly to other tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref017">17</xref>]. Compared to the control P mice, we detected an increased expression of ductal cell marker cytokeratin 19 (CK19) in PL mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Yellow fluorescent protein (YFP<sup>+</sup>)/CK19<sup>+</sup> cells were only observed in PL mice, suggesting that acinar cells underwent ADM, a common hallmark of pancreatitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000418.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). The antigen identified by monoclonal antibody Ki 67 (Ki67) expression was found in YFP<sup>+</sup>/CK19<sup>+</sup> cells, suggesting that proliferation was activated during ADM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000418.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). We found apoptotic cells in PL mice by staining of cleaved caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000418.s003">S3C Fig</xref>). Consistent with hematoxylin–eosin (HE) staining, we identified infiltration of immune cells in PL mice by cluster of differentiation antigen 45 (CD45) staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g001">Fig 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000418.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). We detected strong staining of α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) and significant deposition of collagen in PL pancreata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g001">Fig 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000418.s003">S3A Fig</xref>), suggesting the occurrence of PSC activation and pancreatic fibrosis. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the loss of LATS1/2 in pancreatic acinar cells rapidly leads to pancreatic fibrosis, a major clinical feature of CP.</p>

<title><italic>Hippo</italic> disruption-induced pancreatic inflammation is not initiated by acinar cell death</title>
<p>Inflammation in the pancreas is frequently induced by acinar cell injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref018">18</xref>]. To test whether inflammation in PL mice was induced by autonomous acinar cell death following Lats1/2 deletions, we decided to knock out <italic>Lats1/2</italic> in a small portion of acinar cells in the adult pancreas. If the inflammation was induced by acinar cell death due to Lats1/2 knockout, injured <italic>Lats1/2</italic> null acinar cells would be rapidly removed by immune cells and the pancreas should recover with the remaining wild-type acinar cells. We gave the mice single injections of different doses of TAM. <italic>Ptf1a</italic><sup><italic>CreER</italic></sup> induced chromosome recombination in a TAM dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000418.s005">S5A Fig</xref>). PCR assays confirmed the occurrence of Cre-mediated <italic>Lats1/2</italic> deletions even 4 days after a single dose of 45 mg/kg TAM injection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000418.s005">S5A Fig</xref>). Strikingly, all mice developed inflammation 3 weeks after TAM injection, and the severity of the inflammation was correlated with TAM dose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000418.s005">S5C Fig</xref>). Acinar cells can recover in cerulein-induced AP mice; however, the pancreatic lesions developed in single-dose TAM-injected PL mice did not recover over time. This long-lasting phenotype suggested that acinar damage was not the major mechanism to initiate inflammation in PL mice.</p>
<p>We further chose mice that received a single low-dose (45 mg/kg) TAM injection for time course analysis because they showed Cre-mediated recombination in a fraction of individual acinar cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000418.s005">S5B Fig</xref>), as determined by YFP expression. We co-stained YFP with cleaved-caspase-3 in the pancreata of PL mice at 4, 8, and 12 days after a single TAM injection (45 mg/kg) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) to test whether these cells underwent apoptosis. The results showed no YFP+ cells that were co-stained with cleaved-caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).

<title><italic>Hippo</italic> disruption does not directly induce autonomous proliferation in adult acinar cells</title>
<p>Because one of the best known functions of LATS1/2 is to control cellular proliferation and differentiation, we tested whether <italic>Lats1/2</italic> deletion induced ADM and proliferation of acinar cells. We did not observe YFP-positive cells expressing CK19 in the mice that received a single low-dose (45 mg/kg) TAM injection, indicating that no ADM occurred in <italic>Lats1/2</italic> null acinar cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). We then examined Ki67 expression in these pancreata. No YFP<sup>+</sup> cells expressed Ki67 at every time point. In addition, we quantified the number of YFP<sup>+</sup> cells in these mice and found no significant differences during the 12-day period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). The different effects of low- and high-dose TAM suggested that Hippo disruption incudes ADM by non–cell-autonomous mechanisms. The smaller number of acinar cells with Hippo disruption induced by low-dose TAM require a longer time to create an ADM-prone microenvironment, while high-dose TAM induced Hippo disruption in a larger portion of acinar cells that can rapidly activate PSCs and immune cells to promote ADM.</p>
<p>To further confirm that Hippo disruption does not directly induce autonomous proliferation in adult acinar cells, we isolated acinar cells from PL mice that received 5 injections of TAM and cultured them in a collagen-based 3D model. <italic>Lats1/2</italic> deletions alone did not enhance the proliferation of acinar cells in 3D culture. However, in the presence of exogenous TGFα treatment, the most common method used to induce ADM in mouse acinar cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref019">19</xref>], the sizes of spheres formed by acinar cells with <italic>Lats1/2</italic> deletions were dramatically larger than those formed by the cells from control P mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000418.s005">S5E Fig</xref>), suggesting that acinar cells with <italic>Lats1/2</italic> deletions did not induce autonomous cell proliferation but primed acinar cells to exogenous pro-proliferative stimuli from microenvironment to initiate cell proliferation.</p>

<title><italic>Hippo</italic> disruption in pancreatic acinar cells stimulates PSC activation</title>
<p>To achieve a longer and clearer time window to analyze the temporal sequences of alterations in PL mice, we gave the mice a single TAM injection (180 mg/kg) and analyzed the pancreata at Days 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20. The pancreata of PL mice almost disappeared by Day 20. At Day 15, the phenotype was similar to what we observed at Day 5 for mice with 5 injections of TAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). CK19, αSMA, and CD45 staining by IHC in consecutive sections of PL mice was positive in all lesions at Day 15, indicating the presence of ADM, PSC activation, and immune cell infiltration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000418.s006">S6A Fig</xref>). However, the small dispersed lesions at Day 10 in PL pancreata with YAP1/TAZ nuclear accumulation were surrounded by αSMA-positive stromal cells, implying that PSCs might be activated by the direct communication with <italic>Lats1/2</italic> null acinar cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Indeed, many of these lesions were not accompanied by CD45-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). This was further confirmed by co-staining αSMA with CD45 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000418.s006">S6B Fig</xref>), highlighting the fact that PSCs were activated before significant infiltration of immune cells. These lesions retained acinar morphology and were negative for CK19, suggesting that PSCs were activated in the absence of ADM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). Together, our data indicate that activation of PSCs was an early event in PL mice.</p>

<title><italic>Hippo</italic> disruption activates the fibroinflammatory program in acinar cells</title>
<p>The observation that activation of PSCs was an early event in PL mice provoked us to examine whether Hippo pathway disruption induced the activation of fibrosis and inflammation-associated genes in acinar cells to modulate the microenvironment. Thus, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of pancreata from control P and mutant PL mice. To increase the number of <italic>Lats1/2</italic> null cells, control P mice and PL mice were subjected to180 mg/kg/d of TAM for 5 consecutive days. Tails of pancreata from P mice were harvested at Day 1 and used as the control. Tails of pancreata from PL mice were harvested at Days 1, 2, and 3 (<italic>n</italic> = 3–5 for each time point) for RNA extraction and RNA-seq library preparation. Histological examination showed no visible defects in Day 1, 2, or 3 PL pancreata (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000418.s008">S8A Fig</xref>). There was no positive staining of CD45, αSMA, or CK19 at Day 2, but there was some at Day 3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000418.s008">S8B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We compared transcriptomes from RNA-seq data from PL mice at Days 1, 2, and 3 after TAM injection to control P mice and obtained 40, 405, and 765 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), respectively, using the significance criterion (fold-change &gt; 2; adjusted <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; and read per kilobase of transcript per million reads mapped [RPKM] &gt; 2). A large number of genes with expression changes were found in Day 2 PL pancreata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), although no significant PSC activation or immune cell infiltration was observed at this time point. We performed K-means clustering analysis and identified 2 representative clusters: 300 up-regulated genes and 232 down-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Several known YAP1/TAZ targets, including <italic>Ctgf</italic>, <italic>Cyr61</italic>, and <italic>Spp1</italic>, were among the up-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000418.s008">S8C Fig</xref>). Gene ontology (GO) term analysis with the 300 up-regulated genes showed that 5 out of the top 10 GO terms were related to immune response, which is consistent with the phenotype of PL mice. On the other hand, down-regulated genes were related to endoplasmic reticulum and digestion, which are associated with normal acinar cell function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g006">Fig 6B</xref>).</p>

<p>We specifically analyzed GO terms regarding growth factor activity (GO:0008083), cytokine activity (GO:0005125), and chemokine activity (GO:0008009), and identified a total of 12 up-regulated genes (<italic>Bmp1</italic>, <italic>Ctgf</italic>, <italic>Cxcl12</italic>, <italic>Mia</italic>, <italic>Pdgfα</italic>, <italic>Tgfβ1</italic>, <italic>Tgfβ3</italic>, <italic>Timp1</italic>, <italic>Ccl12</italic>, <italic>Cxcl10</italic>, <italic>Cxcl14</italic>, and <italic>Spp1</italic>). Interestingly, several genes involved in PSC activation (<italic>Tgfβ</italic> and <italic>Pdgf</italic>α) and fibrogenesis (<italic>Spp1</italic>, <italic>Ctgf</italic>, <italic>Cxcl12</italic>, and <italic>Cxcl16</italic>) were significantly up-regulated at Day 2, before immune cell infiltration, suggesting a potential function of acinar cell YAP1/TAZ in direct regulation of PSC activation and pancreatic fibrosis. We validated the expression changes of <italic>Ctgf</italic>, <italic>Spp1</italic>, <italic>Cxcl12</italic>, <italic>Cxcl16</italic>, <italic>Pdgf</italic>α, <italic>TGFβ1</italic>, <italic>TGFβ2</italic>, and <italic>TGFβ3</italic> by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Except for <italic>TGFβ2</italic>, all of these genes showed gradual up-regulation during the time course, strongly supporting that they may be direct targets of YAP1/TAZ.</p>
<p>Among these genes, the up-regulation of secreted phosphoprotein 1 (<italic>Spp1</italic>) was the most dramatic. Even at Day 1 after TAM injection, we detected an about 2-fold increase of <italic>Spp1</italic> compared to the control P mice. <italic>Spp1</italic> has been suggested as a potential target of YAP1/TAZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref022">22</xref>] and is also strongly associated with TGF<italic>β</italic> function and hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref023">23</xref>]. Thus, we performed immunostaining of SPP1 on consecutive sections of Day 10 PL pancreata with one dose of TAM (180 mg/kg). We found that SPP1 staining correlated well with αSMA, YAP1, and TAZ staining in small lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g006">Fig 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000418.s009">S9B Fig</xref>). SPP1 was strongly positive, while no apparent αSMA staining surrounded acinar cells at Day 2 and Day 3 after 5 doses of TAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). Immunofluroescent staining and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR for SPP1 in P, PL, and PLYT mice pancreata after TAM treatment showed that SPP1 up-regulation due to Hippo pathway inactivation was dependent on YAP1/TAZ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000418.s009">S9C and S9D Fig</xref>). These findings suggest that up-regulation of SPP1 by YAP1/TAZ in pancreatic acinar cells may precede PSC activation. To further test whether SPP1 can activate PSCs, we isolated the primary PSCs by density gradient centrifugation to directly test the effect of SPP1 on PSC activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref024">24</xref>]. The purity of the PSCs was confirmed by Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000418.s009">S9A Fig</xref>). The primary PSCs were treated with SSP1 recombinant proteins (50 nM) for 3 days. CTGF is a well-known YAP1/TAZ target that can activate PSCs and is up-regulated in PL mice. We used CTGF recombinant protein as the positive control. SPP1 treatment significantly increased αSMA-positive cell numbers, similarly to what we observed in the CTGF treated group, suggesting that SPP1 can trigger PSC activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). SPP1 treatment did not significantly enhance the proliferation of PSCs as determined by EdU staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g006">Fig 6G</xref>). We noticed that αSMA-positive cells and EdU-positive cells did not always overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g006">Fig 6F</xref>), suggesting that they might be two uncoupled events in PSC activation. Together, these data supported the notion that SPP1 might be an important soluble factor secreted by acinar cells with Lats1/2 deletions to activate PSCs.</p>

<title>Targeting the fibroinflammatory program in acinar cells attenuates <italic>Hippo</italic> disruption-induced pancreatic inflammation and fibrosis</title>
<p>To test whether the activation of the intrinsic fibroinflammatory program in acinar cells contributed to Hippo disruption-induced pancreatic inflammation and fibrosis, we performed a rescue experiment using CTGF-neutralizing antibody FG-3019 (FibroGen, Inc.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref025">25</xref>]. CTGF is the best known YAP1/TAZ target gene and has been documented to play a central role in PSC activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref026">26</xref>] and fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref027">27</xref>]. We found that <italic>Ctgf</italic> mRNA expression was up-regulated at an early time point (Day 2) after <italic>Lats1/2</italic> deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). In addition, CTGF protein level was significantly decreased in PLTY mice compared to PL mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g007">Fig 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000418.s010">S10A Fig</xref>). We injected PL mice with FG-3019 or FG-hulgG (control, human Immunoglobulin G) for 2 days (i.p. 30 mg/kg/d), followed by a single TAM (180 mg/kg) injection. After this, the mice received FG-3019 or FG-hulgG injection every other day and were euthanized at Day 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). The HE staining revealed that CTGF depletion partially attenuated inflammation and fibrosis in PL mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). FG-3019-treated mice achieved 61.7%, 53.5%, and 56.7% reduction of immune cell infiltration, stromal reaction, and ADM, respectively, compared with the FG-hulgG-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g007">Fig 7E</xref>), suggesting that neutralization of CTGF partially rescued the pancreatitis induced by <italic>Lats1/2</italic> deletions in adult acinar cells. To examine whether neutralizing CTGF affected the health of the mice, we treated another group of mice (<italic>n</italic> = 6) for 30 days. Half of the FG-3019-treated mice maintained their body weight, while all FG-hulgG-treated mice lost weight by Day 12 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000418.s010">S10B Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Pancreatitis mouse models exhibit <italic>Hippo</italic> disruption-induced molecular features</title>
<p>To test potential involvement of the Hippo pathway in pancreatitis, we examined the histological alterations and the expression patterns of Hippo pathway core components in time course analysis of caerulein-induced AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). Pancreatic inflammation was observed from Day 1 to 3, and recovery started at Day 4. By Day 6, the pancreas appeared normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). Interestingly, western blot results revealed that the protein levels of Lats1/2 were significantly down-regulated from Day 1. By Day 6, the expression of both LATS1 and LATS2 recovered. In addition, the level of phospho-YAP1 (P-YAP1) showed a similar trend as LATS kinase. Inversely, YAP1/TAZ were increased from Day 1, and when the pancreas recovered, YAP1/TAZ went down back to normal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g008">Fig 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000418.s011">S11A Fig</xref>). YAP nuclei staining was observed at Day 1 in the AP pancreas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000418.s011">S11B Fig</xref>). These data indicated a strong relationship between the Hippo signaling pathway and inflammatory response. CP was induced by repetitive episodes of AP for 4 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g008">Fig 8D</xref>), resulting in pancreatic fibrosis and increased collagen deposition, which was stained by Sirius Red (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g008">Fig 8E</xref>). Western blot data clearly showed significant reduction of LATS1/2 levels and elevated levels of YAP1/TAZ in the CP group compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g008">Fig 8F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000418.s011">S11C Fig</xref>), suggesting that Hippo signaling is also involved in pancreatic fibrosis. SPP1 is expressed in pancreatic ductal tissues and undifferentiated pancreatic precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref028">28</xref>], as well as in pancreatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref029">29</xref>]. However, its role in pancreatitis is unknown. We found SPP1-positive staining in ductal cells in control pancreata, but also in acinar cells in caerulein-induced AP and CP, with much stronger staining in CP pancreata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000418.g008">Fig 8G</xref>). Taken together, we found that the Hippo signaling pathway is dynamically regulated during caerulein-induced pancreatitis, indicating a potential function of Hippo signaling in modulating pancreatic inflammation and fibrosis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The fibroinflammatory program and cellular proliferation in epithelial cells is critical for tissue repair. However, the key molecules linking these processes largely remain unclear. Cobo and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref030">30</xref>] recently reported that nuclear receptor subfamily 5, group A, member 2 (NR5A2), a key transcriptional factor regulating acinar identity, controls an inflammatory program in acinar cells, establishing connection between the transcriptional networks of cellular differentiation and suppression of inflammatory programs. Our study revealed another important player that links epithelial fibroinflammatory signaling with cellular proliferation pathways for rapid response to tissue damage and subsequent tissue regeneration. We observed that acinar cells with disrupted Hippo signaling are surrounded by activated PSCs at early time points after acinar-specific Lats1/2 deletion. These data emphasize the critical role of the Hippo pathway in mediating epithelial–stromal interactions to modulate the microenvironment. Hippo disruption did not affect the expression of <italic>Nr5a2</italic> in acinar cells, suggesting the existence of multiple mechanisms in acinar cells to inhibit the intrinsic fibroinflammatory program under physiological conditions. Importantly, our data showed that Hippo disruption primed acinar cells to exogenous pro-proliferative stimuli without directly inducing cell-autonomous proliferation, highlighting a well-orchestrated scenario in which a Hippo disruption-induced fibroinflammation program signals surrounding stromal cells to support proliferation of epithelial cells.</p>
<p>Unlike other exocrine tissues, pancreatic acinar cells produce large amounts of digestive enzymes to aid digestion. Although these enzymes are packaged as zymogens which normally become active enzymes in the gut, damage to the pancreas can allow them to become active within the pancreas and have detrimental effects on the pancreas itself as well as other internal organs. A sensitive and well-coordinated system is required to contain the damage and promote regeneration in the pancreas. Our study showed that disruption of the Hippo pathway in acinar cells can quickly activate PSCs and recruit immune cells to the pancreas, suggesting that this pathway acts as a core regulator of the fibroinflammatory program in epithelial cells to restrict the spread of active enzymes by ECM deposition from PSCs and to control damage by recruiting immune cells.</p>
<p>RNA-seq data showed that deletion of <italic>Lat1&amp;2</italic> induced early up-regulation of fibroinflammatory-reaction–associated genes, further supporting that Hippo signaling is a key repressor for the intrinsic fibroinflammatory program in acinar cells under physiological conditions. Consistent with previous studies that showed that SPP1 is a potential YAP1/TAZ target, we found that it is up-regulated in acinar cells soon after <italic>Lats1/2</italic> deletion. SPP1 is a known mediator of inflammation and fibrogenesis in different organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref032">32</xref>]. SPP1 treatment enhanced the activation of isolated primary PSCs. Moreover, in PL mice, SPP1 up-regulation co-localizes with YAP- and TAZ-activated acinar cells and strongly correlates with the activation of PSCs. These findings revealed a potential mechanism by which the Hippo pathway mediates epithelial–stromal communications via regulating the fibroinflammatory program in epithelial cells.</p>
<p>A recent study discovered that <italic>Lats1/2</italic> knockout cancer cells secreted DNA containing exosomes to promote T help cell type 1 response and created an antitumor inflammatory environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref033">33</xref>]. However, we found rapid accumulation of T help cell type 2 response-associated M2 macrophages in our mouse model, suggesting a different mechanism. Acinar cells have been thought to have a passive role in promoting inflammation via release of damage-associated molecular patterns when damaged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref034">34</xref>]. In this sense, it is unexpected that deletion of <italic>Lats1/2</italic> in adult acinar cells would induce sterile inflammation because it is not intuitive to connect tissue damage to the knockout of <italic>Lats1/2</italic> based on their well-known functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref035">35</xref>]. Indeed, time course analysis revealed that PSC activation and immune cell infiltration happened well before acinar cell death after <italic>Lats1/2</italic> deletion. In addition, unlike the rapid tissue recovery from AP caused by acinar cell damage, deleting Lats1/2 in a small fraction of adult acinar cells by low-dose TAM administration induced persistent pancreatic inflammation, suggesting that these cells were not rapidly removed by immune cells. These data strongly suggest that pancreatic inflammation and fibrosis after acinar-specific <italic>Lats1/2</italic> deletion are not initiated by acinar cell damage. Nevertheless, whether the acinar cells with <italic>Lats1/2</italic> deletions are more susceptible to apoptosis under an inflammatory microenvironment should be further examined, because this might help to explain the severe phenotype in our PL model.</p>
<p>The observation that PSC activation occurs before immune cell infiltration suggests that disrupted Hippo signaling in acinar cells may directly contribute to PSC activation during tissue damage. While this process might contribute to epithelial regeneration for repair of injured tissues, its deregulation might lead to persistent PSC activation, resulting in excessive deposition of ECM in the gland. Indeed, our mouse model with deletion of Hippo core kinases LATS1/2 in adult pancreatic acinar cells induces prolonged activation of an epithelial fibroinflammatory program. These mice developed severe, YAP1/TAZ-dependent pancreatic fibrosis and inflammation at a strikingly fast speed that has not been seen in other mouse models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref038">38</xref>]. A well-known YAP1/TAZ target, CTGF, was significantly up-regulated in PL mice. Depletion of CTGF with neutralizing antibody ameliorated the pancreatic fibrosis in PL mice. Corroborating with the clinical observation that CTGF expression is induced in acinar cells in human CP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref015">15</xref>], these data suggest that targeting genes induced by Hippo disruption might be a promising strategy for CP treatment. Of note, the concept that YAP1/TAZ-mediated epithelia–stromal interaction plays an important role in tissue fibrosis may be applied to other tissues. TAZ induces the expression of Indian hedgehog (Ihh) to activate HSCs and promote nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-associated fibrosis and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref039">39</xref>]. Nevertheless, Ihh does not activate the proliferation or ECM synthesis of PSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref040">40</xref>], and Hippo disruption did not induce Ihh expression in adult acinar cells.</p>
<p>The ability of <italic>Lats1/2</italic> null acinar cells to directly activate PSCs provides an explanation for the rapid progression of pancreatic fibrosis in our model. Acute pancreatic damage induces the infiltration of M1 macrophages and transient activation of PSCs, while CP has prolonged activation of PSCs. A recent study showed that activated PSCs polarize infiltrated M1 macrophages towards M2, which, in turn, can more efficiently activate the PSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref020">20</xref>]. This “feed-forward” process between PSCs and macrophages promotes CP-associated fibrosis. In PL pancreata, the persistent PSC activation supported by <italic>Lats1/2</italic> null acinar cells accelerates macrophage M2 polarization and rapidly creates a microenvironment in favor of fibrosis development. Our mouse model mimics the persistent Hippo pathway inactivation in CP. Thus, acinar cell-mediated PSC activation might be one underlying mechanism contributing to the sustained fibrosis and inflammation in CP even after the clearance of damaged tissue. A schematic showing our working model of these phenomena is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000418.s011">S11D Fig</xref>.</p>
<p>Although our data support that PSCs could be directly activated by secreted factors from <italic>Lats1/2</italic>-null acinar cells, many of these PSC activators are also immune regulators. Thus, our data do not exclude the possibility that the secreted factors released by <italic>Lats1/2</italic>-null acinar cells may have direct effects on immune cells. Indeed, both activated PSCs and infiltrated immune cells are found in most early lesions in <italic>Lats1/2</italic> knockout mice, strongly supporting that the interactions between acinar cells and immune cells may contribute to the unique phenotype observed in our model. However, understanding the detailed mechanisms of this complex acinar–immune–PSC interaction is beyond the scope of this study and may require the development of new mouse models with appropriate immune backgrounds. In addition, we observed ADM after PSC activation and immune cell infiltration. Considering the well-documented roles of inflammatory cytokines in the induction of ADM, it is unclear whether the ADM in <italic>Lats1/2</italic>-null pancreata is directly induced by activated YAP1/TAZ or by infiltrated immune cells. Additional mouse models are needed to answer this question.</p>
<p>In summary, we used adult pancreatic acinar cells as a model to investigate the physiological roles of the Hippo pathway in epithelial cells. Elegant genetic examinations enabled us to reveal a temporal pattern for epithelial Hippo disruption-induced cellular and molecular changes, which has largely been overlooked in previous studies focusing on endpoint effects of YAP1/TAZ activation. Disruption of Hippo signaling not only primes epithelial cells to exogenous pro-proliferative stimuli but also plays a critical role in activating epithelial fibroinflammatory response to signal surrounding stromal cells. These data highlight that the epithelial Hippo pathway acts as an intrinsic link between inflammatory response and proliferation during tissue repair. Experimental pancreatitis models display the molecular features associated with epithelial Hippo disruption, giving us a new perspective to understand the pathological mechanisms of these diseases and to develop effective therapies.</p>

<p>Primary and secondary antibodies used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000418.s013">S2 Table</xref>. For IHC staining, tissues were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and immersed and heated in a citrate-based antigen unmasking solution (Vector, Burlingame, CA, H300) for 30 minutes. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 3% hydrogen peroxide in ddH<sub>2</sub>O. Sections were blocked with 5% donkey serum in 0.1% TBST (Tween20, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, P1379-500 ml) for 1 hour at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibody at 4°C overnight. Biotin-labeled secondary antibodies (1:250, BD Pharmingen) and Streptavidin-Horseradish peroxidase (SAv-HRP, BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA; 550946) were applied to amplify the target antigen signal, and then sections were developed with DAB substrate (Dako, Santa Clara, CA; K3468), followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin (Biocare Medical, Pacheco, CA). Finally, sections were covered with poly-Mount medium (Polysciences, Warrington, PA; Category number 08381). For immunofluorescence staining, frozen sections were blocked with 10% donkey serum plus 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBST (0.025% Triton X-100, Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA, CAS9002-93-1) for 1 hour at room temperature. Sections were incubated with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight followed by incubation with the Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies (1:250, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 1 hour at room temperature. Sections were covered with a drop of ProLong Gold anti-fade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, P36935) for observation.

<title>Western blot analysis</title>
<p>Proteins were isolated from the tail of the pancreas. Briefly, pancreata were homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer containing phosphatase and protease Inhibitors (GenDEPOT, Katy, TX; P3100-001 and P3200-001) on ice. After 10-cycle of sonication (Bioruptor Pico Sonication System, Diagenode, Denville, NJ, Category Number B01060001), proteins were extracted, and the concentration was determined by a BCA kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL; 23228). Equal amounts of 50 μg protein were resolved in SDS-PAGE, then transferred to PVDF membrane (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, Product number 88520) and blocked with 5% milk in PBST (0.1% Tween 20, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, P1379-500ml) for 1 hour at room temperature. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight and then exposed to secondary antibodies for 1 hour. Finally, protein expression was determined by treating the membrane with Clarity Western ECL substrate (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, Category number 1705060) and measuring luminescence with an Amersham Imager 600 system (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI).

<p>Total RNA was extracted from the tail of the pancreas using a lysis binding buffer (Ambion, Austin, TX; Category AM1560) and Direct-zol RNA miniprep kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, R2052). The RNA concentration was measured using Nanodrop2000 (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The amount of 400 ng of RNA was subjected to RT by using a high-capacity cDNA RT kit (Applied Biosystems; 4368814), following the manufacturer’s protocol. The cDNA samples were amplified with iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA; 172–5271) in a CFX96 Real-Time system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). GAPDH was used as endogenous control for normalization, and the relative expression of mRNA was calculated based on the <sup>ΔΔ</sup>Ct method.

<title>Flow cytometry analysis</title>
<p>Single-cell solutions from P and PL mice were prepared according to previous reports. Briefly, 6-week–aged mice P and PL were treated with 180 mg/kg of TAM for 5 consecutive days. Four days later, mice were anesthetized and then perfused with cold PBS. Pancreas was digested by collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO; C9891-1G); then, cells eventually filtrated through a 5 ml polystyrene round-bottom tube with cell-strainer cap (Corning, Corning, NY; number 352235). All antibodies used for flow cytometry were purchased from Biolegend (San Diego, CA): APC-CD45 (103111; 1:100), Percp/Cy5.5-CD11b (101228; 1:100), and BV421-F4/80 (123137; 1:100). Cells were incubated with the antibodies in FACS buffer at 4°C for 15 minutes. After incubation, cells were washed once and resuspended into FACS buffer.

<title>Isolation and culture of mouse PSCs</title>
<p>Primary mouse PSCs were isolated using a previously reported gradient centrifugation method with a few modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref024">24</xref>]. Briefly, pancreata were dissected from wild-type mice at the ages of 4 to 6 weeks. After all adipose tissues were carefully trimmed off, pancreata were cut into small pieces in cold HBSS buffer. Tissues from 2 mice were transferred into a 50 ml tube containing 10 ml HBSS buffer (0.05% pronase, 0.035% collagenase P, 0.1% DNAse, 10 mM HEPES, and 0.01 Trypsin inhibitor, Sigma-Aldrich). Tissues were incubated in a 37°C water bath for 10 minutes and then dissociated by pipetting up and down with a 10 ml tip 10 times. The tissues were incubated in a 37°C water bath for an additional 5 to 10 minutes and dispersed by pipetting gently up and down with a 10 ml pipette 10 times. The cell suspension was filtered through a 70 μm cell strainer. Cells were washed twice and suspended in 2 ml HBSS buffer containing 0.3% BSA. The amount of 4 ml 60% Optiprep was added to the cell suspension and mixed well in a 15 ml tube; 2 ml HBSS buffer was carefully added to the top of the Optiprep gradient. PSCs were separated by centrifugation at 1400<italic>g</italic> for 20 minutes. PSCs were suspended in DMEM:F-12 medium containing 10% FBS, 15 mM HEPES, 4 Mm glutamine, and antibiotics (penicillin 100 U/ml and streptomycin 100 μg/ml). Cells were seeded on a 10-well microscope slide (6,000 cells/well) and treated with CTGF and SPP1 for 3 days.</p>

<title>Acini preparation and treatment</title>
<p>Immediately after euthanasia, pancreata were dissected out, rinsed in cold 1X Hank’s balanced salt solution, and cut into small pieces. The small tissue pieces were digested with collagenase P (200 μg/ml in 1X HBSS) for 20 minutes at 37 °C. Released cells were washed 3 times in cold 1X HBSS with 5% fetal bovine serum. Large clumps of connective tissues were removed by filtering with 100-μm nylon meshes. Cell suspensions were carefully layered on top of 30% fetal bovine serum for centrifuge (300<italic>g</italic>, 2 minutes at 4 °C) and then were resuspended in 3D culture media (RPMI, 0.5% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor and antibiotics). Forty-eight-well tissue culture plates were coated with a 150 μl/well collagen layer (1 part 10X RPMI, 9 parts 3 mg/ml collagen, neutralized with 4.2% NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) and incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C. The acini suspension was mixed with collagen 1:1 and plated (0.3 ml/well). The cell–collagen mix was allowed to solidify for 1 hour at 37 °C before adding 0.5 ml 3D culture media with TGFα.</p>

<title>RNA-seq and data analysis</title>
<p>Total RNA was isolated using RNA lysis binding buffer (Ambion, Austin, TX; Category number AM1560) at Days 1, 2, and 3, as well as control condition. RNA quality was assessed by Bioanalyzer, and poly A(+) RNA was isolated by oligo-dT purification and fragmented using divalent cations under elevated temperature. cDNA fragment libraries were synthesized following the TruSeq mRNA-seq Library Preparation protocol (Illumina). For a total of 16 samples, we obtained about 31.4 million sequence reads per sample, using Illumina HiSeq system at the Greehey Children’s Cancer Research Institute Genome Sequencing Facility, utilizing a 50 bp single-read sequencing protocol.</p>
<p>Short sequence reads were then aligned with TopHat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref042">42</xref>] to mouse genome (UCSC mm<sup>9</sup> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway?db=mm9" xlink:type="simple">https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway?db=mm9</ext-link>), allowing no more than 2 mismatches in the alignment. Expression abundance of each gene was evaluated with read count and RPKM. Differential gene expression was calculated using DESeq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000418.ref043">43</xref>] to obtain fold-change, <italic>P</italic> value, and adjusted <italic>P</italic> value by Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple tests. DEGs were selected based on the following criteria: (1) fold-change &gt; 2, (2) adjusted <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, and (3) RPKM &gt; 1. Using the significance criterion and for comparison between Days 1, 2, and 3 to control, we obtained 40, 405, and 765 DEGs, respectively. To access the overall expression change across time, a heatmap was created using all DEGs from 3 comparisons. We also performed K-means algorithm (MATLAB, Mathworks) with all DEGs into 9 clusters and then merged up-regulated and down-regulated genes into 2 representative clusters (300 and 232 genes, respectively). Biological functional assessment of these DEGs was performed by using Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/" xlink:type="simple">http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/</ext-link>), with the top 10 most enriched biological processes (BPs) provided in the figure.</p>

<title>Hippo pathway is dynamically regulated in pancreatitis models.</title>
<p>(A) Quantification of western blot of LATS1, LATS2, P-YAP1, YAP1, and TAZ in untreated and AP mice. Untreated mice served as the control group. Tubulin was used as the internal control (<italic>n =</italic> 3); (B) immunochemistry staining to detect YAP1 expression on Day 1 after AP induction (<italic>n =</italic> 4); (C) quantification of western blot of LATS1, LATS2, YAP1, and TAZ in untreated and CP mice. Untreated mice served as the control group. Tubulin was used as the internal control (<italic>n =</italic> 3). **<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01. Underlying numerical values can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000418.s015">S1 Data</xref>. (D) Schematic of the working model of the effect of the Hippo pathway in pancreatic acinar cells. Hippo pathway inactivation-induced YAP1/TAZ nuclear translocation activates the fibroinflammatory transcriptional program in adult acinar cells, leading to up-regulation of secretary factors such as CTGF and SPP1 in acinar cells. These factors activate surrounding PSCs and immune cells, which might provide feedback signals to promote acinar proliferation and ADM. Permanent Hippo pathway inactivation in acinar cells triggers persistent PSC activation, contributing to the development of pancreatic fibrosis.</p>
