        <p>Neurons adjust their intrinsic excitability when experiencing a persistent change in synaptic drive. This process can prevent neural activity from moving into either a quiescent state or a saturated state in the face of ongoing plasticity, and is thought to promote stability of the network in which neurons reside. However, most neurons are embedded in recurrent networks, which require a delicate balance between excitation and inhibition to maintain network stability. This balance could be disrupted when neurons independently adjust their intrinsic excitability. Here, we study the functioning of activity-dependent homeostatic scaling of intrinsic excitability (HSE) in a recurrent neural network. Using both simulations of a recurrent network consisting of excitatory and inhibitory neurons that implement HSE, and a mean-field description of adapting excitatory and inhibitory populations, we show that the stability of such adapting networks critically depends on the relationship between the adaptation time scales of both neuron populations. In a stable adapting network, HSE can keep all neurons functioning within their dynamic range, while the network is undergoing several (patho)physiologically relevant types of plasticity, such as persistent changes in external drive, changes in connection strengths, or the loss of inhibitory cells from the network. However, HSE cannot prevent the unstable network dynamics that result when, due to such plasticity, recurrent excitation in the network becomes too strong compared to feedback inhibition. This suggests that keeping a neural network in a stable and functional state requires the coordination of distinct homeostatic mechanisms that operate not only by adjusting neural excitability, but also by controlling network connectivity.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The central nervous system is continuously adapting to a wide variety of input signals. Single neurons receive from one to thousands of input signals and need mechanisms to prevent their output activity from locking up in quiescence or saturation. One experimentally observed mechanism is homeostatic scaling of neuronal excitability (HSE), which adapts neuronal responsiveness at the time scale of minutes. Most neurons function in networks of excitatory and inhibitory cells. Maintaining stability of activity in such networks is highly relevant, because deviations can result in pathologies like epilepsy. Can HSE control output activity of single neurons without interfering with network stability? To address this question we implement HSE in a neuronal network model. We show that stable functioning of HSE requires that the adaptation rate of the inhibitory cells is slower than that of the excitatory cells. We subsequently investigate various changes in network organization that demand adaptation by HSE, showing that HSE can successfully control activity levels as long as feedback excitation is not stronger than feedback inhibition. This suggests that maintaining stable, functional networks requires the coordination of distinct homeostatic mechanisms, acting not only through adjustments of single cell responsiveness, but also by controlling network connectivity.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Neuronal and synaptic properties exhibit ongoing plasticity during both early development and adult life: neurons show continuous turn-over of ion channels, synapses are formed and eliminated, and existing synaptic connections are altered by processes such as long-term potentiation and depression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Chklovskii1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Sjstrm1">[2]</xref>. At the same time, the firing rate output of a neuron has a limited dynamic working range. Typically neurons are in a quiescent state when input levels are low, whereas the output of the neuron saturates when input levels are high. A neuron can only transmit changes in its input when it functions within its dynamic range, hence, it should avoid both the quiescent and the saturated regime. A neuron can achieve this by employing feedback mechanisms that sense the neuron's activity level and dynamically match its intrinsic excitability to the overall level of synaptic input. Indeed, experiments have demonstrated that neurons regulate membrane properties in response to altered input levels, thereby changing their intrinsic excitability on a time scale of many hours to days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Desai1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Bartley1">[9]</xref>. Recent experiments showed that such homeostatic scaling of intrinsic excitability (HSE) can also occur over tens of minutes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-vanWelie1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Fan1">[11]</xref>, suggesting a prominent role in neural functioning on different time scales.</p>
      <p>It is often hypothesized that HSE not only serves to keep neurons within their dynamic range, but that it also promotes stability of the local network in which the neuron resides. However, adaptation of intrinsic excitability at the single neuron level could also adversely affect the dynamics at the network level. This is particularly relevant in highly recurrent networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, which are ubiquitous throughout the central nervous system. Experimental and theoretical work has illustrated that such networks show a delicate balance between excitation and inhibition for maintaining network stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Wilson1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Brunel1">[14]</xref>. Disturbance of this balance can lead either to quiescence, or to a state in which neurons fire at maximal rates or show synchronized discharges. Hence, also the dynamics at the network level determine whether a neuron can operate within its dynamic range, and importantly, HSE at the single neuron level could interfere with stability of the network.</p>
      <p>Here we investigate the requirements for stability of a recurrent network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons showing HSE. We then examine the capacity of HSE to compensate for various plasticity processes in the neural network, and keep the entire network in a stable, functional state, such that all cells operate within their dynamic range. Inspired by the experimental results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-vanWelie1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Fan1">[11]</xref> we implement HSE as activity-dependent shifts of the neural response function. The shifting of the response functions occurs in such a way that the time-averaged output of a cell remains within its dynamic range. We simulate recurrent networks of excitatory and inhibitory leaky integrate-and-fire neurons that implement HSE. The adapting recurrent network is analyzed using a mean-field approach, describing the activity levels of interacting excitatory and inhibitory neurons at the population level. The mean-field analysis shows the requirements for stable functioning of a HSE controlled recurrent network, thereby also indicating the types of plasticity for which HSE can compensate. Finally, we test the predictions of the mean-field analysis with the spiking network model and illustrate the functioning of HSE for different (patho)physiologically relevant forms of plasticity.</p>

        <title>Stability requirements for a recurrent network with HSE</title>
        <p>We constructed a neural network model consisting of populations of recurrently connected excitatory (e-cells) and inhibitory neurons (i-cells), both receiving excitatory input from external sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g001">figure 1A</xref>). The neurons are leaky integrate-and-fire cells to which we added a mechanism that implements HSE. This mechanism uses a slow (calcium-like) variable that signals the recent output activity of the cell. In turn, this slow variable up- or downregulates a membrane conductance <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> at a time scale controlled by <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for e-cell and i-cells, respectively. The adaptation time scale is considered to be on the order of tens of minutes. Up- or downregulation of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> results in, respectively, right- or leftward shifts of the neural response function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g001">figure 1B</xref>). The slow variable regulates <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in such a way that the time-averaged output level of the cell remains close to a target value, which we set to 2 Hz for e-cells and to 8 Hz for i-cells (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).</p>

An increase of the membrane conductance <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> leads to a rightward shift of the response function (dashed line), making the cell less excitable. Decreasing <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> results in a leftward shift of the response function (dotted line), increasing the cell's excitability.

        <p>Stability of a network with HSE depends crucially on the relationship between the adaptation time scales of the e-cells and the i-cells. We illustrate the dynamics of a network with HSE in response to a persistent increase in the external drive to both the e-cells and the i-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g001">figure 1C–D</xref>). The network is initialized in an adapted state where each cell has a time-averaged firing rate that is close to its target value. We define <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as the ratio of the adaptation time scale of the i-cells to the e-cells (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). First, we consider a network where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, hence the i-cells adapt 2.5 times more slowly than the e-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g001">figure 1C</xref>). After two minutes of simulated time, the mean external drive to the network is increased by 50%. This causes an instantaneous increase in the firing rates of cells in both populations. To maintain their time-averaged activity levels, both cell types decrease their excitability by slowly increasing <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> over the course of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g001">figure 1C</xref>, bottom panel). As a result, the time-averaged activity levels of the cells gradually approach their target levels.</p>
        <p>We next set the adaptation time scale ratio <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to 1, i.e., both cell types adapt on the same time scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g001">figure 1D</xref>). Following the step increase in the external drive to the network, the network activity again increases instantaneously, and, as a consequence, all cells decrease their excitability (by increasing <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) to keep their time-averaged activity levels close to the target levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g001">figure 1D</xref>, bottom panel). However, this now leads to unstable network dynamics with both population rates increasing even further. The activity levels keep increasing, until the network abruptly falls silent, after which the network activity slowly builds up again.</p>
        <p>The ability of the network to adapt in a stable manner to changes in external drive increases with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. For a range of values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we determined the maximum step in external drive to which the network could adapt without showing the unstable dynamics depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g001">figure 1D</xref>. In fact, the network shows a gradual transition between stable and unstable responses when <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is varied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g002">figure 2A</xref>). Hence, we needed to define a criterium for what we consider a stable network response. Upon a step in external drive, the network activity shows an instantaneous increase, which, during a stable response, subsequently decays back to its target level. We define the response as unstable, when, after the initial instantaneous increase, the activity level grows by more than <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g002">figure 2A</xref>, dotted line). For each value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we determined how large the increase in external drive could be without the activity level exceeding this limit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g002">figure 2B</xref>, filled circles). The larger <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (i.e., the slower i-cells adapt), the larger the increases in external drive that the network can stably adapt to. When i-cells adapt 2 times more slowly than e-cells (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), the external drive to the network can increase by <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>% without the network losing stability. The network is intrinsically unstable when <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is smaller than a critical value (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>); with such small <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the noise in the network activity is sufficient to produce unstable dynamics as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g001">figure 1D</xref>.</p>

Mean firing rate of the e-cell population is determined in bins of 2 seconds. The response of the adapting network is considered unstable (gray area) when the population rate grows more than 50% compared to the instantaneous increase following the input step.

        <p>We found the same relationship between <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and network stability when varying other key parameters in the network model. Slowing down the adaptation rates for all cells by a factor five, resulted in the same relationship between <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the maximum input increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g002">figure 2B</xref>, squares), confirming that it is indeed the ratio of the adaptation time scales that is important for the stability of the HSE controlled network. Next we tested whether the relationship is affected by the size of the network model by increasing the number of neurons in the network from 1000 to 5000. Also under these conditions we found the same relationship between <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the maximum input step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g002">figure 2B</xref>, triangles). In the above simulations, all cells within a population used the same target activity level. In a final series of simulations we tested the effect of introducing a distribution of target rates within the excitatory and the inhibitory population, using a standard deviation of 0.75 and 3 Hz around the mean target rates of 2 and 8 Hz for e-cells and i-cells, respectively. Again, we observed the same relationship between <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the maximum increase in external drive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g002">figure 2B</xref>, open circles).</p>
        <p>Experimental work has demonstrated that i-cells in, e.g., neocortical and hippocampal recurrent networks are very diverse with respect to their intrinsic properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Markram1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Somogyi1">[16]</xref>. It is therefore relevant to examine how the stability requirements for a recurrent network with HSE are affected when the network includes multiple populations of different types of i-cells. A detailed examination of such a complex network is beyond the scope of this study. We restrict ourselves to the scenario where the i-cell population consists of two subpopulations that adapt on different time scales. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g003">Figure 3A</xref> shows the response of the e-cells and the two types of i-cells to a 100% step increase in the external drive to all cells. In this simulation, 50% of the i-cells adapt on a time scale that is two times faster than the e-cells (i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), whereas the other 50% of the i-cells do not adapt on the depicted time scale of 25 minutes. In contrast to the results presented above (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g002">figure 2</xref>), the network remains stable with such small <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> when adapting to such a large perturbation. The time-averaged activity levels of the e-cells (black curves) and adapting i-cells (red curves) reach their target levels through adjustments of their excitability, while the activity level of the non-adapting i-cells (magenta curves) remains elevated.</p>

The network is perturbed from its adapted state (to a 1.2 kHz external drive) by a 0.3 kHz step increase of the external drive to all cells. The same criterium for stability of the adaptation dynamics is used as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g002">figure 2</xref>.</p>

        <p>We next varied the relative size of the two i-cell subpopulations and determined the value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that is required for stable adaptation to a 25% increase of the external drive to all cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g003">figure 3B</xref>). The results show that the smaller the population of adapting i-cells is, the faster they can adapt without destabilizing the adaptation dynamics. No unstable network responses occur when fewer than 30% of i-cells adapt. Hence, a subpopulation of i-cells can adapt much faster than the e-cells, as long as another sufficiently large subpopulation of non-adapting (or, slowly adapting) i-cells guarantees stability of the HSE controlled network.</p>
        <p>In summary, stable functioning of a recurrent network with HSE depends crucially on how fast inhibitory cells adapt compared to excitatory cells. The slower inhibitory cells adapt, the more robust the network is to persistent changes in external drive levels.</p>

        <title>Mean-field analysis of a recurrent network with HSE</title>
        <p>To determine the precise requirements for stability of a recurrent network with HSE and the types of plasticity it can cope with, we next analyze the network using a mean-field description. Details of the analysis can be found in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>. What follows is a summary of the approach and the main results. We consider a recurrent network consisting of one excitatory and one inhibitory population, both receiving input from external sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g004">figure 4A</xref>). Activity of the excitatory population, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and the inhibitory population, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, is determined by the excitatory external inputs (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, respectively) and by the recurrent interactions in the network through the positive weights <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

To make analysis of the network simpler, we describe the response function of each population by a threshold-linear function <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> if <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> if <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, with gains <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the excitatory and inhibitory population, respectively. To implement the HSE mechanism, we introduce the variables <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e059" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The mechanism operates via activity-dependent shifts of the response functions, analogous to the single cell HSE mechanism in the spiking network model. The HSE mechanism shifts the response functions in such a way that the time-averaged activity levels remain close to the target state (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), so that both populations function within their dynamic range.

        <p>Our aim is to find the conditions for which the target state <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is stable, meaning that perturbations from this state decay to zero. Since the adaptive process described by equation (2) is much slower than the population dynamics that are governed by equation (1), we can consider that equation (1) is always in steady state at the time scale of adaptation. The behavior of equation (1) has been studied many times in the past (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Wilson1">[12]</xref>). Its stability is determined by a pair of conditions that guarantee that inhibition in the network is strong enough to prevent runaway excitation. These conditions do not depend on <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e089" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e090" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e091" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e092" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This implies that the activity-dependent shifts of the response function cannot stabilize or destabilize the population dynamics described by equation (1). Assuming that these stability conditions are satisfied, we can now obtain the condition for network stability at the time scale of adaptation:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e093" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>This condition states that the adapting network remains stable when recurrent excitatory coupling is weak (i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e094" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), since <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e095" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is always positive. However, in a network with strong recurrent excitation (i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e096" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), the ratio <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e097" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is central to the stability of the adapting network, showing that the inhibitory population needs to adapt sufficiently slow compared to the excitatory population. This corresponds to our findings in the spiking network model, since the ratio <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e098" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> relates directly to the parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e099" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Note that the mean-field model shows an abrupt transition between a stable and an unstable network response when <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e100" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> crosses a critical value. This contrasts with the spiking network model, which – due to the nonuniform connectivity – showed a gradual transition when varying <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e101" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g002">figure 2B</xref>). Since we consider that the network parameters satisfy the stability conditions for equation (1) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>), we can simplify equation (3) and find that the condition<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e102" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula>guarantees stability of the adapting network. Hence, when considering that the time constants (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e103" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e104" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) as well as the population gains (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e105" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) are of similar magnitude, we can state that the adapting network remains stable as long as the inhibitory population adapts more slowly than the excitatory population.</p>

The network activity has been perturbed from the target state (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) (filled circle) such that <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are larger than <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, respectively. It is easiest to see how relatively fast adaptation of the inhibitory population destabilizes the network by considering that <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Because <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-nullcline shifts rightwards (open arrow), corresponding to a decrease of the excitability of the inhibitory population. However, as a consequence the network state <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> moves along the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e123" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-nullcline, away from the target state. The increase of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> leads to further rightward shifts of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-nullcline and consequently to further increases of the network activity. Hence, the network is destabilized when adaptation of the inhibitory population is fast compared to that of the excitatory population. In contrast, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g004">figure 4C</xref> demonstrates that the network remains stable when the excitatory population adapts faster than the inhibitory population (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Now the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-nullcline shifts downwards to decrease the excitability of the excitatory population (open arrow), and as a result, the network state moves toward the target state (filled arrow).</p>
        <p>Summarizing, the mean-field analysis of adapting recurrent networks shows that HSE can keep the time-averaged activity levels of the neural populations within their dynamic range. HSE achieves this for any type of network plasticity that does not destabilize the fast population dynamics. Stability of the adaptation dynamics itself depends critically on the relationship between the adaptation time scales of the two neuron populations combined with the gains of their respective response functions.</p>

        <title>HSE keeps cells within their dynamic range for various forms of plasticity</title>
        <p>The previous sections were focussed on the requirements for HSE to function stably in a recurrent network. Considering that the purpose of HSE is to keep the time-averaged activity of cells within their dynamic range in the face of ongoing plasticity, we next examine the response of the spiking network model to various (patho)physiologically relevant types of plasticity. We first determine the response of both a non-adapting network and a network with HSE to varying levels of external drive. Subsequently we focus on three changes in network parameters that affect the excitation-inhibition balance. The balance between the recurrent excitatory and inhibitory input is crucial to network stability as many theoretical studies have demonstrated in the past <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Brunel1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-vanVreeswijk1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Meffin1">[20]</xref>.

          <title>Adapting to persistent changes in external drive</title>
          <p>First, we consider the steady state response of a recurrent network to a persistent change in the external drive. Note that the level of external input is expressed in the compound external drive to each cell (in kHz). Different levels of this external drive can represent both changes in the frequency of the external input as well as changes in the number of external inputs that project to the cells.</p>
          <p>The non-adapting network shows an approximately linear relationship between the output of both the e-cells and i-cells and the external drive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g005">figure 5A</xref>). The firing rates show a wide distribution (median and 5%–95% percentiles), because the number of recurrent inputs that the cells receive is variable (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> mean and standard deviation). The large variability in firing rates reflects that the neural output is very sensitive to the balance of the excitatory and inhibitory input that a neuron receives: some neurons are quiescent and others are highly active, while the number of inputs to each neuron differs by only a few percent. This emphasizes the need for homeostatic control of neural activity in a recurrent network.</p>

          <p>In the network with HSE, the time-averaged activity levels of all neurons are indeed controlled over a wide range of external input levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g005">figure 5B</xref>). The control of the intrinsic excitability in the HSE network occurs via up- and downregulation of the membrane conductance <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e131" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

The variability in the number of recurrent inputs that each neuron receives leads to a narrow distribution of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. For low compound external drive (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e134" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> kHz), the population mean <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e135" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the e-cells and the i-cells becomes very small, making the cells maximally excitable such that they can produce their target firing rate output. However, when the external input level becomes too low and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e136" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> approaches zero, more and more cells cannot reach their target activity levels anymore. In contrast, for high external input levels the cells can, in theory, always decrease their excitability sufficiently by increasing <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e137" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

          <p>The different levels of external drive to the network do not affect the stability of the adaptation dynamics when the network receives further perturbations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g005">figure 5D</xref>).

          <title>Adapting to persistent changes in the external drive to excitatory cells</title>
          <p>In the above section, the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory input that each cell receives, changed little when varying the level of external input, since the external input projects to both the e-cells and the i-cells. However, external inputs to a local neural network often target specific cell types (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Mountcastle1">[21]</xref>). Plasticity in the number of these inputs (or, equivalently in our model, persistent changes in the activity of these presynaptic neurons) can affect the excitation-inhibition balance in the local network. We examine this with the spiking network model by varying the compound external drive to the e-cells, while keeping the compound external drive to the i-cells constant.</p>
          <p>Varying the drive to e-cells has strong effects on the activity of the non-adapting recurrent network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g006">figure 6A</xref>). A 50% increase in the external drive to the e-cells from 1 kHz to 1.5 kHz leads to a large increase in e-cell activity from <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e142" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> Hz to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e143" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> Hz. In turn, the e-cells also drive the i-cells to high activity levels. In contrast to the non-adapting network, the time-averaged activity levels of both e-cells and i-cells in the network with HSE remain close to their target rates over a wide range of compound external input levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g006">figure 6B</xref>). As the drive to the e-cells increases, the excitability of the e-cells decreases (i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e144" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> grows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g006">figure 6C</xref>).

          <title>Adapting to plasticity of the recurrent excitatory connection strength</title>
          <p>Plasticity of the strength of recurrent excitatory connections is another biologically relevant source of changes in the excitation-inhibition balance in a network. This can result from learning processes, such as spike timing-dependent plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Markram2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Bi1">[23]</xref>. We varied the strength of all recurrent excitatory connections (equivalent to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e152" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the mean-field model) in the spiking network model and determined the resulting state in a network with or without HSE. Note that under more realistic conditions, synaptic plasticity is expected to result in increases of some synaptic weights, while other weights decrease. As a consequence, part of the effects on the excitation-inhibition balance would cancel.</p>
          <p>Activity levels in the non-adapting network rise steeply when increasing the recurrent excitatory synaptic weights above their standard values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g007">figure 7A</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> for standard values). Decreasing the recurrent excitatory weights causes a gradual decrease of the network activity levels. The HSE network is able to maintain the time-averaged output levels for decreasing values of the recurrent excitatory synaptic weights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g007">figure 7B</xref>), which requires only moderate changes in cell excitability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g007">figure 7C</xref>). The HSE mechanism also controls the time-averaged output levels for limited increases of the recurrent weights. However, either with or without HSE, the network becomes gradually more unstable when the normalized excitatory weights are increased from 1 to over 1.15, and starts showing highly synchronized discharges. We quantified the irregularity of spiking activity in the network by calculating the coefficient of variation (CV) of the interspike interval (ISI) distribution of the e-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g007">figure 7D</xref>). When recurrent excitatory weights are set to their standard value (or smaller), the mean CV is close to 1 in both the HSE controlled network and in the network without HSE, reflecting the irregular, Poisson-like firing statistics. When the recurrent excitatory weights are increased, synchronized discharges occur increasingly often, which is expressed in the rising CV. While HSE can control the time-averaged activity levels, it cannot prevent these synchronized discharges from occurring, hence the activity fluctuates between low and high activity levels. These results agree with the mean-field analysis, which showed that HSE cannot compensate for parameter changes that make recurrent excitation too strong compared to feedback inhibition; this destabilizes the population dynamics determined by equation (1).</p>

However, when more than 20% of the i-cells is removed, both the HSE controlled network and the network without HSE become gradually more unstable on the fast time scale of the population dynamics and start showing synchronized discharges. These transitions between low and high activity levels are reflected in the increased CV of the e-cell ISI distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g008">figure 8D</xref>). Hence, while HSE can still control mean activity levels when more than <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e157" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of i-cells are removed, it cannot avoid the occurrence of the synchronized discharges. These results agree with the mean-field analysis in which a decrease in the number of i-cells corresponds to a decrease in the weights <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e158" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e159" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. When feedback inhibition becomes too small compared to recurrent excitation, the network becomes unstable at the time scale of the population dynamics described by equation (1), and this instability cannot be counteracted by HSE.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Recent experimental studies demonstrated activity-dependent scaling of intrinsic excitability in cortical and hippocampal excitatory and inhibitory neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Desai1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Fan1">[11]</xref>. It is generally thought that this process serves to compensate for the ongoing functional and morphological plasticity in neuronal and synaptic properties such that the intrinsic excitability remains matched to the synaptic input level. In this way, homeostatic scaling of intrinsic excitability (HSE) ensures that neurons operate within their limited dynamic range, slowly adapting to specific average input levels, while keeping up a high sensitivity to changes in synaptic input. In addition, this process is thought to promote network stability. Here, we explored the consequences of HSE implemented in single cells on the stability of recurrent networks, and the ability of HSE to facilitate adequate responses in a network that undergoes several forms of long-lasting plasticity.</p>
      <p>Experimental and theoretical work has demonstrated that stability of recurrent networks requires a delicate balance between excitation and inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Wilson1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Brunel1">[14]</xref>. A central issue in our study was to determine the requirements for stable functioning of HSE in such recurrent networks. Simulations with a model consisting of spiking excitatory and inhibitory cells that implement HSE demonstrated that the ratio of adaptation rates of the two cell types is the key parameter determining the stability of HSE controlled networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g001">figure 1C–D</xref>). The slower inhibitory cells adapt, the larger the persistent changes in external drive to which the network can adapt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g002">figure 2</xref>). A mean-field model describing the activity levels of interacting excitatory and inhibitory populations allowed a mathematical analysis of the stability of a network with HSE. The results confirmed that stability of the adapting network critically depends on the ratio of the adaptation rates of both populations. Assuming that the population gains and the time constants of the population dynamics are similar, stability of the adapting network is guaranteed when the inhibitory population adapts slower than the excitatory population.</p>
      <p>With the mean field model we could also demonstrate the process by which HSE can destabilize a recurrent network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g004">figure 4B</xref>). In our model a HSE-induced decrease in excitability of the inhibitory population paradoxically leads to increases in its activity level. This process is closely related to a phenomenon described by Tsodyks and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Tsodyks1">[26]</xref>, who showed that inhibiting the inhibitory population in a recurrent network can result in an increase of the inhibitory population activity. In our HSE controlled network model, the ongoing adaptation reinforces these changes in population activity levels, consequently leading to unstable dynamics on the time scale of the homeostatic process.</p>
      <p>The above requirements for stable adaptation dynamics are relaxed somewhat if the inhibitory population consists of multiple subpopulations of cells that adapt on different time scales. The adapting network can then remain stable when a subpopulation of inhibitory cells adapts faster than the excitatory cells, as long as there is another sufficiently large subpopulation of inhibitory cells that adapts more slowly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g003">figure 3</xref>). To our knowledge, no experimental studies have assessed the relative adaptation time scales of excitatory cells and the various types of inhibitory cells that have been described in recurrent networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Markram1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Somogyi1">[16]</xref>. In fact, only few studies have examined the homeostatic changes in intrinsic excitability of inhibitory cells when network activity levels are manipulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Desai2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Gibson1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Bartley1">[9]</xref>. Those studies demonstrated that two inhibitory subtypes in cortical networks (parvalbumin-positive and somatostatin-positive neurons) indeed show HSE. Our results suggest that it is important for future experimental work to examine the relative adaptation time scales of the various cell types in recurrent networks. This could be particularly relevant for pathological conditions in which networks show abnormal dynamics, e.g., various forms of epilepsy (see also below).</p>
      <p>Once we defined the requirements for stable functioning of HSE in recurrent networks, a key question in this study was to pinpoint forms of plasticity where HSE could be of relevance and guarantee that neurons function within their dynamic range. The results from the mean-field analysis imply that HSE can realize control for any change in network parameters as long as these changes do not destabilize the network dynamics described by equation (1): the conditions that determine the stability of the network at this fast time scale are not controlled by HSE (equations (9) and (10)). Simulations with the spiking network model showed that HSE can indeed adapt to persistent changes in the external drive to the network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g005">figure 5</xref>). The ability of HSE to compensate for plasticity is particularly important when considering changes that affect the excitation-inhibition balance in the network. The results showed that such changes have strong effects on the activity of a non-adapting recurrent network. We tested three biologically relevant sources of such plasticity. First we showed that HSE can adapt the network to persistent changes in external drive to only the excitatory cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g006">figure 6</xref>). Such gross modifications in input strength will be encountered as an increase in total synaptic input during development, but also as a decrease in the number of synaptic inputs during degenerative diseases. We then showed that HSE can also cope with variations in synaptic strength that could occur under normal physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g007">figure 7</xref>). As a final example we illustrated how HSE can control cell activity when (sub)classes of cells are eliminated, a situation that is encountered in specific forms of epilepsy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002494-g008">figure 8</xref>). These examples also illustrated that HSE will never prevent network instabilities that occur when recurrent excitatory connectivity becomes too strong, or for the same token, when the strength of inhibitory feedback in the network becomes too weak.</p>
      <p>The analytical as well as numerical results suggest that, in order to compensate for ongoing plasticity, recurrent networks need, in addition to HSE, mechanisms that control connectivity (e.g., the number of inputs per cell) and synaptic efficacy (e.g., the mean synaptic efficacy of inputs to the cell). Indeed, experiments have demonstrated that the ratio of the number of excitatory and inhibitory synapses onto pyramidal neurons is maintained <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Knott1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Liu1">[28]</xref>. Also, a series of studies have demonstrated a mechanism that regulates the overall efficacy of the synapses impinging on a single cell, a process known as synaptic scaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Turrigiano1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Turrigiano2">[30]</xref>. Like HSE, synaptic scaling has been hypothesized to serve as a homeostatic control mechanism for maintaining neural activity levels to keep cells within their dynamic range. There are indications that synaptic scaling is particularly relevant during development and acts on a very slow time scale (hours to days). A key difference with HSE is that in order to preserve the relative synaptic weights of all synapses, synaptic scaling needs to be proportional for all thousands of synapses over the dendritic tree of a neuron. This is important as it is assumed that information is stored in the relative weights of the synapses. The HSE mechanism in our study that acts via up- and downregulation of ion channels that control excitability, avoids this problem. It has not yet been investigated in detail how synaptic scaling interferes with network stability (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Houweling1">[31]</xref>). It is important for future studies to determine how the various homeostatic control mechanisms operate together and maintain a functional neural network (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Turrigiano3">[32]</xref>).</p>
      <p>As a concluding remark, we want to emphasize that our results suggest that a defect in the HSE mechanism can have severe consequences for network functioning. For example, when excitatory neurons cannot adapt effectively (e.g., because of a defect in the molecular mechanism underlying HSE) the network can become unstable or be in a state that is close to instability. Possibly such defects are involved in certain pathologies, such as epilepsy. It is important to realize that such defects are not necessarily observable in either abnormal cell excitability or network connectivity, but rather in the adaptation dynamics that accompany ongoing plasticity. This suggests that it is important to consider the adaptation properties of cells as a possible source of the abnormal network dynamics seen in several pathologies.</p>

          <title>HSE mechanism</title>
          <p>A mechanism is added to the LIF neurons to implement the homeostatic scaling of intrinsic excitability. The mechanism attempts to keep a neuron within its dynamic range by keeping the time-averaged output activity close to a value that is within the neuron's dynamic range. Experiments in hippocampal and cortical networks demonstrated that HSE typically leads to changes of the input resistance and shifts of the neural response function, while having little effect on the resting membrane potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Gibson1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Karmarkar1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Bartley1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002494-Fan1">[11]</xref>.

The time scale of adaptation for the cells is determined by the constants <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e218" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (for the e-cells) and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e219" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (for the i-cells) and the function <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e220" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

        <p>We analyze the dynamics of an adapting recurrent network that consists of an excitatory and an inhibitory population that both receive excitatory input from external sources. Using a mean-field approach we describe the average activity of the cells within each population.

We assume that the HSE mechanism shifts the response functions in such a way that the time-averaged network activity levels remain close to a target state <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e250" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in which both populations function within their dynamic range.

We can consider equation (5) in steady state at the time scale of adaptation since the adaptive process described by equation (6) is much slower than the population dynamics that are governed by equation (5). The steady state solution of (5) is located at the intersection of the nullclines <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e256" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e257" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The nullclines are given by<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e258" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(7)</label></disp-formula>where the activities <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e259" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e260" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are strictly positive. The explicit steady state solution reads<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e261" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(8)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e262" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e263" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Stability of this solution requires that the matrix of coefficients of equation (5) has eigenvalues with a negative real part. This is guaranteed when<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e264" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(9)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e265" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(10)</label></disp-formula></p>
        <p>We now assume that conditions (9) and (10) are satisfied and thus that equation (5) has a stable solution. We can then use the steady state values of equation (8) and substitute these in equation (6) to formulate the evolution of the adaptation variables <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e266" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e267" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e268" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(11)</label></disp-formula>We now want to determine the stability conditions for the solution of equation (11). Stability of the solution, where both <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e269" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e270" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, requires that perturbations from the solution decay to zero. Using the same approach as above, we can derive the stability conditions:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e271" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(12)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e272" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(13)</label></disp-formula>Since we assume that condition (10) holds and we only allow positive gains, condition (13) is always fulfilled. However, condition (12) imposes extra restrictions on the stability of a recurrent network with HSE. This condition will determine the stability of the adaptation dynamics and, thus, whether the time-averaged activity state of the network will approach the target state <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e273" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Since we assumed that condition (9) holds, we know that<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002494.e274" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(14)</label></disp-formula>is a sufficient condition to fulfill inequality (12) and to guarantee stability of the HSE controlled network.</p>
