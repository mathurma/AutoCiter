<p>Synaptic volume matters! The size of the presynaptic compartment of retinal bipolar cells controls the amplitude, speed, and adaptation of synaptic transmission.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>The visual system transmits information about fast and slow changes in light intensity through separate neural pathways. We used <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging to investigate how bipolar cells transmit these signals to the inner retina. We found that the volume of the synaptic terminal is an intrinsic property that contributes to different temporal filters. Individual cells transmit through multiple terminals varying in size, but smaller terminals generate faster and larger calcium transients to trigger vesicle release with higher initial gain, followed by more profound adaptation. Smaller terminals transmitted higher stimulus frequencies more effectively. Modeling global calcium dynamics triggering vesicle release indicated that variations in the volume of presynaptic compartments contribute directly to all these differences in response dynamics. These results indicate how one neuron can transmit different temporal components in the visual signal through synaptic terminals of varying geometries with different adaptational properties.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The process of neurotransmission involves the conversion of electrical signals into the release of a chemical neurotransmitter from the neurons synaptic terminal, and the key trigger for this release is a rise in calcium concentration. Accordingly, the amplitude and speed of this calcium signal controls the amplitude and time-course of synaptic communication. Working on the synaptic terminals of fish retinal bipolar cells, we show that the presynaptic calcium signal and the subsequent neurotransmitter release are shaped by the basic property of synapse volume. Using a combination of experimental approaches and computational models, we found that large synapses are slow and adapt little during ongoing stimulation, while small synapses are fast and show more profound adaptation. This observation leads to a second key concept: since neurons usually have several presynaptic terminals that may vary in volume, a single neuron can, in principle, forward different synaptic signals to different postsynaptic partners. We provide direct evidence that this is the case for bipolar cells of the fish retina.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The retina analyzes the visual world through a series of spatio-temporal filters that establish parallel representations for transmission to the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Masland1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Masland2">[4]</xref>. The anatomical organization of these channels is established in the inner plexiform layer (IPL), which is organized into five to six distinct strata containing the dendrites of as many as 20 different types of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Roska1">[2]</xref>. In each stratum, bipolar cells (BCs) with distinct filtering properties make excitatory synaptic connections with defined subsets of RGCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Euler1">[5]</xref>. For instance, “transient” RGCs are thought to receive excitatory inputs from BCs with bandpass characteristics, while “sustained” RGCs receive inputs from BCs acting as low-pass filters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Awatramani1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>A long-standing question is how multiple spatio-temporal filters are built using the limited numbers of neurons responding to a particular region of the visual field <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Gollisch1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Taylor1">[9]</xref>. An answer might lie in reconsidering the fundamental neural element through which the visual signal is transmitted to the inner retina: although individual BCs have diverse properties, their output is transmitted through a much more numerous and heterogeneous component of neural circuits–synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Abbott1">[10]</xref>. Indeed, recent evidence indicates that different synapses of the same BC transmit the visual signal with varying kinetics because of local interactions with different types of inhibitory amacrine cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Asari1">[11]</xref>. Here we ask whether heterogeneous transmission of the visual signal might also reflect intrinsic variations between the various synaptic compartments of a BC. The property we concentrate on is the volume of the terminal, which is expected to influence the amplitude and kinetics of the presynaptic calcium signal controlling neurotransmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Mintz1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>To observe the activity of multiple BC synapses we used zebrafish expressing fluorescent proteins reporting the fusion of synaptic vesicles or the presynaptic calcium signal driving fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Dreosti1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Odermatt1">[14]</xref>. Here we demonstrate that BC terminals of different sizes tend to transform the visual signal in different ways. On average, smaller terminals generate calcium transients that are larger and faster, resulting in a higher initial gain of responses to an increase in temporal contrast followed by more profound adaptation. Small terminals also transmit high frequencies more effectively. Such differences in the outputs of small and large terminals are also observed in individual cells, which therefore have an intrinsic ability to filter visual information through channels with different gains, temporal filters and adaptive properties.</p>

<p>In the vertebrate retina, signals from rod and cone photoreceptors travel through BCs to be transmitted through synaptic terminals of various sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). To survey the activity of many BC synapses in a live animal, we imaged eight to ten days post fertilisation (dpf) zebrafish larvae expressing sypHy, a reporter of vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Odermatt1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Granseth1">[15]</xref>, or SyGCaMP2, which signals the presynaptic calcium transient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Dreosti1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Dreosti2">[16]</xref>. Regions of interest defining individual terminals in images of the IPL were generated using an algorithm based on a Laplace operator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Dorostkar1">[17]</xref>, from which we estimated the “effective terminal radius” (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). A survey of 5,061 terminals revealed a wide variation in radius with a mean of 1.13±0.40 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, black bars). Terminals of different sizes were not distributed randomly through the IPL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g001">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001972.s001">S1I</xref>): terminals in layers 2 and 6 were significantly larger than the average across the whole population of BCs, while terminals in layers 1, 3, 4, and 5 were significantly smaller.</p>

<p>How do these variations in the volume of the presynaptic compartment affect the calcium signal that is generated when a stimulus alters the membrane potential and the rate of calcium influx? To investigate this question we imaged SyGCaMP2 and measured the average response over the whole region of interest (ROI) defining each terminal. Although this procedure will neglect calcium gradients within the terminal, these gradients will not be maintained when calcium influx is modulated at frequencies relevant to vision (see below). In a sample of 932 ON terminals, the initial rate of rise of the calcium signal elicited by a full field step of light was approximately twice as fast in the smallest terminals compared to the largest, and the calcium concentration reached a higher steady-state level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g001">Figure 1E<sub>1,2</sub></xref>). Variations in terminal size were also correlated with differences in the kinetics of exocytosis, as measured in fish expressing sypHy. In a sample of 438 ON terminals, the relative rate of vesicle release in response to the same stimulus (quantified as a percentage of vesicles released per second) varied by a factor of at least two between the smallest and largest terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g001">Figure 1F<sub>1,2</sub></xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Odermatt1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Nikolaev1">[18]</xref>. A similar relationship between release amplitude and terminal size was observed in the OFF channel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001972.s001">Figure S1G</xref>).</p>
<p>A correlation between the size of a terminal and the amplitude of its response was also observed when the temporal contrast of the stimulus was increased while keeping the mean luminance constant. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g001">Figure 1G<sub>1</sub></xref> shows averaged SyGCaMP2 responses to modulation of light intensity at 1 Hz (100% contrast). The power of the calcium signal at the fundamental frequency was greater in small terminals (r = 0.6–1.3 µm) than in large (r = 2.1–4.1 µm), varying by a factor of at least three across the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g001">Figure 1G<sub>2</sub></xref>).</p>
<p>Does the correlation between the size of the terminal compartment and the release rate reflect the network in which the terminal is embedded? For instance, one scenario might be that large terminals respond with lower gain because they receive stronger inhibitory feedback from amacrine cells. To test this possibility, we blocked GABAergic inhibition through ionotropic receptors by injecting 100 µM picrotoxin into the eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This manipulation increased the amplitude of the exocytic response across terminals of all sizes, as would be expected when feedback inhibition is reduced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Nikolaev1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Vigh1">[19]</xref>, but larger terminals continued to respond with lower gain. This observation suggests that the correlation between terminal size and release rate reflects intrinsic properties of the terminal rather than the influence of the network it is embedded in.</p>

<p>The initial rate of release in response to a step of light in control terminals (black, from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g001">Figure 1F<sub>2</sub></xref>) is compared with measurements in which 100 M picrotoxin was injected in the front of the eye (77 ON terminals from three fish). The line fitted to the control has a slope of −0.096±0.023, and the line fitted to the picrotoxin measurements has a slope of −0.138±0.01 dependence peak release size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g001">Figure 1F<sub>2</sub></xref>). Note that picrotoxin also increased the amplitude of the exocytic response, as would be expected when feedback inhibition is reduced.</p>

<p>Might the correlation between stimulus-dependent changes in the brightness of terminals and estimates of their size be caused by a bias in the detection algorithm, perhaps causing smaller terminals to be detected only when their fluorescence signal was strong enough? Two lines of evidence indicated that this was not the case. First, the distribution of terminal sizes was very similar when measured in transgenic fish expressing synaptophysin-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), a fluorescent marker of synapses that is not affected by neural activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, red bars). Second, estimates of terminal size did not differ significantly when measurements were compared under conditions of high and low activity, as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001972.s001">Figure S1</xref> (See Methods). The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g001">Figure 1</xref> therefore indicate that the volume of the presynaptic compartment is closely linked to the gain with which BCs transmit the visual signal to the inner retina.</p>

<title>Different Calcium Dynamics in Small and Large Terminals of Individual Bipolar Cells</title>
<p>Are differences in gain maintained in small and large terminals of the same cell?

<title>The Relation between the Decay of the Calcium Transient and the Radius of the Terminal</title>
<p>The time-constant of decay of a calcium transient (τ<sub>decay</sub>) was directly proportional to the radius of the terminal (r), as shown <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g003">Figure 3J</xref>. This observation was made both when r was estimated from images of terminals filled with dye, and when r was calculated from the capacitance of terminals detached from the cell body.

Even in the largest terminals with r = 5 µm, t<sub>eq</sub> is ∼19 ms, which is less than half the period of a stimulus fluctuating at 20 Hz. The lack of any appreciable calcium gradients on these time-scales was confirmed in a 3-D model in which calcium influx occurred through clusters of calcium channels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001972.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Calcium signals on these spatial scales  have been demonstrated to trigger neurotransmitter release from ribbon synapses of fish bipolar cells, although calcium nanodomains very close to calcium channels also play a role in ribbon-type synapses in other neurons and other species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Kim2">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>These considerations indicate that there is a direct and causal link between the volume of the presynaptic compartment and the amplitude and kinetics of the calcium transient caused by a stimulus. But why is the volume of the presynaptic compartment also correlated with its output measured as vesicle release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g001">Figure 1F</xref>)?

<p>To model the presynaptic calcium signal, the light stimulus was convolved with the impulse response of a BC to predict the voltage trajectory in the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, top). BCs in goldfish have bandpass characteristics with peak transmission varying between about 1–14 Hz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Baden1">[22]</xref>, and we chose a value of 9.5 Hz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Schnapf1">[29]</xref>. The voltage response in the soma was then instantaneously mapped to the presynaptic calcium current using the I–V relation and density of L-type calcium channels measured in the terminal of BCs isolated from goldfish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Burrone1">[30]</xref>. This I–V relation is an exponential function, changing e-fold in ∼6.6 mV over the physiological range of membrane potentials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Burrone1">[30]</xref>. These first two steps in the model are analogous to the linear-nonlinear (LN) model that has been used to provide a description of responses in RGCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Gollisch1">[7]</xref>. This model therefore identifies the rectifying I–V relation of the calcium current in BCs as the first major non-linearity in retinal processing. The time-course of the presynaptic calcium signal in response to a visual stimulus was calculated by convolving the time-course of calcium influx with the “presynaptic calcium filter” predicted by the one-compartment model, which has an impulse response decaying with time-constant τ<sub>decay</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g003">Figure 3E and 3F</xref>). The value of τ<sub>decay</sub> depended on the radius of the terminal, according to the linear relation measured experimentally in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g003">Figure 3J</xref>.</p>
<p>To test this model of calcium dynamics we compared its predictions with experimental measurements made with OGB-5N in BCs from slices of goldfish retina. The calcium concentration in the smaller of two connected synaptic compartments rose higher and faster, and then decayed almost to baseline after each cycle of a 1 Hz stimulus, while in the larger terminals there was an accumulation of calcium and much smaller modulations in concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The model could account for these differences by using the appropriate value of r while keeping all other variables constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>We considered two extensions of this model. The first is the use of three dimensions to estimate changes in calcium concentration at the active zone: this provided a very similar prediction to the one-compartment model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001972.s003">Figure S3</xref>). The second extension was to add active conductances in the terminal leading to calcium spikes, but again this did not alter the main conclusions that we could draw about the impact of terminal volume on gain and kinetics (see below and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001972.s006">Figure S6</xref>).</p>

<title>A Model of Synaptic Transmission through Bipolar Cells</title>
<p>Having established that the model accounted adequately for variations in the presynaptic calcium signal, we extended it to explore the impact of terminal size on the kinetics of vesicle release. The following properties of exocytosis at the ribbon synapse of BCs were taken into account, all of which have been measured experimentally.</p>
<sec id="s2e1">
<title>Property 1</title>
<p>There are three anatomically distinct populations of vesicles in the synaptic terminal of BCs: the rapidly-releasable pool (RRP) docked at the active zone, the intermediate pool (IP) attached to the ribbon behind the active zone, and the reserve pool (RP) that is mobile across the whole terminal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Holt1">[31]</xref>.

<p>The spatial scale on which calcium entering through calcium channels triggers exocytosis is of the order of microns.

<p>This model closely described the different phases of exocytosis measured in isolated BCs stimulated by a voltage-clamp step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Neves1">[35]</xref>.</p>
<p>To assess the utility of the model, we compared its predictions with the experimental measurements of synaptic function illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g001">Figures 1E–1G</xref>. Variations in the initial rate of rise of presynaptic calcium signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g005">Figure 5C<sub>1,2</sub></xref>), the initial rate of exocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g005">Figure 5D<sub>1,2</sub></xref>), and the power of the calcium signal elicited by a 1 Hz stimulus could all be accounted for by variations in terminal radius, while keeping other variables constant. For instance, the initial rate of rise of calcium in response to a step stimulus decreased as 1/r while the rate of exocytosis was found to decrease linearly with r <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g001">Figure 1E<sub>2</sub> and 1F<sub>2</sub></xref>) and the model predicted the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g005">Figure 5C<sub>2</sub> and 5D<sub>2</sub></xref>). A notable feature of the model was the prediction of a secondary rise in the release rate beginning ∼150 ms after stimulus onset. A second phase of release has also been observed experimentally by monitoring glutamate release from the BC terminal electrophysiologically in a second voltage-clamped “sniffer cell” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-vonGersdorff1">[32]</xref>.</p>
<p>In its simplest form, the model failed to predict the exact form of the relation between the power of the SyGCaMP2 signal and terminal radius: power varied linearly with <italic>r in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g001">Figure 1G<sub>2</sub></xref>), but the model predicted that it would vary as 1/r (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g005">Figure 5E<sub>2</sub></xref>). This discrepancy could be corrected with a 3-D diffusion model that captures local calcium differences during ongoing signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g005">Figure 5E<sub>2</sub></xref>, inset).</p>
<p>We also explored predictions of the model to alterations in physiological parameters, including the possibility of a nonlinear relation between release rate and calcium concentration, and variations in the relative threshold for L-type calcium channel activation. These changes did not qualitatively alter the predicted effects of terminal volume on the gain and kinetics of signal transmission (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001972.s004">Figure S4</xref>). The combination of experiment and modeling presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g001">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g005">5</xref> converges on one basic idea: the volume of the presynaptic compartment is closely linked with the gain and kinetics of synaptic transmission by determining the amplitude and time-course of the presynaptic calcium transient. This fundamental property of the synaptic compartment varies across BCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) and will therefore contribute to variations in the gain of the visual signal transmitted to the inner retina, as well as the way gain varies as a function of frequency.</p>

Might the size of BC terminals also impact on the process of contrast adaptation?

<p>To quantify time-dependent changes in synaptic gain we used an “Adaptation Index” (AI), calculated as the ratio between the peak initial response to an increase in contrast and the later steady-state response. Using a stimulus of 100% contrast modulated at 5 Hz, and assuming a constant density of vesicles in terminals of different volume, the model predicted that the rate of vesicle release would depress more profoundly in smaller terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g006">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>).

<p>Assaying vesicle release <italic>in vivo</italic> using sypHy confirmed that smaller terminals displayed greater depression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), and AI decreased linearly with r (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). The absolute values of AI measured using sypHy were, however, lower than those predicted by the model: in the smallest terminals, an AI of ∼2.5 was measured using sypHy, while the model predicted values of ∼6. This difference is likely to reflect the relatively low time-resolution of sypHy measurements, causing us to underestimate the initial peak release rate (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Nonetheless, the model and experimental measurements together demonstrate that the geometry of the presynaptic compartment is one of the factors determining the kinetics of vesicle depletion and, therefore, adaptation.</p>

<p>Measurements of vesicle release with sypHy demonstrated strong rectification in the synaptic output because an increase in stimulus variance caused an increase in the mean rate of vesicle release even when the mean luminance was held constant, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g006">Figure 6C</xref>. This behavior is predicted by the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), where it reflects the rectifying relation between membrane potential and the amplitude of the calcium current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g004">Figure 4</xref>).

<p>Although the most obvious aspect of the SyGCaMP2 signal elicited by an increase in the variance of the stimulus was a maintained increase in presynaptic calcium, smaller fluctuations could also be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). The power of the fluctuations following a periodic stimulus was used to quantify the linear component of the synaptic calcium response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Baden1">[22]</xref>, and the power of this linear component was ∼3-fold larger in the smaller population of terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g001">Figures 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g007">7C, and 7D</xref>). Further, when the contrast of the stimulus was varied between 10% and 100%, the power of the linear component was directly proportional to the power of the DC component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g007">Figure 7E</xref>), as predicted by the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g007">Figure 7G</xref>). The proportionality constant for the small population of terminals was 2.4 times that of the large population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g007">Figure 7E</xref>), which was also predicted by the model. The relatively slow response time of SyGCaMP2 (τ<sub>decay</sub>∼200 ms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Dreosti1">[13]</xref>) prevented the imaging of synaptic responses following stimuli at frequencies greater than 3 Hz, but the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g007">Figure 7</xref> demonstrate that smaller terminals generate relatively stronger linear responses than large terminals, and therefore encode fluctuating stimuli more effectively.</p>

<title>Variations in Temporal Filtering in Terminals of Different Volume</title>
<p>How do variations in filtering of the presynaptic calcium signal impact on the output from the synapse? Assaying vesicle release with SypHy demonstrated that smaller terminals respond to a step of light with higher relative release rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g001">Figure 1F</xref>), but the resolution of this reporter was too low to detect modulations at stimulus frequencies &gt;1 Hz (i.e., the linear component of the output). Nonetheless, the model predicted that the modulation in release rate would be directly proportional to the steady rate once the terminal had adapted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g007">Figure 7F</xref>), and sypHy can be used to assess variations in the steady-rate of release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Odermatt1">[14]</xref>. We therefore used steady-state measurements to compare temporal filtering in the output of small and large terminals.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Many BCs transmit the visual signal through multiple terminals located in different strata of the IPL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Using a combination of <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging, slice electrophysiology, and modeling, we have found that variations in the size of these terminals will cause the signal in a single neuron to be transformed through different temporal filters as it is transmitted to the inner retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g001">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g004">4</xref>). The mechanistic link is the calcium signal that controls synaptic transmission: smaller terminals generate larger and faster calcium transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g001">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g005">5</xref>), increasing the gain of synaptic transmission and allowing higher frequencies to be transmitted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g007">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g008">8</xref>). Diversity in the properties of synaptic transmission extend to time-dependent changes in gain: smaller terminals adapt more completely after an increase in stimulus contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g006">Figure 6</xref>). These variations in synaptic properties will expand the number of processing channels that can operate in parallel through the limited number of neurons packed into a given region of the retinal network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Perge1">[55]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Balasubramanian1">[56]</xref>.

<p>The different temporal channels in the visual system were first distinguished by recording responses of “transient” and “sustained” ganglion cells in the retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Masland2">[4]</xref>. These temporal channels partly reflect processing in the inner retina, where feedback inhibition and lateral inhibition from amacrine cells act directly on BC terminals to alter the gain and timing of the synaptic output <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Asari1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Vigh1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Baccus2">[58]</xref>.

<p>In the future, it will be important to assess the extent to which RGCs tuned to different frequencies receive inputs from BC terminals of different sizes. Such a study will be technically demanding, requiring a detailed anatomical reconstruction of IPL circuitry. Nonetheless, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g001">Figure 1D</xref> provides the first evidence that RGCs with dendrites in different layers of the IPL will, on average, receive excitatory input from BC terminals of different sizes. For instance, layer 6 of the IPL contains the highest density of large terminals, which leads to the testable prediction that RGCs extending dendrites in this layer will be more likely to exhibit low-pass characteristics. In contrast, layer 5 has smaller terminals than the average, suggesting that RGCs collecting inputs from this layer will be tuned to higher frequencies.</p>

<title>Extrinsic Factors Affecting the Frequency Response of Bipolar Cell Synapses</title>
<p>The purpose of the model we have presented is to provide a basic mechanistic understanding for the impact of terminal volume on calcium dynamics and vesicle release from BCs. A more comprehensive model of signal transmission from BCs would not treat the neuron in isolation but would also consider the local circuits into which the terminals are connected. In particular we have neglected the effects of direct inhibitory feedback from amacrine cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Asari1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Vigh1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Baccus2">[58]</xref>. It is, however, notable that when the GABAergic component of this feedback was blocked, the size-dependence of release rate was maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g002">Figure 2</xref>), indicating that negative feedback was not the cause of this correlation.</p>
<p>The temporal tuning of BCs also reflects processes in the outer retina, especially cone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Baden2">[59]</xref> inputs with different contact morphologies acting on dendritic glutamate receptors with different kinetics of recovery from desensitization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Wssle1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-DeVries1">[60]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-DeVries2">[61]</xref>. The general picture that emerges is one in which amacrine cells modulate transmission of different frequency components in the visual input by acting on the background of at least two intrinsic properties varying between BCs: tuning of dendritic inputs summed at the cell body and the filter determining calcium dynamics in the synaptic terminal providing the output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g003">Figure 3G</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Robinson1">[62]</xref>. The key new idea that we propose here is that this synaptic filter varies between different outputs because of variations in an intrinsic property of the synaptic compartment—its volume.</p>

<title>The Synaptic Compartment of Bipolar Cells as a Computational Unit</title>
<p>It has long been recognized that the visual system separates signals encoding different aspects of a stimulus for transmission through different pathways or “channels.” The most fundamental of these parallel representations is the separation of ON and OFF signals, which begins in distinct types of BC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Werblin1">[63]</xref>. The separation of signals with different speeds into transient and sustained pathways also begins in BCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Awatramani1">[6]</xref>. More than ten types of morphologically distinct BCs can be recognized in the vertebrate retina, and probably more than 20 in zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Connaughton1">[64]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Li2">[65]</xref>, but we still do not fully understand how these differ in their response properties. The general thinking has been that one type of BC transmits one type of signal, but more recent work indicates that it might be more fruitful to focus on the synaptic terminal as the fundamental unit of signal transmission, which would allow for divergence of different signals from the one neuron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Asari1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>Implicit in this idea is the notion that the different synaptic outputs of a neuron are functionally isolated from each other, at least to some extent. Does the geometry of the terminal arborization allow this? Simultaneous measurements of calcium signals in connected terminals demonstrate that the answer is yes: connecting processes provide a sufficient diffusional barrier to allow calcium signals with different amplitudes and kinetics to remain local to individual terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Such isolation of presynaptic calcium signals would also allow for independent modulation of different synaptic compartments by amacrine cells. The potential number and diversity of these synaptic transformations becomes even greater if one considers that individual amacrine cells provide negative feedback though many neurites with distinct biophysical and synaptic properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Grimes1">[66]</xref>. Such presynaptic heterogeneity has previously been observed in sensory pathways of insects, including cricket auditory afferents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Baden3">[67]</xref> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory receptor neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Gaudry1">[68]</xref>.</p>

<p>All procedures were carried out according to the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and approved by the UK Home Office. Transgenic zebrafish expressing SyGCaMP2.0 and sypHy were maintained on a 14/10 h light/dark cycle at 28°C. From 24 hpf the larvae were maintained in fish medium (E2) containing 1-phenyl-2-thiourea at a final concentration of 200 µM (Sigma) to prevent pigment formation. Fish were imaged as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Dreosti1">[13]</xref>. Briefly, before experiments 8–10 dpf larvae were anesthetized in 0.016% Tricaine (Sigma) and immobilized in low melting point agarose. To prevent eye movement α-bungarotoxin (2 mg/ml) was injected into the extraocular space. Imaging was performed using a custom-built multiphoton microscope, equipped with a mode-locked Chameleon titanium-sapphire laser (Coherent) tuned to 920 nm and controlled using ScanImage v.3.6 software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Pologruto1">[69]</xref>.</p>
<p>The retina was imaged through an Olympus LUMPlanFI 40× water immersion (0.8 NA) objective. Green emission from sypHy and SyGCaMP2 was collected both through the objective and through an oil condenser (ND 1.4, Olympus), filtered through GFP filters (530/50 nm, Chroma Technology), and detected with GaAsP photomultipliers (Hamamatsu). Images (128×128 pixels) were acquired every 0.128 seconds, resulting in a sampling frequency of 7.8 Hz. Full-field light stimuli were delivered using an amber LED (590 nm) filtered through a 600/10 BP filter and projected through a light guide onto the surface of the bath, close to the eye of the fish. The mean intensity of light stimuli was ∼2×10<sup>5</sup> photons/µm<sup>2</sup>/s, which is in the low photopic range.</p>
<p>Importantly, optical measurements in the live retina necessarily give rise to a background activation of photoreceptors. This is due to direct laser activation of photopigment, but usually more importantly, due to indirect activation of photopigments from the emission light of excited fluophores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Euler2">[70]</xref>. As a result, rods are typically saturated, and cones partially adapted, giving rise to a low-photopic background light-level. Indeed, we observed similar effects in our <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001972.s001">Figure S1F</xref>). However, this background illumination was weaker than typically observed in e.g., rabbit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Euler2">[70]</xref>, presumably as the zebrafish retina is cone dominated. Nevertheless, following activation of the laser scanning, we typically waited 30 seconds before commencing with additional visual stimulation to ensure the retina adapted to the background levels attributed to the laser.</p>

<p>Movies were processed using the SARFIA suite of analysis routines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Dorostkar1">[17]</xref> running in Igor Pro 6 (Wavemetrics). We detected terminals on the basis of single images obtained by averaging many frames of the movie corresponding to total integration times of several tens of seconds. ROIs corresponding to terminals within these averaged images were defined using a filtering algorithm based on a Laplace operator followed by application of a threshold, as described in detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001972-Dorostkar1">[17]</xref>. This algorithm will define most or all of the ROIs that an experienced observer would recognize by eye. To prevent bias between ON and OFF terminals within a single field of view, the average image was obtained from movies in which light steps were applied, and/or light intensity modulated at 1 Hz or faster.</p>

<title>Estimation of Terminals Size by Two-Photon Imaging</title>
<p>The point-spread function of the used microscope in XY dimension was 0.5 µm and terminals appeared larger when we increased intensity of the 2-photon laser. We therefore tested whether terminals might appear smaller when less active, but found that this was not the case (as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001972.s001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001972.s010">Text S1</xref>). Average terminal sizes were similar between different fish (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001972.s005">Figure S5A</xref>) and the effects of terminal size on adaptation kinetics could be observed in individual fish (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001972.s005">Figure S5B</xref>) as well as in data averaged over multiple fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). However, the distribution of estimated terminal sizes in SyGCaMP2 was shifted to larger values, compared to sypHy or Synaptophysin-EGFP fish (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001972.s001">Figure S1H</xref>). This is likely explained by the greater overall brightness of SyGCaMP2. The z-resolution of the microscope was ∼2 µm. Given an average radius of just above 1 micron per terminal, this resolution was therefore large enough to avoid underestimating the size of terminals traversed non-centrally by the optical plane, but small enough to avoid out-of-focus terminals contributing to the signal.</p>

(D) Estimated release rates driven by calcium as shown in (C). (E) Concentration of unbound “fixed” (grey) and “diffusible” (green) buffers under normal buffering conditions during step depolarisation of a 1 micron radius terminal (c.f. red in (B)). The dotted line indicates unbound buffer concentration at the channel mouth (“hotspot”), which the solid line indicates concentration at the center of the compartment. The coloration indicates the possible range of unbound buffer concentration at different locations within the compartment. (F) Corresponding calcium concentration at the hotspot (dotted) and globally (solid). (G, H) as (E, F) but with 10 times elevated “fixed” buffer concentration. Elevating the fixed buffer has only small effects on the kinetics of calcium free calcium concentration, but does affect peak calcium concentration at the hotspot.</p>

The threshold was increased (light green) and decreased (dark green) from the value used in the main model (red) by 3 mV in each case. Right: modulation amplitude of calcium (A) and release (B) quantified for the three threshold conditions in different size compartments. Changing the threshold had only minimal effect on the overall size dependence of calcium and release modulation. (<bold>C, D</bold>) Steady state modulation of modeled calcium (C) and release (D) in an r = 1 micron compartment in response to an ongoing 3 Hz stimulus. Changing the Hill coefficient for calcium dependence of release from 1 (linear = in main model, red) to 3 (cooperative, light blue) systematically increases the modulation amplitude of release (D, left) across all frequencies tested (D, right).</p>

(B) Addition of Brownian motion noise (standard deviation [SD] = 1.4 mV) was used to yield an estimate of membrane voltage. Two separate predictions were drawn from the model at this point: graded (black) and spiking (red). A threshold was added to the “membrane voltage” trace to predict spikes, which occurred with an exponential refractory period of 300 ms. Spike amplitude was fixed at 20 mV, with a half width of 3 ms. (C) Bulk calcium and (D) release was calculated as before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001972-g004">Figure 4</xref>) from the graded and spiking voltage traces. (E) Average release rates of 100 graded (black) and 100 spiking (red) model BCs. Note that the mean frequency response of the spiking system is highly reminiscent of the generator frequency response (A), while the graded system imposes a powerful low pass filter on the signal.</p>
