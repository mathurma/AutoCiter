In many sensory systems, collective behaviors in large cell groups can be described by pairwise spike correlations. Here, we test whether in a highly specialized premotor system of songbirds, pairwise spike correlations themselves can be seen as a simple corollary of an underlying random process. We test hypotheses on connectivity and network dynamics in the motor pathway of zebra finches using a high-level population model that is independent of detailed single-neuron properties. We assume that neural population activity evolves along a finite set of states during singing, and that during sleep population activity randomly switches back and forth between song states and a single resting state. Individual spike trains are generated by associating with each of the population states a particular firing mode, such as bursting or tonic firing. With an overall modification of one or two simple control parameters, the Markov model is able to reproduce observed firing statistics and spike correlations in different neuron types and behavioral states. Our results suggest that song- and sleep-related firing patterns are identical on short time scales and result from random sampling of a unique underlying theme. The efficiency of our population model may apply also to other neural systems in which population hypotheses can be tested on recordings from small neuron groups.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>To deal with the vast complexity of the brain and its many degrees of freedom, many reductionist methods have been designed that can be used to simplify neural interactions to just a few key underlying macroscopic variables. Despite these theoretical advances, even today relatively few population models have been subjected to stringent experimental tests. We explore whether second-order spike correlations measured in songbirds can be explained by single-neuron statistics and population dynamics, both reflecting hypotheses on network connectivity. We formulate a Markov population model with essentially two degrees of freedom and associated with different behavioral states of birds such as waking, singing, or sleeping. Excellent agreement between spike-train data and model is achieved, given a few connectivity assumptions that strengthen the view of a hierarchical organization of songbird motor networks. This work is an important demonstration that a broad range of neural activity patterns can be compatible at the population level with few underlying degrees of freedom.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement> This work was supported by a Schweizerischer Nationalfonds (SNF) professorship grant to RHRH.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Weber AP, Hahnloser RHR (2007) Spike correlations in a songbird agree with a simple Markov population model.

A central question pertaining to such observations is the extent to which spike sequences in single neurons reflect sequential behaviors across larger populations. Sometimes there is strong correspondence, and the spike patterns in single neurons can be precisely predicted from a coarse population readout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030249-b006">6</xref>]. However, it is largely unexplored whether population-conditional models of spike trains can go beyond single-neuron statistics and also explain pairwise spike correlations.</p><p>Pairwise spike correlations can signal important information beyond that of firing rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030249-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030249-b008">8</xref>], and in some sensory systems no higher-order interactions seem to exist beyond that of cell pairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030249-b009">9</xref>]. Spike correlations can be interpreted as evidence either of direct synaptic interactions or of common synaptic inputs. To illustrate the relationship between spike correlations and population models, let us consider neurons that display some regular subthreshold oscillations and occasionally fire a spike at the peaks of oscillation cycles. From single-unit data, we cannot infer the activity distribution across the population. However, given pairwise spiking data, we can estimate the number of population states from the conditional probability that a cell spikes given that a spike in another cell occurs (which is a measure of spike correlation). For example, if the conditional spike probability (CSP) averaged over cell pairs is one, then all cells must be linked to the same population state, and fire with unit probability when that state is visited. If, on the other hand, CSPs average to 0.2, then the cells can be distributed among at most five equiprobable states. For example, neurons could each be randomly linked to one of five states and fire with unit probability when that state is visited; or they could all be linked to the same state and fire with probability 0.2 when that state is visited. Which of these cases applies depends on the spread of CSPs: in the one-state case, all CSPs would be narrowly distributed around 0.2, and in the five-state case, CSPs would be bimodally distributed around zero and one (and average to 0.2). The point of this hypothetical example is to illustrate that population-conditional models are constrained by spike correlations, and therefore such models must be tested on experimental data.</p><p>In the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) and the high vocal center (HVC) of zebra finches, neurons exhibit precise and stereotyped high-frequency bursts during singing. The number of bursts produced per song motif varies strongly between neuron types, from about one burst in RA-projecting HVC neurons (HVC<sub>RA</sub> neurons), to about 12 bursts in RA projection neurons, and up to more than 20 bursts in HVC interneurons (HVC<sub>I</sub> neurons) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030249-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030249-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030249-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030249-b011">11</xref>].

And during sleep they display incessant switching between bursting and tonic firing modes; in RA neurons, the sleep-related burst patterns can be highly similar to song-related patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030249-b004">4</xref>], and often the patterns are time-locked to bursts in simultaneously recorded RA-projecting HVC neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030249-g001">Figure 1</xref>Bi) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030249-b012">12</xref>].</p><fig id="pcbi-0030249-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030249.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Song and Sleep-Related Firing in HVC and RA Neurons of Zebra Finches</title><p>(A) During the production of a song motif (sound spectrogram on top), RA-projecting HVC neurons (HVC<sub>RA</sub> neurons) produce at most one stereotyped spike burst (red rasters).

Model spike trains depend on the sequence of population states and are otherwise independent of each other. Formally, state–space models allow for the a priori estimation of the state dynamics from given spike data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030249-b016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030249-b019">19</xref>]. However, because here we assume knowledge of the state–space topology (i.e., a chain-like network among HVC<sub>RA</sub> neurons), we are faced with the simpler problem of estimating the transition probabilities associated with the chain.</p><p>We explore to what fraction sleep-related bursts in HVC and RA constitute replay of premotor bursts. We compare our simulations to sets of song- and sleep-related spike data in different HVC and RA neuron types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030249-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030249-b010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030249-b012">12</xref>]. These datasets are affected by a nonnegligible variability, as exemplified by averages of sleep-related interspike interval (ISI) distributions in RA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030249-g001">Figure 1</xref>Bii). This variability entails model parameters needing to be individually adjusted for each dataset. Our main finding is that the diversity of the data across sets and across behavioral states (waking, singing, and sleeping) can be essentially ascribed to two macroscopic transition probabilities; these set the likelihood that population activity either evolves along the chain of motor states imprinted in the HVC<sub>RA</sub> network, or flips back and forth between motor states and a single resting state. Our results strengthen the view that synaptic networks are organized to support well-defined and highly constrained population behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Model</title><p>In our model, HVC population activity is a random variable that evolves in roughly 5 ms steps and is either in the ground state, or in one of 100 song states.

HVC<sub>I</sub> and RA neurons were randomly linked to more than one HVC<sub>RA</sub> group and fired several bursts per song motif. For each neuron type, burst ISI pdfs were fixed and were simply derived from measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030249-g002">Figure 2</xref>C).

From a recent experimental study, we know that these burst epochs are shaped by input from the thalamic nucleus uveaformis (Uva): decreased tonic firing in HVC-projecting Uva neurons leads to increased bursting in HVC and RA neurons, whereas increased tonic firing in HVC-projecting Uva neurons suppresses HVC and RA burst rates (unpublished data).

We modeled CSP functions by averaging over 50 simulated cell pairs with randomly drawn link sets. It was a simple matter to produce excellent fits of CSP functions in RA–RA and RA–HVC<sub>I</sub> pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030249-g005">Figure 5</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030249-g005">5</xref>D). The effect of <italic>p</italic> was to set the width of CSP functions, whereas <italic>q</italic> and average RA and HVC<sub>I</sub> firing rates set the baseline and peak values. However, CSP function in HVC<sub>RA</sub>–HVC<sub>I</sub> pairs and HVC<sub>I</sub>–HVC<sub>I</sub> pairs turned out to be more problematic because it was impossible to reproduce the high CSP peaks near zero time lag. For HVC<sub>RA</sub>–HVC<sub>I</sub> pairs, there was a simple explanation for this shortcoming: when we simulated only as many model pairs as were available in the experimental dataset (26 instead of 50), then the high CSP peak could be occasionally reproduced due to random link sampling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030249-g005">Figure 5</xref>E). Thus, from a bootstrapping point of view, the small difference between model and real CSP functions in HVC<sub>RA</sub>–HVC<sub>I</sub> pairs was not statistically significant. In contrast, the peak CSP in HVC<sub>I</sub>–HVC<sub>I</sub> pairs was significantly higher than its model counterpart: even when sleep activity was restricted to song states only (<italic>p</italic> = 1), the high peak CSP in HVC<sub>I</sub>–HVC<sub>I</sub> pairs could not be reproduced. A good fit was only possible with substantially higher HVC<sub>I</sub> burst probability, <italic>p</italic><sub>I</sub> = 0.95. Thus, we were faced with the paradoxical conclusion that HVC<sub>I</sub> neurons burst more reliably during sleep than during singing (this conclusion is paradoxical, because with our estimate of HVC<sub>RA</sub> burst probability <italic>p</italic><sub>P</sub> = 1 during singing and <italic>p</italic><sub>P</sub> = 0.8 during sleep, the presumed HVC<sub>RA</sub> drive is smaller during sleep, and so <italic>p</italic><sub>I</sub> should be smaller as well). We could imagine two reasons why the CSP peaks of HVC<sub>I</sub> pairs might be so high during sleep. First, during sleep, HVC<sub>I</sub> neurons could be selectively driven by X-projecting HVC (HVC<sub>X</sub>) neurons or by neurons in the nucleus interface of the nidopallium (NIf) that project to HVC (NIf<sub>HVC</sub> neurons), in addition to their weaker drive from HVC<sub>RA</sub> neurons. This explanation by itself seems somewhat implausible, because it would require that HVC<sub>RA</sub> neurons not be driven (or only very weakly driven) by HVC<sub>X</sub> or NIf<sub>HVC</sub> neurons, which appears not to be the case [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030249-b021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030249-b023">23</xref>]). Therefore, we favored a second explanation, which is that our assumption of random and uniform links in HVC<sub>I</sub> neurons must be wrong. In other words, there must be a special subset of HVC<sub>RA</sub> groups to which HVC<sub>I</sub> neurons are linked with higher probability. In fact, such an explanation agrees with song-related data, according to which HVC<sub>I</sub> population activity is weakly correlated with sound amplitude and therefore not uniformly distributed over the time course of a song motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030249-b011">11</xref>]. Indeed, when we relaxed the assumption that HVC<sub>I</sub> neurons can be linked to any one of the 100 HVC<sub>RA</sub> groups, but to only 56 randomly selected groups, we obtained a good fit to the CSP peak with standard HVC<sub>I</sub> parameters <italic>p</italic><sub>I</sub> = 0.63 (<italic>L</italic><sub>I</sub> = 50) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030249-g005">Figure 5</xref>F).</p><p>Note that a requirement for the excellent CSP fits was the inclusion of burst epochs. Without burst epochs, the long tails of CSP functions could not be well fit (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030249-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). Note also that the asymmetry in the average RA–HVC<sub>I</sub> CSP function in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030249-g005">Figure 5</xref>D was largely due to RA inhibition that decreases tonic firing after bursts and due to differences between RA and HVC<sub>I</sub> tonic firing rates.</p><p>One of our model assumptions is that any HVC<sub>RA</sub> group can be activated from within the ground state. We were unable to stringently test this assumption: All of our results remained unchanged when singing-like activity could be initialized in only a random subset of ten or more song states. However, when this number was much smaller (two to four states), unrealistic peaks in correlation functions appeared, thereby setting a lower bound for the number of possible initial HVC<sub>RA</sub> groups.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Tests of HVC Ultrasparseness and Sequential Dynamics during Sleep</title><p>We tested the validity of our assumptions of ultrasparseness and sequential dynamics of HVC<sub>RA</sub> activity.

The same held true for the number of CSPs in the bin [0, 0.01], which was significantly larger than in adjacent bins.

For the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030249-g002">Figure 2</xref>, very small and very large CSPs appeared frequently (red curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030249-g006">Figure 6</xref>), in good agreement with the data. Almost no parameter tuning was necessary to achieve a good fit. The heights of extreme CSP peaks were positively correlated with <italic>q</italic>. When <italic>q</italic> was small, the likelihood of repeated switching between ground and song states within 60 ms was large, thereby decorrelating spike trains and forcing extreme CSP values to appear less frequently. CSPs in the intermediate range 0.5–0.95 were positively correlated with <italic>p</italic>, because with longer RA burst sequences, intermediate CSP values occurred more often. For a peak at unit CSP to appear, the RA burst probability <italic>p</italic><sub>R</sub> had to be close to one: by decreasing <italic>p</italic><sub>R</sub> from one to 0.8, the peak at unit CSP completely disappeared. Thus, to agree with the data, RA neurons must have a very high burst probability, which is suggestive of a strong drive from HVC.</p><p>We then assumed that HVC<sub>RA</sub> neurons do not burst by linkage with a single HVC<sub>RA</sub> group, but that 80% of their bursts are locked to a first HVC<sub>RA</sub> group, and 20% of bursts are locked to a second group (in the simulations, the two groups were randomly chosen for each simulated HVC<sub>RA</sub> neuron). We expected these double linkages to create a washout effect in which clear RA burst pattern would no longer be seen. Indeed, by remapping just 20% of HVC<sub>RA</sub> bursts in this manner, very high and very low CSPs appeared less frequently (green curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030249-g006">Figure 6</xref>), in disagreement with the data. This phenomenon was very robust because increasing <italic>p</italic> up to 99/100 and <italic>q</italic> up to 999/1000 was insufficient to reproduce the high peak at unit CSP. Thus, ultrasparseness of HVC<sub>RA</sub> linkage is necessary to explain the abundance of extreme CSPs.</p><p>We also estimated the degree to which HVC<sub>RA</sub> groups are activated in sequence as opposed to random (nonsequential) activation. In principle, our sleep model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030249-g002">Figure 2</xref>B allows for almost arbitrary state transitions by means of a brief intermission via the ground state. However, reasonable values for <italic>p</italic> and <italic>q</italic> imply that nonsequential HVC<sub>RA</sub>-group activation is rare and that such events have little impact on the observed CSP distribution. To test our model assumption that fixed and sequential state transitions underlie sleep-related activity patterns, we performed simulations in which 20% of transitions between song states were nonsequential but completely random. We found that introducing such randomness into the model resulted in an altered CSP distribution in which zero CSPs appeared very infrequently, in stark disagreement with the data (blue curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030249-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The reason for this lack was that with increasing time lag to HVC<sub>RA</sub> spikes, stray RA bursts started to appear due to random transitions, leading to non-zero CSPs. This phenomenon was very robust as it was not possible to remedy the scarcity of zero CSPs by changing <italic>p</italic> and <italic>q.</italic> Note that the peak at unit CSP was unchanged by the introduction of random transitions, presumably because unit CSPs arose only at very small time lags away from HVC<sub>RA</sub> spikes and thus were not significantly affected by the random transitions. In conclusion, the inclusion of few nonsequential transitions leads to severe decorrelation of RA spikes a few tens of milliseconds away from HVC<sub>RA</sub> spikes and to shortage of very small CSPs; therefore, nonsequential transitions of HVC activity must be very rare during sleep. Note that by the same argument, we could also exclude the possibility that two or more HVC-activation sequences can coexist at the same time. If this were the case, then extreme CSPs would be rare, even more so than by relaxing sequential order or ultrasparseness.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Tests of RA Intrinsic Dynamics and Inhibition</title><p>In our model, RA neurons are simply driven by HVC<sub>RA</sub> bursts. To test for the possibility that RA burst sequences can be self-sustaining due to recurrent RA circuitry and in the absence of HVC drive, we performed model simulations in which after each transition into the ground state, RA burst sequences continued to propagate for a random duration uniformly distributed in the time interval 0–15 ms. By doing this, RA neurons produced less than 4% additional burst spikes compared to before. Despite this small addition of spikes, average CSP functions of RA–HVC<sub>I</sub> pairs became unrealistically heavy at negative time lags, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030249-g007">Figure 7</xref>A. This behavior was very robust, though it obviously depended on the estimated HVC<sub>RA</sub> spike propagation time <italic>t</italic><sub>R</sub> = 4 ms; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030249-b024">24</xref>]. To assess the relevance of RA intrinsic dynamics in a manner independent of spike-propagation estimates, we removed single spikes in RA neurons (these are spikes forming ISI pairs of more than 10 ms each). Thus-formed RA–HVC<sub>I</sub> CSP functions (with single RA spikes removed) displayed a high peak that in fact could not be reproduced with any set of model parameters <italic>p</italic> and <italic>q</italic> unless RA links were correlated with HVC<sub>I</sub> links (good agreement could be achieved when RA neurons were linked to 13 among the 56 HVC<sub>RA</sub> groups to which HVC<sub>I</sub> neurons were linked). Thus, rather than finding evidence for RA intrinsic dynamics, we found the contrary evidence that in order to explain the non-lagging and strong RA–HVC<sub>I</sub> correlations, RA neurons must be preferentially linked to and driven by the same HVC<sub>RA</sub> groups as are HVC<sub>I</sub> neurons.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030249-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030249.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>RA-Intrinsic Dynamics and Inhibition</title><p>(A) When RA burst sequences extend beyond HVC<sub>I</sub> sequences by a random time uniformly distributed in the interval 0–15 ms, then the left flank of the average RA–HVC<sub>I</sub> CSP function gets uncharacteristically wide (arrows).</p><p>(B) Transitive suppression of tonic firing in RA neurons is explained by RA inhibition. Shown are average RA IFR curves in 1.2 s time windows in which one RA neuron does not fire a burst, and time-aligned to burst onset in a simultaneously recorded RA neuron.

The key experimental observation is that right after sleep bursts, RA neurons do not immediately reenter the tonic firing mode, but that tonic firing recovers after an estimated recovery time of <italic>D</italic><sub>R</sub> = 240 ms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030249-sg001">Figure S1</xref>E).

A good fit was achieved using <italic>P</italic><sub>Inh</sub> = 0.1. Due to the nonspecificity of this inhibition, tonic RA firing was suppressed also when the recorded RA neuron did not burst, but some other RA neuron did. The situation was different when we modeled the reduced tonic firing by a soft refractory period with average duration <italic>D</italic><sub>R</sub> = 240 ms, in which case tonic RA firing was suppressed only after bursts. To distinguish between these two models, we inspected paired RA–neuron recordings for periods when one neuron burst, but the other did not. We then plotted the average instantaneous firing rate (IFR) of the nonbursting neurons, time-aligned to burst onsets. We found that in synchrony with the bursts, there was a brief dip in the IFR. The inhibition model was able to reproduce this phenomenon, but the adaptation model was not, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030249-g007">Figure 7</xref>B.

Current evidence indicates that HVC and RA burst epochs are shaped by a thalamic nucleus. Accordingly, the persistence probability <italic>p</italic> must depend on such extrinsic influences as well. We are more uncertain about the persistence probability <italic>q</italic> of the ground state. Songs of birds are initiated somewhere in the brain with the result of activating a particular HVC<sub>RA</sub> group. During sleep, initializing signals appear to originate in the NIf that projects to HVC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030249-b023">23</xref>]. The parameter <italic>q</italic> could thus represent vesicle release probability in synapses of HVC-projecting NIf neurons or of synapses (or excitability) within NIf.</p><p>An inherent assumption in our model is conditional independence of spike trains given a sequence of population states. This is a strong assumption, as it ignores the fact that cells spike more reliably when their afferents spike more reliably as well. As a consequence, we found that the model tended to underestimate some measured correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030249-g005">Figure 5</xref>F), yet the differences could be explained by assuming nonhomogeneity of link distributions. Possibly, by doing so, we have overestimated the tendency by which neurons link to preferred HVC<sub>RA</sub> groups; part of the high CSPs could be attributable to genuine pairwise interactions. To be able to estimate these interactions in future work, it will be necessary to simultaneously record from larger neuron populations. Our prediction would be that higher-order spike correlations must obey the regularities imposed by population-conditional spike-generation mechanisms. If this prediction turns out to be wrong and spike triplets appear more often than predicted, then we might have to revise our model by incorporating mutual dependencies of burst probabilities, which in essence corresponds to introducing higher-order spike correlations.</p><p>We were unable to characterize the HVC<sub>RA</sub> groups to which HVC<sub>I</sub> and RA neurons are linked with higher probability, but we speculate that preference applies to HVC<sub>RA</sub> groups that represent syllable onsets, in agreement with weak predictive correlations between song patterns and activity in HVC<sub>I</sub> and RA neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030249-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030249-b011">11</xref>]. These distinguished HVC<sub>RA</sub> groups could also be leaders that are preferentially activated in transition from the ground state. Such a scenario seems plausible given that syllable onsets are flexible song elements optimally aligned with global song tempo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030249-b025">25</xref>]. Insights into these questions could emerge from applications of our modeling approach to a set of HVC and NIf recordings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030249-b023">23</xref>]: because NIf projection neurons tend to burst in time intervals of 100 ms and more, their correlations with HVC neurons might provide evidence of regular spacing between leading HVC<sub>RA</sub> groups.</p><p>One of the benefits of our modeling approach compared to other approaches is increased simulation efficiency, because the time it takes to generate a model spike train is orders of magnitude shorter than for detailed biophysical models such as conductance-based integrate-and-fire neurons. Thanks to this efficiency, we were able to compare simulated data with real data to great detail, a task that usually becomes exhaustive in simulations of membrane biophysics. We have not hand-picked neurons for model comparison, but tested model predictions on data from all recorded cells and in all relevant behavioral states. Despite the many simplifications of our model, we believe it can be converted into the language of membrane voltages and synaptic potentials. For example, we have implicitly assumed that neurons are intrinsic bursters. It is known that intrinsic bursting can stabilize the propagation of synchronized activity in conductance-based model neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030249-b014">14</xref>]. One of the main difficulties would then be to find the appropriate conductance values that implement our estimates of burst probabilities and burst durations. In contrast, comparatively little effort would have to be made to compose synaptic weight matrices, as these are specified by our estimates of link statistics.</p><p>It might also be interesting to apply our approach to other neural systems. For example, in the insect olfactory system, odor processing is associated with stereotyped neural sequences in the antennal lobe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030249-b026">26</xref>]. Although the diversity of these sequences is thought to have the function of maximizing odor discriminability in downstream areas, it is currently not clear whether odor-evoked sequences are assembled from discrete states and constrained by a small number of state transitions, or whether an almost infinite number of possibilities applies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030249-b027">27</xref>]. Our approach would be ideally suited to explore such hypotheses.</p><p>Our findings suggest that all sleep-related bursts are in fact replay of song-evoked bursts, as each model sleep burst is clearly associated with one of 100 song-related activity states. Such similarity seems not surprising given that song- and sleep-related activity is generated by the same synaptic circuits. However, what could be the function of such randomized replay? We do not know the answer, but generative probabilistic models as ours have the advantage that they are closely related to some machine learning algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030249-b028">28</xref>].

During sleep, firing rates of burst spikes are typically lower than during singing (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030249-sg001">Figure S1</xref> for a comparison), suggesting a weakened synaptic drive during sleep.

By construction, spike trains restricted to time intervals [<italic>t</italic>, <italic>t</italic> + δ<italic><sub>t</sub></italic>] have renewal statistics, but because of frequent state switching of the HVC population, renewal statistics does not apply to large time intervals. All our simulations are performed with a unit time step of Δ<italic>t</italic> = 0.1 ms. For each simulated neuron, we generate spike trains between 2 min and 30 min duration.</p><p>The following additional assumptions about switching behavior produce good results: when a neuron switches from the tonic mode into the burst mode, we automatically set the first spike of the burst. However, if a neuron remains for two or more consecutive time steps in the burst mode, then we continue to sample the CIF without setting a spike at subsequent time steps (we set a spike only after a state switch).</p><p>To model reduced tonic firing in RA neurons after spike bursts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030249-sg001">Figure S1</xref>E), we incorporate an RA inhibitory mechanism into the model. We assume that in each song state, there is an (independent) probability <italic>P</italic><sub>Inh</sub> = 0.1 that a neuron experiences inhibitory input from RA interneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030249-b031">31</xref>]. Such inhibitory input lasts for a duration <italic>D</italic>, where <italic>D</italic> is randomly drawn from an exponential distribution with mean <italic>D</italic><sub>R</sub>. As long as an RA neuron receives inhibitory input, it does not produce tonic spikes (in contrast, RA neurons are allowed to fire burst spikes while subjected to inhibitory input). To test the validity of this inhibition model, we compare it to a different model in which tonic firing is reduced after bursts by means of burst-triggered spike-rate adaptation. That is, when an RA neuron switches into the tonic firing mode, no spike is fired until a random time delay <italic>D</italic> passes since the onset of the last burst, where <italic>D</italic> is again randomly drawn from an exponential distribution with mean <italic>D</italic><sub>R</sub>. Both models are able to explain burst-triggered firing adaptation in single RA neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030249-sg001">Figure S1</xref>E); however, only the inhibition model is able to correctly reproduce transitive firing suppression in RA pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030249-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Bursting in RA and HVC neurons is under tight control of input from Uva (unpublished observation).
