<abstract>
<p>Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), the causative agent of Kaposi’s sarcoma, encodes 25 mature viral miRNAs. MCP-1-induced protein-1 (MCPIP1), a critical regulator of immune homeostasis, has been shown to suppress miRNA biosynthesis via cleavage of precursor miRNAs through its RNase domain. We demonstrate that MCPIP1 can directly cleave KSHV and EBV precursor miRNAs and that MCPIP1 expression is repressed following de novo KSHV infection. In addition, repression with siRNAs to MCPIP1 in KSHV-infected cells increased IL-6 and KSHV miRNA expression, supporting a role for MCPIP1 in IL-6 and KSHV miRNA regulation. We also provide evidence that KSHV miRNAs repress MCPIP1 expression by targeting the 3’UTR of MCPIP1. Conversely, expression of essential miRNA biogenesis components Dicer and TRBP is increased following latent KSHV infection. We propose that KSHV infection inhibits a negative regulator of miRNA biogenesis (MCPIP1) and up-regulates critical miRNA processing components to evade host mechanisms that inhibit expression of viral miRNAs. KSHV-mediated alterations in miRNA biogenesis represent a novel mechanism by which KSHV interacts with its host and a new mechanism for the regulation of viral miRNA expression.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>A subset of viruses, including Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), encode microRNAs within their own genomes. We propose that the human host may possess strategies to repress viral microRNA biogenesis as an antiviral strategy by taking advantage of unique temporal features of viral microRNA biogenesis upon infection. We describe a human protein that can degrade microRNA precursor molecules from two different viruses. In this report, we identified strategies by which KSHV can evade this antiviral host response through alterations in the expression of its microRNA biogenesis factors. We found an inverse relationship between key microRNA biogenesis factors and inhibitors of microRNA stability after KSHV infection. KSHV-mediated alterations in microRNA biogenesis factor expression represent a novel mechanism by which KSHV interacts with its host and a mechanism for the regulation of viral microRNA expression.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV; HHV-8), is a γ-herpesvirus that is the causative agent of Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) in endothelial cells and two rare lymphoproliferative disorders, primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and multicentric Castleman’s disease (MCD). KS is an AIDS-defining malignancy and the most frequent cancer in many sub-Saharan countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref003">3</xref>]. It should be noted that the majority of infected cells in KS lesions are latently infected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (21–23 nt) noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally through translational repression and/or mRNA degradation. The KSHV genome encodes 12 pre-miRNAs that give rise to at least 18 mature viral miRNAs. In KSHV-associated cancers, a single KSHV miRNA can account for as much as 28% of all human and viral mature miRNAs within a cell and function to regulate host gene expression to promote the latent viral persistence, immune evasion, and tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Regardless of species of origin, most miRNAs are expressed and processed in similar fashion. Primary microRNAs (pri-miRNAs) are cleaved by the Drosha/DGCR8 complex to form hairpin precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs). Pre-miRNAs are then exported into the cytoplasm where they are further cleaved by the RNase III enzyme, Dicer. During processing and loading of mature miRNAs, Dicer collaborates with members of the Argonaute protein family (AGO1-4) and HIV-1 TAR-RNA Binding Protein (TARBP2 or TRBP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref008">8</xref>]. This intermediate complex is termed the miRNA RISC loading complex (miRLC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref009">9</xref>]. One strand representing the ~22 nt mature miRNA can then be loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), while Dicer and TRBP are released [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref009">9</xref>]. The miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) can then interact with target mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref010">10</xref>]. Due to the imperfect complementarity with which miRNAs bind to target sequence mRNAs, target prediction remains difficult.</p>
<p>MCP-1-induced protein-1 (MCPIP1 or Regnase-1) is part of the CCCH-zinc finger protein family that includes MCPIP1, 2, 3, and 4 and is encoded by four genes <italic>Zc3h12a</italic>, <italic>Zc3h12b</italic>, <italic>Zc3h12c</italic>, and <italic>Zc3h12d</italic>, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref011">11</xref>]. MCPIP1 is expressed in most tissues and can be induced in response to treatment with a number of proinflammatory molecules such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref013">13</xref>]. MCPIP1 has been described as a transcription factor and a RNase due to its PIN-like nuclease domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref014">14</xref>], which acts as a negative regulator of inflammation due to its ability to degrade the mRNA transcripts of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and IL-12p40 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref015">15</xref>]. Recently, MCPIP1 was suggested to be a broad suppressor of the miRNA biogenesis pathway by cleaving the terminal loops of pre-miRNAs leading to destabilization of pre-miRNAs and, ultimately, degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref016">16</xref>]. At the time of infection, most human miRNAs exist in the mature miRNA form in the RISC complex. However, incoming viral miRNAs are distinct because these viral miRNAs start at the beginning of the biogenesis pathway, which makes them more sensitive to MCPIP1 since it cleaves pre-miRNAs and not mature miRNAs.</p>
<p>In this report, we demonstrate that MCPIP1 can directly cleave human and viral pre-miRNAs and reduce mature miRNA levels. We identify MCPIP1 as a down-regulated gene following KSHV infection and a direct target of KSHV miRNAs. Conversely, Dicer and TRBP expression is increased following KSHV infection, which may promote increased amounts of the miRLC available for host and viral miRNAs. KSHV-mediated alterations in global miRNA biogenesis represent a novel mechanism by which KSHV evades an antagonizing host response.</p>

<title>MCPIP1 Cleaves Human and Viral Pre-miRNAs</title>
<p>MCPIP1 has previously been identified as an RNase and a suppressor of miRNA biogenesis that acts by cleaving the terminal loop of pre-miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref016">16</xref>]. To determine whether MCPIP1 can directly cleave viral pre-miRNAs in addition to endogenous human pre-miRNAs, we developed an in vitro cleavage assay that utilizes fluorescently labeled synthetic pre-miRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000998.s006">S1 Table</xref>) and recombinant MCPIP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000998.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). We found that MCPIP1 was able to efficiently cleave the fluorescently labeled precursor form of hsa-miR-135b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), as previously demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref016">16</xref>]. We hypothesized that viral miRNAs, which are processed identically to human miRNAs, may also be degraded by MCPIP1. In vitro cleavage assays revealed that labeled KSHV-mir-K12-3 and EBV-mir-BART15 pre-miRNAs were efficiently cleaved in the presence of MCPIP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). We found that the mutant MCPIP1, D141N [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref016">16</xref>], which lacks RNase activity, significantly inhibited degradation of both human and viral pre-miRNAs indicating that the RNase activity of MCPIP1 is responsible for cleavage of the pre-miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine if MCPIP1 can cleave KSHV pre-miRNAs within the context of a cellular environment, we transfected HEK293 cells with a KSHV miRNA expression vector and a MCPIP1 expression vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The miRNA expression was measured 72 hours post transfection. We observed a significant decrease in mature KSHV miRNA expression for a majority of the KSHV miRNAs measured when MCPIP1 is ectopically expressed as compared to the empty Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Furthermore, expression of the KSHV miRNA primary transcript from which the majority of the KSHV miRNAs originate remains unchanged in the presence of MCPIP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). And the viral pre-miRNA expression decreased dramatically in the presence of MCPIP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Together, these indicate that MCPIP1 is cleaving KSHV miRNAs at the pre-miRNA level and not affecting transcription of the clustered miRNA primary transcript. Expression of hsa-miR-135b is also significantly reduced in the presence of MCPIP1 while there is no decrease in pri-hsa-miR135b expression in concordance with Suzuki et al. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g002">Fig 2E and 2F</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref016">16</xref>]. A similar experiment with the MCPIP1 D141N mutant results in no decrease in mature KSHV miRNA expression levels, supporting our results from the in vitro cleavage assays (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g002">2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g001">1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000998.s002">S2A Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g002">Fig 2</xref>, we observed the difference in MCPIP1-mediated degradation of pre-miRNAs to be greater than the changes in mature miRNA expression. This is likely due to differences in miRNA stability. Mature miRNAs have a half-life of approximately 5 d when incorporated in the RISC complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref017">17</xref>], while pre-miRNAs are thought to have a shorter half-life more similar to mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref018">18</xref>]. In order to test the effects of repression of MCPIP1 in KSHV-infected cells, we used siRNAs to reduce MCPIP1 expression in the KSHV-infected B-cell line, BCBL-1, and found no change in mature miRNA expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000998.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). However, this assay is measuring expression of two classes of miRNAs: (1) miRNAs generated before and (2) miRNAs generated after MCPIP1 repression, and we next wanted to examine only newly transcribed miRNAs. In these assays, reduction of MCPIP1 using siRNA in BCBL-1 cells followed by purification of newly transcribed RNA transcripts showed increased expression of a majority of the mature KSHV miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g002">Fig 2H</xref>). These data demonstrate not only that reduced MCPIP1 expression increases mature miRNA levels, but that this effect is primarily due to MCPIP1-mediated effects on pre-miRNAs during miRNA biogenesis as opposed to mature RISC-associated miRNA.</p>
<p>Finally, MCPIP1 did not cleave all KSHV pre-miRNAs with the same efficiency. Although MCPIP1 appeared to cleave most of the KSHV pre-miRNAs, it did not effectively cleave KSHV-pre-mir-5 or 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g002">Fig 2I</xref>), which was consistent with the cellular assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Taken together, MCPIP1 in a purified system displays specificity for certain pre-miRNAs, but the determinants of specificity are currently unknown and require further investigation.</p>

<title>KSHV Infection Affects Expression of the miRNA Biogenesis Machinery</title>
<p>MCPIP1 expression is induced by a number of proinflammatory cytokines, many of which are known to play a role in KS biology and are up-regulated after KSHV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref019">19</xref>]. Accordingly, we found that IL-1β, TNFα, and tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK)—a member of the TNF superfamily—can induce MCPIP1 mRNA expression in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). In the absence of inducing stimuli, MCPIP1 expression is maintained at lower levels. Our previously published microarray dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref020">20</xref>] identified <italic>MCPIP1</italic> as a down-regulated gene following latent KSHV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>). We note this repression is likely to be more significant at sites of infections in humans where inflammatory cytokines are present and driving increased expression of MCPIP1. In contrast to MCPIP1, essential miRNA biogenesis genes Dicer and TRBP (TARBP2) were up-regulated after latent KSHV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). We validated these observations following latent KSHV infection in HUVECs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000998.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). We also evaluated expression of these key biogenesis factors in MC116.219, a human B lymphocyte cell line (MC116 cells) that was infected with rKSHV.219 and maintained in the latent phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref021">21</xref>]. We found that MCPIP1 mRNA expression is reduced in infected MC116.219 cells, while Dicer and TRBP expression were both increased upon KSHV infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000998.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). We found no significant changes in the expression of other key miRNA biogenesis proteins (Drosha, DGCR8, and Exportin 5) in the miRNA biogenesis pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). In conclusion, we observed alterations in expression of a number of miRNA biogenesis factors (MCPIP1, Dicer, TRBP) following KSHV infection in multiple relevant cell types.</p>

<title>KSHV miRNAs Target the MCPIP1 3’ UTR</title>
<p>Since a subset of mature viral miRNAs may enter the cells via virions or exosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref023">23</xref>], we hypothesized that one mechanism for reduced MCPIP1 expression immediately following KSHV infection may be through KSHV miRNAs targeting MCPIP1 mRNA directly. To determine the effect of KSHV miRNAs on MCPIP1 mRNA expression, individual miRNAs were transfected into HUVECs and MCPIP1 mRNA expression was determined by qPCR. Three KSHV miRNAs (KSHV-miR-4-5p, 6-3p, and 10a) resulted in decreased MCPIP1 mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Since miRNAs can silence genes through both mRNA degradation and translational repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref024">24</xref>], we also cloned the MCPIP1 3’UTR downstream of a luciferase reporter vector and transfected individual KSHV miRNAs into 293 cells along with the MCPIP1 luciferase reporter vector. KSHV miRs-1, 6-3p, and 7 demonstrated a statistically significant repression of a luciferase reporter containing the MCPIP1 3’ UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Unrelated miRNAs tested as controls showed no change in reporter activity. Furthermore, when we transfected the combination of KSHV-miRs-1, 6-3p, and 7 with the MCPIP1 3’ UTR reporter vector, we observed the strongest decrease in MCPIP1 reporter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). To investigate miRNA-mediated MCPIP1 repression in the context of KSHV infection, we inhibited KSHV-miRNAs-1, 6-3p, and 7 using locked nucleic acid inhibitors (LNAs) in BCBL-1 cells. We observed an increase in MCPIP1 expression following repression of this combination of KSHV miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Since multiple KSHV miRNAs are involved in the regulation of MCPIP1, we obtained iSLK mutant cells deleted for the KSHV miRNA cluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref025">25</xref>]. We found that expression of MCPIP1 was increased in the iSLK miRNA cluster mutant as compared to the wild type KSHV infected iSLK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g004">Fig 4E</xref>), highlighting the importance of KSHV miRNA expression in the down-regulation of MCPIP1 expression.</p>

<p>The miRNA target prediction program, miRanda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref026">26</xref>], identified a 7-mer m8 type KSHV-miR-1 potential target binding site in the MCPIP1 3’ UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g004">Fig 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000998.s007">S2 Table</xref>). Following the mutation of this predicted binding site, KSHV-miR-1 no longer repressed MCPIP1 3’ UTR reporter expression, while reporter plasmids with the KSHV-miR-1 mutation could still be repressed by KSHV-miR-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). Our results are supported by previous PAR-CLIP experiments that identified MCPIP1 (ZC3H12A) as a KSHV-miR-1 target in KSHV-infected BC-1 and BC-3 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref005">5</xref>]. Thus, not only is MCPIP1 a direct target of KSHV-miR-1 but this miRNA binding site is important for KSHV-miR-1 mediated repression of MCPIP1.</p>
<p>Although the miRanda program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref026">26</xref>] was unable to find any additional miRNA binding sites in the MCPIP1 3’ UTR, we found a potential KSHV-miR-7 target site using an alternative miRNA target prediction program. RNA hybrid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref027">27</xref>] identified a noncanonical KSHV-miR-7 potential target binding site with extensive 3’ pairing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g004">Fig 4G</xref>). We mutated either the 5’ miRNA region (mut1) or the 3’ target site (mut2) and observed that KSHV-miR-7 could no longer repress either of these reporter constructs indicating that both of these interactions are critical for KSHV-miR-7 directed MCPIP1 repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g004">Fig 4G</xref>). While we could identify a few potential KSHV-miR-6-3p binding sites within the MCPIP1 3’ UTR, we observed little repression in the presence of KSHV-miR-6-3p. Therefore, we separated the MCPIP1 3’ UTR sequence into three segments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000998.s008">S3 Table</xref>). We determined that the KSHV-miR-6-3p binding site is within nucleotides 509–763 of the MCPIP1 3’ UTR along with the KSHV-miR-1 site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g004">Fig 4H</xref>). We additionally analyzed MCPIP1 protein expression after transfection with KSHV miRNA mimics and found a correlation between repression of the luciferase reporters and repression of endogenous MCPIP1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g004">Fig 4I</xref>). Together, we were able to validate MCPIP1 as an mRNA target for KSHV miRNAs and demonstrate that these viral miRNAs can reduce MCPIP1 expression.</p>

<title>Increased Expression of miRNA Biogenesis Components Dicer and TRBP after KSHV Infection</title>
<p>As opposed to MCPIP1, we also demonstrated an increase in Dicer expression following de novo KSHV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g003">Fig 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000998.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Additionally, previously published data showed an increase in Dicer mRNA levels following transfection with a combination of 16 KSHV miRNA mimics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref028">28</xref>]. This suggests that the up-regulation of Dicer expression is partially due to the expression of KSHV miRNAs. Therefore, we transfected individual KSHV miRNAs into HUVECs and determined the expression of Dicer at both the mRNA and protein level. Focusing on miRNAs that increased Dicer expression (in accordance with our de novo infection data), we found that KSHV-miR-2 and 5 resulted in up-regulation in Dicer levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g005">Fig 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000998.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Further, KSHV-miR-2 and 5 were also able to increase expression of the miRLC component and Dicer binding partner, TARBP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Deletion of the KSHV miRNA cluster in the iSLK ΔmiRNA mutant cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref025">25</xref>] resulted in decreased expression of Dicer and TRBP as compared to the wild type KSHV infected iSLK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that KSHV miRNAs are involved in the regulation of Dicer and TRBP expression. The increase in expression of Dicer and TRBP is likely through repression of an inhibitor of these genes, since miRNAs are generally found to repress gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref029">29</xref>].</p>

<p>AU-binding factor-1 (AUF1), also known as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D (hnRNP D) lowers Dicer mRNA stability resulting in a reduction of Dicer abundance and mature miRNA expression levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref030">30</xref>]. We have observed decreased expression of AUF1 following de novo KSHV infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000998.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). This suggests that latent viral gene products may stimulate Dicer expression by repressing AUF1 and likely additional repressors.</p>
<p>In addition to KSHV-miRs-2 and 5 that up-regulate Dicer expression, we have also observed increased Dicer expression following the down-regulation of MCPIP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000998.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Conversely, the knockdown of Dicer has no effect on MCPIP1 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000998.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). MCPIP1 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) also express more Dicer at both the RNA and protein level as compared to WT MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). Addition of a MCPIP1 expression vector back into the MCPIP1 -/- MEFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000998.s004">S4 Fig</xref>) was able to rescue the phenotype and restore Dicer expression to wild type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). These data reveal that expression of KSHV miRNA-2 and 5, or separately, repression of MCPIP1 can increase Dicer expression. This suggests two different and distinct mechanisms for the observed increase in Dicer expression following KSHV infection.</p>

<p>Expression of essential miRNA biogenesis players Dicer and TRBP are increased following latent KSHV infection, suggesting an increase in the core components of the miRNA loading complex (miRLC) that is available for miRNA processing.

This may suggest an increase in miRLC formation that could allow increased loading of mature miRNAs into RISC as they move through the biogenesis pathway due to increased amounts of the intermediate miRLC available as well as an increased stability of miRNAs as they are incorporated into the final RISC complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref032">32</xref>].

<title>MCPIP1 Is Repressed by KSHV Infection in the Presence of Stimulating Cytokine, IL-1β</title>

<title>MCPIP1 Degrades Target mRNA and Viral miRNAs following KSHV Infection</title>
<p>Infection with KSHV up-regulates IL-6 expression, a known autocrine growth factor for KS cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref033">33</xref>]. In contrast, MCPIP1 destabilizes IL-6 through its RNase activity, targeting a stem loop structure within the IL-6 3’ UTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref034">34</xref>]. To determine the consequences of MCPIP1 loss of function in the context of KSHV infection, MCPIP1 was repressed with siRNAs in KSHV positive BCBL-1 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000998.s005">S5 Fig</xref>) followed by IL-1β treatment for 24 h. We found that induction of IL-6 by IL-1β was stronger when MCPIP1 was repressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). These data demonstrate that reduced MCPIP1 expression can relieve the MCPIP1-mediated reduction of its mRNA target, IL-6, in the presence of a stimulating cytokine, IL-1β. Conversely, we determined the effect of induced MCPIP1 expression in the context of de novo KSHV infection. A doxycycline-inducible transgene harboring the coding sequence of MCPIP1 fused to GFP was introduced in HEK293TRex cells. GFP-MCPIP1 was induced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000998.s005">S5 Fig</xref>) followed by KSHV infection. Overexpression of MCPIP1 in the presence of KSHV infection results in significantly decreased levels of IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g007">Fig 7C</xref>).</p>
<p>We also measured expression of both human and viral mature miRNAs in MCPIP1-induced 293 cells infected with KSHV. While the expression of multiple human miRNAs remained unchanged after MCPIP1 induction, expression of mature hsa-miR-135b was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). In contrast to many of the human miRNAs, we found that increased MCPIP1 expression resulted in significantly lower levels of many KSHV miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g007">Fig 7E</xref>). We also observed increased LANA expression and a decrease in some lytic genes, ORF69 and K14 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000998.s005">S5C Fig</xref>), suggesting that MCPIP1 expression can have consequences to viral protein-encoding genes as well. Together, this data shows that modulation of MCPIP1 in the context of KSHV infection can result in significant changes in expression for its mRNA and miRNA targets and supports a role for MCPIP1 in KSHV pathogenesis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>While MCPIP1 cleaves both human and viral pre-miRNAs, there appears to be some level of specificity that remains unclear (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g002">2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g007">7D and 7E</xref>). We hypothesize that this could include a number of different possibilities including: (1) MCPIP1 cleaves pre-miRNA and not mature miRNAs, (2) some pre-miRNAs are sensitive to MCPIP1 while others are not, and (3) steady state expression of host miRNA (as mature miRNA incorporated into RISC has a half-life of 5 d [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref017">17</xref>]) as compared to newly synthesized viral miRNA. At the time of infection, most human miRNAs exist in the mature miRNA form in the RISC complex. However, incoming viral miRNAs are distinct, because these viral miRNAs start at the beginning of the biogenesis pathway, which makes them more sensitive to MCPIP1 since it cleaves pre-miRNAs, but not mature miRNAs. Recent work by Mino et al. showed that MCPIP1 recognizes and degrades transcriptionally active mRNA targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref035">35</xref>]. Together with our data, this suggests that reduced MCPIP1 expression increases mature miRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g002">Fig 2H</xref>) and is primarily due to MCPIP1-mediated effects during miRNA biogenesis as opposed to mature RISC-associated miRNA. An additional consideration to explain differences in MCPIP1-mediated cleavage efficiency of pre-miRNAs includes differences in nuclear transport. However, the correlation between the amount of MCPIP1-mediated degradation of specific pre-miRNAs in our cell-free assays (without transport considerations) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g001">Fig 1</xref> and cellular assays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g002">Fig 2</xref> suggests that this is not the case, at least for the viral miRNAs that we investigated. Additionally, we observed MCPIP1-mediated repression of miRNAs from eight of the ten KSHV pre-miRNAs, with some of these pre-miRNAs from all three levels of expression (high, moderate, and low) in the O'Hara et al. pre-miRNA expression data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref018">18</xref>]. The two pre-miRNAs that were resistant to MCPIP1 degradation, -K5 and -K6, were from two classes of expression (moderate and low). Taken together, these data suggest that there is not a strong correlation between pre-miRNA expression and sensitivity to MCPIP1 degradation. Further investigation of MCPIP1 cleavage targets and specificity will yield interesting insights into MCPIP1 specificity.</p>
<p>In addition to pre-miRNAs, MCPIP1 is reported to regulate expression of many proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g007">Fig 7</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref015">15</xref>]. Recently, Mino et al. showed that MCPIP1 recognizes and degrades transcriptionally active mRNA targets through stem loop structures within the 3’ UTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref035">35</xref>]. Although increased IL-6 expression may initially seem to benefit only the host immune system, multiple studies have shown that IL-6 has beneficial properties to KSHV infection. Human IL-6 can promote growth of KSHV-infected PEL cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref036">36</xref>] and AIDS-KS-derived cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref033">33</xref>]. In addition, KSHV has evolved to express its own IL-6 homolog, viral IL-6 (ORF-K2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref037">37</xref>], and a latently expressed protein, LANA, can promote expression of IL-6 (PMID: 11781250). Elevated human IL-6 levels also correlate with increased KSHV viral load and worse clinical outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref038">38</xref>]. These results suggest that KSHV-mediated control of MCPIP1 and IL-6 expression can benefit KSHV infection.</p>
<p>In this study, we report that KSHV infection inhibits MCPIP1, a negative regulator of miRNA biogenesis, and up-regulates critical miRNA processing components Dicer and TRBP to evade host mechanisms that inhibit expression of viral miRNAs. We suggest that this is a complex interaction between the host immune defense and the virus. MCPIP1 is a potent regulator of the innate immune response and possesses antiviral activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref041">41</xref>]. MCPIP1 was previously found to target multiple viral RNA species including hepatitis C virus (HCV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DEN) and HIV resulting in decreased steady states levels of the viral RNA due to its RNase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref042">42</xref>]. Conversely, the virus wants to repress any host defenses that down-regulate viral RNAs to allow for viral replication, viral dissemination, or persistent viral infection. Multiple pieces of evidence suggest that MCPIP1 may inhibit miRNA biogenesis during other viral infections as well. EBV is a γ-herpesvirus that is related to KSHV and expresses its own viral miRNAs. Similar to our findings, a recent paper found that EBV-infected proliferating B cells exhibit a significant repression of MCPIP1 compared to EBV-negative purified adult human CD19+ peripheral blood B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref043">43</xref>]. In addition to the KSHV miRNAs reported here that target the MCPIP1 3’ UTR, miRanda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000998.ref026">26</xref>] predicts four EBV miRNAs including EBV-miR-BART8-5p, BART8-3p, BART10-5p, and BART11-5p that may target the MCPIP1 3’UTR resulting in repression. In this report, we focused on changes to miRNA biogenesis factors mediated by viral miRNAs, but it is also possible that latent viral proteins and virally induced changes in host mRNAs and miRNAs could also help establish a favorable environment for viral miRNA biogenesis. Further studies are required to elucidate if simultaneous repression of MCPIP1 and induction of miRNA pathway components is a common strategy of viruses that encode miRNAs to ensure biogenesis of their viral miRNAs and counteract the host defense.</p>
<p>One possible model for the KSHV-mediated changes observed in the miRNA biogenesis pathway is represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000998.g007">Fig 7E</xref>. It is likely that both the repression of inhibitory miRNA biogenesis factors and the induction of productive biogenesis factors are important for KSHV infection and the production and expression of viral miRNAs. We propose that KSHV inhibits MCPIP1 and up-regulates Dicer to evade host mechanisms of inhibiting expression of foreign miRNAs. We inspected PAR-CLIP data for cellular genes that may reveal mechanisms of miRNA-mediated changes in Dicer1 expression. We first searched the literature for reported repressors of Dicer1 (CALCOCO2, PIWIL1, DDB1, and CASP3). We searched PAR-CLIP hits for these genes and did not find any KSHV miRNA hits for PIWIL1 or DDB1. We did find KSHV miRNA hits for CALCOCO2 (miR-K10A) and CASP3 (miR-K1, -K3, -K4-3p), but not for miR-K2 or miR-K5. This current report aims to provide insight into the comprehensive understanding of miRNA processing in the context of KSHV infection. KSHV-mediated alterations in miRNA biogenesis factors represent a novel mechanism by which KSHV interacts with its host, and a new mechanism for the regulation of miRNA expression. Our results suggest that this may be part of a general viral response to overcome host defense mechanisms.</p>

<p>MC116 and MC116.219 cells were a generous gift from Stephen Dollery and Edward Berger. The Dox-inducible GFP-MCPIP1 HEK293 cells were a generous gift from Tianyi Wang. MCPIP -/-, and WT MEFs were a generous gift from Pappachan E. Kolattukudy and Zhaohui Wu. Recombinant MCPIP1 protein was generated by Jane Jones at Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc. KSHV mRNA qPCR primers and KSHV pre-miRNA primer sequences were obtained from Dirk Dittmer. A mutant KSHV variant that lacks the majority of KSHV miRNAs was generously provided by Rolf Renne. Finally, we would like to acknowledge Anna Serquiña, Astrid Haase, Shou Gu and Robert Yarchoan for their insight and critical reading of this manuscript.</p>
