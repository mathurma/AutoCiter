      <abstract>
        <p>Of the membrane proteins of known structure, we found that a remarkable 67% of the water soluble domains are structurally similar to water soluble proteins of known structure. Moreover, 41% of known water soluble protein structures share a domain with an already known membrane protein structure. We also found that functional residues are frequently conserved between extramembrane domains of membrane and soluble proteins that share structural similarity. These results suggest membrane and soluble proteins readily exchange domains and their attendant functionalities. The exchanges between membrane and soluble proteins are particularly frequent in eukaryotes, indicating that this is an important mechanism for increasing functional complexity. The high level of structural overlap between the two classes of proteins provides an opportunity to employ the extensive information on soluble proteins to illuminate membrane protein structure and function, for which much less is known. To this end, we employed structure guided sequence alignment to elucidate the functions of membrane proteins in the human genome. Our results bridge the gap of fold space between membrane and water soluble proteins and provide a resource for the prediction of membrane protein function. A database of predicted structural and functional relationships for proteins in the human genome is provided at sbi.postech.ac.kr/emdmp.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Membrane proteins play important roles in cellular communication and molecular transport. However, experimental difficulties and lack of structural information have limited the functional characterization of membrane proteins. In this study, we find that over 60% of the extramembrane domains were structurally related to proteins of known structure. The exchanges between membrane and soluble proteins are particularly frequent in eukaryotes, indicating that this is an important mechanism for increasing functional complexity. This result has important implications for the evolution of membrane and soluble proteins. Beyond that, it provides a previously untapped resource for predicting the functions of many membrane proteins without a known function. Based on these results, we provide a new database of predicted functional and structural overlaps for all membrane proteins in the human genome.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The structural space of soluble proteins has been extensively explored. Indeed, most single-domain soluble proteins now appear to have at least one structural homolog in the current PDB database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-Kihara1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-Skolnick1">[2]</xref>. In contrast, the exploration of membrane protein fold space lags far behind <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-White1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-White2">[5]</xref>. Moreover, much more work has been directed at soluble proteins, so functional annotations are much more extensive for soluble proteins as well.</p>
      <p>Membrane proteins reside in a hydrophobic lipid-bilayer, but their extra-membrane regions are exposed to same folding environment as soluble proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-White2">[5]</xref>. Thus, fold space of membrane proteins may be connected with soluble proteins through the extra-membrane portions. Indeed, many membrane proteins contain large extracellular domains that can be separated from the membrane embedded domain and they behave as stable soluble proteins. We therefore examined how much overlap exists between the structure spaces of soluble proteins and membrane proteins. If there is extensive domain sharing, it may be possible to use the vast data on soluble proteins to provide information on their membrane protein relatives.</p>
      <p>Here, we used a large-scale structure comparison to explore domain sharing between membrane and soluble proteins. We found that: <italic>(i)</italic> a large fraction of membrane proteins share structural similarities with soluble proteins, <italic>(ii)</italic> the domain exchanges between membrane and soluble proteins are particularly frequent in eukaryotes, <italic>(iii)</italic> in many cases, residues in functional sites are conserved between membrane and soluble protein pairs. These results imply that we can use the extensive knowledge of soluble protein function, to infer previously uncharacterized membrane protein functions. We therefore employed structure guided sequence alignment to elucidate the functions of membrane proteins in the human proteome.</p>

      <sec id="s2a">
        <title>The fold space of membrane and soluble proteins is highly connected</title>
        <p>We compared the structures of the extramembrane domains of 558 membrane proteins with 43,547 soluble protein structure in the PDB by using TM-align <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-Zhang1">[6]</xref> which is a suitable tool for large-scale structural comparisons. We found that structure comparison results from various tools were similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002997.s001">Figure S1A and S1B</xref>), but TM-align was faster than other structure alignment programs. Domain structures were considered to be similar if the RMSD was less than 5 Å over an aligned length of more than 100 residues, and a confidence score of more than 0.5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-Zhang1">[6]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In the current PDB library, 67% (376) of the membrane proteins share a domain structure with soluble proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002997-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Moreover, 41% (17,858) of soluble proteins share structural similarity with the already known membrane protein structures. The structurally similar membrane and soluble proteins have a mean RMSD of 3.9 Å and a mean aligned length of 162 residues. Furthermore, we found that a large fraction of non-redundant membrane protein structures shared extramembrane domains with soluble proteins. We applied PISCES <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-Wang1">[7]</xref> with sequence identity threshold 30% to remove the redundant sequences. Among the 160 non-redundant membrane protein structures, 68% (106) of membrane proteins share extramembrane domains with soluble proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002997.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

        <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002997-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, the distribution of structural relatives is skewed toward distant relationships with low sequence identity. Thus, most of these relationships would have been undetectable by sequence methods alone, which explains why the high degree of overlap between membrane and soluble protein structures has not been previously observed to our knowledge. The structure alignment data between membrane and soluble proteins are available at: sbi.postech.ac.kr/emdmp. In the web-server, users can search membrane and soluble proteins by PDB ids or Pfam domains and download all structure alignment results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002997.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
        <p>We found that majority of globular domains shared between membrane and soluble proteins are located at the ‘outside’ region of membrane proteins. We mapped the topology information (i.e. inside and outside regions) onto membrane protein structures aligned with soluble proteins. Among the 376 membrane protein structures, we found that 95.7% (360) structures are located at the ‘outside’ region, whereas only 4.3% (16) structures are located at the ‘inside’ region, suggesting that domain exchange were much more frequent at the outside region of membrane proteins. Interestingly, structures located at the outside region of membrane proteins had larger alignment than structures of inside region. Shared domains located at the outside region have a mean aligned length of 163 residues, whereas domains located at the inside region have a mean aligned length of 116 residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002997.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>
        <p>The extramembrane domains that have soluble counterpart appear to be less intimately associated with the membrane or membrane embedded domains. To assess the degree of membrane association, we determined the average membrane distance of extramembrane domain, measured by the z-coordinate information from PDBTM database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-Kozma1">[8]</xref> (detailed description in Material and Methods section). The average membrane distance of extramembrane domains that have soluble counterpart was 25.9 Å, whereas the distance without soluble counterpart was 20.7 Å (<italic>p</italic>-value = 0.0088, Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002997.s005">Figure S5</xref>). This result may reflect the more facile exchange of domains that are not deeply entwined within the membrane protein structure.</p>
        <p>The structural relatives do not appear to be restricted to any particular type of fold as they span many SCOP classes, including all alpha, all beta, alpha+beta and alpha/beta classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002997-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The aligned pairs share 352 different fold types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002997.s017">Table S1</xref>) which is roughly a quarter of the 1,200 total fold types in SCOP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-Andreeva1">[9]</xref>. These results indicate that diverse fold types performing various biological functions are shared between membrane and soluble proteins.</p>

        <p>We conducted a comprehensive gene ontology analysis for 29% membrane proteins that have no counterpart in the soluble proteins. It turned out that these membrane proteins were GPCRs families and sensory receptors families (G-proteins coupled receptor protein signaling pathway; <italic>p</italic> = 6.78e-54, sensory perception of chemical stimulus; <italic>p</italic> = 3.15e-49, sensory perception of smell; <italic>p</italic> = 6.58e-48) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002997.s018">Table S2</xref>). They usually have short extra-membrane regions and tend not to share globular domains with soluble proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-Wallin1">[10]</xref>.</p>

        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002997-g003">Figure 3A</xref> shows the distribution of sequence identities between soluble and membrane proteins grouped into archaea, bacterial and eukaryotes. High sequence identities reveal the soluble/membrane domain exchanges that occurred relatively recently in evolutionary history. The high sequence identities are dominated by eukaryotes, suggesting that many of the soluble/membrane protein exchanges in eukaryotes are relatively new developments. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002997-g003">Figure 3B</xref> compares sequence identity distributions according to their functional ontologies. The basal cellular functions have the lowest sequence identities between membrane and soluble proteins, consistent with their ancient origin, whereas the more complex functions associated with eukaryotic organisms have higher sequence identities. These results suggest that as life became more complex, recombination of membrane and soluble proteins became more common and important.</p>

        <title>Can soluble protein annotations be used to illuminate membrane protein function?</title>
        <p>Proteins that share similar domain structures often have similar functions even with very low sequence similarity. For example, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and acetylcholine-binding protein, which both bind acetylcholine, are found to share a domain that aligned with 2.94 Å RMSD over 173 residues, but shares only 17.3% sequence identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002997-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-Smit1">[11]</xref>. The chloride intracellular channel and glutathione S-transferase (GST) can be aligned with 3.43 Å RMSD over 159 residues, but share only 2.9% sequence identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002997-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Both proteins share a glutathione S-transferase function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-Fanucchi1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-Littler1">[14]</xref>. Thus, structural similarity can often suggest a functional similarity that cannot always be detected by sequence similarity. It therefore seems possible, given the extensive domain sharing noted above, to learn more about membrane protein functions by employing the annotations available for soluble proteins.</p>

        <p>The soluble protein knowledge base could provide a rich source of information for membrane proteins as soluble proteins have generally been studied more extensively. Consistent with this history, only 26% of membrane protein domains that we found to align to soluble domains have annotated biochemical functions (109 of 414 proteins). In contrast, 72% (13,044 of 17,972 proteins) of soluble proteins that share domain structure with membrane proteins have domain annotation in the aligned regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002997-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>
        <p>A common structure does not always imply a common function, however, so we examined the degree to which functional annotations might be transferrable from soluble proteins to membrane protein extracellular domains. To test the possibility of functional overlaps, we asked whether residues known to be critical for function were conserved in the structurally aligned pairs. For proteins with catalytic residues defined in the Catalytic Site Atlas (CSA) database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-Porter1">[15]</xref> we found that 56% (114 of 211 proteins) of aligned structures share identical functional residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002997-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). For example, the functional residues of bovine heart phosphotyrosyl phosphatase (soluble protein) are found to be conserved in envelope structure-factor (membrane protein), although their sequence identity is only 4.7% over 116 residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002997-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Bovine heart phosphotyrosyl phosphatase has a tyrosine phosphatase domain with the catalytic site residues, Cys12 and Cys17. Envelope structure-factor currently has no domain annotation, but the conserved catalytic sites as well as the aligned domain structures suggest that they may share a general biochemical function. Also, Penicillin-binding protein (membrane protein) and Oxa-10 β-lactamase (soluble protein) share identical functional residues although they only share 13.2% overall sequence identity over 218 residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002997-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Both apparently interact with β-lactam antibiotics. These results suggest that structure-guided alignments between membrane and soluble proteins can be useful for inferring unknown functions of extra-membrane domains.</p>

        <p>We analyzed sequence identity of the first and second shell residues around the common functional sites compared to the rest of the residues. We defined the first shell residues as those within a distance of 5 Å of a known functional residue. The second shell residues were defined as the group of residues within 5 Å from the first shell residues. Sequence similarity scores were calculated using a PAM-250 matrix with the gap penalty of −11. We found that the first and second shell residues showed higher sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002997.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Among the 471 structure pairs of membrane and soluble proteins, 412 structure pairs have higher sequence similarity at the first and second shell residues than other regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002997.s019">Table S3</xref>). For example, the first and second shell residues around common functional sites of envelope structure-factor (1BHY) and bovine heart phosphotyrosyl phosphatase (1PNT) have higher sequence similarity than the rest of the residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002997.s007">Figure S7A</xref>). The first and second shell residues of functional sites have a sequence similarity score of 123, whereas other residues have a sequence similarity score of 51.3. Also, the first and second shell residues of the functional sites of penicillin-binding protein (1K25) and Oxa-10 β-lactamase (1E4D) had higher sequence similarity than the rest of the residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002997.s007">Figure S7</xref>).</p>
        <p>We compared the functional annotations of membrane and soluble protein domains that share conserved functional residues. We discovered that 41% (28) of membrane protein domains share same the functional annotations with soluble domains and 31% (21) of membrane protein domains do not have functional annotation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002997.s008">Figure S8</xref>). Thus, these membrane protein functions can be inferred from the functional annotation of soluble proteins. But, 26% (18) of membrane protein domains turned out to have ambiguous functional annotations whose annotation were dissimilar but somewhat related. For example, membrane protein 1NRF has been annotated as beta-Lactamase/D-ala carboxypeptidase and soluble counterpart 2G2U has been annotated as beat-lactamase-inhibitor protein. We provide the list of functional annotation of membrane and soluble protein domains that share common functional residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002997.s020">Table S4</xref>)</p>
        <p>We examined how frequently shared domains between membrane and soluble proteins were found from same SCOP folds. Of 87 structurally similar domains, 60 (68.9%) extramembrane domains and soluble protein domain shared same SCOP folds, whereas 27 (31.1%) domains appeared in different SCOP folds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002997.s009">Figure S9A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002997.s021">Table S5</xref>). The number of fold types annotated for membrane proteins is much smaller than that of soluble proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002997.s009">Figure S9B</xref>). Specifically, structural pairs that share same SCOP fold were usually found from the extramembrane regions of membrane proteins. Meanwhile, structural pairs with different SCOP folds were mostly found from fold annotations assigned to whole membrane protein structures including both transmembrane and extramembrane regions.</p>
        <p>We examined what kinds of membrane protein functions can be inferred from our work and to what extent. We classified membrane protein functions into 3 large families, such as receptors, transporters and enzymes, and divided into 16 sub families. We found that extramembrane domains shared between membrane and soluble proteins were mainly found from the enzyme family. Specifically, about 50% of the enzyme family of membrane proteins shares extramembrane domains with soluble counterparts, whereas less than 25% of the receptor family shares extramembrane domains with soluble counterparts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002997.s010">Figure S10</xref>). It suggests that function of membrane proteins in the enzyme family can be more likely inferred from the structural comparisons with soluble counterparts.</p>

        <title>Structure-guided sequence alignment of membrane and soluble proteins</title>
        <p>The results described above indicate that membrane and soluble proteins extensively exchange domains and that soluble domain annotations can be useful for suggesting functions of the membrane domains. There are relatively few membrane protein structures, however, and the vast majority of structurally related proteins show little detectable sequence similarity. We therefore sought to expand the utility of the soluble domain structure database using both sequence and structural information.</p>
        <p>To detect distant relationships that are not apparent by sequence similarity alone, we employed the secondary structure element alignment method (SSEA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-Fontana1">[16]</xref>. To test the effectiveness of the SSEA method for detecting distant relationships and to identify appropriate cutoffs, we generated training sets. A positive set included 923 similar membrane and soluble protein structures with less than 5 Å RMSD and sequence identity ranging from 5 to 15%. The negative set included 210 dissimilar structure pairs with greater than 10 Å RMSD and sequence identity ranging from 5 to 15%. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002997-g006">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>, the SSEA method can effectively separate the two training sets at an SSEA score of 50 (<italic>P</italic>-value&lt;1.0×10<sup>−100</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-Fontana1">[16]</xref>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our results show that membrane proteins quite commonly acquire or share functions by domain exchange with soluble proteins. There has been a controversy over whether membrane or soluble proteins have emerged first during evolution and several reports support the idea that membrane proteins may have come first <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-Doi1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-Tolstoguzov1">[19]</xref>. They argue that membrane proteins require less extensive sequence optimization for folding than soluble proteins because they reside in a more restrictive membrane environment. However, we suggest that the evolutionary paths of membrane proteins might be more diverse. For example, we found that a soluble protein, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, exists in all three kingdoms, whereas the membrane form of HMG-CoA reductase only exists in eukaryotic species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002997.s014">Figure S14A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-JordanStarck1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-Lam1">[21]</xref>. This suggests that the evolutionary origin of HMG-CoA reductase may be a soluble form and the membrane form was created by acquiring transmembrane domains. Alternatively, the membrane variants in prokaryotes could have been lost at some point in evolution. On the other hand, acetylcholine-binding proteins may have emerged from eukaryotic species by losing the transmembrane domains of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002997-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors exist in all three kingdoms, but acetylcholine-binding proteins only exist in eukaryotes. Thus, it seems reasonable to suggest that membrane and soluble proteins exchange domains and functionalities in both directions over the course of evolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002997.s014">Figure S14B</xref>). The fact that the more recent exchanges have occurred in eukaryotes suggests that this became a particularly important evolutionary mechanism as life became more complex.</p>
      <p>Regardless of the evolutionary origins, it is clear that many membrane and soluble proteins share structural similarity. Similar folds do not always imply similar function, but in many cases, structural similarities of proteins have been used to discover functional similarities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-Brylinski1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-Whisstock1">[25]</xref>. This is based on the notion that sequence and structure similarities between gene products infer functional similarities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-Punta1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-Wolfson1">[28]</xref>. We can therefore utilize structural and functional information obtained from one class to report on the other.</p>

        <title>Pair-wise structure comparisons between membrane and soluble proteins</title>
        <p>We compared structure pairs of membrane and soluble proteins using TM-align, a structure comparison algorithm which uses dynamic programming and alignment confidence score rotation matrix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-Zhang1">[6]</xref>. TM-align is a suitable tool for large-scale structural comparisons. The calculation time of TM-align was faster than other structure alignment programs, such as CE and DALI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-Holm1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-Shindyalov1">[31]</xref>. The average CPU time per pair by TM-align was 0.3s, which was 40 time faster than CE (<italic>P</italic>-value = 1.65e-56, <italic>t</italic>-test). For the calculation, we randomly selected structure pairs of membrane and soluble proteins 1,000 times. Calculations were performed on 2.66 GHz hexa core CPU LINUX machine. We compared structural superimposition of TM-align with other tools by using 10,000 random pairs between membrane and soluble proteins. We found that CE and DALI gave equivalent results of structural alignments compared with TM-align. Particularly, RMSD values from each tool are highly correlated for the same structure pairs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002997.s001">Figure S1A and S1B</xref>).</p>
        <p>We applied a strict cutoff of RMSD, aligned length, and alignment confidence score to select only significantly aligned structure pairs between membrane and soluble proteins. Structure pairs with RMSD&lt;5 Å, aligned length &gt;100 residues, and alignment confidence score (TM-score) &gt;0.5 were selected. Structural alignments of relatively shorter sequence (less than 100 residues) gave somewhat dissimilar results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002997.s001">Figure S1C and S1D</xref>) when we applied different tools. Thus, we chose aligned length &gt;100 residues as a length threshold. These selection criteria have been found to filter out dissimilar structures in other high-throughput structural comparison studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-Kihara1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-Zhang1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-Zhang2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-Zhang3">[33]</xref>. We applied PDBTM database to measure whether structural similarity occurred in the extramembrane or transmembrane regions of membrane proteins. Membrane proteins that shared structural similarity within transmembrane region were removed. Furthermore, structure pairs that have several disconnected extramembrane loops were removed since these short loops cannot act as independent domains. We mapped the topology information (i.e. inside and outside regions) of membrane proteins onto the structural alignment results using TMHMM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-Krogh1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-Moller1">[35]</xref>.

Secondary structures of membrane and soluble proteins were predicted by PSIPRED <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002997-Jones1">[38]</xref>. To set a reliable cut-off value for the structural comparisons, we evaluated SSEA score based on a positive and a negative set. The positive set includes structure pairs of membrane and soluble proteins with &lt;5 Å RMSD and sequence identity range from 5 to 15%. The negative set includes dissimilar structure pairs of membrane and soluble proteins with &gt;10 Å RMSD and sequence identity range from 5 to 15%. We selected 100 pairs from each positive and negative set by random sampling. We compared the SSEA score of these pairs from each group and repeated the process 1,000 times. We found that SSEA score of 50 works best for separating the positive set from the negative set (<italic>P</italic>-value&lt;1.0×10<sup>−100</sup>; Figure 6AB). Furthermore, we analyzed the correlation between SSEA score and the probability of finding structure pairs with RMSD &lt;5 Å (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002997.s011">Figure S11</xref>). To calculate the probability, we randomly selected 10,000 structure pairs of membrane and soluble proteins from all ranges of RMSD values.
