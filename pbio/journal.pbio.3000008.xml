<abstract>
<p>The threat of viral pandemics demands a comprehensive understanding of evolution at the host–pathogen interface. Here, we show that the accessibility of adaptive mutations in influenza nucleoprotein at fever-like temperatures is mediated by host chaperones. Particularly noteworthy, we observe that the Pro283 nucleoprotein variant, which (1) is conserved across human influenza strains, (2) confers resistance to the Myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) restriction factor, and (3) critically contributed to adaptation to humans in the 1918 pandemic influenza strain, is rendered unfit by heat shock factor 1 inhibition–mediated host chaperone depletion at febrile temperatures. This fitness loss is due to biophysical defects that chaperones are unavailable to address when heat shock factor 1 is inhibited. Thus, influenza subverts host chaperones to uncouple the biophysically deleterious consequences of viral protein variants from the benefits of immune escape. In summary, host proteostasis plays a central role in shaping influenza adaptation, with implications for the evolution of other viruses, for viral host switching, and for antiviral drug development.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Viruses, such as influenza, evade the host immune response by mutating frequently. However, these adaptive amino acid substitutions are often biophysically deleterious and can thus increase the propensity for viral proteins to misfold and hamper viral replication. Host protein folding factors called chaperones interact extensively with viral proteins, like influenza nucleoprotein, and are thus poised to potentiate the fitness of biophysically defective, adaptive variants. Here, we directly test this hypothesis by quantitatively profiling the mutational tolerance of influenza nucleoprotein in host cells with reduced chaperone levels. We find that chaperones indeed increase the accessibility of destabilized adaptive nucleoprotein variants, with an especially strong effect at fever-like temperatures. We observe that the destabilized Pro283 nucleoprotein variant, which is universally conserved across human influenza strains and enables evasion of the Myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) innate immunity restriction factor, is rendered unfit in a chaperone-depleted host environment. Together, these data show that host chaperones critically impact viral adaptation and may serve as targets for antiviral therapeutic adjuvants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>RNA viruses are exceptionally efficient pathogens that leverage host machineries to replicate their genetic material, synthesize their proteins, and assemble new virions. Perhaps their most remarkable feature, however, is the capacity to rapidly evolve in the face of environmental and immune system pressures. Such rapid evolution is largely mediated by a high mutation rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref001">1</xref>].</p>
<p>Despite its adaptive benefits, rapid genetic change comes at a significant cost for evolving proteins. The majority of amino acid substitutions (especially functionally relevant substitutions that alter or create protein activities) are biophysically deleterious, negatively affecting either protein folding or stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>A striking illustration of this phenomenon in RNA viruses is influenza nucleoprotein (NP). NP is a globular protein that oligomerizes to encapsulate influenza genomic material and mediate its import into the host nucleus, a process that is required for transcription and replication of the viral genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref007">7</xref>]. NP is strongly conserved relative to the highly variable influenza surface proteins targeted by antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref008">8</xref>]. However, NP does experience significant selection pressure from the host immune system, including from innate immune restriction factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref010">10</xref>]. In particular, the human restriction factor Myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) can prevent influenza ribonucleoprotein import [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref013">13</xref>], cutting short the viral replication cycle.</p>
<p>Adaptive mutations in NP that allow escape from human MxA are critical for the efficient replication of new influenza strains in humans following zoonotic transmission. In just the last century, nonhuman influenza NP was introduced into circulating human influenza strains in 2009 and probably in 1918 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref015">15</xref>], leading to the acquisition of MxA resistance and ultimately to global pandemics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref017">17</xref>]. While NP evolution is driven by immune escape, it is nonetheless clear that a delicate balance exists between immune system resistance and NP stability and folding. Several NP substitutions known to engender immune escape are destabilizing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref010">10</xref>], impairing viral growth in the absence of immune pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref016">16</xref>]. Apparently, the evolving virus must balance the costs of a NP folding defect with the benefits of escaping host immunity.</p>
<p>In theory, any mechanism that allows influenza (or other viruses) to uncouple protein folding versus immune escape selection pressures would have tremendous benefits for the pathogen. Recent work by us and others suggests that the host’s heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) chaperone can modulate the evolutionary paths traversed by viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref019">19</xref>]. Neither the mechanism of Hsp90’s effect on viral evolution nor its relevance to actual viral strains is clear. A provocative possibility, not yet experimentally explored, is that hijacked host chaperones, whether Hsp90 or any of the other dozens of chaperones beyond Hsp90 that interact extensively with influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref021">21</xref>], potentiate viral evolution directly by assisting the folding of biophysically defective NP variants that would otherwise be insufficiently fit to persist in the population. If this hypothesis is correct, it would suggest that subversion of host protein folding chaperones by viruses can make otherwise inaccessible mutational trajectories leading to immune system escape possible, specifically by promoting the folding of escape variants. Such a mechanism for host adaptation would have broad implications for the evolution of not only influenza NP but also other influenza proteins and other viruses.</p>
<p>Rigorously testing this hypothesis requires a method to systematically and quantitatively evaluate whether and how host proteostasis modulates viral protein mutational tolerance. Here, we achieve that objective using deep mutational scanning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref022">22</xref>] of influenza NP. We apply deep mutational scanning in the context of chemical genetic inhibition of the host’s heat shock factor 1 (HSF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref023">23</xref>]) to create biophysically challenging, chaperone-depleted cellular protein folding environments. This high-throughput approach revealed a number of amino acid positions in influenza NP whose mutational tolerance is strongly reduced in chaperone-depleted host cells. We confirmed the strong effects of host chaperones on NP mutational tolerance at a number of these sites using head-to-head competition experiments. Most strikingly, the strongly conserved proline (Pro) residue at site 283 in NP is rendered highly unfit by HSF1 inhibition at febrile temperatures. Pro283 in NP is known to facilitate escape from the human innate immune system restriction factor MxA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref016">16</xref>], a feature that critically enhanced the pathogenicity and fitness of the 1918 pandemic influenza strain. We further show that Pro283 disrupts a key structural element in NP, rendering it unstable and aggregation-prone. Host chaperones resolve this folding problem, allowing Pro283 to persist in the viral population and thereby promoting MxA escape.</p>
<p>Collectively, our data demonstrate that viral hijacking of host chaperones addresses critical biophysical defects that would otherwise sensitize the virus to host restriction factors. This phenomenon thus has tremendous impact on the capacity of viruses to adapt to their environments, emphasizing the central importance of a hitherto underappreciated element of the host–pathogen interaction and potentially providing new targets for antiviral intervention.</p>

<title>Quantifying NP variant fitness in distinctive host cell folding environments</title>
<p>We used a deep mutational scanning strategy to systematically and experimentally quantify the fitness of nearly all viable single amino acid substitutions in influenza NP in both basal and biophysically challenging host cell environments. To this end, we employed previously reported duplicate NP mutant libraries based on the human-adapted A/Aichi/2/1968 (H3N2) influenza strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref024">24</xref>] and competed each viral library in Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells.

To create a chaperone-depleted host cell environment for viral propagation, we employed a highly specific, chemically inducible dominant negative form of HSF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref023">23</xref>], which is the master regulator of cytosolic and nuclear chaperone levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref026">26</xref>]. At both permissive (37°C) and biophysically restrictive, fever-like (39°C) temperatures, chemical induction of the HSF1 inhibitor reduces cytosolic chaperone transcript and protein levels in both the absence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s002">S2A</xref> Figs; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s011">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s012">S2 Data</xref>) and presence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s012">S2 Data</xref>) of influenza. Notably, the condition in which HSF1 was inhibited (HSF1i) did not significantly alter the replication of wild-type influenza or host cell metabolic fitness over the course of our experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s002">S2C and S2D Fig</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s012">S2 Data</xref>). We anticipated that the fever-like temperature would prove moderately more challenging for NP folding, potentially restricting the accessible mutational landscape, while the depletion of cytosolic chaperones at each temperature would assess the potential function of host chaperones in regulating NP variant fitness.</p>
<p>To maintain library diversity (approximately 10,000 single amino acid substitutions) whilst minimizing coinfection, we infected 10<sup>7</sup> cells in each host environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000008.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) with 10<sup>6</sup> infectious virions from our biological duplicate viral NP libraries. In addition to performing deep mutational scanning in biological duplicate, we also performed technical duplicates with one of the replicate libraries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). Following a 48-hour infection, we utilized a previously reported barcoded subamplicon sequencing strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref027">27</xref>] to accurately quantify the abundance of NP variants after replication at both 37°C and 39°C with and without host chaperone depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s003">S3B–S3D Fig</xref>). The change in variant frequency upon selection was then normalized to that of the wild-type residue, such that the resulting differential selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref028">28</xref>] value provides a quantitative measure of the relative fitness of each NP variant in the conditions tested.

<p>As expected, we found that the fever-like temperature is restrictive, generally reducing the fitness of NP variants relative to the wild-type sequence (see net site differential selection plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000008.g001">Fig 1B</xref> and also the logo plot in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s006">S6 Fig</xref>—Basal 39°C versus Basal 37°C). Host chaperone depletion caused by inhibition of HSF1 modestly reduces NP variant fitness on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000008.g001">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s005">S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s007">S7</xref> Figs—HSF1i 39°C versus Basal 39°C and HSF1i 37°C versus Basal 37°C), whereas chaperone depletion at the restrictive, fever-like temperature substantially reduces the fitness of NP variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000008.g001">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s004">S4 Fig</xref>—HSF1i 39°C versus Basal 37°C; statistical analyses in Materials and methods). Most strikingly, chaperone depletion at an elevated temperature results in very high levels of differential selection at several specific sites in NP, including sites 283, 334, 353, and 377 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000008.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s004">S4 Fig</xref>—HSF1i 39°C versus Basal 37°C). At each of these sites, multiple amino acids confer strongly enhanced fitness relative to the wild-type residue. This phenotype is specifically revealed upon host chaperone depletion at 39°C, as we do not observe significant positive differential selection at these sites upon depleting chaperones at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000008.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s007">S7 Fig</xref>—HSF1i 37°C versus Basal 37°C) and observe only modest positive differential selection upon increasing the temperature in an environment with basal levels of chaperones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000008.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s006">S6 Fig</xref>—Basal 39°C versus Basal 37°C).</p>
<p>Competitions between thousands of variants are often inherently noisy, largely owing to differences in variant composition between replicate libraries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref027">27</xref>]. However, we observed strong correlation for selection on NP sites between biological (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.71) and technical (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.79) replicates of our deep mutational scanning experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s013">S3E Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s013">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s014">S4</xref> Data). Thus, the selection strength imparted by host chaperone depletion at a restrictive, fever-like temperature substantially exceeds the experimental noise. Moreover, these deep mutational scanning results were recapitulated in all pairwise competitions we performed between individual highly selected variants and virus carrying the wild-type NP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000008.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s008">S8 Fig</xref>), and no significant fitness change was observed for a synonymous variant used as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000008.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, false discovery rate [FDR] = 0.4). Cumulatively, these findings confirm the validity of the deep mutational scanning data and indicate that depleting chaperones at a moderately elevated temperature creates a stringent host environment that strongly selects against wild-type residues in NP at certain sequence positions.</p>

<title>Biophysical costs of individual NP variants</title>
<p>The strong differential selection we observed in chaperone-depleted host cells at a restrictive temperature suggested to us that specific wild-type NP residues in the Aichi influenza strain, the strain our libraries are based on, may entail a biophysical cost that is nonetheless tolerated under permissive conditions, perhaps owing to competing selection forces. This hypothesis is particularly compelling for the previously characterized stabilizing NP variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref010">10</xref>] N334H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000008.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s004">S4 Fig</xref>) and M136I (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), which were positively selected in biophysically challenging conditions. These variants exhibited modestly enhanced fitness upon increased temperature and significantly enhanced fitness upon chaperone depletion at increased temperature. The unmasking of the deleterious fitness effects of the wild-type sequence at these positions upon host chaperone depletion supports the hypothesis that chaperones can indeed rescue biophysically deleterious NP variants.</p>
<p>We observed a similar and even more striking trend at site 283, where numerous amino acid substitutions—including serine (Ser), leucine (Leu), threonine, and glycine (Gly)—were validated in our pairwise competition experiments to be significantly more fit than the wild-type Pro residue when host chaperones were depleted at a restrictive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000008.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000008.g002">Fig 2</xref>B—HSF1i 39°C versus Basal 37°C). The identity of the amino acid at NP site 283 is known to critically modulate influenza sensitivity to the human antiviral restriction factor MxA, with Pro at that position contributing greatly to MxA escape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref016">16</xref>]. Although a structure of the MxA:NP complex is not currently available, site 283 is likely located at the MxA–NP interface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref029">29</xref>]. Moreover, Pro283 is nearly universally conserved in human influenza NP but rarely occurs in avian influenza NP. This characteristic difference between human and avian influenza strains is attributed to the necessity of Pro283 to escape human MxA, whereas the avian MxA ortholog lacks known antiviral activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref030">30</xref>]. Indeed, the Leu283Pro substitution enabled the 1918 pandemic influenza strain to escape MxA following zoonotic transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref016">16</xref>]. Pro283 in NP has thus greatly impacted the fitness of modern human influenza strains.</p>
<p>The observation that an adaptive amino acid substitution as important as Pro283 can be rendered unfit by biophysically challenging, host chaperone–depleted conditions motivated us to elucidate the underlying molecular basis of this phenomenon. Our hypothesis was that the depletion of host chaperones exacerbates a biophysical defect in NP folding that is caused by installation of a Pro at position 283. Prior work has shown that NP is engaged by numerous cytosolic chaperones, including chaperones like heat shock protein 40 (Hsp40) and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) that are depleted in our HSF1-inhibited host cell environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref035">35</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s002">S2</xref> Figs). For example, Hsp40 (<italic>DNAJB1</italic>) directly interacts with NP and facilitates its nuclear import [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref034">34</xref>], while Hsp70 is implicated in modulating NP nuclear export [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref035">35</xref>]. The heat shock proteins can also regulate antiviral responses indirectly through their interactions with NP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref033">33</xref>]. Thus, the disruption of critical NP–host chaperone interactions by HSF1 inhibition-mediated chaperone depletion may indeed be the source of significant differential selection at site 283, especially at a biophysically restrictive temperature.</p>
<p>This possibility raises the question of whether the Pro283 NP variant is, in fact, biophysically defective relative to other variants at site 283. Although there is currently no high-resolution structure of a NP variant containing Pro283, crystal structures of avian influenza NP variants with Ser or Leu at position 283 are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref037">37</xref>]. In these structures, site 283 is in the middle of an α-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000008.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Pro is classically regarded as a “helix-breaker,” owing in part to its inability to form an <italic>i</italic> + 4 hydrogen bond important for α-helix stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref038">38</xref>]. Therefore, it seemed reasonable to anticipate that the replacement of Ser (or Leu) with a Pro at position 283, as is observed in human influenza strains, would indeed be biophysically problematic.</p>

<p>To assess this hypothesis, we first performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in explicit water to evaluate whether Pro283 affects either the overall structure of NP or the structure of the α-helix centered at position 283. Although the overall NP structure was not grossly perturbed by Pro283, as would be expected given that this variant is still capable of supporting influenza replication, our simulations revealed that a Pro283 NP variant is significantly less α-helical at residues 282–284 than is a Ser283-containing variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000008.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s021">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s022">S2</xref> Videos and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s016">S6 Data</xref>).</p>
<p>The significant structural consequences of Pro283 observed in these simulations prompted us to experimentally investigate whether Pro283 affects NP stability. Following a previously reported protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref010">10</xref>], we recombinantly expressed and purified a monomeric form of NP with either Pro, Ser, Leu, or alanine (Ala) at position 283 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s009">S9A–S9C Fig</xref>). Circular dichroism spectra indicated that all four variants had grossly similar secondary structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s009">S9B Fig</xref>), consistent with our simulations. Thermal denaturation of NP is irreversible, leading to rapid aggregation and precipitation of the protein. Nonetheless, fitting these irreversible thermal melts to a two-state model revealed that Pro283 NP does indeed precipitate at a significantly lower temperature than all three of the non-Pro variants studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000008.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s009">S9C Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s017">S7 Data</xref>) and is therefore less stable and more aggregation prone.</p>
<p>The observation that Pro283 NP has a higher propensity to aggregate than other variants is consistent with either a kinetic or thermodynamic defect caused by substitution with Pro283. Given that Gly is, like Pro, known as an α-helix breaker and that Gly283 is positively selected relative to Pro283 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000008.g001">Fig 1</xref>C—HSF1i 39°C versus Basal 37°C) upon chaperone depletion at febrile temperatures, we favor a substantial contribution from a kinetic defect that may be associated with the propensity of Pro to form both <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-amide bonds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref038">38</xref>]. The substantive biophysical defect endowed by Pro283 on NP likely explains the enhanced dependence of this variant on host chaperones and explains why other variants are significantly more fit in the absence of those key chaperones. Moreover, these results may help to explain why Pro283 is not observed in avian influenza strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref016">16</xref>]. Birds typically have body temperatures ranging from 39–43°C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref039">39</xref>], the upper end of which may be too extreme to permit chaperone-mediated rescue of the biophysically defective Pro283 NP variant.</p>

<title>Evaluating competing selection pressures of MxA escape and host chaperone depletion</title>
<p>Cumulatively, these results suggest that NP variants critical for innate immune system escape, most especially Pro283, can be folding-defective and display compromised fitness in biophysically challenging host environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000008.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, left). This finding motivated us to evaluate whether Pro283 fitness remains compromised under biophysically challenging conditions even upon the addition of an MxA selection pressure that normally selects strongly in favor of the Pro283 variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000008.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, right). To this end, we performed pairwise viral competitions between the biophysically stable Ser283 variant and the MxA-resistant Pro283 variant in each of our host environments in the presence of either active or inactive MxA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000008.g004">Fig 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s002">S2E Fig</xref>).

In contrast, in biophysically challenging environments (Basal and HSF1i at 39°C), the stability defects of Pro283 were exacerbated, and Ser283 was enriched compared to Pro283. Ser283 was enriched even in the presence of MxA selection pressure when chaperones are depleted at 39°C, thereby hindering immune escape.</p>

<p>Altogether, these data reveal that HSF1-regulated chaperones can define the fitness of biophysically destabilized immune escape variants in influenza. This observation suggests a model in which enhanced fitness conferred by immune escape is often counterbalanced over the course of influenza evolution by biophysical defects that have a substantive fitness cost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000008.g005">Fig 5</xref>, left). Remarkably, at least in the case of influenza NP, our data show that the virus is able to hijack host chaperones to resolve these biophysical defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000008.g005">Fig 5</xref>, right). By this mechanism, the virus manages to uncouple protein folding fitness costs from the advantageous consequences of immune escape, expanding the accessible mutational landscape to access essential viral protein variants capable of both folding and immune escape.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This work provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first direct experimental evidence that host chaperones mediate the accessibility of biophysically deleterious, adaptive viral protein variants. This feature of the host–pathogen interaction is apparent in multiple sites across the NP gene. Particularly noteworthy, we find that the destabilized Pro283 NP variant is not tolerated in a chaperone-depleted host environment at a restrictive temperature, as NP is unable to engage host chaperones to address the Pro283-induced biophysical defect. Remarkably, we observe that even in the presence of selection pressure imposed by MxA that strongly favors Pro283 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref009">9</xref>], the fitness of Pro283 NP is still contingent on the host’s chaperone levels and biophysical environment.</p>
<p>Based on these results, we expect that host chaperones can impact the accessibility of adaptive viral protein variants far beyond NP and influenza, as amino acid substitutions are largely destabilizing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref006">6</xref>], and many viral proteins are known to engage host chaperones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref041">41</xref>]. Moreover, previous work has revealed (1) that viral evolution is fundamentally constrained by protein stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref010">10</xref>] and (2) the role of the Hsp90 chaperone in viral replication across numerous viral families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref044">44</xref>]. Thus, the evolutionary trajectories of diverse viral proteins are likely to be influenced by numerous host chaperones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>Since our work suggests that host chaperones preferentially rescue biophysically defective viral protein variants, as more data accumulate in this field, we may eventually be able to predict how chaperones will impact fitness in a rational manner based on protein variant biophysical properties. Further, our infections in the presence of the MxA restriction factor demonstrate that host chaperones can mediate the accessibility of escape variants irrespective of competing selection pressures. These data raise the possibility of antiviral therapeutic adjuvants targeting host chaperones that inhibit the development of antiviral resistance by constraining the accessible mutational landscape. We further observe that temperature critically influences the fitness of viral variants, with most variants suffering fitness costs at elevated temperatures that mimic fever conditions and/or the body temperatures of birds and small mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref039">39</xref>]. Thus, fever and host-switching events may impose selection on viral variants that hampers adaptation. Based on our findings here, the nature of such selection is likely to be strongly influenced by host-specific differences in chaperone network compositions.</p>
<p>We anticipate that these phenomena extend far beyond the host–pathogen interface and apply to protein evolution more broadly. Previous work by Lindquist and others suggested that the Hsp90 chaperone can potentiate and buffer genetic variation in endogenous proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref045">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref049">49</xref>]. Here, the impact of the host chaperone environment on NP variant fitness is driven predominantly not by Hsp90 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s010">S10 Fig</xref>), even though NP does engage this chaperone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref050">50</xref>], but instead by inhibition of HSF1 modulating the composition of a complex network of multiple protein folding and quality control factors. Moreover, our work shows experimentally that chaperones have the largest effect on the fitness of biophysically defective protein variants, a result that may help to explain extensive prior work with Hsp90 in which the potential biophysical mechanism of effects on protein evolution have not been experimentally evaluated.</p>
<p>HSF1-regulated host proteostasis network components may modulate NP evolution directly—for example, by impacting NP–chaperone interactions—or indirectly, perhaps by perturbing levels of endogenous chaperone client proteins with antiviral properties. Our data support the former case, as we find that destabilized NP variants are particularly sensitive to chaperone depletion. Nonetheless, we would not rule out possible contributions from secondary effects. Deciphering between primary and secondary effects will first require identifying the individual components of the intricate protein folding network that are primarily responsible for modulating NP fitness, followed by systematic elimination of potential downstream effectors. Whether primary or secondary, the evolutionary implications of the protein folding network clearly extend well beyond Hsp90 and also play critical roles in evolution at the host–pathogen interface.</p>
<p>Finally, this work provides experimental evidence for the longstanding hypothesis that chaperones buffer the fitness cost of biophysically destabilized protein variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref051">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref052">52</xref>]. Experimental validation of this concept in metazoan cells for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, has significant consequences for understanding the constraints on protein evolution, which have so far focused on inherent biophysical properties of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref010">10</xref>]. For specific destabilized adaptive variants, fitness has been attributed to compensatory stabilizing mutations elsewhere in the protein structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref053">53</xref>]. Cases of this idiosyncratic epistasis mediating pathogen adaptation have motivated efforts to determine the pervasiveness of compensatory mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref010">10</xref>]. Our data reveal that the constraints on protein evolution are still more complex, establishing that protein variant fitness is constrained not just by inherent stability but also by the cellular environment in which the protein folds.</p>

Briefly, 10-fold serial dilutions of viruses (in technical triplicates) were prepared in 96-well plates and incubated with 5 × 10<sup>3</sup> MDCK-SIAT1 cells/well for 72 h at 37°C. The wells were then scored for cytopathic effects, and viral titers were calculated using a Reed-Muench Calculator, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/jbloomlab/reedmuenchcalculator" xlink:type="simple">https://github.com/jbloomlab/reedmuenchcalculator</ext-link>.</p>
<p>Two plasmid libraries were used to generate two biological replicate viral libraries, one of which was used twice to perform 2 technical replicates of the deep mutational scanning (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). MDCK<sup>dn-cHSF1</sup> cells were plated in 15-cm plates at a density of 6 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/dish and treated with 0.1% DMSO or 1 μg/ml doxycycline for 24 h at either 37°C or 39°C. Deep mutational scanning was also performed in cells treated with an Hsp90 inhibitor (100 nM 17-AAG; 90 min pretreatment). Then, 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> infectious virions (as determined by a TCID<sub>50</sub> assay) from each viral library were used to infect four 15-cm plates from each condition at an MOI of 0.1 virions/cell (the cells expanded to approximately 12.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per plate by the time of infection). In addition, one 15-cm plate at both 37°C and 39°C was either mock-infected (negative control) or infected with wild-type virus. For infection, the cellular growth media were replaced with WSN media containing a mutant virus library, wild-type virus, or no virus for mock infection. After 2 h, the inoculum was replaced with fresh WSN media containing 0.1% DMSO, 1 μg/mL doxycycline, or 100 nM 17-AAG. At 48 h post infection, the viral supernatant was harvested, centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min to remove cell debris, and stored at −80°C. Viral RNA was extracted from the infectious supernatant using a Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed using the AccuScript High Fidelity 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Agilent) using 5′-BsmBI-Aichi68-NP and 3′-BsmBI-Aichi68-NP primers (primer sequences in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s020">S1 Table</xref>). At least 10<sup>6</sup> NP molecules were PCR-amplified for preparation of the sequencing libraries, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref027">27</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s003">S3B Fig</xref>).

<title>Pairwise viral competitions</title>
<p>NP variants that reproducibly exhibited the most positive or negative differential selection in the deep mutational scan were selected for pairwise competitions (P283M, P283A, P283G, P283L, P283S, P283T, S353L, S353F, N334H, D34N, H82N, and a synonymous control P283P). The NP mutants were generated by introducing point mutations into the pHWAichi68-NP plasmid using the QuikChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent). Technical difficulties with specific site-directed mutagenesis reactions prevented generation of the P283M, P283A, and S353L mutant plasmids. The remaining 9 mutant plasmids were generated successfully and used to produce the corresponding mutant viruses by transfecting a coculture of 25,000 MDCK-SIAT1 and 300,000 HEK 293T cells, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref055">55</xref>]. The resultant viruses were titered using a TCID<sub>50</sub> assay. For each competition, 100,000 cells/well of MDCK<sup>dn-cHSF1</sup>, MDCK<sup>dn-cHSF1-FLAG-MxA</sup>, or MDCK<sup>dn-cHSF1-FLAG-MxA(T103A)</sup> cells were plated in 12-well dishes and treated with 0.1% DMSO or 1 μg/mL doxycycline for 18 h at either 37°C or 39°C. Cells were infected with a 1:1 mixture of wild-type and mutant viruses at an MOI of 0.1 virions/cell in triplicate under conditions identical to that of the deep mutational scanning experiment. After 2 h, the inoculum was replaced with fresh WSN media containing either 0.1% DMSO or 1 μg/mL doxycycline. At 48 h post infection, infectious supernatants were harvested, centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min to remove cell debris, and stored at −80°C. Viral RNA was extracted from the infectious supernatant using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, and at least 10<sup>6</sup> NP molecules were reverse transcribed using the SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 5′-BsmBI-Aichi68-NP and 3′-BsmBI-Aichi68-NP primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s020">S1 Table</xref>). The amplicons were visualized on a 1% analytical agarose gel to verify amplification of the NP gene (1.5 kb). The dsDNA was purified using 1.5× AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) and quantified using a Quant-iT PicoGreen Assay (Life Technologies). Illumina NexteraXT sequencing libraries were prepared using a Mosquito HTS Liquid Handler (TTP Labtech) and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeqv2 in 2 runs of either 40-bp single-end or 150-bp paired-end reads. To call sequence variants, reads were aligned to the Aichi NP reference sequence using bwa mem (v. 0.7.12-r1039) (arXiv:1303.3997v2) with flag–t 16, and sorted and indexed bam files were generated using samtools (v 1.3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref057">57</xref>]. These bam files were processed using samtools mpileup with flags–excl-flags 2052, -d 30000000, and the same Aichi NP reference sequence used for mapping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref058">58</xref>]. For pairwise competitions in the absence of MxA, mutant allele frequencies were normalized to wild-type allele frequencies for each sample, and the resulting values were used to calculate the differential selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref028">28</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000008.g002">Fig 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s008">S8 Fig</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s015">S5 Data</xref>).

<title>MD simulations</title>
<p>Two sets of simulations were performed for NPs with the sequence of the human H3N2 variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000008.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). In one set, NP residue 283 was Pro (this system is termed Pro283 hereafter). In the other set, residue 283 was Ser (this system is termed Ser283 hereafter). The initial structures of both systems were prepared using the comparative modeling software RosettaCM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref059">59</xref>], with the structures of H1N1 influenza A virus NP (PDB ID: 2IQH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref036">36</xref>]) and H5N1 NP (PDB ID: 2Q06 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref037">37</xref>]) used as templates with equal weights. The first 20 amino acids in the N-terminal region, whose 3D coordinates are missing in the template structures, were considered flexible and also of minimal impact to the region near residue 283. Therefore, they were removed in the following simulation.</p>
<p>In the threading procedure, the target NP sequence was aligned with the templates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref060">60</xref>] and assigned coordinates from the template PDB structures (2IQH and 2Q06). The helix formed by residues 278–286 of 2IQH and 2Q06 was removed to allow RosettaCM to construct this region without influence from the templates. This region (residues 278–286), along with all the other regions missing in the template PDBs, was patched in the hybridization step. During hybridization, RosettaCM generated hybridized structures that contained pieces from each of the threaded structures, providing more accurate comparative models that were energetically favorable. Additionally, RosettaCM used fragments and minor ab initio folding to fill in residues not previously aligned with any template sequences during the threading process. A total of 1,000 models for each NP system were created, and the best-scoring model without a disulfide bond was used as the initial structure for further MD simulations.</p>
<p>Five runs of MD simulations for each NP system were carried out using GROMACS with the oplsaa/tip4p force field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref061">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref062">62</xref>]. The N-terminus of the initial structure of the MD simulation was capped with an acetyl group, while the C-terminus was free (ending with COO<sup>–</sup>). This structure was energy minimized in a vacuum and then immersed in the center of a cubic box containing preequilibrated water molecules with an edge of 12 nm. The system was electrostatically neutralized by adding 11 Cl<sup>−</sup>ions. The solvated system was further energy minimized to remove any bad contacts. The solvated NP then underwent 2 stages of equilibrations. The first stage of equilibration consisted of a 50-ps isochoric–isothermal (NVT) simulation at 300 K and a subsequent 50-ps isobaric–isothermal (NPT) simulation at 300 K and 1 bar. During the first stage of equilibration, the NP-heavy atoms were restrained by a harmonic potential with a force constant of 1,000 kJ mol<sup>–1</sup> nm<sup>–2</sup> to equilibrate the solvent molecules and adjust the density. The second stage of equilibration consisted of an additional 100-ps NVT simulation at 300 K without any restraints to equilibrate the whole system, followed by a 100-ns NPT production simulation at 300 K and 1 bar. The V-rescale thermostat was coupled to both the NP and solvent separately, with coupling time constants of 0.1 ps. The pressure was maintained using the Parrinello-Rahman barostat with a coupling time constant of 2.0 ps and isothermal compressibility of 4.5 × 10<sup>−5</sup> bar<sup>-1</sup>. The leapfrog algorithm with a time step of 2 fs was used for dynamics evolution. All bonds involving hydrogen were constrained using the LINCS algorithm. All neighbor searching, electrostatic interactions, and van der Waals interactions were truncated at 1.0 nm. Electrostatics were treated using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) summation with a Fourier spacing of 0.12 nm and an order of 4. A long-range dispersion correction for energy and pressure was applied to account for the 1.0-nm cutoff of Lennard-Jones interactions. Five 100-ns trajectories were produced for the Pro283 and Ser283 systems, respectively. The trajectories between 50 ns and 100 ns were used for analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s016">S6 Data</xref>).</p>

<title>Recombinant expression and biophysical characterization of NP variants</title>
<p>The P283S, P283A, and P283L amino acid substitutions were introduced into the wild-type influenza A/Aichi/2/1968 NP in a pET28b(+) expression vector using the QuikChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent). This NP construct contained an R416A mutation and deletion of residues 2–7 to obtain nonaggregated, RNA-free NP in a CD-compatible buffer, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000008.ref010">10</xref>]. Mutagenized plasmid DNA was isolated using the E.Z.N.A. Plasmid Mini Kit I (Omega). For bacterial expression, BL21(DE3) chemically competent cells were transformed with 1 μL of purified plasmid and incubated overnight on LB-kanamycin agar plates. Colonies were used to inoculate 50-mL LB-kanamycin cultures overnight. Then, 10 mL of starter cultures were used to inoculate 1 L LB-kanamycin cultures, which were shaken at 37°C until reaching an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.3–0.6. Cultures were then chilled on ice and induced with 500 μM IPTG (Sigma) overnight at 20°C. Cells were then pelleted, Dounce homogenized, and lysed by sonication in 50 mL of lysis buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate at pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mM imidazole, 1 mM PMSF, and 0.1 mg/mL MgCl<sub>2</sub>). Cells were sonicated for 2 min (30% amplitude, 10 s on, 10 s off; Branson Digital Sonifier). Lysates were then clarified for 30 min at 10,000 × g at 4°C. Clarified lysates were passed through 0.45-μm filters. His-tagged NP variants were then incubated on Ni-NTA (Millipore) columns for 60 min at 4 <bold>°</bold>C and washed with Ni-NTA Wash Buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate at pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, and 20 mM imidazole). Proteins were eluted using Ni-NTA Elution Buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate at pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, and 250 mM imidazole). Eluates were dialyzed overnight into analysis buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate at pH 7.0 with 300 mM NaF) using 3.5-kDa molecular mass cutoff SnakeSkin dialysis tubing (Fisher Thermo Scientific). Dialyzed proteins were concentrated using Amicon Ultra 3K MWCO filters (Millipore) and further purified over a size exclusion column (Bio-Rad ENrich SEC 650) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000008.s009">S9A Fig</xref>).</p>
