<abstract>
<p>The hierarchical relationships between stem cells and progenitors that guide mammary gland morphogenesis are still poorly defined. While multipotent basal stem cells have been found within the myoepithelial compartment, the in vivo lineage potential of luminal progenitors is unclear. Here we used the expression of the Notch1 receptor, previously implicated in mammary gland development and tumorigenesis, to elucidate the hierarchical organization of mammary stem/progenitor cells by lineage tracing. We found that Notch1 expression identifies multipotent stem cells in the embryonic mammary bud, which progressively restrict their lineage potential during mammary ductal morphogenesis to exclusively generate an ERα<sup>neg</sup> luminal lineage postnatally. Importantly, our results show that Notch1-labelled cells represent the alveolar progenitors that expand during pregnancy and survive multiple successive involutions. This study reveals that postnatal luminal epithelial cells derive from distinct self-sustained lineages that may represent the cells of origin of different breast cancer subtypes.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Tissue-specific stem cells are believed to be multipotent, thus able to generate all cell types of their tissue of origin. In the mammary gland epithelium, however, the existence of multipotent versus unipotent adult stem cells is currently under debate. In this study, we have identified and characterized a population of mammary luminal progenitors that express the Notch1 receptor. Using lineage tracing experiments, we found that these cells are self-sustained unipotent adult progenitors with high self-renewal capacity. Although they lack estrogen and progesterone hormone receptors, these cells are highly responsive to hormones. Importantly, Notch1-expressing cells are multipotent during embryonic mammary development, when they can give rise to all mammary cell types, while they become lineage-restricted postnatally. The cells characterized in this study also present extensive plasticity, as they can repopulate the entire mammary gland in transplantation experiments. Our study reveals that the Notch1 receptor is a specific marker for the identification of luminal progenitors that lack expression of hormone receptors and that can be critical for breast cancer initiation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The mammary gland is composed of two epithelial compartments: an inner layer, which contains luminal cells, and an outer myoepithelial layer in direct contact with the basal membrane. These two cell lineages originate from mammary stem cells (MaSC) that were initially found to reside in the basal compartment, as only these cells have been reported to efficiently regenerate a complete mammary gland in transplantation assays [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, more recent in vivo lineage tracing studies using promoters of specific cytokeratins expressed either in the luminal or in the myoepithelial compartment have led to conflicting results regarding the plasticity of multipotent mammary stem cells in the adult mammary gland. While Visvader and colleagues showed that some basal cells are able to generate both luminal and myoepithelial cells in the adult gland [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], Blanpain and colleagues indicated that after birth, the two lineages originate from distinct unipotent progenitors [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Luminal cells have been roughly subdivided into ductal and alveolar subtypes, and they have received increasing attention in the past few years, partly because they are thought to be the cells of origin for the vast majority of breast tumors [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although several surface markers for luminal progenitors have been reported, such as the Stem cell antigen-1 (Sca1), Prominin1 (CD133) [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], α2-integrin (CD49b) [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], E74-like factor 5 (Elf5) [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], CD61 [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], CD14 [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], c-Kit [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], Notch2 [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and Notch3 [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], their functional significance and the hierarchical relationships between different subsets of luminal cells are still unclear. Some luminal progenitors are responsible for forming alveolar buds during pregnancy, when milk-secreting cells are specified [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The process of alveologenesis is orchestrated by consecutive waves of hormones that drive extensive proliferation and remodeling of the mammary epithelium at pregnancy. Luminal cells expressing the ovarian steroid hormone receptors Estrogen Receptor-α (ERα) and Progesterone Receptor (PR), designated hormone-sensing cells, are directly stimulated by circulating hormones and induce proliferation of neighboring cells, referred to as hormone-responsive cells, that lack expression of ERα or PR [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. While luminal progenitors are believed to be largely ERα<sup>neg</sup>, a small fraction of ERα<sup>pos</sup> cells have also been found to have progenitor features, at least in vitro [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
<p>With the aim of unraveling the cellular heterogeneity of the luminal epithelium, we have used the Notch1 promoter to genetically label and follow the fate of Notch1-expressing cells during mammary gland development and adult homeostasis in vivo. Indeed, the Notch signaling pathway is involved in stem cell maintenance, preservation of progenitor pools, and control of cell differentiation in a variety of tissues [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In the mammary gland, the Notch1 receptor has been found expressed in the luminal compartment, and its ectopic activation in basal cells induces luminal cell commitment [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Nevertheless, it is still unknown which types of luminal cells physiologically express this Notch paralogue.</p>
<p>During embryonic development, we show by lineage tracing that Notch1-expressing cells are multipotent and can produce all mammary lineages, including myoepithelial and both ERα<sup>pos</sup> and ERα<sup>neg</sup> luminal cells. The potency of these progenitors is then restricted perinatally, resulting in unipotent cells that exclusively maintain their own ERα<sup>neg</sup> lineage. Indeed, we find that in the postnatal mammary gland, Notch1 marks cells that invariably lack expression of the ERα and PR hormone receptors, displaying high self-renewal capacity throughout life. These cells are rapidly mobilized in response to hormones and are crucial for alveolar formation at pregnancy. Importantly, the high regeneration capacity of these cells is revealed in transplantation assays, demonstrating that Notch1-expressing cells can generate complete mammary outgrowths consisting of both myoepithelial and luminal cells. Our results collectively suggest that, differently from embryonic mammary stem cells, in the pubertal and adult mammary gland, ERα<sup>neg</sup> and ERα<sup>pos</sup> luminal cells represent independent and self-sustained lineages, derived from distinct unipotent progenitors.</p>

<title>Notch1 Marks Multipotent Embryonic Progenitors in the Mammary Bud</title>
<p>Previous work has shown that K14<sup>pos</sup> basal mammary cells can give rise to all mammary cell types during embryonic development, but they restrict their potential and do not contribute to the luminal lineage in the postnatal mammary gland [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. As Notch signaling has been shown to dictate cell fate decisions in the mouse mammary gland [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], we analyzed the differentiation potential of Notch1-expressing cells during embryonic development, when the embryonic mammary placodes invaginate to form mammary buds [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. To this end, we used Notch1-CreERT2<sup>SAT</sup> mice [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] crossed to a double fluorescent reporter line, Rosa26<sup>mTmG</sup> [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], referred to as N1Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>R26<sup>mTmG</sup> (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), which we previously characterized in the mouse intestine [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], to genetically label with membrane-bound Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) Notch1-expressing cells and their progeny in vivo in the mammary gland. The CreERT2 inducible system permits the identification of Notch1-expressing cells when mice receive a single dose of tamoxifen and are analyzed 24 h later (pulse), but it also allows following the clonal progeny derived from initially labeled cells, by analyzing mice at longer time points after tamoxifen administration (chases) (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>.). To induce the activity of the CreERT2 recombinase, we used 0.1 mg of tamoxifen/g of mouse body weight, a dose that does not delay or alter mammary gland development [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>

<p>When we administered a single dose of tamoxifen to pregnant females 15.5 d post-coitum (dpc), and analyzed the double transgenic N1Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>R26<sup>mTmG</sup> embryos 24 h later, we found that GFP-marked cells co-expressed both myoepithelial cytokeratin 5 (K5) and luminal cytokeratin 8 (K8) markers (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B,C</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002069.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig</xref>.), confirming that the two epithelial lineages are not yet resolved at this developmental stage [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The analysis of the cell lineages derived from these embryonic progenitors in N1Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>R26<sup>mTmG</sup> mice 5 wk after birth revealed that the GFP-labeled progeny contained both myoepithelial cells (marked by the expression of K5, K14 and p63) (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002069.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B,C Fig</xref>.) and K8<sup>pos</sup> luminal cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Corroborating these results, flow cytometry analysis of these cells, using the established CD24 and CD29 surface markers to resolve the luminal (CD24<sup>+</sup>CD29<sup>low</sup>) and myoepithelial (CD24<sup>+</sup>CD29<sup>high</sup>) cell populations, confirmed that the GFP-labeled progeny was composed by both cell types (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2E Fig</xref>.). In addition, while embryonic mammary cells lack expression of ERα (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], GFP-marked clones were composed of both ERα<sup>pos</sup> and ERα<sup>neg</sup> cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>) and both PR<sup>pos</sup> and PR<sup>neg</sup> cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2D Fig</xref>.). The presence of GFP-marked progeny containing all mammary lineages implies that the Notch1 receptor is expressed in a pool of embryonic mammary stem cells, co-expressing basal and luminal markers (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig</xref>.), which is able to give rise to all mammary lineages after birth.</p>

<title>Notch1 Expression Is Restricted To ERα<sup>neg</sup> and PR<sup>neg</sup> Luminal Cells in the Postnatal Mammary Gland</title>
<p>Our observations during embryonic mammary development prompted us to use the Notch1 promoter to define stem cell hierarchies in the postnatal mammary gland. To this purpose, we examined Notch1-expressing cells in pubertal and adult N1Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>R26<sup>mTmG</sup> mice 24 h after tamoxifen administration. Surprisingly, GFP-marked cells could only be detected within the luminal cell layer, as they expressed the luminal marker (K8) but not the myoepithelial-specific cytokeratin K5 at all postnatal developmental stages (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A,B</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002069.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A Fig</xref>.). We also confirmed that GFP<sup>pos</sup> cells were indeed luminal (CD24<sup>+</sup>CD29<sup>low</sup>) by flow cytometry analysis (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Quantification by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) revealed that Notch1-expressing GFP<sup>pos</sup> cells represent 13.27 ±2.9% and 25.28 ±3.6% of the total luminal population in puberty and adulthood, respectively. Moreover, both Notch1 mRNA (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) and protein (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>) were exclusively found in luminal mammary cells, isolated by FACS, confirming and extending previous reports [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Unexpectedly, we found that Notch1-expressing cells invariably lacked the expression of ERα and PR (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F,G</xref>), and we confirmed these results by quantitative Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) in sorted GFP-labeled cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3B,C Fig</xref>.).</p>

<title>ERα<sup>neg</sup> Mammary Luminal Cells Clonally Expand and Self-Renew In Vivo</title>
<p>To examine the lineage potential of Notch1-expressing cells during pubertal mammary duct morphogenesis, we administered a reduced dose of tamoxifen (1µg/g of mouse body weight) to 4-wk-old females in order to target isolated single cells and analyzed the derived marked clones at different time points after tamoxifen injection. With this low dose of tamoxifen, we target only 0.074 ±0.008% of the mammary epithelial cells. To better quantify the clonal expansion of Notch1-marked cells, we classified GFP<sup>pos</sup> clones as single cells, small clones (composed of two to five cells), or large clones (composed of six or more cells) (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), and we counted them at different time points (24 h, 2 wk, 6 wk, and 10 wk after induction). The quantification was performed on freshly dissected mammary glands that received a mild enzymatic digestion to remove the surrounding stroma but preserved intact fragments of ducts in 3-D, as we previously reported [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We observed that Notch1-expressing cells generate marked clones during pubertal development in vivo (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A,B</xref>). The histological analysis of GFP-labeled progeny derived from Notch1-expressing cells after a 10 wk chase revealed that GFP<sup>pos</sup> cells retain their luminal identity (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>) and still remained ERα<sup>neg</sup> and PR<sup>neg</sup> (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D,E</xref>), in sharp contrast with our findings in embryonically derived lineages (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>).</p>

<p>To assess the self-renewal capacity of Notch1<sup>pos</sup> luminal cells in vivo, we induced Cre recombination in pubertal females and analyzed them after three consecutive pregnancies and involutions. Remarkably, we found the same percentage of GFP<sup>pos</sup> cells (28.9 ±1.4%) after three successive pregnancies (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>), as in adult, virgin females, indicating that Notch1-expressing cells are maintained as a constant pool of ERα<sup>neg</sup> and PR<sup>neg</sup> cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G,H</xref>) throughout mammary gland remodeling induced by pregnancy, and they represent cells able to survive involution.</p>
<p>Altogether, these results reveal that Notch1-expressing cells define ERα<sup>neg</sup> mammary luminal cells as long-lived, unipotent stem cells, endowed with extensive self-renewal capacity. Importantly, our results are consistent with the existence of a common progenitor only during embryogenesis, while after birth the luminal ERα<sup>pos</sup> and ER<sup>neg</sup> cell populations maintain their own lineages independently.</p>

<title>Notch1-Expressing Cells Represent ERα<sup>neg</sup> Clonogenic Luminal Progenitors</title>
<p>To determine if Notch1-expressing cells were actively cycling, we asked what percentage of GFP<sup>pos</sup> cells was marked by the proliferation marker Ki67 and found that 73.45 ±3.72% of GFP<sup>pos</sup> cells expressed Ki67 at puberty in 6-wk old mice (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). A quantitative analysis of cell cycle phases by FACS indicated that 46.9 ±5.1% of Notch1<sup>pos</sup> cells were cycling (S-G<sub>2</sub>-M) compared to 26.9 ±5.5% of total luminal cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). In order to investigate the ability of Notch1-expressing cells to proliferate in vitro, we probed their clonogenic capacity compared to GFP<sup>neg</sup> sorted luminal cells, when seeded on a feeder layer of irradiated 3T3 fibroblasts [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. After 7 d in culture, GFP<sup>pos</sup> cells had a strikingly higher colony-forming efficiency compared to GFP<sup>neg</sup> luminal cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). These results indicate that the Notch1 receptor marks luminal ERα<sup>neg</sup> progenitors with a high in vitro clonogenic potential. To further characterize these cells, we tested the expression of reported luminal progenitor markers in the GFP<sup>pos</sup> population and found a remarkable overlap between Notch1<sup>pos</sup> cells and luminal progenitors defined by the expression of CD49b [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Importantly, GFP<sup>pos</sup> cells also lack expression of Sca1 and CD133 (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], normally associated with non-clonogenic cells, further confirming their definition as luminal progenitor cells. Interestingly, when we explored the colony-forming ability of specific luminal cell populations sorted using these reported markers, we found that the CD133<sup>neg</sup> and CD49b<sup>pos</sup> cell subsets contain a mixture of equally clonogenic progenitors (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4A Fig</xref>.) that can be either ERα<sup>pos</sup> (i.e., Notch1<sup>neg</sup> cells) or Notch1<sup>pos</sup> (corresponding to ERα<sup>neg</sup> cells) (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4B,C Fig</xref>.). The quantification of the levels of Notch1 and ERα (<italic>Esr1</italic>) mRNA in the different subpopulations revealed that GFP<sup>neg</sup> cells include both ERα<sup>pos</sup> progenitor cells (CD133<sup>neg</sup> and CD49b<sup>pos</sup>) and some non-targeted Notch1<sup>pos</sup> cells (which did not undergo Cre-mediated recombination, due to the mosaic nature of this mouse line) (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4D Fig</xref>.).

<title>The Transcriptomic Profile of Notch1-Expressing Mammary Cells Defines a Signature of Luminal Progenitors</title>
<p>To gain further insights into the molecular signature characteristic of Notch1-expressing luminal progenitors, we performed a genome-wide microarray analysis comparing GFP<sup>neg</sup> and GFP<sup>pos</sup> sorted luminal cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002069.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed that GFP<sup>neg</sup> cells tightly correlate with a mature luminal signature, characteristic of terminally differentiated cells, whereas the expression profile of GFP<sup>pos</sup> cells closely corresponds to a luminal progenitor signature (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

<title>ERα<sup>neg</sup> Mammary Luminal Cells Are Self-Sustained Progenitors That Retain the Same Molecular Profile as the Cells They Derive From</title>
<p>Our findings indicated that Notch1 is expressed postnatally in a self-sustained population of luminal progenitors. When we characterized the identity of the Notch1-derived clonal progeny in adult mice, we were intrigued to observe that they expressed the same surface markers as the Notch1-expressing cells, even 10 wk after induction (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). To further confirm that Notch1-derived cells maintain the same molecular features as their “mothers,” we took an unbiased approach and assessed by qRT-PCR the expression levels of the top-ten ranking genes differentially expressed in GFP<sup>neg</sup> and GFP<sup>pos</sup> cells in our microarray data. These experiments indeed confirmed that Notch1-derived progeny 10 wk after CreERT2 induction retains an identical transcription profile as the cells analyzed after a 24 h tamoxifen pulse (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>.). Altogether, this compelling dataset unequivocally shows that Notch1-expressing progenitors exclusively give rise to cells with the same molecular profile in vivo in the postnatal mammary gland.

<title>Notch1-Expressing Cells Designate Alveolar Progenitors at Pregnancy</title>
<p>The observation that Notch1<sup>pos</sup> cells are highly proliferating during puberty (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A,B</xref>) but not in the adult gland (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6A Fig</xref>.), prompted us to ask if the proliferative behavior of these cells was influenced by circulating hormones, as would be predicted for ER<sup>neg</sup> hormone-responding cells. Pregnancy triggers a wave of hormones, and we tested whether the cells marked by Notch1 in our mice would represent alveolar progenitors that expand extensively during pregnancy and contribute to the formation of alveolar buds. To this end, we labeled single cells with a low dose of tamoxifen (1µg/g of mouse body weight) in pubertal females and examined their clonal expansion at mid-pregnancy (14.5 dpc), when high levels of circulating hormones are released and the mammary gland undergoes dramatic remodeling. Pointing to a prominent role in alveologenesis, we observed that Notch1<sup>pos</sup> cells massively expanded in pregnant mice compared to virgin females of the same age and they gave rise to GFP-marked alveoli (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A,B</xref>). Importantly, we confirmed that even at this stage, Notch1-expressing cells only gave rise to Notch1-expressing luminal cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6B Fig</xref>.), as the percentage of GFP<sup>pos</sup> cells at mid-pregnancy is comparable after a 24 h tamoxifen pulse and after a 10 wk chase (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C,D</xref>). These results reveal that Notch1<sup>pos</sup> luminal cells represent the alveolar progenitors of the mammary gland, responsible for the formation of milk-producing units during lactation. Of note, Notch1<sup>pos</sup> cells are reminiscent of the recently characterized steroid receptor negative alveolar progenitors found in pregnancy and lactation as parity-identified mammary epithelial cells (PI-MECs) [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], but it is difficult at present to establish the relationship of the cells we describe here with PI-MECs in nulliparous females, as PI-MECs were only explored at pregnancy and lactation.</p>

<p>In order to better define the specific hormones to which Notch1<sup>pos</sup> cells respond, we cultured fragments of mammary epithelium from adult mice as 3-D organotypic primary cultures [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and examined the clonal growth of Notch1-expressing cells in the presence of three different hormones: β-estradiol (β-2E), progesterone (Pg) or prolactin (Prl). After 10 d in culture, we observed a net and prominent expansion of GFP<sup>pos</sup> cells only in response to estrogen (β-estradiol) (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E,F</xref>). To confirm that each exogenously added hormone efficiently activated its specific pathway, we assessed by qRT-PCR the expression of the immediate target genes activated in response to each hormonal treatment: progesterone receptor (<italic>Pgr</italic>) for estradiol signaling, Rank ligand (<italic>Tnfs11</italic>) for progesterone stimulation, and β-Casein (<italic>Csn2</italic>) for Prolactin [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A significantly elevated expression of mRNAs for each of these target genes, in response to stimulation with the corresponding hormone, clearly shows that cells grown as mammary organoids correctly respond to physiologic hormones (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6C Fig</xref>.). Of note, we could not detect any synergistic effect when we concomitantly treated the organoids with both estrogen and progesterone (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E,F</xref>). These findings in ex vivo cultures, while not able to recapitulate the sequential waves of hormones that occur in vivo, corroborate the results we obtained in vivo during pregnancy and are consistent with the identification of Notch1-expressing cells as the estrogen-responsive cells of the mammary gland, stimulated in a paracrine fashion by neighboring ERα<sup>pos</sup> cells [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. As further discussed below, the ability of these cells to respond to hormones has important clinical applications in pathological conditions, as most current breast cancer treatments involve hormonal inhibitors, and the capacity of a given tumor to respond to these therapies can determine patient prognosis.</p>

<title>Notch1-Expressing ERα<sup>neg</sup> Luminal Cells Display Extensive Regenerative Capacity in Transplantation Assays</title>
<p>To further ascertain the plasticity of adult Notch1-labeled cells, we tested their mammary repopulating capacity in transplantation assays [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. As luminal mammary cells are known to produce mammary outgrowths very inefficiently when transplanted in the absence of myoepithelial cells, we first co-transplanted a mixture of sorted Tomato-labeled epithelial cells (Lin<sup>neg</sup>) with luminal GFP-marked Notch1<sup>pos</sup> cells at a ratio of 1:1 in cleared fat pads of immunodeficient host mice. In this experimental setting, 6 wk after transplantation, GFP<sup>pos</sup> cells could grow and gave rise to luminal cells that included both ERα<sup>pos</sup> and ERα<sup>neg</sup> cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002069.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>.), while the myoepithelial layer was formed by Tomato cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>), confirming previous reports [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These findings demonstrate that in these regenerative conditions, Notch1-labeled luminal progenitors reveal a multipotent capacity that cannot be observed in vivo in adult homeostasis. Based on these important results, we also assayed the mammary repopulating ability of sorted GFP<sup>pos</sup> luminal cells when transplanted in the absence of any myoepithelial cell. Given that we found that Notch1-labelled cells undergo a considerable expansion at pregnancy (see <xref rid="pbio.1002069.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), we tested whether the regenerative capacity of sorted ER<sup>neg</sup> progenitors was affected by hormonal stimulation. While only one out of eight outgrowths was obtained in host virgin females transplanted with 10,000 sorted GFP<sup>pos</sup> cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>), when we mated the host mice to induce pregnancy, we significantly increased the mammary repopulating capacity of Notch1-expressing cells, which produced outgrowths in seven out of 11 transplants (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). Remarkably, immunofluorescence analysis of these outgrowths revealed that GFP<sup>pos</sup> cells had generated all mammary lineages, including myoepithelial K5<sup>pos</sup> cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>) and both ERα<sup>pos</sup> and ERα<sup>neg</sup> cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E,F</xref>). These important results reveal the high plasticity of ERα<sup>neg</sup> luminal progenitors and demonstrate that these cells have the ability of generating multiple lineages, although in adult homeostatic conditions they never show multipotency.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The cellular hierarchies between different luminal cell populations in the mammary gland in physiological conditions, as well as the molecular identity and dynamic in vivo behavior of stem and progenitor cells in this rather unique tissue are still not well understood. In this study we identified self-renewing ER<sup>neg</sup> stem cells within the luminal mammary epithelium, able to maintain their precise cellular identity during development and tissue remodeling in pregnancy and involution, suggestive of a tight and long-term genetic and epigenetic memory.</p>
<p>Of relevance, the vast majority of breast cancers are thought to arise from luminal progenitors [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and, as a consequence, the elucidation of the cellular hierarchy of this epithelial compartment in mammary development and adult homeostasis is fundamental to the eventual identification of the cells of origin of different breast tumor subtypes.</p>
<p>Despite the abundance of surface markers proposed to identify mammary cells with clonogenic capacity, the paucity of in vivo lineage tracing experiments has prevented a complete understanding of the developmental fate of these clonogenic cells and their contribution to homeostatic maintenance of the mammary gland. Proteins found to be specifically expressed in clonogenic cells have undeniably helped to discriminate between progenitors and mature luminal cells, but we still do not appreciate their in vivo behavior or the progeny that they physiologically produce at different developmental stages.</p>
<p>Through lineage-tracing studies using the Notch1 promoter, our results reveal the existence of ERα<sup>neg</sup> luminal progenitors that are multipotent during embryonic development and become unipotent after birth (as they never generate myoepithelial nor ERα<sup>pos</sup> cells in adult mice). These cells have extensive self-renewal capacity, they preserve their identity throughout adult life, and are highly responsive to hormones. Importantly, they can repopulate the entire mammary gland in transplantation assays, especially when they are stimulated by pregnancy-induced hormones.</p>
<p>Notably, our results evoke the involvement of a fundamental signaling pathway, like Notch, in retaining long-term cellular memory. In this context, is it important to mention that previous lineage tracing studies on Notch2-labelled [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and Notch3-expressing [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] mammary cells have indicated that, while all these three Notch receptor paralogues are exclusively expressed in the luminal compartment, they seem to define distinct cell types. Indeed, mammary cells labeled by Notch1, Notch2, and Notch3CreERT2<sup>SAT</sup> mice present different molecular features, morphology, localization, and in vivo behavior, unraveling the complexity and diversity of luminal lineages [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Our findings, that postnatally Notch1-expressing luminal progenitors can only give rise to identical progeny that maintains Notch1 expression, are completely unexpected and raise the question of the capacity of the rare ER<sup>pos</sup> progenitors to produce different types of luminal cells. The results we obtained on the in vitro colony-forming potential of several luminal subsets indicate that the CD133<sup>neg</sup> and CD49b<sup>pos</sup> populations comprise two different progenitor subsets: ERα<sup>neg</sup> (which would coincide with the Notch1-expressing cells characterized in this study) and ERα<sup>pos</sup> progenitors (that would be Notch1<sup>neg</sup>) (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>.). The current absence of a mouse line able to exclusively label ER<sup>pos</sup> luminal cells prevents a formal demonstration of the in vivo potential of these cells. However, we have previously reported that the Notch3 receptor was expressed at comparable frequency in both ER<sup>pos</sup> and ER<sup>neg</sup> luminal cells [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. When we carefully analyzed the clones produced in vivo by single Notch3-expressing luminal cells, we found that the vast majority of Notch3-derived clones was composed of either exclusively ER<sup>pos</sup> or ER<sup>neg</sup> cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>.). These results are consistent with a model in which ER<sup>pos</sup> and ER<sup>neg</sup> progenitors can only give rise to ER<sup>pos</sup> or ER<sup>neg</sup> daughter cells, respectively, suggesting that these two populations of adult luminal progenitors define distinct, self-sustaining lineages (<xref rid="pbio.1002069.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>

<title>Proposed model for luminal cell hierarchy during mammary gland development.</title>
<p><bold>(A)</bold> Lineage tracing from embryos reveals that Notch1-expressing (N1<sup>pos</sup>) multipotent stem cells exist only during embryonic mammary development, when they co-express myoepithelial cytokeratin (K5) and luminal cytokeratin (K8). These multipotent stem cells can generate all mammary lineages (labeled in green postnatally). <bold>(B)</bold> After birth, luminal stem cells resolve in two distinct luminal progenitors: ERα<sup>pos</sup> and ERα<sup>neg</sup> cells, which maintain exclusively their own lineage throughout adulthood. Unipotent progenitors lacking ERα expression (ERα<sup>neg</sup>) marked by Notch1 are responsible for generating milk-producing alveoli at pregnancy and define self-renewing luminal cells able to survive mammary gland involution.</p>

</fig>
<p>In this context, it is conceivable that embryonic Notch1-expressing could also represent distinct progenitors that would give rise to the different lineages observed postnatally. Indeed, while clonal tracing experiments in embryos show that Notch1-labeled embryonic cells can generate clones containing both myoepithelial and luminal ER<sup>pos</sup> and ER<sup>neg</sup> cells, it is difficult to rigorously determine if cells labeled with a single fluorophore are indeed part of the same clone or if they belong to two adjacent clones. Our results imply that embryonic mammary cells labeled by Notch1 expression can give rise to both myoepithelial and luminal lineages, but if these progenitors represent a unique cell type or distinct ones that co-express K5 and K8 remains to be established.</p>
<p>Our observations can have important implications for defining the cellular origin of specific breast cancer types. The possibility that a tumor may derive from an ER<sup>pos</sup> or ER<sup>neg</sup> luminal progenitor may dictate its molecular subtype, its growth characteristics and hormonal dependency, as well as its prognosis. Indeed, Molyneux and colleagues found that ER<sup>neg</sup> luminal progenitors, and not basal stem cells, when targeted with a Brca1 mutation in mice, can yield mammary tumors that closely resemble human <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutant (basal-like) breast cancer, at least by histological examination [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In this context, it is noteworthy that, while several studies have reported a penetrant oncogenic effect of constitutively active forms of Notch1 in mammary tumorigenesis [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], the cells from which these tumors originate are not known, as all previous reports have used MMTV-driven transgenes, targeting the whole mammary epithelium. It will be interesting to use the Notch1-CreERT2<sup>SAT</sup> mice described here to specifically induce oncogenic mutations in ERα<sup>neg</sup> luminal progenitors and determine if this can influence the tumor outcome. Our results indicating that Notch1-expressing cells are extremely sensitive to hormonal stimulation and require estrogen to proliferate may partly explain why ectopic Notch activation in the mammary gland results in mammary tumors only upon pregnancy, suggesting that the cells we have characterized in this study may be linked to the increase in human breast cancer found to be associated with pregnancy and may be at the origin of hormonal-dependent human breast cancer subtypes.</p>

<p>The generation of Notch1-CreERT2<sup>SAT</sup> knock-in mice has been previously described [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These mice were crossed to a double fluorescent reporter mouse strain Rosa26<sup>mTomato/mGFP</sup> [<xref rid="pbio.1002069.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], that was obtained by the Jackson Laboratories. For the chase experiments at E15.5, pregnant females were induced with tamoxifen and the embryos were extracted by C-sections at E19.5 and adopted by foster mothers, due to delivery failure caused by tamoxifen. All mice were injected with 0.1mg/g of mouse body weight of tamoxifen free base (Euromedex) as a standard dose or with 1µg/g of mouse body weight to label isolated cells where indicated in the text (also see <xref rid="pbio.1002069.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>.).
