<abstract>
<p>Members of the solute carrier 17 (SLC17) family use divergent mechanisms to concentrate organic anions. Membrane potential drives uptake of the principal excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate into synaptic vesicles, whereas closely related proteins use proton cotransport to drive efflux from the lysosome. To delineate the divergent features of ionic coupling by the SLC17 family, we determined the structure of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> D-galactonate/H<sup>+</sup> symporter D-galactonate transporter (DgoT) in 2 states: one open to the cytoplasmic side and the other open to the periplasmic side with substrate bound. The structures suggest a mechanism that couples H<sup>+</sup> flux to substrate recognition. A transition in the role of H<sup>+</sup> from flux coupling to allostery may confer regulation by trafficking to and from the plasma membrane.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Secondary active transporters couple the movement of ions down their electrochemical gradient to the concentration of substrate. Differences in the mechanism of energy coupling enable them to meet diverse physiological requirements. In general, transporters related in sequence exhibit similar ionic coupling. However, a highly conserved transporter family contains members that use distinct mechanisms of energy coupling to transport substrate in opposite directions, suggesting divergence from a common underlying mechanism.</p>
<p>The concentration of organic anions has a crucial role in diverse biological processes, from nutrient uptake by cells to the packaging of neurotransmitter into secretory vesicles for subsequent release by exocytosis. Members of the solute carrier 17 (SLC17) family catalyze the coupled transport of anions driven by a proton electrochemical gradient Δμ<sub>H+</sub> (= Δψ − 2.3× (RT/F) × ΔpH, where R is the gas constant, T is temperature, and F is Faraday’s constant), with contributions from both electrical potential Δψ and proton gradient ΔpH (pH<sub>o</sub>/pH<sub>i</sub>). To take advantage of environmental conditions, members of the SLC17 family have tuned their response to the available driving force, illustrating an unusual form of adaptive divergence.</p>
<p>SLC17 protein sialin uses H<sup>+</sup> symport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref002">2</xref>] to drive the anion sialic acid out of lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The electroneutrality that derives from coupling to H<sup>+</sup> enables the efflux of negatively charged sialic acid despite a lumen-positive Δψ. In contrast, vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs), also of the SLC17 family, rely on membrane potential Δψ (inside positive) to accumulate the principal excitatory transmitter glutamate inside synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref006">6</xref>]. In this case, glutamate uptake occurs against the outwardly directed H<sup>+</sup> gradient. The VGLUTs thus exhibit a dependence on components of Δμ<sub>H+</sub> different from that of other SLC17 family members such as sialin. Sialin has itself been reported to confer vesicular transport of aspartate and glutamate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref008">8</xref>]. Although the physiological significance remains uncertain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref010">10</xref>], this finding would suggest that a single protein can catalyze both activities. The VGLUTs also differ from other vesicular neurotransmitter transporters (not of the SLC17 family) that act as H<sup>+</sup> exchangers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref011">11</xref>]. They nonetheless retain a pH dependence that limits their activity to uptake by acidic compartments such as synaptic vesicles and prevents nonvesicular glutamate efflux across the plasma membrane, where the pH is neutral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref012">12</xref>].</p>

<title>Coupled D-gal:H<sup>+</sup> cotransport by <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> DgoT.</title>
<p>(A) Diagram illustrating transport by sialin (left) and a VGLUT (right). A vacuolar-type H<sup>+</sup> pump provides the H<sup>+</sup> electrochemical driving force for both activities, but sialin uses the pH gradient to drive electroneutral cotransport of sialic acid with H<sup>+</sup> out of the lysosome whereas the VGLUTs rely on membrane potential to drive glutamate uptake by synaptic vesicles against a pH gradient. (B, C) Liposomes containing pyr at pH 7.5 were reconstituted with (+) or without (−) <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> DgoT and added to reaction buffer at pH 5.5. gal, glu (both 10 mM), or buffer alone were added at <italic>t</italic> = 0. The fluorescence emission at 510 nm with excitation at 460 nm was normalized to excitation at 415 nm (the isosbestic point for pyr versus pH). (B) The representative change in fluorescence ratio shows that D-gal but not glu or buffer control reduce the lumenal pH of proteoliposomes reconstituted with DgoT but not empty liposomes. Bar graph (right) shows the average rate of fluorescence change for glu and buffer relative to gal (<italic>n</italic> = 6). ****<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001.

<p>How do different components of Δμ<sub>H+</sub> drive transport in different directions through closely related proteins? Mammalian transport proteins of the SLC17 family show up to 27% sequence identity to bacterial relatives. Although of undefined function, many of the bacterial SLC17 genes occur within operons dedicated to the metabolism of acidic sugars such as galactonic, glucaric, and galacturonic acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref013">13</xref>]. To understand how the SLC17 family has adapted to divergent roles in metabolism and neurotransmitter transport, we determined the crystal structures of a D-galactonate transporter in 2 conformers.</p>

<title>DgoT is a proton symporter highly selective for D-galactonate</title>
<p>The D-galactonate transporter (DgoT) gene lies within an operon devoted to the metabolism of D-galactonate, suggesting a role in transport of this acidic sugar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref014">14</xref>]. Because the ionic coupling was not known, we reconstituted purified, recombinant DgoT into liposomes containing the pH-sensitive fluorophore 8-hydroxypyrene-trisulfonate (pyranine; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000260.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). With an inwardly directed H<sup>+</sup> gradient, addition of D-galactonate outside quenches the fluorescence of lumenal pyranine, indicating galactonate/H<sup>+</sup> cotransport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Without DgoT, without D-galactonate, or with the galactonate epimer gluconate, there is no effect on the pyranine fluorescence of proteoliposomes, suggesting high selectivity for galactonate. Because entry of the anion galactonate might alone create the inwardly negative Δψ that drives H<sup>+</sup> influx, we tested the coupling between galactonate and H<sup>+</sup> by adding galactonate to proteoliposomes with an outwardly directed H<sup>+</sup> gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Under these conditions, galactonate still quenches the pyranine fluorescence of proteoliposomes but not control liposomes, indicating that translocation of H<sup>+</sup> and galactonate are coupled by DgoT, not by changes in Δψ. Further excluding a role for Δψ in the acidification by galactonate, dissipation of Δψ by the K<sup>+</sup> ionophore valinomycin increases fluorescence quenching by galactonate (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g001">1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000260.s001">S1</xref>). Indeed, the stimulation by valinomycin shows that Δψ opposes galactonate/H<sup>+</sup> influx, suggesting that DgoT moves net charge, presumably positive. The transport activity demonstrates that purified DgoT is functional, enabling its use for structural studies. In addition, the H<sup>+</sup> cotransport mechanism indicates similarity to the lysosomal sialic acid/H<sup>+</sup> cotransporter sialin. Unlike electroneutral sialin, however, the effect of membrane potential on DgoT activity suggests that galactonate flux is coupled to the movement of more than one H<sup>+</sup>.</p>

<title>Open inward structure of wild-type DgoT</title>
<p>To determine the structure of DgoT, the wild type (WT) protein was crystallized at pH 5.35, in an inward-open conformation and crystal space group P2<sub>1</sub>. Nonsubstrate gluconate improved the diffraction, and it as well as β-nonylglucoside (β-NG) were identified nonspecifically within the aqueous cavity of the structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000260.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). The structure was determined to a resolution of 2.9 × 3.8 × 3.8 Å by molecular replacement (MR) trials based on all available major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters in turn because the MFS typically each crystallize in different parts of the transport cycle. The correct MR solution derived from a polyalanine model of (inward facing) Glycerol-3-phosphate transporter (GlpT; 1PW4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref016">16</xref>] and was subsequently built and refined to an R-factor/Rfree of 24.9%/29.7% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000260.s009">S1 Table</xref>). The asymmetric unit contains 2 almost identical, antiparallel monomers of DgoT, with 4 molecules of β-nonylglucoside (β-NG) between the 2 molecules of DgoT and a root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of 0.57 Å between their congruent 392 Cα atoms.</p>
<p>The structure contains residues 27 through 443, lacking a 6–amino acid unstructured cytoplasmic loop (residues 235–242) between transmembrane (TM) domains 6 and 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). DgoT is composed of 12 TM helices and belongs to the MFS fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref017">17</xref>]. Two 6-helix bundles (N- and C-terminal domains) are related by a pseudo 2-fold symmetry axis perpendicular to the membrane plane.

<title>Proton flux to an N-terminal polar pocket</title>
<p>Although the main cavity of the inwardly oriented structure is sealed to the outside, the N-terminal lobe of DgoT contains a tunnel that extends from the periplasmic surface near glutamate-180 (Glu180; TM5) to a membrane-embedded site at aspartate-46 (Asp46; TM1; Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g002">2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g002">2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000260.s004">S4</xref>). The average diameter of the tunnel near its entrance (3.6 Å) and exit (5.0 Å) suggests accessibility to a line of water molecules. Polar residues lining the entrance (Glu59, glutamine-179 [Gln179], Glu180), interior (threonine-172 [Thr172], Thr297), and exit (Asp46) have the potential to interact with H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> and could therefore facilitate H<sup>+</sup> transport. On the other hand, residues phenylalanine-278 (Phe278), proline-279 (Pro279), and Thr297 reduce the tunnel diameter to 2.4 Å, about the diameter of a water molecule (2.75 Å; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), suggesting a dynamic mechanism to control access of H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> from the periplasm. A positively charged region near Pro279 will also raise the energy barrier for H<sup>+</sup> movement toward the site of potential protonation at Asp46 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000260.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). With its side chain carboxyl sequestered, Asp46 is predicted to have a pKa of approximately 6.0 (H++ server) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref021">21</xref>], and this could be much higher due to screening by the lipid bilayer. Thus, Asp46 is most probably protonated (uncharged) in this structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g002">Fig 2</xref>).</p>
<p>At the end of the tunnel, a pocket of conserved polar residues buried within the membrane-spanning region of the N-terminal domain lies adjacent to Asp46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>). In this pocket, residues conserved between sialin and the VGLUTs include arginine-47 (Arg47; TM1), Arg126, and Glu133 (TM4). However, Asp46 itself is not conserved in metazoan SLC17 proteins, suggesting it may contribute to the difference in function between family members. The buried Glu133 residue has a predicted pKa of approximately 8.1 (H++ server) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref021">21</xref>], suggesting that it is protonated. Although Arg47 is directly adjacent, the structure thus indicates that the 2 residues do not form a charge pair in this inward-facing state. Multiple TM helices contribute less well conserved residues to this unusual charged pocket buried in the <italic>trans</italic>-bilayer region, including asparagine-49 (Asn49; TM1), Thr110, Gln113 (TM3), and Thr129 (TM4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g002">Fig 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>To test the functional significance of Asp46 and Glu133 for galactonate transport by DgoT, we replaced each separately by an uncharged residue (asparagine [D46N] and glutamine [E133Q], respectively) to mimic the electroneutrality of their protonated states. Reconstituting these purified proteins into liposomes, D46N and E133Q each reduce acidification by D-galactonate to the level observed with nontransported gluconate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g003">Fig 3A</xref>).</p>

<p>To characterize galactonate transport by DgoT rather than rely on H<sup>+</sup> flux to infer its properties, we developed a quantitative assay based on radiotracer uptake. Expressed in the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> DgoT mutant, WT DgoT confers robust uptake of <sup>14</sup>C-galactonate relative to empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Using this assay, we reexamined the substrate specificity of DgoT by competition. Nonradioactive galactonate (1 mM) eliminates uptake of <sup>14</sup>C-galactonate, whereas epimer gluconate or cyclized neutral sugar galactose (10 mM) has no effect, supporting the remarkable specificity for galactonate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). However, high levels (100 mM) of gluconate do eliminate uptake, indicating some recognition of the epimer. The Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) for galactonate is indeed 18 ± 4 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), approximately 100-fold lower than for glutamate transport by the VGLUTs (1–3 mM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref015">15</xref>] and approximately 20-fold lower than for sialic acid transport by sialin (approximately 0.5 mM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref002">2</xref>], tuning the Km values to the respective available substrate concentrations. To assess energy coupling by DgoT, we monitored <sup>14</sup>C-galactonate uptake into spheroplasts. The H<sup>+</sup> ionophore nigericin that dissipates the proton gradient ΔpH eliminates transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Dissipation of Δψ with the K<sup>+</sup> ionophore valinomycin also eliminates galactonate uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g004">Fig 4C</xref>), supporting the electrogenic nature of DgoT suggested by H<sup>+</sup> flux measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>

<p>Consistent with the absence of H<sup>+</sup> flux, D46N and E133Q DgoT also accumulate very little <sup>14</sup>C-galactonate in the radiotracer assay (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g003">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000260.s008">S8</xref>).

<title>Substrate binding stabilizes the occluded state</title>
<p>The position of Glu133 at the end of the putative H<sup>+</sup> tunnel, its importance for active transport, and its proximity to Arg47 facing the substrate cavity suggested that Glu133 might occupy a central role coupling H<sup>+</sup> flux to transport of D-galactonate. We were able to crystallize E133Q DgoT with D-galactonate bound. At pH 9.0, this complex crystallized in an outward-facing conformation, in a different crystal form than for the WT protein alone, and refined to an R-factor/Rfree of 28.5%/30.0% at 3.5 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g005">Fig 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000260.s009">S1 Table</xref>). There are 2 independent copies of the protein in each asymmetric unit. This is the case in each of the 2 crystal forms; i.e., there are 2 independent structures of the molecule in each of the 2 molecular configurations. In each of the 2 major domains within each molecule, the congruence of intramolecular contacts and hydrogen bonds (i.e., 4 independent observations) provide strong cross-validation of intradomain interactions. As with the inward-open conformation, 2 essentially identical monomers (rmsd of 0.63 Å between their 345 Cα atoms) pack in pairs closely against each other sharing contacts from the lipophilic surface but in an antiparallel arrangement in the asymmetric unit (i.e., one molecule with its cytoplasmic side up packs against another with its cytoplasmic side down in a noncrystallographic 2-fold orientation). The structure includes residues 24 to 443 except for the 11–amino acid dynamic region in the cytoplasmic loop (residues 231–243) and 13–amino acid periplasmic end of TM7 (residues 276–291). In both conformations, the substrate cavity has a positive electrostatic surface potential to match the negatively charged substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>).

<p>In the outward-facing structure, Arg47 (TM1) forms a direct electrostatic interaction with the carboxyl group in D-galactonate through a 3.6 Å salt bridge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Arg47 is conserved in almost all other members of the SLC17 family from bacteria to mammals, consistent with this role. The 3.6 Å distance between the ε-NH<sub>2</sub> of Arg47 in DgoT and the galactonate carboxyl suggests that the salt bridge is primarily electrostatic and may not involve hydrogen bonds, perhaps maintaining specificity without an affinity too high for rapid flux. In addition, conserved tyrosine-79 (Tyr79) coordinates the carboxyl group, suggesting a common role for these 2 residues in recognition of the carboxyl across the SLC17 family (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g006">6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000260.s003">S3</xref>).

<p>Four residues (Asn393, Gln264, serine-370 [Ser370], and Gln164) provide 8 hydrogen bonds with the 5 substrate −OH groups and confer high specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). The geometry of the stereogenic center C4-OH recognized by Asn393 in TM11 and the less conserved Gln264 in TM7 may account for the selectivity for galactonate over its epimer gluconate to compete with galactonate. The different geometry of gluconate in a solution may also contribute. In contrast to sugar transporters that generally segregate H<sup>+</sup> and substrate translocation to different lobes, both N-terminal (Tyr 44 and Arg47 from TM1, Tyr79 from TM2, and Gln164 from TM5) and C-terminal domains (Gln264 from TM7, Ser370 from TM10, and Asn393 from TM11) of DgoT thus participate in substrate recognition.</p>

Aromatic residues Phe137 in TM4 and tryptophan-373 (Trp373) in TM10 both make hydrophobic interactions with the aliphatic surface of D-galactonate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g006">Fig 6A and 6C</xref>). Removing the aromatic side chain in the equivalent phenylalanine residue of sialin increases the Km 15-fold (and the maximal rate (Vmax) 3-fold) for the physiological substrate glucuronic acid, with little effect on transport of sialic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref024">24</xref>], supporting a role in substrate recognition and transport.</p>
<p>Comparing the 2 structures reveals hinges in TM4 and TM10 that accommodate changes associated with alternating access and substrate binding. In the outward-facing conformation, TM4 has a kink at Pro135, whereas TM10 is continuous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g006">Fig 6C and 6E</xref>). In the inward-facing conformation, TM4 is continuous, whereas TM10 has a kink (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g006">6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000260.s005">S5</xref>). In the outward-facing and substrate-bound state, Trp373 interacts with Ser377 (in TM10) and isoleucine-385 (Ile385) from TM11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Helical kinks are also seen in sugar transporters of the MFS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref020">20</xref>], although in these proteins, the kinks occur within a single domain, perhaps because only that domain participates in substrate recognition.</p>
<p>Arg47 interacts with the substrate carboxyl in the outwardly oriented E133Q structure, but the residue occupies the same position relative to the rest of the N-terminal lobe as observed in the inwardly oriented state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000260.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Protonation of Glu133 thus enables Arg47 to remain associated with D-galactonate without a major change in position of the TM1 arginine. However, the position of other residues that contact galactonate, especially F137 and W373, shows apparent movement between the 2 states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000260.s005">S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000260.s006">S6</xref> Figs). In addition to the rotation in TM7, this movement in the substrate site closes the main cytoplasmic gate thereby occluding the substrate from both periplasmic and cytoplasmic sides.</p>
<p>The outwardly oriented structure lacks the putative H<sup>+</sup> tunnel observed in the inwardly oriented state. The N- and C-terminal lobes that line the periplasmic entry site separate in the outwardly oriented structure, and the remaining tunnel is blocked (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000260.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). However, it is plausible that closure of the tunnel secures protonation of the buried carboxyls as a key part of the cycle. The critical Glu133 has no clear access to the main substrate cavity in either structure (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g006">6</xref>), consistent with the existence of distinct pathways, separated in time and space, for galactonate and H<sup>+</sup>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A critical question is how DgoT and sialin cotransport H<sup>+</sup> with substrate, whereas the VGLUTs concentrate anion in a direction opposite the H<sup>+</sup> electrochemical gradient. The 2 conformations of DgoT suggest a pathway for H<sup>+</sup> translocation by the SLC17 family. The inward-facing WT structure has a tunnel capable of water-mediated H<sup>+</sup> movement from the periplasmic space to a polar pocket in the N-terminal lobe. This putative H<sup>+</sup> pathway terminates at Asp46, which may serve as a possible conduit for H<sup>+</sup> to nearby Glu133, a residue highly conserved among SLC17 family members from bacteria to mammals, including the VGLUTs and sialin. Protons may access these acidic residues from the main vestibule rather than through the putative tunnel, but the crystal structures do not reveal an obvious alternate pathway. Because coupled ions in symporters generally access from the same side as the substrate, the presence of a H<sup>+</sup> tunnel to the periplasm despite inward orientation to the cytoplasm makes DgoT unusual among solute carriers. Although we do not know the significance, this configuration could confer the potential for coupling to different steps of the transport cycle (e.g., reorientation of the empty carrier to the outside), allosteric activation, or even transport in different directions (as in the VGLUTs).</p>
<p>In both structures, Glu133 is sequestered from the solvent, so it is predicted to have a high pKa and be protonated. Mutation of either Asp46 (D46N) or Glu133 (E133Q) to mimic their neutral and/or protonated state eliminates active transport. Because sensitivity to valinomycin indicates that transport is electrogenic and suggests coupling to more than a single H<sup>+</sup>, Asp46 and Glu133 are candidates for transport of these protons. It is important to note that coupled to H<sup>+</sup>, DgoT concentrates substrate driven by a negative Δψ, in contrast to the positive Δψ that drives glutamate uniport by the VGLUTs.</p>
<p>We have not determined the stoichiometry of H<sup>+</sup>:D-galactonate transport by DgoT, but thermodynamic considerations help us to understand the number of protons that could be driven uphill by a galactonate gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>), with implications for the concentration gradient of D-galactonate that could be produced in <italic>E</italic>.<italic>coli</italic>. The electrochemical gradient of protons across the membrane is composed of interconvertible electrical and chemical components according to Δµ<sub>H+</sub> = Δψ − 2.3 (RT/F) ΔpH, where 2.3 RT/F is 58.8 mV at 20°C.</p>
<p>Moving a single charge across an electrochemical gradient E = 58.8 mV corresponds to <italic>N</italic>eE<sub>m</sub> = FE<sub>m</sub>, approximately 1.4 kcal/mol of free energy. To move a proton uphill against ΔpH of 0.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), when Δψ = 0 (in the presence of valinomycin) thus requires 0.3 × 1.4 = +0.42 kcal/mol. Without valinomycin, transport is reduced as opposing Δψ develops due to excess positive charge, suggesting that the H<sup>+</sup>/D-galactonate stoichiometry is greater than 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref027">27</xref>]. A 10:1 gradient (out:in) of D-galactonate would provide a chemical-free energy of ΔG<sup>0</sup><sub>f</sub> = RT ln(C<sub>in</sub>/C<sub>out</sub>) = 1.4 log<sub>10</sub>(C<sub>in</sub>/C<sub>out</sub>) kcal/mole = −1.4 kcal/mol. Therefore, this gradient could pump approximately 2 to 3 H<sup>+</sup> against the initial ΔpH of 0.3, consistent with electrogenic transport and the observed stoichiometry of &gt;1. In <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> at external pH of approximately 5.5, internal pH of approximately 7.5 (and hence ΔpH = 2), Δψ = −60 mV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref029">29</xref>], and electroneutral cotransport of a single proton by DgoT would contribute ΔG<sup>0</sup><sub>f</sub> of approximately −2.8 kcal/mol and produce a galactonate gradient of approximately 100:1. If the stoichiometry were 2 H<sup>+</sup> per substrate, the resulting electrogenic transport would contribute ΔG<sup>0</sup><sub>f</sub> of approximately 7 kcal/mol to produce a galactonate gradient of approximately 10<sup>5</sup>:1.</p>
<p>At pH 7.5 outside, when ΔpH = 0 and Δμ<sub>H+</sub> ≈ −100 mV, all due to Δψ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref029">29</xref>], this would result in equilibration of galactonate (i.e., no gradient of galactonate) if driven by cotransport of a single H<sup>+</sup> and hence no net charge movement. However, electrogenic transport driven by 2 H<sup>+</sup> would contribute ΔG<sup>0</sup><sub>f</sub> of approximately 2.3 kcal/mol (due only to Δψ) to generate a gradient of approximately 50:1. Thus thermodynamic considerations help us to understand the physiological rationale for a H<sup>+</sup> stoichiometry great than 1.</p>
<p>In the outward-open substrate-bound structure, Arg47 in DgoT interacts with the carboxyl on the anionic substrate and is highly conserved among other SLC17 members from bacteria to mammals. Two exceptions are the mammalian transporters SLC17A3 and SLC17A4, in which the equivalent residue is, respectively, asparagine and glutamine. These proteins transport organic anions, some of which (e.g., uric acid) do not contain a carboxyl group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref031">31</xref>], supporting a specific role for the TM1 arginine in DgoT and other SLC17 proteins in recognition of the substrate carboxyl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref033">33</xref>]. In total, 9 hydrogen bonds contribute directly to substrate recognition, of which 3 are donors to the carboxyl, and the remaining 6 can be acceptors to each of the substrate −OH groups, conferring the high specificity observed. In addition, both N- and C-terminal domains of DgoT participate in substrate recognition, whereas sugar transporters generally segregate H<sup>+</sup> and substrate translocation to different lobes. Furthermore, comparison of the 2 structures shows that major conformational changes and local movement around the substrate site occur to accommodate substrate for transport.</p>
<p>The 2 structures and the functional effects of mutations suggest a mechanism for coupling H<sup>+</sup> to substrate translocation in the transport cycle. In the outward-facing conformation of DgoT, Glu133 is protonated. As a result, Arg47 can provide the positive charge required to complement the incoming substrate carboxyl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g007">Fig 7</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref034">34</xref>]. Sequestration of the substrate then stabilizes the neutral, protonated state of Glu133, consistent with the high pKa of the buried carboxyl inaccessible to the solvent. The transporter then reorients to the cytoplasmic side, where it releases substrate and H<sup>+</sup>. Similar to substrate, cytoplasmic release of H<sup>+</sup> may occur from the substrate cavity, in contrast to the apparently specialized pathway from the periplasm. Glu133 must therefore deprotonate to enable movement of the empty transporter, a reduction in its pKa (by occlusion with water) accompanying formation of a charge pair with Arg47. Thus, Glu133 may release H<sup>+</sup> via water to the side that closes when and only when Arg47 does not interact with substrate. After reorientation of the empty carrier from inside to out, another H<sup>+</sup> enters, displacing the H<sup>+</sup> bound at Asp46 to Glu133 so that external substrate can again bind.</p>

<title>Proposed mechanism for coupling H<sup>+</sup> to substrate translocation.</title>
<p>Mechanism described counterclockwise from top left. In the outwardly oriented, occluded structure (top left), both Asp46 (D) and Glu133 (E) are protonated (H), liberating Arg47 (R) to interact with the anionic substrate (Dgal<sup>−</sup>) and transition from outward-facing to inward-facing conformation (bottom left). Release of substrate into the cytoplasm is captured in the inward-facing structure (bottom middle). Deprotonation of Glu133 could then enable the formation of a charge pair with Arg47 (bottom right) and so facilitate the transition of the empty transporter to the outward-facing state (top right). To account for electrogenic transport, we presume that Asp46 would also lose a H<sup>+</sup> to the inside before this transition of the empty carrier. After reorientation to the outward-facing state, reprotonation of Asp46 and Glu133 (top middle) would allow Arg47 to interact with substrate (top left) and complete the cycle. We presume that the H<sup>+</sup> tunnel to the periplasm occurs in the outward (as well as inward) orientation, before occlusion of the substrate, although we do not know whether proton(s) use this pathway or the main cavity to access the N-terminal polar pocket with Asp46 and Glu133. Arrows indicate the direction for inward uptake, although all the reactions are reversible. The VGLUTs lack an acidic residue in TM1 equivalent to Asp46 in DgoT and hence do not couple to H<sup>+</sup>. However, they contain a glu in TM4 equivalent to Glu133, and analogy with DgoT suggests that protonation of this site from the outside could allow the Arg in TM1 to bind neurotransmitter and facilitate transport. Protonation and deprotonation of a surrogate of Glu133 from the same side could account for allosteric activation of the VGLUTs by H<sup>+</sup>. This, in turn, could account for the efficient glu transport activity by synaptic vesicles, which is then inhibited by the higher pH in the synapse after vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane.

<p>The VGLUTs show conservation of Arg47, Arg126, and residues that contact galactonate in DgoT. The arginine in TM4 plays a critical role in glutamate transport by VGLUT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref035">35</xref>] as well as in sialic acid transport by sialin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref024">24</xref>]. Of the 2 key protonatable residues in DgoT (Asp46, Glu133), the VGLUTs (which are not driven by proton flux) contain only the highly conserved glutamate in TM4 (equivalent to Glu133 in DgoT) that is required for glutamate transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref036">36</xref>]. The VGLUTs thus retain the crucial H<sup>+</sup> binding site of bacterial relatives (Glu133 in DgoT) and sialin. The VGLUTs function in an acidic environment, and protonation of Glu133 could be the titratable site for allosteric activation by H<sup>+</sup> that we have previously observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref012">12</xref>]. Indeed, mammalian SLC17 proteins that operate at the plasma membrane (e.g., Na+-dependent phosphate transporter (NPT) 1–4) lack the conserved glutamate in TM4 and do not depend on low pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref037">37</xref>]. These observations suggest that, very similar to their role in coupled transport, H<sup>+</sup> may allosterically activate the VGLUTs by protonation of the TM4 glutamate for translocation of the loaded carrier and by deprotonation of the same site for reorientation of the empty carrier. The difference between the 2 mechanisms is that H<sup>+</sup> are not coupled to glutamate transport, and VGLUTs indeed lack the Asp46 required for coupled transport by DgoT.</p>
<p>The structures also help us to understand the effect of mutations in the lysosomal H<sup>+</sup> symporter sialin, which mediates efflux of sialic acid, a monosaccharide essential for oligosaccharide synthesis. Mutations in sialin cause a storage disease due to ineffective export and hence lysosomal accumulation of sialic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref038">38</xref>]. The H183R mutation in human sialin prevents efflux of sialic acid, leading to infantile sialic acid storage disease (ISSD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref039">39</xref>]. This mutation eliminates transport activity with no effect on sialin expression or localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref002">2</xref>]. DgoT contains an asparagine at the equivalent position in TM4, and this residue (Asn141) forms hydrogen bonds with TM10 through the hydroxyl group of Ser377 and the backbone carbonyl of Trp373, thereby positioning Trp373 to interact with the substrate directly (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g006">6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g006">6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000260.s005">S5</xref>). Thus, the H183R mutation in sialin would impair cytoplasmic closure of the aqueous cavity and so inhibit outward opening of sialin, accounting for the loss of transport activity and the severe clinical phenotype.</p>
<p>Sialin and the VGLUTs (but not the sugar transporters) also contain sequences corresponding to DgoT ICH1 and, to a slightly lesser extent, ICH2. The R39C mutation in sialin causes a milder sialic acid storage disorder, Salla disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref039">39</xref>]. In contrast to H183R, R39C reduces but does not eliminate transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref002">2</xref>]. The corresponding residue Arg29 in DgoT lies at the cytoplasmic end of TM1, surrounded by conserved residues in TM5 and ICH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). It forms a salt bridge with Glu152 in TM5. Thus, the R29C mutation in DgoT would disrupt interactions between TM1, TM5, and ICH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). Conserved residues Glu219 and Tyr222 in the ICH1 domain form salt bridges with, respectively, Arg28 (TM1) and His151 (loop between TM4 and TM5). ICH1 thus provides an alternative mechanism to connect TM1 and TM5. As a result, the R39C mutation in sialin might be expected to impair but not eliminate the tripartite interactions between TM1, TM5, and ICH1, accounting for the Salla disease phenotype.</p>
<p>In summary, the 2 structures of DgoT suggest a common mechanism for divergent ionic coupling by the SLC17 family: protonation of Glu133 effectively releases Arg47 to bind and translocate substrate. If there is no substrate bound, Glu133 must give up its H<sup>+</sup> so that it can form a charge pair with Arg47 and reorient empty to complete the transport cycle. Thus, translocation of the conjoint substrate site—loaded with substrate or empty—mandates neutralization of Arg47 and Glu133, either by binding of substrate to Arg47 and protonation of Glu133 or by formation of a charge pair between deprotonated, charged Glu133 and Arg47.</p>

HiLiDe-treated DgoT was crystallized via hanging drop methods in a 96-well crystallization plate (Greiner) using the TTP mosquito (TTP Labtech). For hanging drops, 150 nl 5 mg/ml protein was mixed with 150-nl–well solution containing 39% PEG 400 and 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.35) and grown at 4°C. Initially, small, rod-shaped crystals grew and disappeared within 2 to 3 days, possibly reflecting sensitivity to precipitant concentration that occurs through vapor diffusion. To grow larger and more stable crystals, 50 μl of Al’s oil (Hampton Research, Viejo, CA) was placed over the well solution to slow vapor diffusion. Also, DgoT was pre-incubated with 10 mM sodium gluconate (Sigma) on ice for 10 minutes prior to crystallization set-up.

The resolution for reporting data and refinement statistics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000260.s009">S1 Table</xref>) is based on the statistically significant correlation coefficient value of CC<sub>1/2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref043">43</xref>]. If resolution cut-off is based on the criterion of &lt;I/σ(I)&gt; <italic>&gt;</italic> 1 the resolution is reduced to 3.5 Å. However, the quality of the electron density maps shows details in places as in a 2.9 Å density map.</p>
<p>For E133Q crystals, data sets were recorded on a Pilatus3 detector, and because this involved 3,600 images, the XDS package is more appropriate for the processing, integration, and scaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref044">44</xref>]. The space group was C2 (<italic>n</italic> = 2). Post-processing for anisotropic data was not necessary. These crystals diffracted isotropically but to a more limited highest resolution of 3.5 Å. This resolution limit was determined by statistical significance of the CC<sub>1/2</sub> criterion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref043">43</xref>]. Despite the low &lt;I/σ(I)&gt; = 0.2 and the low CC<sub>1/2</sub> (0.16) data in the outer shell, it is still statistically significant. If resolution cut-off is based on the criterion of &lt;I/σ(I)&gt; <italic>&gt;</italic>1, the resolution would be reduced to 4.0 Å. The quality of the map shows details as in a 3.5 Å map.</p>
<p>Both DgoT structures were determined by MR using Phaser-MR (PHENIX). For the inward-facing structure, phases were determined by Phaser-MR (PHENIX) using a poly-alanine model of the crystal structure of GlpT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref016">16</xref>] (PDB ID: 1PW4) that is 24% sequence identical as a search model. The unit cell volume indicated the presence of 2 molecules in the asymmetric unit, with a solvent content of 70%. Initial phases yielded an electron density map that identified 12 TM helices suggesting the secondary structure of MFS transporters. Reiterative model building in COOT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref045">45</xref>] followed by refinement runs in phenix.refine (PHENIX) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref046">46</xref>] programs were used. For initial refinement strategies, rigid-body refinement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref047">47</xref>], individual B-factor refinement, simulated-annealing refinement (torsion: 2,500 K start; 300 K final; 25 steps), and translation libration screw (TLS) rotation model refinement were used. PHENIX-autobuild was used in calculating iterative-build composite omit maps followed by intermittent simulated-annealing composite omit maps to reduce model bias during building [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref049">49</xref>]. Once Rfree reached approximately 32%, hydrogens were added to the model and were refined using individual B-factor refinement with X-ray and/or stereochemistry target weight optimization. The final model of DgoT includes residues 10 to 219 and 229 to 427 and has an R<sub>free</sub> value of 29.7%.</p>
<p>For the outward-facing E133Q structure, the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of the WT DgoT structure were separately used as search models for MR. Two molecules in the asymmetric unit were identified similar to WT. Initial phases yielded an electron density map that identified the 12 TM helices and the 2 ICHs, but in a different structural arrangement than WT, suggesting a different conformation. Initial refinement was performed using TLS and restrained refinement with 50 to 100 cycles of jelly-body refinement implemented in Refmac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref050">50</xref>] along with ProSMART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref051">51</xref>] to produce general fragment-based restraints for low-resolution refinement. Once Rfree reached approximately 35%, additional refinement under PHENIX was done using rigid-body refinement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref047">47</xref>], individual B-factor refinement, and TLS refinement. D-galactonate assignment was guided using 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc maps. All structural figures were generated using PyMol (Schrödinger, New York, NY). Composite SA omit map (−100 Å2) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000260.g004">Fig 4A</xref> was B-factor sharpened (PHENIX). Electrostatic potential surfaces were calculated using APBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref052">52</xref>].

<title>Sodium D-galactonate preparation</title>
<p>To our knowledge, the only commercially available form of D-galactonate is the insoluble calcium salt. We therefore used previously reported methods to produce the Na<sup>+</sup> salt from Ca<sup>2+</sup> D-galactonate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref054">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref055">55</xref>]. Briefly, 10 g Ca<sup>2+</sup> D-galactonate (City Chemical, West Haven, CT) was resuspended in 100 ml water. An equimolar amount of oxalic acid dihydrate (2.93 g; Sigma, Burlington, MA) was added to the mixture and stirred for 10 minutes at 55°C. The precipitated calcium oxalate was then separated from aqueous D-galactonic acid by filtration under vacuum through 0.22 μm nylon. Sodium hydroxide was titrated into the solution to pH 7. Absolute ethanol was added in a 3:1 (v/v) ratio, the mixture stored at 4°C overnight, and the resulting crystalline precipitate removed by filtration and washed with absolute ethanol. The precipitate was dried for 24 hours in a vacuum desiccator. The resulting crystalline Na<sup>+</sup> D-galactonate was then stored at room temperature for subsequent use. The crystalline precipitate was analyzed by <sup>1</sup>H-NMR using a Bruker 400 mHz Avance III HD spectrometer, confirming the purity of Na<sup>+</sup> D-galactonate.</p>

<title>DgoT reconstitution and transport assay</title>
<p>Purified DgoT was reconstituted using preformed vesicles permeabilized with Triton X-100 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000260.ref056">56</xref>]. Briefly, 10 mg <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> polar lipids (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) were dissolved in 1 ml chloroform, dried first under nitrogen and then under vacuum overnight. The dried lipid film was rehydrated in 1 ml 0.5 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG)-methanesulfonate (a large organic cation that should not permeate), 2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and 0.5 mM pyranine (reconstitution buffer) by incubating at 37°C for 30 minutes and resuspended through pipetting. To form unilamellar vesicles, the lipid suspension was subjected to 4 cycles of freeze-thaw, alternating between liquid nitrogen and 25°C, with sonication in a water bath for 5 minutes between freeze-thaw cycles. The lipids were then extruded through a 200 or 400 nm filter, sonicated for 5 minutes, and finally extruded through a 100 nm filter. The extrusions both involved 20 passages through each filter.</p>
<p>To prepare proteoliposomes, the liposomes were destabilized by adding 0.6% (v/v) Triton X-100 and incubated at 4°C overnight under gentle nutation. Purified DgoT was added to the destabilized liposomes at a 1:30 protein:lipid (w:w) ratio and incubated for 1 hour at 4°C. To extract detergent, SM2 Bio-beads (Bio-rad, Hercules, CA) were added sequentially in 4 steps. First, 200 mg SM2 Bio-beads were added and incubated for 1 hour at 4°C. This addition was repeated once (step 2) followed by the addition of 400 mg SM2 Bio-beads for an additional 2 hours (step 3). For the final step, 600 mg SM2 Bio-beads were added and incubated overnight. To remove unincorporated pyranine and the Bio-beads, the proteoliposome mixture was separated using a 10-DG desalting column (Bio-rad, Hercules, CA), eluting with 4 ml pyranine-free reconstitution buffer according to the manufacturer’s protocol.</p>
<p>To measure transport by DgoT, an inwardly directed H<sup>+</sup> gradient was produced by adding 200 μl proteoliposomes into a cuvette containing 1.35 ml 0.5 mM MES (pH 5.5), 150 mM NMDG methanesulfonate, and 5 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub> (reaction buffer). Transport was initiated by adding 50 μl D-galactonate or D-gluconate in reaction buffer, and uptake was monitored at 30°C by measuring the fluorescence emission at 510 nm upon dual excitation at 415 nm (F1) and 460 nm (F2). The fluorescence data were collected at 0.7-second intervals using a F-4500 fluorimeter (Hitachi). The ratio of fluorescence emission at the 2 excitation wavelengths (F2/F1) was normalized to the initial ratio (F2<sub>o</sub>/F1<sub>o</sub>) and the results plotted as 1 − [(F2/F1)/(F2<sub>o</sub>/F1<sub>o</sub>)] (as a percentage), with galactonate added at <italic>t</italic> = 0. To assess coupling between galactonate and H<sup>+</sup>, we used the same conditions but with lumenal pH 7.2 and external pH 7.5 (both buffered with Hepes rather than MES), 5 mM K<sup>+</sup> in both lumenal and external solutions, with or without 0.2 μM valinomycin. The fluorescence measurements at the low pH were performed in triplicate on multiple occasions. The fluorescence measurements at the higher pH were performed using 2 reconstitutions, and the initial rates were determined by subtracting the drift in fluorescence before galactonate addition from the time points after. Subtracted data were fitted to the equation y = A + B(x) + Ce<sup>−D(x)</sup>, which contains a single exponential decay component [Ce<sup>−D(x)</sup>] plus a linear term [A + B(x)] that better fits the rate of decay in liposome controls.</p>

<p>The expression of DgoT protein was monitored by immunoblotting with a polyhistidine antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP; Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands) and the chemiluminescent detection of HRP monitored with a ChemiDoc MP imaging system (Bio-rad, Hercules, CA). The absolute amounts of WT and mutant DgoT expression were estimated by comparing the band intensities of each to a serial dilution of purified DgoT (100 to 3 ng) on the same western blot.</p>

The overnight culture (3 ml) was used to inoculate a 150 ml LB culture (+carbenicillin/kanamycin) and grown at 37°C with shaking until the OD<sub>600</sub> reached 1.0. At that point, 25 ml culture was sedimented at 3,800 rpm for 10 minutes using a table-top centrifuge, the pellet was washed twice in 30 mM Tris (pH 8; 16 ml per 0.2 g cell pellet) and was resuspended in 30 mM Tris (pH 8) with 20% sucrose (approximately 80 ml buffer per g cell pellet), lysozyme was added (to 20 μg/m), and the mixture was incubated for 5 to 10 minutes. After 1:1 dilution with 30 mM Tris (pH 8) buffer, EDTA was added (to 1 mM), and the resulting spheroplasts were incubated for 10 to 15 minutes with gentle nutation.
