        <p>Multiple studies show that tumor suppressor p53 is a barrier to dedifferentiation; whether this is strictly due to repression of proliferation remains a subject of debate. Here, we show that p53 plays an active role in promoting differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and opposing self-renewal by regulation of specific target genes and microRNAs. In contrast to mouse embryonic stem cells, p53 in hESCs is maintained at low levels in the nucleus, albeit in a deacetylated, inactive state. In response to retinoic acid, CBP/p300 acetylates p53 at lysine 373, which leads to dissociation from E3-ubiquitin ligases HDM2 and TRIM24. Stabilized p53 binds <italic>CDKN1A</italic> to establish a G<sub>1</sub> phase of cell cycle without activation of cell death pathways. In parallel, p53 activates expression of <italic>miR-34a</italic> and <italic>miR-145</italic>, which in turn repress stem cell factors OCT4, KLF4, LIN28A, and SOX2 and prevent backsliding to pluripotency. Induction of p53 levels is a key step: RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of p53 delays differentiation, whereas depletion of negative regulators of p53 or ectopic expression of p53 yields spontaneous differentiation of hESCs, independently of retinoic acid. Ectopic expression of p53R175H, a mutated form of p53 that does not bind DNA or regulate transcription, failed to induce differentiation. These studies underscore the importance of a p53-regulated network in determining the human stem cell state.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Most cell types in an organism are generated from embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which are able to proliferate an unlimited number of times and have the potential to produce any kind of cell of that organism (this ability is called pluripotency). In order to maintain these properties, ESCs have to remain in a proliferate state, which is achieved by the collaboration of several factors. Expressing combinations of these factors in differentiated cells can result in ESC-like qualities; these induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can then function like ESCs. Previous studies suggested that p53, generally known for its roles in maintaining genomic integrity by regulating cell cycle and cell death pathways, also acts as a barrier to reprogramming adult cells during the creation of iPSCs; whether this is strictly due to repression of proliferation remains a subject of debate. Here, we show that p53 plays a significant role in actively promoting differentiation of human ESCs (hESCs). We find that, prior to differentiation, p53 is expressed at very low levels in hESCs, held in check by two negative regulators, HDM2 and TRIM24, that trigger p53 degradation. Upon induction of differentiation, lysine 373 of p53 is acetylated, and this disrupts the existing interactions with negative regulators, thus allowing stabilization and activation of p53. Active p53 in turn promotes expression of the cell cycle regulator p21 to slow down the hESC cell cycle; cells in the gap (G<sub>1</sub>) phase of the cell cycle accumulate, preventing division. In parallel, p53 activates specific microRNAs, <italic>miR-34a</italic> and <italic>miR-145</italic>, that inhibit the expression of several stem cell factors and prevent differentiated cells from backsliding to pluripotency. Our results highlight a novel function of p53 in determining the human stem cell state.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have an unlimited potential to proliferate (self-renewal) and the ability to generate and differentiate into most cell types (pluripotency) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Thomson1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Pera1">[2]</xref>. The undifferentiated ESC state is regulated by a network of transcription factors, e.g., OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and KLF4, and epigenetic modifiers, which promote expression of ESC-specific genes and suppress differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Lee1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Bernstein1">[7]</xref>. Exogenous introduction of transcription factors such as OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and KLF4 into murine or human adult cells induces pluripotency by reprogramming these cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which are functionally and phenotypically similar to ESCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Takahashi1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Yu1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The ability of ESCs to self-renew and maintain pluripotency is linked to the ability of these cells to remain in a proliferative state. ESCs progress through an abbreviated cell cycle, leading to rapid cell division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Stead1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Jirmanova1">[12]</xref>, characterized by a truncated G<sub>1</sub> phase, elevated expression of G<sub>1</sub>-associated cyclins, active cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and low levels of inhibitory cell cycle proteins p21, p27, and p57 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Becker1">[13]</xref>. During differentiation to embryoid bodies, mouse ESCs (mESCs) accumulate in G<sub>1</sub> and exhibit a cell cycle lengthened from 8–10 h to more than 16 h, as observed in adult cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-White1">[14]</xref>. In the creation of iPSCs, multiple studies show more efficient reprogramming of cells with dysfunctional ARF/p53 pathways and increased cellular proliferation, shortening of G<sub>1</sub>, and lack of cell cycle checkpoints <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Hong1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Hanna1">[20]</xref>. Additional studies identified several small non-coding RNAs that play roles in cell cycle regulation and control of ESC status <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Wang1">[21]</xref>. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs of 21–23 nucleotides in length that regulate gene expression, generally at a post-transcriptional level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Bartel1">[22]</xref>. Specific miRNAs regulate self-renewal, pluripotency, and mESC stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Wang2">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Melton1">[24]</xref>, and several are differentially expressed in human ESCs (hESCs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Morin1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Laurent1">[26]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here, we connect both regulatory arms, e.g., cell cycle progression and transcription of miRNAs, to tumor suppressor p53 in regulated differentiation of hESCs. Exposure of hESCs to differentiating conditions signals an acetylation switch to stabilize p53 protein. Activation of p53 elongates the G<sub>1</sub> phase of the cell cycle by p21 induction, and increases <italic>miR-34a</italic> and <italic>miR-145</italic>, which target specific stem cell factors for repression. These functions of p53 are direct, as ectopically expressed p53 binds these chromatin targets and causes spontaneous differentiation without retinoic acid (RA) addition. The combined effects of p53 not only antagonize self-renewal and pluripotency but also have an active role in promoting differentiation of hESCs.</p>

        <title>p53 Protein Is Induced during Differentiation of hESCs</title>
        <p>In vitro differentiation of hESCs (WA09 cells), induced by addition of RA and withdrawal of fibroblast growth factor (FGF), is marked by a steady decline in levels of proteins and RNAs associated with pluripotency and self-renewal, e.g., NANOG, OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4, and increased expression of endodermal marker <italic>GATA4</italic>, <italic>AFP</italic>, ectodermal marker <italic>PAX6</italic>, and neural progenitor gene <italic>Nestin</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g001">Figures 1A–1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001268.s001">S1A</xref>), as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Gu1">[27]</xref>. In parallel, p53 protein levels increase significantly but transiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>) without increased <italic>TP53</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). In response to RA, induced p53 is nuclearly localized in differentiating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g001">Figures 1E, 1F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001268.s001">S1B</xref>), which are identifiable by the loss of homogeneity and elongated nuclei seen in highly p53-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). As one of several examples where hESCs differ from mESCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Han1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Chia1">[29]</xref>, p53 is expressed at low levels and nuclearly enriched in hESCs prior to induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g001">Figures 1B, 1E</xref>, and S1C). Transient induction of p53 protein levels during RA-mediated differentiation was also observed in WA01 hESCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001268.s001">Figure S1D and S1E</xref>), and in BMP4-mediated differentiation of hESCs (data not shown).</p>

        <p>Stress activation of p53 is primarily attributed to post-translational modification of p53 and increased protein stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-MurrayZmijewski1">[30]</xref>. During RA-mediated differentiation of hESCs, p53 gained acetylation at residue lysine 373 (p53K373; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g002">Figures 2A, 2B</xref>, and S2A), and DNA-damage-associated modifications, such as phosphorylation of p53S15 or p53S46, were not observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001268.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). p53K373 is a known substrate of histone acetyltransferase CBP/p300 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Ito1">[31]</xref>, and treatment of differentiating hESCs with CBP/p300 inhibitor circumin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Balasubramanyam1">[32]</xref> led to loss of p53K373ac and p53 stability during differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Increased p53K373ac occurred in parallel with reduced levels of SIRT1, at days 1–3 of RA treatment, suggesting that a pool of p53 escapes deacetylation by SIRT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent histone deacetylase SIRT1 is down-regulated during differentiation of hESCs, as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Calvanese1">[33]</xref>; however, SIRT1 protein levels and p53 interaction recover after differentiation of hESCs (day 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), as p53 and p53K373ac are restored to low levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g002">2A</xref>). Addition of an inhibitor of SIRT1 activity, nicotinamide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Li2">[34]</xref>, on day 4 of RA treatment, maintained p53K373ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). These results suggest that an active acetylation/deacetylation switch regulates p53 during differentiation of hESCs.</p>

        <title>The Consequences of p53 Accumulation in hESCs</title>
        <p>DNA damage of mESCs, where p53 is expressed at high levels and is primarily cytoplasmic, leads to repression of <italic>NANOG</italic> and spontaneous differentiation into other cell types, which undergo p53-dependent apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Han1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Lin1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Aladjem1">[41]</xref>. However, a previous report shows that, unlike mESCs, exposure of hESCs to DNA damage induces p53-dependent cell cycle arrest rather than differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Becker2">[42]</xref>. In order to assess functions of p53 during differentiation of hESCs we performed flow cytometry analysis of the cell cycle in hESCs at time points of exposure to RA, and compared control and p53-depleted hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g003">Figure 3</xref>).

        <p>Flow cytometry showed that 60% of pluripotent hESCs are in S phase, and approximately 10% of hESCs are in G<sub>1</sub> (time = 0), consistent with a rapid cell cycle (15–16 h) due to truncation of G<sub>1</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Becker1">[13]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g003">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001268.s004">S4A</xref>).

        <p>One approach we used to assess the progression of RA-mediated differentiation was to stain hESC cultures with alkaline phosphatase (AP) at each time point.

        <title>DNA Binding Is Required for p53-Mediated Regulation of Differentiation</title>
        <p>We established a system in hESCs where expression of p53 is controlled in a dose-dependent manner without addition of RA. Lentiviral constructs, which express wild-type or mutant p53 with an IRES-GFP reporter under control of a tetracycline (doxycycline [Dox])–responsive promoter, were introduced into hESCs and selected for stable integration. Cell lines with regulated expression of wild-type p53 (p53WT) or p53 mutated within its DNA-binding domain (p53R175H and p53R175P) were positive for both OCT4 and SSEA4 stem cell markers, as assessed by flow cytometry analysis, in the absence of Dox (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001268.s006">Figure S6A</xref>) and exhibited Dox-regulated expression of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g005">Figure 5</xref>). In the absence of RA, Dox-induced expression of p53WT led to loss of OCT4 expression. In contrast, expression of a mutated form of p53, incapable of binding to DNA and regulating p53 target gene expression (p53175H), did not correlate with decreased OCT4 even though p53R175H protein levels are higher than those of p53WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Interestingly, Dox induction of a mutated form of p53, p53R175P, known to induce cell cycle arrest but not apoptosis in mouse models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Liu1">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Liu2">[48]</xref> led to loss of OCT4 expression, although the decrease was smaller than the significant reduction induced by p53WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g005">Figure 5A and 5C</xref>). The dichotomy between responses of hESCs exposed to p53R175H versus p53R175P supports functions of p53 in the activation of cell cycle arrest, without apoptosis, during differentiation of human cells.</p>
        <p>Further analysis of differentiation driven by conditionally regulated p53, in the absence of RA, showed that p53 target genes, <italic>CDKN1A</italic> and <italic>HDM2</italic>, were activated over a time course of Dox exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g005">Figures 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001268.s006">S6B</xref>). In parallel, pluripotency marker gene expression of <italic>KLF4, NANOG</italic>, and <italic>OCT4</italic> was significantly reduced with length of exposure to Dox (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g005">Figures 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001268.s006">S6C</xref>). Dox treatment led to a ∼4- to 5-fold induction in exogenous wild-type and mutant p53 RNA, with an insignificant change in endogenous <italic>TP53</italic> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g005">Figures 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001268.s006">S6B</xref>). Differentiation occurred as marked by a gain in <italic>AFP</italic> expression and flattened cell morphology, with loss of AP staining in hESCs expressing p53WT or p53R175P but not p53R175H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g005">Figure 5B and 5C</xref>). Ectopic expression of p53WT and p53R175P led to an increase of cells in G<sub>1</sub>, similar to induction by RA treatment; however, p53R175H did not affect the cell cycle profiles of hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Induction of p53WT in hESCs led to expression of endoderm markers GATA4 and AFP, as well as ectoderm marker PAX6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g005">Figure 5F and 5G</xref>). However, these cells did not express mesodermal marker Brachyury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g005">Figure 5F and 5G</xref>). Differentiation is specific to p53, as depletion of Dox-induced p53 by siRNA, added at <italic>t = </italic>0, rescues OCT4 protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). Similarly, after siRNA-mediated depletion of p21 in hESCs over-expressing p53, OCT4 protein levels were rescued, further confirming p21 as a mediator of p53-induced differentiation of hESCs, whether induced by exogenous p53WT or by RA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g005">Figure 5E</xref>).</p>
        <p>Interestingly, Dox-induced p53 is not acetylated at K373, as is readily detectable when RA is used to induce equivalent levels of endogenous p53 and differentiation of hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g005">5H</xref>). This finding suggests that ectopic induction of p53 circumvents K373 acetylation, which promotes release of endogenous p53 from negative regulatory proteins during RA-induced differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Taken together, these results support a view of p53 as a critical regulator of hESC differentiation, capable of acting in the absence of RA and other stimuli that may be induced by RA treatment. The role of cell cycle regulators in this process is underscored by expression of mutated forms of p53 that specifically regulate genes that lead to G<sub>1</sub> arrest but are unable to regulate apoptosis in mouse models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Liu1">[47]</xref>.</p>

        <title>p53 Regulates <italic>miR-34a</italic> and <italic>miR-145</italic> to Drive Differentiation of hESCs</title>
        <p>To understand the mechanism underlying p53-mediated differentiation of hESCs, we performed high-throughput ChIP sequencing analysis of hESCs incubated with RA (unpublished data). Putative p53 targets included miRNAs; among these, we focused on <italic>miR-34a</italic> and <italic>miR-145</italic> as likely significant in the p53-mediated regulation of hESCs. In somatic cells, <italic>miR-34a</italic> acts in a feed-forward loop of p53 control. In response to stress stimuli, p53 is activated and induces expression of <italic>miR-34a</italic>, which in turn represses negative p53 regulator SIRT1 to augment p53 activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Yamakuchi1">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Chang1">[50]</xref>, and CyclinD1 and CDK6 to support cell cycle arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Sun1">[51]</xref>. SIRT1 deacetylates p53, which decreases the ability of p53 to bind DNA and regulate gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Gu2">[52]</xref>, as we also show in pluripotent hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Regulation of <italic>miR-34a</italic> and its downstream targets in ESCs has not been previously reported, to our knowledge. In contrast, a role for <italic>miR-145</italic> in differentiation of hESCs is known, where <italic>miR-145</italic> acts by negatively regulating levels of pluripotency genes, <italic>OCT4, SOX2</italic>, and <italic>KLF4</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Xu1">[53]</xref>. <italic>miR-145</italic> is known to be a p53 target in somatic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Sachdeva1">[54]</xref>; however, the mechanisms that lead to <italic>miR-145</italic> up-regulation during differentiation of hESCs have not been defined.</p>
        <p>In response to RA treatment and differentiation of hESCs, <italic>miR-34a</italic> and <italic>miR-145</italic> were significantly up-regulated in a p53-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g006">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>), an induction which also occurs with a DNA-damaging agent, Adr (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001268.s007">Figure S7A</xref>). RA treatment led to a time-dependent enrichment of p53 at predicted p53REs of both <italic>miR-34a</italic> and <italic>miR-145</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), in parallel with the transient activation of p53. Interestingly, p53 enrichment on two identified p53REs of <italic>miR-145</italic> exhibited distinct patterns during differentiation compared to DNA damage: p53 accumulation occurred at both p53REs but was stronger on the proximal p53RE (p53RE2) during differentiation and on the distal p53RE (p53RE1) after DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g006">Figures 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001268.s007">S7B</xref>). <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref> of small inhibitory oligonucleotides to counter expression of targeted miRNAs (anti-miRNAs), anti-<italic>miR-34a</italic> and anti-<italic>miR-145</italic>, resulted in ∼80% miRNA depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001268.s006">Figure S6C</xref>), and had specific effects on expression of stem cell factors: inhibition of <italic>miR-34a</italic> led to increased expression of OCT4, KLF4, LIN28A, and SOX2 proteins, and to a lesser extent SIRT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g006">Figure 6E</xref>), as well as <italic>SOX2</italic> and <italic>SIRT1</italic> RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Inhibition of <italic>miR-145</italic> induced protein levels of OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4, as well as increased RNA expression of <italic>SOX2</italic> and <italic>KLF4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g006">Figure 6D and 6E</xref>). Quantitative determination of OCT4/SSEA4-positive cells by flow cytometry analysis revealed that hESCs could differentiate with RA after inhibition of <italic>miR-34a</italic> but not in the presence of anti-<italic>miR-145</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g006">Figure 6F</xref>). Depletion of both miRNAs significantly delayed differentiation of hESCs, as ∼97% of hESCs remained OCT4-positive 3 d after RA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g006">Figure 6F</xref>), indicating the significance of these miRNAs during differentiation.</p>

Pluripotency genes targeted by <italic>mir-145</italic> are known <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Xu1">[53]</xref>; additionally, we found that <italic>mir-34a</italic> has predicted target sites within the 3′ UTRs of <italic>KLF4</italic> and <italic>LIN28A</italic>, which are conserved across species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g006">Figure 6G</xref>). To investigate whether <italic>KLF4</italic> and <italic>LIN28A</italic> are directly targeted by <italic>miR-34a</italic>, we engineered luciferase reporters that have either the wild-type 3′ UTRs of these genes, or mutated 3′ UTRs with a 4-bp mutation in the predicted target sites. The luciferase reporters were cotransfected with miRNA precursor (pre-miRNAs) mimics, which are processed into mature miRNAs in HEK293 cells. A scrambled precursor with no homology to the human genome was used as a control. The pre-miRNA mimic of <italic>miR-34a</italic> (pre-<italic>miR-34a</italic>) significantly reduced the luciferase activity of the wild-type <italic>LIN28A</italic> reporter (∼30%), compared to the scrambled precursor control (two-tailed Student's <italic>t</italic> test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g006">Figure 6H</xref>), and did not alter activity of mutated reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g006">Figure 6H</xref>). Repression was specific to <italic>LIN28A</italic>, as there was no significant effect of pre-<italic>miR-34a</italic> transfection on the <italic>KLF4</italic> reporter. These results suggest that <italic>miR-34a</italic> directly targets sites within the <italic>LIN28A</italic> 3′ UTR. Taken together, p53-activated miRNAs decrease expression of major stem cell factors to oppose self-renewal of hESCs, as well as inhibiting <italic>SIRT1</italic>, a negative regulator of p53. Thus, p53-mediated regulation of miRNAs reinforces and expands the direct effects of p53 in regulation of the cell cycle during differentiation of hESCs.</p>

      <p><italic>TP53</italic> is mutated in more than half of all human cancers, and maintains genomic stability in somatic cells, primarily as a stress-responsive transcription regulator of genes that control cell cycle arrest and apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Taylor1">[60]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Zuckerman1">[61]</xref>.

A role for p53 in ESC modulation was first suggested by a report that p53 directly represses <italic>Nanog</italic> in mESCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Lin1">[40]</xref>. Likewise, p53 functions in apoptosis and differentiation of hESCs were previously reported, but no clear mechanisms were revealed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Qin1">[66]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Maimets1">[67]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here, we show that p53 actively promotes differentiation of hESCs and does so by mechanisms distinct from direct regulation of <italic>NANOG</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g007">Figure 7</xref>). In contrast to in mESCs, human p53 is localized in the nucleus of hESCs at a low concentration and in a deacetylated state. In response to differentiation signals, SIRT1 is down-regulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Calvanese1">[33]</xref>, allowing p53 to be acetylated at Lys373, a target of CBP/p300. Acetylation of p53 activates its functions as a transcription factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Barlev1">[68]</xref>, and relieves p53 from HDM2- and <italic>TRIM24</italic> (shown here)– mediated ubiquitination and degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Li2">[34]</xref>. The importance of p53 concentration and its regulation was shown by the significant levels of differentiation that occur either in response to siRNA-mediated depletion of <italic>MDM2</italic> and TRIM24 or by ectopic expression of p53. In these cases, differentiation occurs in the absence of RA and in medium that normally maintains stem cells as such.</p>

          <p>In pluripotent hESCs, p53 is negatively regulated by HDM2 and TRIM24. Differentiation induces acetylation at Lys373 of p53 via CBP/p300, p53K373ac then activates transcription by binding to p53REs on <italic>CDKN1A</italic> (p21), <italic>miR-34a</italic>, and <italic>miR-145</italic>. Induction of p21 leads to p53-dependent elongation of G<sub>1</sub> phase, whereas induction of <italic>miR-34a</italic> supports G1 elongation, blocks deactivation of p53 by targeting the deacetylase SIRT1, and counteracts pluripotency by targeting <italic>LIN28A</italic>. On the other hand, <italic>miR-145</italic> targets OCT4, KLF4, and SOX2 and antagonize pluripotency. Thus, p53 exerts a cumulative pro-differentiation effect by elongating hESC G<sub>1</sub> phase via p21 and synergistically up-regulating <italic>miR-34a</italic> and <italic>miR-145</italic> to counteract pluripotency.

      <p>Comparison of cell cycle profiles during RA-mediated differentiation and DNA damage conditions highlights the diverse roles played by p53 to restrict cell division and initiate either differentiation or DNA repair, respectively. Differentiation-activated p53 binds to the p53REs of downstream gene target <italic>CDKN1A</italic> to promote a G<sub>1</sub> block that effectively elongates G<sub>1</sub> and lengthens the cell cycle of hESCs, with minimal induction of apoptosis. The pattern of post-translational modifications of p53 and the accumulation of hESCs in G<sub>1</sub> induced by RA are in contrast to arrest of Adr-treated hESCs at G<sub>2</sub>–M of cell cycle in a classical, p53-mediated DNA damage response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Taylor1">[60]</xref>. We find that p53, transiently activated during differentiation, regulates cell cycle but does not induce significant apoptosis. Although selectivity of p53 in activating arrest of cell cycle versus apoptosis remains incompletely understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-MurrayZmijewski1">[30]</xref>, our findings for hESC differentiation recapitulate the specificity previously shown in mouse models that express specific point mutants of p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Liu2">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Lang1">[69]</xref> and suggest that these mechanisms are highly conserved. Differentiation of hESCs is significantly delayed when <italic>TP53</italic> and/or <italic>CDKN1A</italic> levels are reduced, as shown by AP staining, cell cycle analysis, and expression of markers of pluripotency in hESCs transfected with siRNAs. Recently, Dox-inducible exogenous expression of p21 in hESCs was shown to induce cell cycle arrest and massive hESC differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Ruiz1">[70]</xref>, further supporting that induced levels of p21 and control of cell cycle are required for hESCs to differentiate.</p>
      <p>A number of p53 downstream target genes have been extensively studied, especially in transformed cells, and non-coding RNAs regulated by p53 are now being identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Hermeking1">[71]</xref>. Roles of miRNAs during hESC differentiation or reprogramming of somatic cells have recently been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Melton1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Xu1">[53]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Tarantino1">[72]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Kim2">[76]</xref>, with specific signatures of miRNAs shown in distinct stem cell states of pluripotency regulated by p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Neveu1">[77]</xref>. A known p53 target, <italic>miR-34a</italic>, was shown to increase p53 activation by repressing SIRT1 in cultured cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Yamakuchi1">[49]</xref> but was not previously linked to hESCs. <italic>miR-145</italic> was discovered to be a direct repressor of pluripotency factors, but was not shown to be regulated by p53 in stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Xu1">[53]</xref>. Here we show that p53 activates <italic>miR-34a</italic> and <italic>miR-145</italic> expression during RA-mediated differentiation of hESCs. Expression of these miRNAs, directly induced by chromatin interaction of p53 at p53REs, impacts a network of target transcripts that control pluripotency, either directly or indirectly. Further, during preparation of this manuscript, Choi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Choi1">[78]</xref> showed that <italic>miR-34a</italic> provides a barrier to somatic cell reprogramming. This study offers further support for our finding that <italic>miR-34a</italic> antagonizes pluripotency of hESCs and has pro-differentiation functions in stem cell biology. We found that <italic>miR-145</italic> has a more significant role in differentiation of hESCs, with <italic>miR-34a</italic> acting to augment its functions. However, since DNA damage induced miRNAs <italic>miR-34a</italic> and <italic>miR-145</italic> but did not promote accumulation of hESCs in G<sub>1</sub> and differentiation of hESCs, as seen with RA treatment or ectopic p53 expression, it is clear the miRNAs alone are insufficient to induce differentiation of hESCs. We showed that p53 activation is transient during differentiation of hESCs; thus, activation of miRNAs that repress stem cell factor expression broadens the impact of p53 activation and may prevent “backsliding” to pluripotency, once p53 returns to its normally low concentration during differentiation to a committed state.</p>
      <p>Recently, the creation of <italic>TP53<sup>−/−</sup></italic> hESCs by homologous recombination showed that loss of p53 promotes pluripotency, a role for p53 conserved in both murine and human ESCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Song1">[79]</xref>. However, <italic>TP53<sup>−/−</sup></italic> hESCs contribute to all three germ layers during teratoma formation in SCID mice, perhaps because of compensation by structurally similar members of the p53 family, p63 and p73. Deletion of all p63 and p73 isoforms in mice reveals critical roles in development and differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Mills1">[80]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Yang1">[81]</xref>. p63 and p73 can bind to canonical p53 DNA-binding sites and regulate transcription from p53-responsive promoters, in the presence or absence of p53 itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Keyes1">[82]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Dotsch1">[84]</xref>. Compensation may be incomplete, as p53-null mice exhibit some developmental anomalies, such as a high percentage of exencephaly in females, and specific genes exhibit altered p53-regulated gene expression during development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Hu1">[85]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Sah1">[87]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The establishment of elongated Gap-phase timing in stem cells, more similar to that in somatic cells, was previously proposed as a requirement for reception of differentiation signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Orford1">[11]</xref>. Our studies show that p53 is integral in this process and actively promotes differentiation of hESCs, in the absence of cellular stress or DNA damage. The collective effects of p53 activation elongate the G<sub>1</sub> phase and antagonize pluripotency by induction of <italic>miR-34a</italic> and <italic>miR-145</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001268-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Importantly, activation of p53 during differentiation of hESCs is transient, allowing later stages of growth and differentiation, while p53-induced miRNAs regulate a network of genes that bolster forward progression to differentiate. How these findings in ESCs may be relevant in adult and tumor stem cells—where they may be channeled toward therapeutic applications to restructure cell cycle and regulate a network of miRNAs—is an important area for further study.</p>

Briefly, WA09 cells were maintained in hESC culture medium on γ-irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) prepared using WiCell instructions. hESCs ranging from passage number 32–38 were used for all of our experiments. hESC complete culture medium is composed of DMEM/F12 supplemented with 20% knockout serum replacement, 1 mM L-glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, 4 ng/ml human FGF2 (all from Invitrogen), and 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). The medium was changed daily, and cells were passaged every 4–6 d with 1 mg/ml Collagen IV (Invitrogen). For differentiation studies hESCs were cultured in differentiation medium (hESC medium without FGF) containing 1 µM RA for 5 d, with fresh medium change daily. hESCs were also maintained as feeder-free cultures on hESC qualified Matrigel (BD Biosciences) in mTeSR1 medium (Stemcell Technologies) and MEF conditioned medium (CM). Passage 32 hESCs were grown on mTeSR1 medium for five passages. hESCs were cultured on Matrigel following manufacturer's instructions and received fresh mTeSR1 medium daily, and cells were passaged every 4–6 d with 1 mg/ml Dispase (Stemcell Technologies). For differentiating hESCs cultured on mTeSR1, 1 µM RA was added to homemade MEF CM (without additional FGF). CM was prepared in our facility by culturing γ-irradiated MEFs in complete hESC culture medium for 24 h, collected daily, filtered, and freezed at −20°C. FGF was added to CM before use to a final concentration of 10 ng/ml to culture the cells grown on Matrigel under pluripotent conditions.</p>

Lentiviral supernatants were produced by transfecting 293T cells with the pSAM2.gw vector, pCMV-VSV-G and pCMV-ΔR8.91, using Fugene HD transfection reagent (Roche) and collected 48 h post-transfection. WA09 rtTA cells were generated by spin infection of WA09 cells with Lenti-rtTA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001268-Bosnakovski1">[88]</xref> at 2,500 rpm at 37°C for 90 min with polybrene (4 µg/ml), and incubated at 37°C for an additional 2 h prior to medium replacement with mTeSR1. The WA09 rtTA cells were subsequently transduced with listed pSAM2.gw plasmid as described above. Enrichment of infected cells was performed by FACS sorting (FACSAria II, BD Biosciences) for GFP-positive cells (to a final enrichment of about 80%), following low dose transient induction (addition of 0.05 µg/ml Dox [Sigma]) for 8 h. About 16 h before the sort, the Dox was removed, and the cells were incubated with regular mTeSR1 medium. Positive cells were sorted, plated in fresh mTeSR1, and expanded for secondary/tertiary enrichment or testing.</p>
