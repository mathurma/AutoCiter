      </related-article><abstract>
        <p>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) usually requires symptomatic supportive therapy by intubation and mechanical ventilation with the supplemental use of high oxygen concentrations. Although oxygen therapy represents a life-saving measure, the recent discovery of a critical tissue-protecting mechanism predicts that administration of oxygen to ARDS patients with uncontrolled pulmonary inflammation also may have dangerous side effects. Oxygenation may weaken the local tissue hypoxia-driven and adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor (A<sub>2A</sub>R)-mediated anti-inflammatory mechanism and thereby further exacerbate lung injury. Here we report experiments with wild-type and adenosine A<sub>2A</sub>R-deficient mice that confirm the predicted effects of oxygen. These results also suggest the possibility of iatrogenic exacerbation of acute lung injury upon oxygen administration due to the oxygenation-associated elimination of A<sub>2A</sub>R-mediated lung tissue-protecting pathway. We show that this potential complication of clinically widely used oxygenation procedures could be completely prevented by intratracheal injection of a selective A<sub>2A</sub>R agonist to compensate for the oxygenation-related loss of the lung tissue-protecting endogenous adenosine. The identification of a major iatrogenic complication of oxygen therapy in conditions of acute lung inflammation attracts attention to the need for clinical and epidemiological studies of ARDS patients who require oxygen therapy. It is proposed that oxygen therapy in patients with ARDS and other causes of lung inflammation should be combined with anti-inflammatory measures, e.g., with inhalative application of A<sub>2A</sub>R agonists. The reported observations may also answer the long-standing question as to why the lungs are the most susceptible to inflammatory injury and why lung failure usually precedes multiple organ failure.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Many clinical conditions, including aspiration, trauma, and hemorrhagic shock, are frequently followed by pulmonary and systemic infectious and septic complications that lead to pulmonary dysfunction and subsequent lung failure. Acute lung injury or its more severe form, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), occur with a frequency of approximately 130.000 cases and more than 50.000 deaths from ARDS per year in the United States alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b01">1</xref>]. Intubation with mechanical ventilation represent one of the most widely used prophylactic and therapeutic clinical interventions to counteract the insufficient pulmonary oxygen-delivering capacity in patients who suffer from severe lung inflammation. Although the majority of patients respond well to oxygen therapy, and oxygen toxicity is an uncommon occurrence in intensive care medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b02">2</xref>], there remains the possibility that oxygen therapy may be suboptimal in ARDS patients, as it may promote deleterious pulmonary inflammation, which fuels this disease process. Since the magnitude and duration of lung inflammation has been shown to determine the final outcome of ARDS patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b03">3</xref>], it is important to carefully evaluate the possible adverse effects of oxygen on inflammatory processes.</p>
      <p>We assumed that lung tissues are protected from overactive immune cells by the same hypoxia-driven mechanism and immunosuppressive adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor (A<sub>2A</sub>R)-mediated mechanism that was recently shown to play a critical role in the down-regulation of inflammation and tissue damage in different models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b04">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b07">7</xref>]. Accordingly, it is likely that bacterial toxin-activated immune cells (e.g., granulocytes) cause collateral lung tissue damage with impairment of the local microcirculation and blood supply, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of acute lung injury. The ensuing tissue damage-associated hypoxia facilitates the accumulation of extracellular adenosine [8–12<inline-formula id="form1"><underline>]</underline></inline-formula>, which then triggers the activation of immunosuppressive A<sub>2A</sub>Rs on activated immune cells and causes the accumulation of immunosuppressive intracellular cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP). This cAMP, in turn, inhibits signaling pathways that are required for synthesis and secretion of proinflammatory and cytotoxic mediators by immune cells, and thereby protects remaining healthy tissues from continuing immune damage. Since this physiological tissue-protecting mechanism depends on the hypoxia-produced extracellular adenosine [8–12<inline-formula id="form2"><underline>]</underline></inline-formula>, and since the oxygenation of lungs in intubated patients is performed to increase oxygen tension—with the goal of abolishing the hypoxia but disrupting the adenosine accumulation—we reasoned that such interruption of the hypoxia → adenosine → A<sub>2A</sub>R pathway by oxygenation could lead to a disengagement of the critical tissue-protecting mechanism and to an unintended exaggeration of inflammatory lung damage (iatrogenic disease). Thus, oxygenation may eliminate this lung-protecting pathway and thereby contribute to pulmonary complications.</p>
      <p>We confirm our prediction in several in-vivo models of lung infection and inflammation and report that oxygenation does indeed strongly exacerbate inflammatory lung damage and accelerate death in mice by the interruption of the hypoxia → adenosine → A<sub>2A</sub>R pathway. We also suggest an effective and feasible therapeutic countermeasure to prevent deleterious effects of oxygenation: Exogenously added synthetic A<sub>2A</sub>R agonist compensated for the loss of endogenously formed adenosine in inflamed lungs of oxygenated mice, and thereby prevented inflammatory lung injury and prevented death.</p>

        <title>Exacerbation of Inflammatory Lung Injury and Death in Oxygenated Mice</title>
        <p>To test our prediction, we subjected mice to inhalation of combined toxins from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. In this model of polymicrobial lung infection, intratracheal (IT) injection of both lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) strongly potentiates their toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b13">13</xref>].</p>
        <p>The results of these assays confirmed the prediction of exaggerated lung injury in mice in conditions that mimic therapeutic oxygenation, and this is reflected in the dramatic increases in inflammatory lung damage in different in vivo and ex vivo assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g002">2</xref>).</p>

            <title>Increased Death Rate upon Oxygenation of Mice with Acute Lung Injury</title>
            <p>Mice were IT injected with SEB and LPS to model polymicrobial infection and were exposed to 21% or 100% oxygen for 48–60 h. Determination of time-dependent survival curves was prohibited by considerations of unrelieved severe respiratory distress in NIH-approved animal care protocol, which required termination of experiments immediately after differences between groups became apparent. Major differences between groups occurred within 48–60 hours after IT injection of toxins, when the majority of oxygenated animals with inflamed lungs had died, while the nonoxygenated, obviously sick control mice with inflamed lungs were still alive.</p>

            <p>(A) Enhanced lung vascular permeability (left graph) and impairment of lung gas exchange (right graph) in mice breathing 100% O<sub>2</sub> upon induction of acute lung injury. Following IT injection of mice with SEB and LPS, animals breathed 21% or 100% oxygen. After 48 h, lung vascular permeability and lung gas exchange were determined by the amount of protein recovered by BAL or by measuring pO<sub>2</sub> values in arterial blood drawn, respectively, 15 min after return of mice to normal atmosphere. During this equilibration period, three out of seven mice previously exposed to 100% oxygen died, so that no arterial blood gas analyses could be performed, but BAL protein concentrations were determined immediately thereafter.</p>
            <p>(B) Increased lung vascular permeability (left graph) and impairment of lung gas exchange (right graph) in mice with acute lung injury even upon exposure to lower levels of oxygen (60%), which are considered clinically safe in humans. Experimental conditions were the same as in (A), except oxygen concentration was 60% instead of 100%.</p>

        <p>Five times more mice with inflamed lungs died after exposure to 100% oxygen than those left at 21% ambient oxygen tension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This was further confirmed by a much more pronounced increase in the alveolocapillary permeability and severe overall impairment of lung gas exchange, as evidenced by the increase in the amount of protein recovered from the alveolar space by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), as well as by the decrease in arterial oxygen partial pressure (pO<sub>2</sub>) values of previously oxygen-exposed mice when returned to normal atmosphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Although exposure of mice to 100% oxygen alone (with no toxin inhalation) did induce a small accumulation of BAL fluid protein, the magnitude of that effect could not account for the dramatic increases in lung vascular permeability and impairment of lung gas exchange when both toxins and oxygenation were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g002">Figure 2</xref>A).</p>
        <p>The exacerbation of inflammatory lung injury was also observed when mice were exposed to 60% oxygen, a concentration considered in human patients to be fairly safe. Compared to toxin-injected animals breathing 21% oxygen, those breathing 60% oxygen accumulated much more exudate proteins in the alveolar spaces and exhibited impaired arterial blood oxygen tensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Exposure of toxin-injected mice to 60% oxygen, however, did not result in death in the short-term assays we used.</p>
        <p>These observations confirmed the prediction that inflamed lung injury is exacerbated by oxygenation; however, the development of therapeutic countermeasures requires testing of the validity of our underlying assumptions and conclusive identification of the molecular mechanisms of these proinflammatory effects of oxygen.</p>

        <title>Oxygenation Disrupts the Hypoxia → A<sub>2A</sub>R-Mediated Pathway</title>
        <p>The observed effects of oxygenation could not be accounted for by direct toxic effects of oxygen, since these effects of oxygen take much longer to manifest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b02">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b15">15</xref>] and therefore are unlikely to fully account for the dramatic lung injury observed in our short-term experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g002">2</xref>).</p>
        <p>To test whether oxygen enhances inflammatory tissue damage by eliminating the hypoxia → adenosine → A<sub>2A</sub>R pathway, which is hypothesized as being responsible for protecting inflamed lungs and down-regulating neutrophils, we (i) determined the role of neutrophils in inflammatory lung injury, (ii) tested for A<sub>2A</sub>R expression on these cells to demonstrate their susceptibility to modulation by endogenously produced adenosine, (iii) analyzed the degree of inflammatory lung tissue damage in <italic>A<sub>2A</sub>R</italic> gene-deficient mice or in wild-type mice treated with highly selective pharmacologic antagonists for A<sub>2A</sub>Rs, and (iv) tested whether the hypoxia has a lung-protective role and whether there is a direct linkage between hypoxia (upstream) and A<sub>2A</sub>Rs (downstream) in the proposed lung-protective hypoxia → A<sub>2A</sub>R pathway.</p>
        <p>To diminish the suffering of animals with severely inflamed and damaged lungs, in the experiments described in the next section we used the less-severe lung injury model established by the injection of LPS alone instead of the polymicrobial (SEB + LPS) model of lung damage.</p>

This finding was further supported by the correlation between the number of PMNs and the degree of lung vascular permeability as reflected by the amount of protein recovered from the alveolar space by BAL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g003">Figure 3</xref>B).</p>

        <p>To answer the question of whether murine neutrophils are susceptible to inhibitory effects of endogenously produced adenosine via A<sub>2A</sub>R signaling, we characterized the effects of increasing concentrations of the highly specific A<sub>2A</sub>R agonist CGS21680 on the oxygen radical production of granulocytes taken from the blood of healthy mice. Surprisingly, respiratory burst activity of such “naïve” granulocytes was only poorly inhibited by A<sub>2A</sub>R signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g004">Figure 4</xref>A, left graph). Therefore it was important to test whether “in vivo-activated” granulocytes isolated from inflamed lungs of IT LPS-injected mice might have up-regulated their A<sub>2A</sub>R expression. As expected, significant up-regulation of A<sub>2A</sub>R was observed in experiments in which CGS21680 greatly enhanced the chemotactic peptide N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP)-stimulated cAMP production of in vivo-activated neutrophils isolated from inflamed lungs from wild-type mice, but not of naïve granulocytes obtained from the bone marrow of healthy wild-type control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g004">Figure 4</xref>B, left graph). In a genetic control, the cAMP increase was absent in in vivo-activated granulocytes from <italic>A<sub>2A</sub>R</italic> gene-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g004">Figure 4</xref>B, right graph). In addition, the adenosine-induced cAMP increase was inhibited in wild-type granulocytes by the selective antagonist of A<sub>2A</sub>Rs ZM241385 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g004">Figure 4</xref>B, right graph). Results of parallel assays confirmed increased expression of A<sub>2A</sub>R on activated granulocytes, since CGS21680 inhibited the functional response of in vivo-activated granulocytes (i.e., as evidenced by the production of tissue-damaging reactive oxygen species) much more strongly than in naïve cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g004">Figure 4</xref>A<italic>,</italic> right graph).</p>

            <title>Evidence for the Up-Regulation of Immunosuppressive A<sub>2A</sub>R Expression on In Vivo-Activated Granulocytes Isolated from Inflamed Lungs</title>
            <p>(A) The selective A<sub>2A</sub>R agonist CGS21680 inhibited the fMLP-stimulated hydrogen peroxide production by granulocytes in blood of healthy mice to only a small degree, reflecting low levels of expression of A<sub>2A</sub>R on naïve blood granulocytes. In contrast, granulocytes recovered by BAL from inflamed lungs 48 h after IT LPS injection were much more inhibited by CGS21680, demonstrating functional up-regulation of A<sub>2A</sub>R on in vivo-activated cells.</p>
            <p>(B) CGS21680 induces cAMP accumulation in in vivo-activated granulocytes isolated from lungs 48 h after IT LPS injection. No effects of the A<sub>2A</sub>R agonist were observed in naïve granulocytes obtained from bone marrow of healthy mice (left graph) or in in vivo-activated granulocytes recovered from inflamed lungs of <italic>A<sub>2A</sub>R</italic> gene-deficient mice (right graph). The CGS21680-stimulated cAMP production observed in lung granulocytes obtained from wild-type mice could also be antagonized by the selective A<sub>2A</sub>R antagonist ZM241385. Naïve bone marrow granulocytes were used for cAMP measurements, since it was impossible to isolate naïve cells from blood of healthy mice in sufficient numbers.</p>
            <p>(C) Higher levels of A<sub>2A</sub>R-specific mRNA in in vivo-activated granulocytes. In parallel with the much stronger A<sub>2A</sub>R agonist-induced inhibition of hydrogen peroxide production and accumulation of cAMP in in vivo-activated granulocytes, the relative levels of A<sub>2A</sub>R-specific mRNA were much higher in in vivo-activated granulocytes obtained from inflamed lungs 48 h after IT LPS injection, as compared with naïve granulocytes isolated from the bone marrow of healthy mice (left graph). Up-regulation of A<sub>2A</sub>R mRNA in in vivo-activated granulocytes was confirmed in another set of experimental animals breathing 21% oxygen, but was increased to a much lesser extent in animals subjected to 100% oxygen (right graph). Levels of A<sub>1</sub>R mRNA did not change much in inflammatory lung granulocytes from animals breathing normal atmosphere, but were clearly increased in mice exposed to 100% O<sub>2</sub>. In the two sets of experiments (left and right graphs), granulocytes were pooled from five and six mice per treatment, respectively. Taken together, the results demonstrate that granulocytes recovered from alveolar spaces of inflamed lungs did, indeed, up-regulate their A<sub>2A</sub>R expression during these in vivo lung injury assays, thereby confirming and extending previous findings in other inflammation models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b53">53</xref>]</p>

        <p>The results of mRNA expression studies were in agreement with above functional studies of adenosine receptors, and a much stronger increase in A<sub>2A</sub>R mRNA levels was observed in in vivo-activated PMNs than in naïve cells, with only small changes in A<sub>1</sub> receptor mRNA expression in the first experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, left graph). These findings were further confirmed in a second experiment in which the effect of 100% oxygen was compared to that of normal atmosphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, right graph). When compared to the several-fold increase in A<sub>2A</sub>R mRNA expression levels in inflammatory granulocytes from mice exposed to 21% oxygen, these levels were up-regulated to a much lesser extent in mice breathing 100% oxygen. As in the first experiment, no changes were observed in A<sub>3</sub> mRNA expression, while expression of A<sub>2B</sub> receptors showed changes similar to those of A<sub>2A</sub>R mRNA (unpublished data). Interestingly, the expression of A<sub>1</sub> mRNA levels was increased in inflammatory lung granulocytes obtained from hyperoxic animals. Thus, the decreased up-regulation of A<sub>2A</sub>R-specific mRNA that was observed in parallel with an increased A<sub>1</sub> receptor-specific mRNA expression in inflammatory granulocytes from mice breathing pure oxygen is in support of hyperoxic exacerbation of lung injury.</p>

This dosing regimen of the A<sub>2A</sub>R antagonist caused significant more lung tissue damage, as reflected by increased number of PMNs (left graph) and protein levels (center graph) in the BAL fluid obtained after 48 h. In parallel experiments, the A<sub>2A</sub>R antagonist decreased lung function (right graph) as compared to untreated wild-type mice, in agreement with results of experiments with <italic>A<sub>2A</sub>R</italic> gene-deficient mice.</p>

        <title>Hypoxia Down-Regulates Neutrophils and Protects Lung Tissue from Inflammatory Damage</title>
        <p>To test whether anti-inflammatory lung-protective effects can be induced in mice by allowing them to breathe a hypoxic gas mixture, LPS-injected wild-type mice were exposed to 10% oxygen. Although this oxygen concentration was sublethal for LPS-injected mice, we chose to study the effects of this degree of hypoxia because 15% of ARDS patients die from therapy-refractory hypoxemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b18">18</xref>]. Accordingly, some deaths occurred in IT LPS-injected mice at hour 4–7 of hypoxic exposure. In the majority of surviving mice (over 90%), however, hypoxia for 48 h strongly inhibited acute neutrophilic inflammation and led to overall better lung protection compared to mice kept at 21% oxygen. This improvement was evidenced by a decreased pulmonary sequestration of PMNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g006">Figure 6</xref>), inhibition of their capability to produce oxygen-reactive metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g006">Figure 6</xref>A), decreased protein accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g006">Figure 6</xref>B), and better lung function as reflected in higher arterial pO<sub>2</sub> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). This conclusion was further confirmed by histological studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g006">Figure 6</xref>C) that revealed not only a decrease in PMN sequestration, but also a significant decrease in parameters of lung tissue damage as evidenced by the 7-fold reduction of the lung injury score (LI; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g006">Figure 6</xref>C).</p>

The representative H&amp;E-stained slices in the right two photomicrographs show less intravascular granulocyte sequestration, less thickening of the alveolocapillary membrane, and almost no granulocytes in the alveolar spaces as compared to IT endotoxin-injected animals breathing 21% O<sub>2</sub>.

            <p>(B) No survival of <italic>A<sub>2A</sub>R</italic> gene-deficient mice was observed in acute hypoxic lung injury. Wild-type and <italic>A<sub>2A</sub>R</italic> gene-deficient mice were injected IT with LPS and exposed to hypoxia (10%). While the majority of wild-type mice survived, all of the <italic>A<sub>2A</sub>R</italic> gene-deficient mice died, indicating that expression of A<sub>2A</sub>R is required for survival of hypoxic lung inflammation; this experiment mimics the clinical situation in which lung inflammation increases to such severity that hypoxia occurs.</p>
            <p>(C) Significantly higher levels of pulmonary and systemic inflammatory cytokine production in hypoxic A<sub>2A</sub>R-deficient mice. Observations of survival were supported by significantly higher BAL and serum (Se) levels of inflammatory cytokines in hypoxic A<sub>2A</sub>R-deficient mice compared to hypoxic wild-type mice. Cytokines were determined 2 h after IT LPS injection, because A<sub>2A</sub>R-deficient mice started to die soon after LPS administration and thus could not be used in comparative studies with wild-type control mice. The early mortality of A<sub>2A</sub>R-deficient mice also did not allow the comparative determination of effects of hypoxia on other late markers of inflammation such as PMN accumulation, lung vascular permeability, and pulmonary gas exchange, which in wild-type mice need about 48 h to develop after IT endotoxin injection.</p>
            <p>(D) Degree of inflammation is independent from level of oxygen in A<sub>2A</sub>R-deficient mice but not in wild-type mice. While BAL fluid TNF-α concentration determined 2 h after IT LPS injection was significantly suppressed in hypoxic wild-type mice compared to animals breathing 100% oxygen, hypoxia had no effect on TNF-α BAL concentrations in <italic>A<sub>2A</sub>R</italic> gene-deficient mice, demonstrating that suppression of TNF-α formation by hypoxia is mediated through A<sub>2A</sub>R signaling.</p>

        <p>Hypoxic (10%) oxygen was also expected to provide an important readout of the degree of lung injury by the level of survival in the mice. In our experiments, the dose of LPS injected IT induced much higher levels of lung injury in A<sub>2A</sub>R-deficient mice than in control wild-type mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g005">Figure 5</xref>), but neither wild-type or A<sub>2A</sub>R deficient mice died if they were kept at 21% oxygen at these levels of lung injury.</p>
        <p>Different outcome with respect to death rates were expected, if A<sub>2A</sub>R-deficient and wild-type mice with LPS-inflamed lungs were kept at 10% oxygen. We reasoned that under these conditions the A<sub>2A</sub>R-deficient mice would have much more pronounced pulmonary inflammation and hence less healthy lung tissues left to adequately oxygenate vital organs. Thus, the interruption of the hypoxia → A<sub>2A</sub>R pathway and the resulting uninhibited inflammatory processes and increased lung damage would lead to accelerated death of A<sub>2A</sub>R-deficient mice in 10% oxygen.</p>
        <p>In contrast, these treatments would not result in pronounced lethality in lung-inflamed wild-type mice at 10% oxygen tension, because wild-type mice benefit from their lung-protecting hypoxia → A<sub>2A</sub>R pathway and would have much larger portions of still-healthy lungs left to ensure sufficient oxygen supply to tissues.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, we predicted that the majority of A<sub>2A</sub>R genetically deficient mice would die at 10% oxygen, while the majority of wild-type mice would survive. This prediction was based on the assumption that the hypoxia → A<sub>2A</sub>R pathway is nonredundant and would not be substituted by another hypoxia → “X” molecule receptor pathway.</p>
        <p>These expectations were confirmed by the data showing that exposure of the IT LPS-injected wild-type mice to hypoxia resulted in low mortality (only 20% [4 out of 20] of the mice died), whereas in the parallel group all (20 out of 20) similarly treated A<sub>2A</sub>R-deficient mice died (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). Control experiments with healthy, non-LPS treated, wild-type and A<sub>2A</sub>R-deficient mice subjected to hypoxia demonstrated that deficiency in the A<sub>2A</sub>R did not cause death per se, because all mice survived (unpublished data).</p>
        <p>These observations of survival were further supported by measurements of BAL and plasma levels of the cytokines tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6), and the chemokine major intrinsic protein 2α (MIP-2α), all of which are considered to be early mediators of lethal endotoxic shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b20">20</xref>]. Accordingly, the outcome of survival experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g007">Figure 7</xref>B) was in agreement with that from higher concentrations of TNF-α, IL-6, and MIP-2α in hypoxic (10% oxygen) A<sub>2A</sub>R-deficient mice as compared to hypoxic wild-type mice 2 h after IT LPS injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g007">Figure 7</xref>C). No time points after 2 h could be compared in wild-type versus A<sub>2A</sub>R-deficient mice, because A<sub>2A</sub>R knockout mice started to die soon after IT LPS-injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g007">Figure 7</xref>B).</p>
        <p>Interestingly, the increase in hypoxia A<sub>2A</sub>R-controlled TNF-α levels was accounted for by local accumulation in the lung, because BAL concentrations of this cytokine were on average ten times higher than in the systemic circulation, although the BAL volume was at least three times higher than that of a mouse's blood. By contrast, levels of IL-6 and MIP-2α were much higher in the systemic circulation, suggesting that TNF-α BAL levels may serve as a useful marker for lung inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g007">Figure 7</xref>C). Moreover, the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g007">Figure 7</xref>D support the view that pulmonary proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α levels are indeed under the negative control of the hypoxia → A<sub>2A</sub>R pathway. This is supported by data showing no differences in BAL TNF-α concentrations between <italic>A<sub>2A</sub>R</italic> gene-deficient mice breathing either 10% or 100% oxygen. In contrast, the BAL TNF-α concentrations were significantly lower in hypoxic wild-type mice (with functioning hypoxia → adenosine → A<sub>2A</sub>R pathway) than in mice breathing pure oxygen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g007">Figure 7</xref>D).</p>
        <p>Taken together, these experiments support the view that both hypoxia and A<sub>2A</sub>R are needed to down-regulate lung inflammation, and that oxygenation exacerbates lung injury due to interruption of the tissue-protecting hypoxia → A<sub>2A</sub>R anti-inflammatory pathway. Thus, these observations leave no room for yet another lung tissue-protecting hypoxia → X receptor signaling pathway in tested experimental conditions. This knowledge suggested a direct and effective therapeutic countermeasure to reap benefits of oxygenation without sacrificing still-healthy lung tissues to continuing inflammatory damage: use of the A<sub>2A</sub>R agonist CGS21680.</p>

Representative H&amp;E-stained slices in the right two photomicrographs show less intracapillary PMN sequestration and almost no intraalveolar accumulation of PMNs in CGS21680-treated mice. These CGS21680-induced changes are similar to those observed for the effects of hypoxia on endotoxin- injected animals (compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g006">Figure 6</xref>C).</p>

        <p>Treatment with CGS21680 was effective even when applied in the more severe polymicrobial toxin model of lung injury (i.e., LPS + SEB); IT injections of this agonist under hyperoxic conditions rescued the majority of mice from oxygenation-induced death. The death rate was 80% among oxygenated mice with inflammatory lung injury in the control group, but dramatically less among those treated with the A<sub>2A</sub>R agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g009">Figure 9</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The oxygenation of hypoxic patients with impaired lung function is an important and life-saving therapeutic measure, but 15% of patients with ARDS still die from treatment-refractory hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b18">18</xref>]. We here provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that, in a mouse model of lung inflammation, while oxygenation relieves the immediate life-threatening consequences of hypoxemia, it also further exacerbates acute lung injury and even may lead to death due to the interruption of the critically important, nonredundant hypoxia → adenosine → A<sub>2A</sub>R-mediated lung-protecting pathway. This conclusion is supported by (i) the strong increase in lung inflammation and mortality after short-term exposure of mice to high and even to moderately elevated concentrations of oxygen (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g002">2</xref>); (ii) the causative pathogenic role of PMNs in inflammatory lung injury (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g003">Figure 3</xref>) and the up-regulation of A<sub>2A</sub>R expression on alveolar PMNs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g004">Figures 4</xref>); (iii) the critical role of A<sub>2A</sub>R in lung protection from enhanced accumulation of PMNs as well as more pronounced vascular permeability and stronger impairment of lung gas exchange in A<sub>2A</sub>R genetically deficient mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g005">Figure 5</xref>A) and in A<sub>2A</sub>R antagonist-treated wild-type mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g005">Figure 5</xref>B); (iv) the strong lung-protective effects of hypoxia by suppression of PMN emigration, PMN activation, lung vascular permeability, and impairment of gas exchange in wild-type mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g006">Figure 6</xref>); (v) the evidence that hypoxia is upstream of A<sub>2A</sub>Rs in the same anti-inflammatory, lung tissue-protecting pathway, as shown by the failure of the adenosine-producing (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g007">Figure 7</xref>A) hypoxia to protect A<sub>2A</sub>R-deficient mice from death and excessive pulmonary TNF-α cytokine production (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g007">Figure 7</xref>B–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g007">7</xref>D), and (vi) the confirmation of the hypoxia-elicited lung-protective effects in wild-type mice by the A<sub>2A</sub>R agonist CGS21680 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g008">Figure 8</xref>), which (vii) could rescue mice from hyperoxia-accelerated death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g009">Figure 9</xref>).</p>
      <p>By confirming the molecular mechanism of the predicted exacerbation of lung injury by oxygenation, this mechanism also offers a direct and effective preventive measure by compensating for the oxygenation-related loss of endogenous adenosine. Accordingly, we suggest the reevaluation of relevant ventilation and oxygenation protocols and the consideration of compensatory therapeutic treatments of oxygenated-inflamed lungs with A<sub>2A</sub>R agonists (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b07">7</xref>]) to prevent uninterrupted inflammatory lung damage (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g008">Figure 8</xref>) and death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Other anti-inflammatory drugs alone or in combination with an A<sub>2A</sub>R agonist should be also considered in future refinements of this approach, because an A<sub>2A</sub>R agonist offers the advantage of pharmacologically restoring the physiological tissue-protecting pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b04">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b12">12</xref>], which is unintentionally weakened by therapeutic oxygenation.</p>
      <p>It is likely that these findings are most applicable to ARDS patients, although other clinical situations in which inflamed lungs are oxygenated should be also considered. The lungs of ARDS patients are known to be heterogenously ventilated, leaving substantial lung areas hypoxic with up to 33% of total lung volume being nonaerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b21">21</xref>]. These are the most damaged and therefore hypoxic lung regions, where—counterintuitively—hypoxia may protect still-healthy surrounding lung tissues from the additional inflammatory injury by promoting formation of extracellular adenosine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b08">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b10">10</xref>] and strengthening the anti-inflammatory A<sub>2A</sub>R signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b04">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b07">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b12">12</xref>]. Supportive ventilation to increase lung tissue oxygen levels also eliminates the hypoxia-associated formation of anti-inflammatory endogenous adenosine, and this allows the unopposed continuation of the inflamed lung destruction. Thus, a necessary medical intervention (oxygenation of oxygen-deprived patients) may also cause an iatrogenic exacerbation of the very condition that led to the need for oxygenation in the first place. Such pathophysiological consequences of tissue oxygenation are expected to be most pronounced in collapsed hypoxic lung areas that would be recruited by any kind of ventilatory strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b22">22</xref>].</p>
      <p>In agreement with our findings are sporadic observations of effects of oxygenation in other clinical human protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b24">24</xref>] and experimental assays in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b26">26</xref>]. For instance, intraoperative administration of 100% oxygen augmented proinflammatory cytokine production of alveolar macrophages within 2–8 h of the start of anesthesia and surgery in patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b24">24</xref>]. Similarly, in animal models of lung injury, a synergistic action between infectious agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b25">25</xref>], bacterial toxins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b26">26</xref>], or acid aspiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b27">27</xref>] and hyperoxia was demonstrated and difficult to explain by direct oxygen toxicity. Indeed, the time periods of these effects were much too short for the manifestation of oxygen toxicity, which usually takes more than 64–72 h to become clinically apparent in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b14">14</xref>]. Of note, in the same mouse strain (C57BL/6) that we used in our studies, breathing of pure oxygen did not result in death before the fourth day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b15">15</xref>].</p>
      <p>Although it is likely that synergy between lung-damaging noxious agents and oxygen is mediated by oxygen radicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b27">27</xref>], the elimination by oxygenation of the natural anti-inflammatory hypoxia → A<sub>2A</sub>R signaling pathway was not appreciated before, which may account for a significant proportion of inflammatory complications in patients.</p>
      <p>Our observations of potent anti-inflammatory effects of hypoxia in lung injury (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g007">7</xref>D) are in agreement with previously published effects of hypoxia, including significant attenuation of emigration of neutrophils to the site of inflammation in carrageenin-induced pleurisy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b28">28</xref>], inhibition of granulocyte adhesion to endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b29">29</xref>], enhanced shedding of adhesion molecule CD11b from PMNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b30">30</xref>], and suppression of cytokine formation when PMNs are in contact with extracellular matrix proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b31">31</xref>]. Use of <italic>cd39</italic>- and <italic>cd73</italic>-null animals revealed that extracellular adenosine produced through adenine nucleotide metabolism during hypoxia is a potent mechanism attenuating excessive tissue PMN accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b09">9</xref>]. Hypoxia was also shown to strongly inhibit production of MCP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b32">32</xref>], IL-1β [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b33">33</xref>], granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b34">34</xref>], and induced down-regulation of cosignaling molecules (CD80) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b35">35</xref>]. Hypoxia was further shown to cause decreased expression of Toll-like receptor 4 receptors by inhibiting translocation of activator protein 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b36">36</xref>] and caused suppression of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Escherichia coli</named-content>-induced nuclear factor κB and activator protein 1 transactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b37">37</xref>]. Finally, hypoxia was shown to stimulate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity and thereby protect human lung microvascular endothelial cells and epithelial type II-like A549 cells from subsequent oxygen toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b38">38</xref>].</p>
      <p>However, hypoxia was also shown to exert some proinflammatory effects in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b39">39</xref>] and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b09">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b41">41</xref>] for time intervals ranging from 3 to 12 h, which may not reflect the long-term effects of hypoxia on inflammatory processes as assessed in our study.</p>
      <p>Importantly, the virtually complete lung protection from the proinflammatory effects of 100% oxygen by an immunosuppressive A<sub>2A</sub>R agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030174-g009">Figure 9</xref>) supports the view that exacerbation of lung damage by 100% oxygen could be almost fully accounted for by immune mechanisms in addition to mechanical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b43">43</xref>] or radical-mediated mechanisms of lung injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b02">2</xref>]. It remains to be determined, however, whether the much longer time course of the direct toxicity of 100% oxygen in healthy, noninflamed lungs could be explained by the recruitment of immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b44">44</xref>], which then, in turn, would exacerbate the 100% oxygen-triggered lung tissue damage through prolongation of trauma-initiated inflammation.</p>
      <p>Finally, the observations and conclusions of this report may have implications for the widely used therapeutic oxygenation in patients with lung injury, and may answer the long-standing question as to why lungs are the most susceptible to inflammatory injury and why lung failure usually precedes multiple organ failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b46">46</xref>]. We propose that the diseased lung might be uniquely susceptible to iatrogenic damage by oxygenation, because the lungs are exposed to the highest levels of oxygen tension of all organs. Therefore, this critical, A<sub>2A</sub>R signaling-mediated, hypoxia-driven, lung tissue-protecting anti-inflammatory mechanism is the most vulnerable to elimination by oxygenation in the hypoxic areas of damaged lung as compared to other vital organs.</p>

The thoracic cage was opened to allow lungs to expand during injection of 1 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde. After 15 min, the lungs were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde until processing and H&amp;E staining (American Histolabs, Washington, Maryland). Quantitative analysis of lung neutrophil sequestration was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b49">49</xref>], and lung tissue injury was semiquantitatively assessed in a blinded fashion by a professional pathologist (I. Bittmann, MD). Lung slices of IT LPS-injected groups of mice were first assessed for pathological changes in general, enabling identification of lung inflammation parameters to be further evaluated in a semiquantitative way by assignment of four degrees of increasing severity. Overall assessment of slides showed acute blood congestion, intraseptal and intraalveolar neutrophil sequestration, interstitial edema, intraalveolar macrophage accumulation, pneumocyte type II activation, endothelial cell activation, and endothelial adherence of leukocytes. No intraalveolar edema and no fibrin deposits were observed. Lung tissue injury was then evaluated by assignment of four degrees of severity (0–3) to the following parameters in H&amp;E stained lung slides: interstitial edema formation, intraalveolar macrophage accumulation, pneumocyte activation, endothelial cell activation, and leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. The lung injury score of each lung slice was calculated as an average of each parameter's degree of severity, ranging from 0 for a healthy lung to 15 (= 5 × 3) for a maximally injured lung.

In parallel experiments designed to test the effects of CGS21680 on blood granulocytes, cells were preincubated with LPS (10 μg/ml) in the absence or presence of the A<sub>2A</sub>R agonist for 15 min, then stimulated by addition of the chemotactic tripeptide fMLP (10 μM). When pharmacologic effects of CGS21680 were tested on BAL granulocytes, no LPS was added. Cells were washed two times with ice-cold PBS that contained bovine serum albumin (0,5%). FcgII/III receptors were blocked by anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (10 min, 1 mg/ml) and cells were incubated with PE-anti-mouse Ly6G (Gr-1) (15 min, 0,5 mg/ml). After washing with PBS, cells were subjected to flow cytometry. Granulocytes were identified by staining for Gr-1 on Fl-2. Hydrogen peroxide production was determined by the fluorescence intensity of rhodamine on Fl-1. Appropriate compensation was set on fluorescence channels to avoid signal overlap. All data were collected in the log-amplified mode, and readings linearized using CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson, San Diego, California, United States). Spontaneous activity was calculated by subtraction of values of cells kept on ice from those incubated at body temperature. Chemotactically induced activity was determined by subtraction of values obtained at body temperature from those after addition of fMLP.</p>

          <title>Preparation of granulocytes from bone marrow.</title>
          <p>Bone marrow was removed from femur and tibia by injection of HBSS medium, washed two times, and resuspended in HBSS medium. Remaining red blood cells were removed by dextran sedimentation, and neutrophils were recovered by discontinuous Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. Purity of cells (over 90% granulocytes) was checked and further used for cAMP and adenosine receptor mRNA determination as outlined below.</p>

          <title>Modulation and measurement of cAMP production of PMNs by A<sub>2A</sub>R stimulation and antagonism in vitro</title>
          <p>In vivo-activated granulocytes recovered by BAL from inflamed lungs or naïve granulocytes obtained from bone marrow of healthy mice were incubated in the presence of rolipram (1 μM, 37 °C, 30 min) and activated with fMLP (10 μM) in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of the A<sub>2A</sub>R agonist CGS21680. Specificity was tested by either pharmacological antagonism (A<sub>2A</sub>R antagonist ZM241385 1 μM) or using cells from A<sub>2A</sub>R<sup>−/−</sup> mice. After 2 min of chemotactic activation, cAMP metabolism was stopped by addition of HCl and putting cells on dry ice. Cell suspensions were kept frozen (−80 °C) until analysis of cAMP levels as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b50">50</xref>]. Freshly prepared thymocytes from wild-type mice in which cAMP production was induced by CGS21690 (10 μM) in the absence or presence of ZM241385 were used as a positive control. Since ZM241385 concentration-dependently decreased the cAMP production of thymocyte elicited by A<sub>2A</sub>R activation with a fixed concentration of adenosine, the system was also used to determine the plasma concentrations of ZM241385 during the in vivo treatment of mice with the antagonist (unpublished data).</p>

          <title>Blood sampling and determination of plasma concentrations of adenosine.</title>
          <p>Arterial blood samples were drawn from anesthetized mice by cardiac puncture using ice-cooled syringes pre-filled with a stop solution containing EHNA (20 μM), dipyridamole (200 μM), EDTA-Na<sub>2</sub> (20 mM), EGTA (20 mM), and dl-α-glycerophosphate to prevent degradation or additional formation of plasma adenosine. Mice were breathing 21% oxygen or 10% oxygen atmosphere at least 5 min before cardiac blood sampling. By obtaining arterial blood samples from the left ventricle, the loss of the adenosine due to its rapid degradation by adenosine deaminases was minimized and plasma concentrations of adenosine better reflected those in lung tissue, although local levels of adenosine in hypoxic tissues are expected to be much higher. Drawn samples were processed and plasma concentrations of adenosine determined by HPLC as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030174-b52">52</xref>].</p>
