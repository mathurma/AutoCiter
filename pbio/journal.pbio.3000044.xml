<abstract>
<p>Many bacterial pathogens hijack macrophages to egress from the port of entry to the lymphatic drainage and/or bloodstream, causing dissemination of life-threatening infections. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we report that <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection generates directional electric fields (EFs) in the follicle-associated epithelium of mouse cecum. In vitro application of an EF, mimicking the infection-generated electric field (IGEF), induces directional migration of primary mouse macrophages to the anode, which is reversed to the cathode upon <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection. This infection-dependent directional switch is independent of the <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) type III secretion system. The switch is accompanied by a reduction of sialic acids on glycosylated surface components during phagocytosis of bacteria, which is absent in macrophages challenged by microspheres. Moreover, enzymatic cleavage of terminally exposed sialic acids reduces macrophage surface negativity and severely impairs directional migration of macrophages in response to an EF. Based on these findings, we propose that macrophages are attracted to the site of infection by a combination of chemotaxis and galvanotaxis; after phagocytosis of bacteria, surface electrical properties of the macrophage change, and galvanotaxis directs the cells away from the site of infection.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Bacterial pathogens can invade and survive within macrophages and use them as a vehicle to reach important organs of a human body, resulting in life-threatening infections, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Our current understanding is that macrophages are recruited to the infected site by sensing gradients of chemokines and/or cytokines released by damaged cells—a process known as chemotaxis. However, this mechanism does not explain how macrophages containing the pathogens escape the site to reach the bloodstream. Here, we use a disseminated <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection model in mice and detect electric fields (EFs) generated by <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection at the gut epithelium, which can drive unidirectional migration of macrophages towards the anode—a biological process also known as galvanotaxis. We further demonstrate that macrophage galvanotaxis can be reversed to the cathode by phagocytosis of the bacteria. Based on these findings, we propose that macrophages are attracted to the site of infection by a combination of chemotaxis and galvanotaxis; after phagocytosis of bacteria, the electrical properties of the macrophage change, and galvanotaxis directs the cells away from the site of infection allowing the escape of the macrophages that contain pathogens.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Common bacterial pathogens such as <italic>Salmonella</italic>, <italic>Shigella</italic>, and <italic>Yersinia</italic> spp. invade the gut epithelial barrier, preferentially by targeting the relatively small number of M cells located in the follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref003">3</xref>]. Disruption of epithelial integrity releases chemokines that attract immune cells such as neutrophils and macrophages—a process known as chemotaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref007">7</xref>]. Subsequent phagocytosis and clearance of these pathogens by immune cells usually stops the infection. However, some of these bacterial pathogens have developed strategies, such as the type III secretion systems in <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref012">12</xref>], to evade macrophage killing and survive inside the macrophage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref016">16</xref>], an environment in which the pathogen is hidden from the immune system. Survival within the macrophage allows the pathogen to spread from its entry site to the spleen, liver, bone marrow, and other organs via the bloodstream, resulting in life-threatening consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref019">19</xref>]. Although chemotaxis can explain how macrophages reach an infected site, it cannot explain how macrophages harboring pathogens escape from the bacterial entry site to reach the lymphatic drainage and/or bloodstream, a critical initial step in the dissemination process that is understudied and poorly understood.</p>
<p>Bioelectric signals have been implicated in development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref023">23</xref>], wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref026">26</xref>], and regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref028">28</xref>]. For example, a wound collapses the transepithelial potential (TEP) difference of an intact epithelial barrier, generating laterally oriented endogenous electric fields (EFs) of up to 1.4 V cm<sup>−1</sup>, as well as local electric current densities (J<sub>I</sub>) of several μA cm<sup>−2</sup>. These bioelectric phenomena actively control wound healing in the skin and cornea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref029">29</xref>]; however, they are extremely challenging to study in the gut epithelium due to limited accessibility and have never been characterized in vivo during an active infection. Nonetheless, it is generally appreciated that an EF on this scale can drive directional cell migration—a process known as electrotaxis or galvanotaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref021">21</xref>]. Many cell types, regardless of their origin, respond to an exogenous EF by directional migration toward the cathode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref030">30</xref>], whereas others, e.g., human keratinocytes (HaCat cells) and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, migrate toward the anode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref031">31</xref>]. Macrophages and lymphocytes also undergo galvanotaxis in vitro and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref034">34</xref>].</p>
<p>In the present study, we have developed an ex vivo mouse cecum model of <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection that enables bioelectricity measurement. We report that <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection generates a directional EF at the bacterial entry sites that can recruit macrophages by galvanotaxis. We demonstrate that primary macrophages reverse galvanotaxis direction upon <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection by modifying their surface glycan composition, which reduces the negative electric charge on the surface. This directional switch is independent of the <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) type III secretion system, a major virulence determinant responsible for <italic>Salmonella</italic> invasion. Instead, it may require certain glycosidases that are widely conserved in <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp., because cleavage of surface-exposed sialic acids with a potent neuraminidase caused severe defects of macrophage galvanotaxis.</p>

<title>Development of an ex vivo mouse cecum model of <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection for bioelectric characterization</title>
<p>The mouse is an ideal organism for understanding human infectious diseases and is widely used to study bacterial pathogenesis and mucosal immunity of enteropathogenic bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref040">40</xref>]. Previously, we have successfully measured bioelectric currents in various tissue and organ cultures using the noninvasive vibrating probe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref044">44</xref>]; however, measuring bioelectric currents in the mouse small intestinal epithelium is challenging due to limited accessibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref045">45</xref>]. Therefore, we developed a new ex vivo cecum model for measuring bioelectric activity in the gut epithelium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000044.s004">S1 Fig</xref>). This model is based on the well-established mouse typhoid model, in which mice orally infected with <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serotype Typhimurium (<italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium) develop disseminated infection that mimics human typhoid disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref036">36</xref>]. Although the ileum is the most commonly targeted organ to study pathogen–host interactions in vivo, it is too small for the bioelectrical measurements in our ex vivo experimental setting. Instead, the size of the mouse cecum is anatomically optimal. <italic>Salmonella</italic> invades the cecum in mice and causes acute appendicitis in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref046">46</xref>]. Furthermore, we can easily identify the FAE under a dissecting microscope, because we found that 90% of C57BL/6 mice have only 1 Peyer’s patch around the blind-end apex, containing 6 to 11 lymphatic follicles.</p>

<title>Active bioelectricity pervades the FAE in the healthy murine cecum</title>
<p>Using microelectrodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref028">28</xref>] in the ex vivo mouse cecum model, we measured a TEP of up to 15 mV, lumen-positive in uninfected mice. Notably, the TEP in the FAE was significantly smaller than that of the surrounding villi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000044.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Next, using a vibrating probe to measure the J<sub>I</sub> close to the gut surface, we detected outward currents at the FAE and inward currents at the villus epithelium, with a magnitude of around 1 μA cm<sup>−2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000044.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Such currents were not detected in the serosal epithelium, despite the presence of a TEP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000044.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), nor in formalin-fixed epithelia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000044.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), suggesting the existence of active bioelectricity restricted to the mucosal epithelium.</p>

<p>It has been well appreciated that mammalian intestinal mucosa maintains a large transmucosal potential difference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref048">48</xref>]. In humans, that potential is up to 12 mV, lumen-negative, in the fasting jejunum and ileum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref050">50</xref>]. Rats, mice, chickens, and fish all maintain a TEP of up to 5 mV in their intestinal epithelium, as measured with Ussing chambers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref051">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref055">55</xref>]; however, these measurements provide no spatiotemporal information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref045">45</xref>]. The TEP of control murine ceca (up to 15 mV) that we have measured directly with glass electrodes under microscopic resolution were well within the physiological range described above; however, it differed spatially, i.e., the TEP of the FAE was significantly lower than the TEP of the surrounding villus epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000044.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Using an ultrasensitive vibrating probe, we further detected ionic currents that run in opposite directions between the FAE and surrounding villi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000044.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Together, these findings unveil lateral voltage gradients and/or constant current loops running between these two structurally and functionally distinct epithelia. In the normal gut scenario, such a bioelectrical landscape may prevent commensals from accidentally entering the FAE and enable the pathogens to specifically target M cells via bacterial galvanotaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref056">56</xref>].</p>

<title><italic>Salmonella</italic> infection generates bioelectric fields at the FAE of its entry site</title>
<p><italic>Salmonella</italic> invades the intestinal epithelium, preferentially by targeting M cells located at an FAE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref057">57</xref>]. If a wound disrupting an epithelium can generate a steady EF, one would envisage that similar EFs must be produced at the <italic>Salmonella</italic> entry site because of the breakage of epithelial integrity and subsequent short-circuit of the transmucosal potential difference. This is indeed the case in our model. In mice intragastrically challenged with <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium, the peak J<sub>I</sub> remarkably reversed to become inward in FAE compared to control mice, whereas that of the villus epithelium increased nonsignificantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000044.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Consistent with this finding, we also detected high variation in TEP from individual <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium–infected mice (up to 25 mV), still lumen-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000044.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), which has also been observed in chemically induced colitis in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref058">58</xref>]. More importantly, penetrating electrodes through disrupted FAE up to 200 μm in depth revealed a stepwise increase in TEP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000044.s005">S2 Fig</xref>), suggesting the existence of an electric potential gradient generated by the <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium infection.</p>
<p>Bacterial invasion and subsequent dissemination to mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and spleen were verified by determination of colony-forming units (CFUs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000044.s007">S4A Fig</xref>), and disruption of FAE was assessed by histological staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000044.s007">S4B Fig</xref>). <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium was undetectable in some of the MLNs and spleens, indicating that some of the FAE and surrounding villi were either uninfected or mildly infected, which explains the wide distribution of TEP and J<sub>I</sub> measured in the <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium–challenged mice.</p>
<p>Based on these results, we coined the term infection-generated electric field (IGEF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000044.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) to distinguish it from a wound-generated electric field (WGEF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref026">26</xref>]. We demonstrate, for the first time, that <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection generated a steady EF (up to 5 V cm<sup>−1</sup>, provided an epithelial thickness of 50 μm) that drives minute directional electric currents, running from the breached FAE into the deep intestinal wall in a stepwise manner. Although how the IGEFs are formed is currently unknown, we speculate on a couple of possible mechanisms. First, in order to establish a steady EF, a potential gradient or a circuit must be formed. Even though there are accumulated charges segregated by the epithelium (positive at the apical side), in a healthy gut a circuit is unlikely to be formed by the epithelium itself due to high resistance of the epithelium, which is sealed by tight junctions. However, given that the intestinal lumen is alkaline (more negative in terms of electrogenesis), a micropotential gradient could be developed in close proximity to the apical side of the gut epithelia, which can drive outward ionic currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000044.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Second, differential expression and asymmetric distribution of ion pumps and channels essential for selective absorption and/or secretion of electrogenic ions by enterocytes and M cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref048">48</xref>] are likely to be critical for the generation of the aforementioned bioelectricity. Future studies using specific channel blockers in combination with our bioelectrical experimental model and techniques will help to pinpoint the molecular mechanism of an IGEF by identifying the channel(s) or pump(s) involved. Third, as in the formation of a WGEF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref059">59</xref>], <italic>Salmonella</italic> preferentially invades and destroys M cells and collapses the epithelial barrier at the FAE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000044.s007">S4B Fig</xref>), which short-circuits the TEP. Subsequently, the short-circuited and augmented TEP could then drive inward ionic currents as supported by the measurements of stepwise increase of the TEP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000044.s005">S2B Fig</xref>). Fourth, in contrast to the healthy alkaline gut, the microenvironment at the <italic>Salmonella</italic> entry site (i.e., the FAE) is likely to be more acidic (more positive in terms of electrogenesis) because of the local inflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref060">60</xref>] and metabolic changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref061">61</xref>] induced by <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection. Such a microenvironmental pH switch could be related or attributed to the reversal of ionic current flow as we detected with vibrating probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000044.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Like the injury currents reported by Sawyer and colleagues in early publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref062">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref064">64</xref>], IGEF-driving ionic currents could affect small blood vessels in the intestinal wall and mesentery to cause a transvascular potential drop or reversal, resulting in 2 possible consequences: an intravascular occlusion that may benefit transendothelial penetration of immune cells (e.g., monocytes, leukocytes) and/or the creation of a galvanotactic route between the infected epithelium and the electrically impacted vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref065">65</xref>].</p>

<title><italic>Salmonella</italic> reverses the directional migration of IGEF-guided macrophage galvanotaxis in vitro</title>
<p>Although IGEFs may provide a guidance cue for the enterocytes or even local stem cells, contributing to the repair process of damaged epithelium, the major focus of this work is, rather, to investigate its biopathological role in the systemic <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection, specifically during the initiation of macrophage-driven dissemination. Previous studies have shown that applying an EF in vitro can direct macrophage galvanotaxis to the anode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref034">34</xref>]. We confirmed this phenotype by demonstrating that the primary mouse peritoneal macrophages (PMs), in response to an exogenous EF tuned to mimic the in vivo IGEF (mathematics in Materials and methods), underwent robust unidirectional migration to the anode (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000044.s016">S1 Movie</xref>). This unidirectional migration was verified by immunostaining showing that nearly 100% of macrophages were polarized to the anode with a distinct morphology characterized by a leading pseudopodium of dense actin meshwork and a rearward uropod. However, upon challenge with <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium IR715, the average directionality of EF-induced galvanotaxis decreased significantly, with approximately 41% of the macrophages reversing their migratory direction from the anode to the cathode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000044.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000044.s017">S2 Movie</xref>). Although PMs have been widely used in bacterial infection studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref066">66</xref>], likely due to the ease of harvesting, the most commonly used primary murine macrophages are the bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) because of their high yield and less heterogeneous nature, which makes them phenotypically and functionally different from PMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref067">67</xref>]. To exclude the possibility that the observed bidirectional migration is restricted to PMs, we generated and tested galvanotaxis of BMDMs as we did with PMs. Although both types of macrophages exhibited similar unidirectional migration (mean directionality: −0.98 versus −0.88) to the anode, reversal in BMDMs infected by <italic>Salmonella</italic> IR715 was more robust than in PMs infected by the same <italic>Salmonella</italic> strain (mean directionality: 0.36 versus −0.18) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000044.g002">Fig 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000044.s008">S5B Fig</xref>). Notably, this phenotype can be reproduced in BMDMs challenged by another 2 virulent <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium strains, LT2 and SL1344 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000044.s008">S5 Fig</xref>), suggesting that directional migration in response to electrical stimuli is an intrinsic hallmark of the macrophages regardless of their origins and that the ability to manipulate and subvert galvanotaxis in these macrophages is conserved in virulent <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp.</p>

<title>Infection-dependent directional switch of macrophage galvanotaxis is SPI-1 independent</title>
<p>Macrophages are professional phagocytes that uptake a broad range of substances; meanwhile, pathogenic <italic>Salmonella</italic> has developed several virulence means to evade macrophage killing, with SPI-1 being the major virulence factor responsible for colonization and invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref068">68</xref>].

<title>Cleavage of surface-exposed sialic acids impairs macrophage galvanotaxis via zeta potential</title>
<p>Sialylated cell surface molecules are negatively charged, creating an electronegative zeta potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref072">72</xref>]. Using an electrophoretic light-scattering technique, we determined the zeta potential of BMDMs under various conditions. The negative zeta potential of macrophages infected by <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium was significantly reduced, i.e., less negative than that of control macrophages (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000044.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). By contrast, macrophages challenged with microspheres showed a nonsignificant zeta potential change compared to that of control macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000044.g004">Fig 4E</xref>), suggesting that the decrease in surface-exposed sialic acids and subsequent reduction of surface negativity is mediated by active bacterial product(s) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref073">73</xref>].</p>
<p>If a decrease of the negatively charged sialic acids of the surface glycoproteins is critical for the directional switch in macrophage galvanotaxis, then cells with their sialic acids enzymatically removed should exhibit a switch or at least a defect in directional migration when exposed to an EF. To test this, we treated freshly isolated mouse BMDMs with a potent neuraminidase (an enzyme that cleaves terminal sialic acid residues from surface-exposed glycoproteins) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref074">74</xref>]. Cleavage of sialic acids following enzymatic treatment was confirmed by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000044.g005">Fig 5A–5C</xref>). As predicted, the zeta potentials of neuraminidase-treated macrophages were significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000044.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). These cells also lost anodal migration compared to control macrophages monitored in parallel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000044.g005">Fig 5E and 5F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000044.s019">S4 Movie</xref>). Further inspection and morphological quantification of macrophages stained with fluorescently labeled actin and/or lectin revealed that 71% of the macrophages treated with neuraminidase failed to establish a polarity and notably, 12% of the cells were polarized to the cathode whereas nearly all the control macrophages (97%) were polarized to the anode in response to the EF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000044.g005">Fig 5G</xref>).</p>

<p>It is well known that a change in the environmental pH can dramatically influence the growth and virulence of <italic>Salmonella</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref075">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref076">76</xref>]. Moreover, by exposure to acidic pH, a condition that is required for activation of several <italic>Salmonella</italic> virulence factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref077">77</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref079">79</xref>], it is possible to modify macrophage surface electrical properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref030">30</xref>]. Therefore, to further determine the importance of surface negativity, we incubated BMDMs in medium at pH 5.8 that markedly reduced the zeta potential (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000044.s014">S11A Fig</xref>), presumably through protonation of the sialylated surface molecules. Similar to the neuraminidase treatment, galvanotaxis of BMDMs under acidic conditions was significantly impaired, resulting in nearly half of the macrophages (47%) losing their directional migration and 14% of the macrophages reversing their polarity to the cathode (S11B-S11D Fig and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000044.s020">S5 Movie</xref>). Although these data are consistent with our previous studies, showing that low pH abrogates directional migration of epithelial cells in response to an EF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref080">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref081">81</xref>], it also suggests that the acidic environment is not only required for the activation of <italic>Salmonella</italic> but also contributes to triggering dissemination.</p>
<p>How does <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection instruct macrophages to reverse EF-directed migration? Firstly, it is important to note that infecting macrophages with a SPI-1 mutant resulted in a directional switch similar to that of WT, with nearly all the macrophages containing live fluorescent protein-expressing bacteria migrating to the cathode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000044.g003">Fig 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000044.s018">S3 Movie</xref>). This suggests a general mechanism, independent of this major virulence factor, even though other specific factor(s) may still be involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref082">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref083">83</xref>]. Previously reported effects have suggested that negatively charged surface glycan moieties are critical for EF-induced cell motility and polarization, which are consistent with our data, and provide a long sought-after mechanism of action. Because macrophages challenged with microspheres did not show a significantly reduced zeta potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000044.g004">Fig 4E</xref>), it is likely that the decrease in surface-exposed sialic acids and reduction of surface negativity is mediated by active bacterial product(s) rather than by metabolic changes in the host itself. It is also important to note that although both <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection and neuraminidase treatment decreased the surface-exposed sialic acids, the latter caused a serious defect in macrophage galvanotaxis without reversing the overall directionality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000044.g005">Fig 5E</xref>), in contrast to <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000044.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). There may be multiple glycosidases involved in surface glycan modification to reverse directionality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000044.g005">Fig 5H</xref>) because <italic>Salmonella</italic> possesses at least 51 putative glycosidases that likely function in glycan degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref084">84</xref>]. In fact, a recent study identified several glycosidases, including a putative neuraminidase, as new virulence factors essential for <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection of epithelial cells, which is again independent of the SPI-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref085">85</xref>]. We are in the process of performing genetic knockouts to identify the factors involved.</p>
<p>It is also possible that modification of surface glycan and reduction of zeta potential were mediated by internalization during phagocytosis of the bacterium itself rather than by bacterial enzymatic activities. For example, macrophages express Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that recognize structurally conserved molecules derived from <italic>Salmonella</italic> and other pathogens. All TLRs contain <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation consensus sites, and both TLR2 and TLR4 require glycosylation for surface translocation and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref086">86</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref087">87</xref>]. Binding of <italic>Salmonella</italic> to these glycosylated receptors and subsequent internalization may reduce surface negativity of macrophages, leading to directional switch under an EF. This idea is supported by our observations in which the accumulation of certain lectin binding aggregates within macrophages infected by <italic>Salmonella</italic> but not in cells challenged by microspheres (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000044.s011">S8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000044.s012">S9</xref> Figs). It is also possible that a macrophage can uptake microspheres without significantly changing its zeta potential (e.g., through a neutralized receptor) and thus still migrate to the anode.</p>
<p>Disseminated <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection is a major health problem of developing countries, responsible for approximately 433,000 deaths annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref088">88</xref>]. Understanding the mechanisms that trigger dissemination is critical for efforts to target this key process for preventive and therapeutic purposes. We propose that macrophages are attracted to the site of infection by a combination of chemotaxis and galvanotaxis, driving the cells in the same direction. After phagocytosis of bacteria, surface electrical properties of the macrophage change, and galvanotaxis directs the cells away from the site of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000044.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Our study represents a new perspective for the initiating mechanisms, suggesting that <italic>Salmonella</italic> disseminates through infection-generated bioelectrical control of macrophage trafficking. It is important to emphasize that the demonstrated bidirectional migration of macrophages to the IGEF-like EFs is not a physical electrophoresis (movement of charged particles under direct-current EF) but rather a complex yet poorly understood biological process that requires phosphoinositide 3-kinases and other critical signaling activities, as well as the cellular motility machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref081">81</xref>]. It is also worth emphasizing that the model proposed in this work is not mutually exclusive with respect to chemotaxis but offers an alternative and/or complementary mechanism of directional migration. Both directional cues can coexist and play equally important roles in orchestrating the initial stage of the innate immune response against bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000044.g006">Fig 6</xref>), although a chemical gradient could be overridden by a strong electrical stimulus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref059">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref089">89</xref>]. Both chemotaxis and galvanotaxis likely share critical signaling pathways as suggested in studies of macrophage-like <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, which are highly sensitive to cyclic adenosine monophosphate gradients, as well as to electrical potential gradients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref090">90</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref092">92</xref>]. Future work utilizing transgenic animals and pharmacological perturbations to target specific pathways (known or unknown) will help to pinpoint key molecules mediating the infection-dependent directional reversal (i.e., the molecular mechanisms to initiate disseminated infection) and response to bioelectric signaling.</p>

TEPs were recorded by microelectrode impalement through the epithelial layers.

Cecal FAE and adjacent villus epithelium were discriminated under a dissecting microscope within a Faraday cage on an antivibration table. In some cases, the TEP were measured as follows: first at the epithelial surface (0 μm), then stepwise at 50, 100, and 200 μm in depth, controlled by a micromanipulator (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000044.s005">S2A Fig</xref>).

<title>Construction of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium expressing fluorescent proteins</title>
<p>In an effort to monitor live intracellular <italic>Salmonella</italic> during macrophage galvanotaxis we constructed an <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium strain derived from IR715 that constitutively expresses mCherry coded in its genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref095">95</xref>].

<title>Oral infection in a mouse model of human typhoid fever</title>
<p>The mouse is a well-established animal model for studying <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref035">35</xref>]. C57BL/6 and other mice carrying a mutation in <italic>nramp1</italic> develop disseminated infections when challenged by <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium, which mimics human typhoid fever [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref099">99</xref>]. For the mouse infection experiment, we used the hyper-disseminative D23580 strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref100">100</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref101">101</xref>]. In brief, D23580 was used to inoculate LB broth and incubated overnight at 37°C. C57BL/6 mice (6 to 10 wk old, mixed sexes) were intragastrically infected with 10<sup>9</sup> bacteria (actual inoculum was determined by plating) in 0.1 ml LB broth. Uninfected mice used as a control were given 0.1 ml sterile LB broth in place of <italic>Salmonella</italic>.</p>
<p>Mice were euthanized at 16 h and 40 h post infection (PI) by CO<sub>2</sub> asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation as the secondary method of euthanasia. The 16 h PI was chosen based on previous studies showing that the best-characterized route for the phagocytes harboring <italic>Salmonella</italic> to reach the bloodstream normally requires between 12 and 20 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref102">102</xref>]. MLNs and spleens were collected aseptically and homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for CFU enumeration.

<title>Isolation and culture of primary mouse PMs and BMDMs</title>
<p>Both PMs and BMDMs were isolated from C57BL/6 mice (6 to 10 wk old, mixed sex) following standard procedures as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref103">103</xref>]. PMs were seeded onto 6-well plates and allowed to adhere to the plastic for 1 to 2 d in DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1× antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Invitrogen). BMDMs were cultured in the same medium as described above but supplemented with 20% L-929 conditioned medium for 6 d (plus an extra feed at day 3), followed by 1-d culture without the conditioned medium. Adherent macrophages were then harvested by gently scraping with a “policeman” cell scraper and used for subsequent experiments accordingly. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue staining and counting.</p>
<p>Our initial galvanotaxis experiments were carried out in PMs. Because we observed better directional switch in BMDMs infected by <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000044.s008">S5 Fig</xref>), subsequent experiments were done in BMDMs, unless stated otherwise.</p>

After 60 min of incubation, cells were gently washed 3× with PBS and further incubated in gentamycin-containing culture media at a final concentration of 50 μg ml<sup>−1</sup> for an additional 60 min. Afterwards, media were replaced with culture media containing 10 μg ml<sup>−1</sup> gentamycin for the duration of the experiment. Intracellular CFU was measured at 16 h PI.

<title>Infection, challenge, and treatment of macrophages</title>
<p>Typically, 4 × 10<sup>4</sup> primary mouse macrophages were seeded per well of engineered silicon stencils sealed in custom-made EF chambers (see “Engineering silicone stencil and EF chamber design” for details) or 96-well glass bottom plates (Nunc) or 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well in 24-well tissue culture-treated plates depending on different experiment needs for 5 to 6 h in culture medium. Overnight cultures of <italic>Salmonella</italic> or fluorescently labeled microspheres were used to infect and/or challenge macrophages at an MOI of 20.

<title>1. Engineering silicone stencil and EF chamber design</title>
<p>We have tested cover glass and plastics coated with different substrates and found that macrophages perform robust and consistent galvanotaxis when cultured in tissue culture dishes (Corning). Therefore, our EF chambers were customized based on 100 mm tissue culture dishes. To facilitate group comparability and EF control, we engineered removable and reusable silicone stencils of multiple wells (diameter of 8 mm, thickness of 2.4 mm) to seed the same batch of cells that can be challenged and/or treated with different bacteria and/or substances and monitored under identical galvanotactic conditions simultaneously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref105">105</xref>].

<title>2. EF application and time-lapse recording</title>
<p>We applied exogenous EF as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref105">105</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref107">107</xref>]. The EF strength is based on the IGEF we measured at the gut epithelium in 2 ways. First, we detected an inward J<sub>I</sub> of approximately 1.5 μA cm<sup>−2</sup> at <italic>Salmonella</italic>-infected FAE. The mouse Ringer’s solution we used in the measurement has a resistivity (ρ) of 19.47 mΩ cm, measured with a conductivity meter. A common approximation to the current density assumes that the current is simply proportional to the EF, as expressed by the following equation (derived from Ohm’s law):

where <italic>E</italic> is the EF. Plugging <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>I</italic></sub> and <italic>ρ</italic> into the equation, we calculated that a density of 1.5 μA cm<sup>−2</sup> equals an EF of 0.77 V cm<sup>−1</sup>. Based on trials in rabbit corneal epithelium, the in vivo J<sub>I</sub> is likely 2 to 4 times larger than the ex vivo J<sub>I</sub> because of the higher resistances of the tissues and of the higher physiological temperature. Second, we detected a TEP of approximately 25 mV crossing a single layer of <italic>Salmonella</italic>-infected gut epithelium. This generates an EF of 5 V cm<sup>−1</sup> providing an epithelial cell height of 50 μm. After testing a range around those values, we have empirically chosen an EF of 4 V cm<sup>−1</sup> because it consistently induced significant directional migration of primary mouse macrophages, although biased directional migration can be achieved by an EF as small as 0.5 V cm<sup>−1</sup>. Actual EF strengths were measured and determined with a voltmeter before and after each EF application.</p>
<p>Cell migration was monitored with a Carl Zeiss Observer Z1 inverted microscope equipped with a motorized stage and an incubation chamber (37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>). Time-lapse contrast images and/or images of appropriate fluorescence channels were captured using MetaMorph NX program (Molecular Devices). A Retiga R6 (QImaging) scientific CCD camera and long exposure time (approximately 2 s) were used to detect and monitor intracellular <italic>Salmonella</italic> expressing fluorescent proteins. Typically, in each experiment, 2 to 4 fields of each condition under a 10× or a long-distance 20× lens were chosen. Images were taken at 5-min intervals for up to 3 h unless stated otherwise.</p>

<p>Time-lapse images were imported, processed, and assembled in ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij" xlink:type="simple">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij</ext-link>). To quantify single-cell and population motility, we extracted the trajectory of each cell migration (&gt;30 cells for each condition) using an automatic and/or manual tracking tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref081">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref105">105</xref>]. Directionality as directedness in cosine theta (cosθ), in which θ is the angle that each cell moved with respect to the EF vector, was quantified from the coordinates of each trajectory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref108">108</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000044.ref109">109</xref>]. If a cell moved perfectly along the field vector toward the cathode, the cosine of this angle would be 1; if the cell moved perpendicular to the field vector, the cosine of this angle would be 0; and if the cell moved directly toward the anode, the cosine of this angle would be −1. Dead cells (macrophages killed by <italic>Salmonella</italic>) or cells unresponsive to the EF (due to neuraminidase treatment or acidic conditions) were either washed away or excluded from quantification by migration speed thresholding. The thresholds were estimated from fixed cells recorded in the same optical parameters and experiment setting for the live macrophages. The galvanotaxis assays and quantification of directionality in BMDMs infected with <italic>ΔinvA</italic> and their isogenic WT <italic>Salmonella</italic> were assigned in a double-blinded manner.</p>
<p>To simulate cell migration, each cell was numbered and its <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> coordinates were measured on the first image and on every subsequent image in the image stack, with the x-axis parallel to the applied EF. The (<italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>) data of each cell were imported with the ImageJ chemotaxis tool plugin and recalculated based on the optical parameters (lens and camera). Trajectories of the cells in each group were simulated in a Cartesian coordinate system by placing the first coordinates of each cell in the origin (0, 0).</p>
<p>To plot the rose histograms, we combined θ of each time interval of tracked cells in each group. The vector θ, expressed in radians, was calculated from the coordinates of each trajectory. The distribution of θ in 12 angle bins and their abundance in percentage were plotted in Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA) using a custom script (available upon request).</p>

(C) Representative traces of bioelectric current measured at the FAE from <italic>Salmonella</italic>-infected or mock-infected control mouse cecum. Probes were calibrated by passing a 1.5 μA cm<sup>−2</sup> electric current through the measuring buffer in either direction (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000044.s015">S1 Data</xref>). By convention, flux of positive charge is used for electric current direction. As in most studies, we used conventional current flow; therefore outward current density is defined as net positive charge leaving the epithelial surface and inward current densities as that entering. Hence, positive values represent net outward current densities, and negative values represent net inward current densities. FAE, follicle-associated epithelium.</p>
