<p>Potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) ion channels switch between open and closed conformations. The nature of this important transition was revealed by comparing the X-ray crystal structures of the MthK channel from <italic>Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum</italic>, obtained in its open conformation, and the KcsA channel from <italic>Streptomyces lividans</italic>, obtained in its closed conformation. We analyzed the dynamic characteristics and energetics of these homotetrameric structures in order to study the role of the intersubunit cooperativity in this transition. For this, elastic models and in silico alanine-scanning mutagenesis were used, respectively. Reassuringly, the calculations manifested motion from the open (closed) towards the closed (open) conformation. The calculations also revealed a network of dynamically and energetically coupled residues. Interestingly, the network suggests coupling between the selectivity filter and the gate, which are located at the two ends of the channel pore. Coupling between these two regions was not observed in calculations that were conducted with the monomer, which emphasizes the importance of the intersubunit interactions within the tetrameric structure for the cooperative gating behavior of the channel.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Potassium channels are found, in essence, in all kingdoms of life and all types of cells, and they are involved in key biological processes. For example, they are involved in the generation and propagation of nerve impulses in the synapse and neuron. Mutations in the proteins that form the channel may lead to diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, cystic fibrosis, and cardiac arrhythmia. Because of their involvement in these and other channelopathies, i.e., channel-related diseases, they are major drug targets. The channels switch between open (ion-conducting) and closed conformations. The structural characteristics of the transition between these conformations were studied using X-ray crystallography, spectroscopic, and single-molecule techniques, as well as computations. Here we used normal-mode analysis and in silico alanine-scanning mutagenesis to understand the molecular underpinnings of this transition. Our results suggest that the transition is mediated through a network of amino acids that are coupled to each other and connect the two ends of the pore. The importance of many of these residues was noted in previous empirical studies. The calculations also suggest that interactions between subunits of the homotetrameric structure of the channel contribute to the transition. The approach may also be useful to elucidate the mechanism of other transmembrane proteins in molecular details and to suggest key amino acids that are functionally important.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Permeation and gating are two fundamental and distinct qualities of ion-channels. Permeation refers to the efficient and selective transfer of ions through the channel pore, governed by the selectivity filter, and gating refers to the control of ion access to the pore. In potassium channels (K-channels), the selectivity filter and gate are located at the opposite ends of the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g001">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g002">2B</xref>).</p>

<title>Dynamic fluctuations in the KcsA channel.</title>
<p>The K-channel may fluctuate between the open and closed conformations. The upper panels show a side view of the X-ray crystal structure of the channel (B; PDB identifier 1bl8) and the slowest mode of fluctuations in opposite directions (A and C). The lower panels show an intracellular view of the corresponding conformations: the X-ray structure (E) and the fluctuations (D and F). The outer (M1), inner (M2), and pore helices (PH) are displayed in red, yellow and blue, respectively. The Gly99 hinge is shown in green. To open the pore, i.e., to switch from the conformation in “C” and “F” to “A” and “D,” the inner and outer helices bend around their hinge sites, the inner helices rotate in a clockwise direction and swing away from the permeation pathway. The arrows indicate the rotations of the inner helices in each subunit. The picture was prepared using Pymol (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pymol.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.pymol.org</ext-link>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-DeLano1">[64]</xref>.</p>

<p>The second slowest mode of fluctuations of the channel is presented from a side view in the upper panels ((A) and (C)) and from an intacellular view in the lower panels ((D) and (F)). The X-ray structure of MthK (PDB identifier 1lnq) is presented in the panels in the middle ((B) and (E)). The color scheme is the same as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g001">Figure 1</xref>. To close the pore, i.e., to switch from the open conformation of “A” and “D” to the closed conformation of “C” and “F”, the inner and outer helices bend around their hinge sites, and the inner helices rotate in a counterclockwise direction. The arrows mark the rotations of the inner helices in each subunit. The picture was prepared using Pymol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-DeLano1">[64]</xref>.</p>

<p>The bacterial K-channels are very similar to each other in their 3D structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Doyle1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Kuo1">[4]</xref>. The channel is a homotetramer, where each monomer includes an outer (M1) and inner (M2) helix that are connected to each other by a pore helix (PH) and selectivity filter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g001">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g002">2B</xref>). The selectivity filter includes the conserved TVGYG sequence motif, and is responsible for the preferential conductance of K<sup>+</sup> over other ions. The segment that connects the outer and pore helices is referred to as the turret loop.</p>
<p>The ability of the structure to undergo conformational transitions and thus control the open/closed states of the pore in response to external signals, such as ligand binding or changes in the membrane potential, is important for proper function of the channel in the cell. Different external signals appear to bring about a similar conformational change in the pore. Studies, using EPR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Perozo1">[5]</xref>, NMR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Baker1">[6]</xref>, X-ray crystallography <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Doyle1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Kuo1">[4]</xref>, and single-molecule techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Shimizu1">[7]</xref>, provided important clues about the nature of the conformational change. The structures of the KcsA channel in its closed conformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Doyle1">[1]</xref> and of the calcium-activated MthK channel in its open state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Jiang1">[2]</xref> were determined. A comparison of the two structures showed that the change is associated primarily with a bend of the inner helices of the four subunits near a highly-conserved glycine residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g001">Figure 1B and 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g002">Figure 2B and 2E</xref> for KcsA and MthK, respectively). Recently it was suggested that this motion, which leads to the transition between the open and closed state of the pore, is coupled to the selectivity filter region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Baker1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Berneche1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Chakrapani1">[10]</xref>, which plays a mechanistic role in channel activation/inactivation.</p>
<p>Systematic studies of the effects of single- and double-mutants in the channel-pore on the gating properties of the voltage-gated <italic>Shaker</italic> K-channel provided convincing evidence that gating is mediated through a chain of energetically-coupled residues that connect the selectivity filter to the gate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Yifrach1">[11]</xref>. This conclusion was further consolidated by computational analysis of the evolutionary history of the channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Fleishman1">[12]</xref>: a cluster of evolutionarily-coupled residues was found, which included many amino acids that are known to be involved in gating. However, these studies failed to determine if the correlations are indicative of inter- or intrasubunit interactions, which is one of the main goals of the current work.</p>
<p>The understanding of molecular function in terms of structure and dynamics requires detailed knowledge of the underlying energy landscape and conformational space <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Akke1">[13]</xref>. Perturbations, caused, e.g., by covalent modifications, mutations, or ligand binding, often change the energy-landscape and shift the sampled conformational space <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Suel1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Gunasekaran1">[15]</xref>. Thus, structural changes may propagate globally in a fracture-like manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Suel1">[14]</xref>. For example, binding interactions can be distributed from the binding site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Whitten1">[16]</xref>, and mutations may cause long-range structural-perturbations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Radkiewicz1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Muzammil1">[18]</xref>. Communication between distant sites is fundamental to the function, requiring structural elements that mediate correlated motions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Esabrook1">[19]</xref>. Identification of such correlations is a formidable effort.</p>
<p>The availability of X-ray crystal structures and a set of highly characterized mutational data of K-channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Doyle1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Jiang1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Yifrach1">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Irizarry1">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Thompson1">[22]</xref> have provided the foundation for atomistic simulation and modeling studies aiming at understanding the dynamic behavior of the channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Berneche1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Berneche2">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Tikhonov1">[26]</xref>. However, the study of long-time and large-scale conformational changes in the gating process is currently beyond the reach of such simulations. Normal-mode analysis based on coarse-grained potentials can fill this gap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Bahar1">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>Previous studies on many different proteins demonstrated that the intrinsic slow modes of motion often correlate with the functionally-important conformational-changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Ma1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Wang2">[30]</xref>. This suggests that protein topology evolved in such a way that their intrinsic flexibilities ease the conformational changes required for function. Recently, Shrivastava and Bahar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Shrivastava2">[31]</xref> conducted normal-mode analysis of the structures of five different K-channels. They demonstrated that the channels share similar low-frequency modes, which facilitate the opening of the pore. Also, in a very recent work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Miloshevsky1">[32]</xref>, the opening of the KcsA pore was investigated by a combined analysis of atomistic normal-mode and Monte Carlo simulations. In the present work, which is complementary to theirs, we analyzed the KscA and MthK structures, in order to study the role of intersubunit cooperativity in K-channel gating. To this end, we combined analysis of the dynamics and energetics of the channels in a novel way.</p>
<p>The dynamics was investigated using two elastic-network models with simple potentials of interactions: Namely, the Gaussian Network Model (GNM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Bahar2">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Haliloglu1">[34]</xref> and the Anisotropic Network Model (ANM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Atilgan1">[35]</xref>. These structure-based models allowed us to analyze the topologically-induced cooperative behavior of the channels in the relevant modes of motion.</p>
<p>In addition, a more realistic potential function, the residue-specific knowledge-based potentials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Bahar3">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Bahar4">[37]</xref>, helped us identifying a simple pairwise-coupling measure, i.e., the intensity of interactions, between the residues by in silico mutagenesis.</p>

<title>Results/Discussion</title>
<p>We analyzed the two structures of the KcsA channel (PBD identifiers 1bl8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Doyle1">[1]</xref> and 1k4c <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Zhou1">[38]</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g001">Figure 1B and 1E</xref>) and the structure of the MthK channel (PDB identifier 1lnq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Jiang1">[2]</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g002">Figure 2B and 2E</xref>).

<title>Overall, Each Subunit Is Made of Four Rigid Elements, Connected by Three Hinges</title>
<p>We conducted calculations using two KcsA structures, 1bl8 and 1k4c, and obtained, in essence, the same results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000164.s001">Text S1</xref>); the results that are presented here were calculated using the former structure.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref> display the fluctuations in the slowest modes of motion of a KscA subunit in isolation and in the tetrameric form, respectively. The first mode, which describes the most cooperative mode of motion of the protein, also dominates the average behavior of all modes of motion of the isolated and tetrameric structures (data not shown). It is evident that the first mode is, in essence, independent of the oligomerization state. This is an indication that the mode is inherent to the subunit's architecture. The curve (solid, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>) suggests that each subunit includes three hinge points: The first is around Leu36 in the outer helix, the second is around Val76 at the selectivity filter, and the third is around Gly99 in the inner helix. This is in agreement with empirical data: Leu36 (in coupling with Ser102) was noted as gating-sensitive in the correlated-mutational analysis of Yifrach and Mackinnon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Yifrach1">[11]</xref>, and Val76 and Gly99 are highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g004">Figure 4</xref>). That Gly99 is a hinge suggests an explanation for the fact that this residue is, in essence, irreplaceable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Jiang1">[2]</xref>. Another conserved site, five amino acids downstream (residue Gly104), which is conserved as Gly or Ala (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g004">Figure 4</xref>), was also previously noted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Jiang1">[2]</xref>. Our analysis suggested that this site is a part of the hinge around Gly99. That the Gly99 through Gly104 region functions as a hinge was also revealed by free-energy calculations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Biggin1">[39]</xref>. Further, the flexibility around the selectivity-filter region, noted here, is in agreement with the large changes in the rotational angles of Gly77 through Asp80, suggested by NMR spectroscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Lange1">[40]</xref>. The flexibility is also in keeping with the rearrangements that were observed experimentally in the region of Leu81 through Pro83 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Kurata1">[21]</xref>. In the latter study, this region was associated with channel inactivation.</p>

<p>Overall, our analysis suggested that each subunit is made of four rigid elements, connected by the three hinges. The first element (I) includes the intracellular part of the outer helix (approximately until residue 35). The second (II) includes the extracellular part of the outer helix, the pore helix and the loop that connects them (approximately residues 38–75). The third (III) includes the extracellular part of the inner helix and the loop that connects it to the selectivity filter (approximately residues 78–98). The fourth (IV) includes the intracellular segment of the inner helix (starting approximately at residue 105).</p>
<p>The subsequent modes correspond to more subtle and less cooperative types of motion. They show that there is another hinge close to the intracellular side of the inner helix around Ala109, which is highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The hinge was observed both in the isolated subunit (second mode; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) and the tetramer (fifth mode; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), which indicates that it is also an intrinsic property of the subunit. The presence of a hinge in this region has emerged in EPR studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Perozo1">[5]</xref> and in previous normal-mode calculations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Shen1">[41]</xref>. Interestingly, a recent normal-mode/Monte Carlo study showed that pore opening was initiated by the motion of the preceding residue, i.e., Ala108 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Miloshevsky1">[32]</xref>.</p>
<p>The tetrameric organization of the subunits suppresses the amplitude of the fluctuations of the intracellular termini of the inner and outer helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The tetrameric organization of the subunits also appears to induce the emergence of a second hinge on the outer helix close to the intracellular termini (the second mode; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, dashed curve). Interestingly, it was noted that His25 in this region of the outer helix interacts with residues at the C-terminus of the inner helices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Thompson1">[22]</xref>. Depending on the pH, the network of interactions across the termini of the inner and outer helices stabilizes the closed state or allows the channel to open.</p>
<p>The hinge regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, dips) correlate reasonably well with the mechanistically-informative sites of the channel, suggested by the experimental single- and double-mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Yifrach1">[11]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>Hinge regions can also be identified based on the correlations between residue fluctuations in a given slow-mode, following the methodology described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000164.s001">Text S1</xref>. The hinge residues detected this way for the seven slowest modes are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000164.s005">Table S1</xref>.

<p>Further analysis, conducted using the MthK structure, which corresponds to an open conformation of the channel, is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000164.s001">Text S1</xref>. The overall behavior of the MthK structure was very similar to that of KcsA, suggesting that the pore domains of K-channels share a similar gating-mechanism.

<title>The Open and Closed Conformations of the Channel</title>
<p>We conducted complementary anisotropic normal-mode analysis to display the direction of the motions predicted by the Gaussian-network model. For this, first the anisotropic normal-modes corresponding to those given by the Gaussian-network model were identified (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000164.s001">Text S1</xref>). The results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g002">2</xref> for the KcsA and MthK channels, respectively. Overall, it is evident from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g001">Figure 1</xref> that the fluctuations of the KcsA channel involve deformation towards the open conformation of the MthK structure. Similarly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g002">Figure 2</xref> show that MthK can deform towards the closed structure of the KcsA channel.</p>
<p>In the X-ray crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g001">Figure 1B and 1E</xref>), the KscA channel is closed. Our calculations showed that fluctuations around this structure in the slowest mode may lead to two deformed conformations: one in which the pore is a bit more closed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g001">Figure 1C and 1F</xref>) and another, in which the pore is open and would allow ion permeation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g001">Figure 1A and 1D</xref>). Overall, the close/open transition involved motion of the rigid structural elements (I–IV) around the three flexible regions, mainly the primary hinges in the inner and outer helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>). The inner and outer helices bent around the hinges in residues Val37 and Gly99, respectively, and their intracellular segments (structural elements I and IV) rotated clockwise, while moving away from the permeation pathway. Such motion was suggested by Perozo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Perozo2">[42]</xref>, who argued that the fact that the motion of these two elements is coupled may help stabilizing the structure. This suggestion gained support when the structure of the MthK channel, obtained in an open conformation, came out <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Jiang1">[2]</xref>. During the conformational change, the extracellular loops of the channel rotated in the opposite direction to the rotation of the intracellular mouth of the channel. The flexibility of the pore-helix/selectivity-filter region contributed significantly to this motion. Such twisting motion around the pore-axis in the transition between the open and closed conformations was recently observed by single molecule techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Shimizu1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the next anisotropic normal-mode of KcsA, the mobility of the extracellular turret loop that connects the outer and pore helices is emphasized (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000164.s001">Text S1</xref>). In this mode, the helix-termini are immobile, but the conformations of the pore helix and the loop between the selectivity filter and the inner helix may be affected by the mobility of the turret loop. In this context, it is interesting to note that molecular dynamics simulations and solid state NMR studies displayed conformational changes in the selectivity filter upon binding of scorpion-toxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Zachariae1">[43]</xref>.</p>
<p>The conformations that describe the fluctuations in the two slowest modes, discussed above also reflect the large variations around the selectivity filter, which agrees with several experimental observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Kurata1">[21]</xref>. Moreover, Trp67 and Glu71 were noticed here to display structural distortions. This is in keeping with empirical studies about the role of Glu71 in conformational changes and C-type inactivation, and the functional importance of Trp67 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-CorderoMorales1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>We repeated the same calculations starting from the open structure of the MthK channel and obtained very similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g002">Figure 2A–F</xref>). Overall, from a cytoplasmic view, channel-opening involves a clockwise rotation of structural elements I and IV at the ends of the inner and outer helices, and closing involves counter-clockwise rotation of the same elements between the two channels. This motion is in agreement with recent single-molecule studies of the KcsA channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Shimizu1">[7]</xref>. The channel behavior with respect to pore-opening should be a superimposition of several modes of motion, but this mode dominates the behavior (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000164.s001">Text S1</xref>).</p>
<p>The fact that similar modes of motion were obtained for two different channels in two different conformations is very reassuring. Moreover, similar calculations showed that the same pore-opening mechanism is shared also by three other channels in addition to these two <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Shrivastava2">[31]</xref>.</p>

<title>Dynamic and Energetic Couplings</title>
<p>We analyzed the KcsA structure, using the Gaussian network model, in search for pairs of amino acids that are dynamically-coupled. We also conducted in silico alanine-scanning mutagenesis studies in order to detect residues that are energetically-linked. One of the aspects that were explored is the cooperation between the selectivity filter and gate region at the opposite ends of the channel pore. Particular emphasis was made on the discrimination between intra- and intersubunit cooperativity within the homotetrameric structure, which is particularly challenging experimentally. Overall, there is significant overlap and complementarities between the results of the dynamic- and energetic-coupling analysis: Residue pairs, whose fluctuations are positively-correlated, are typically located in spatial proximity to each other, and are often linked on the energy landscape. In contrast, residue pairs with negatively correlated fluctuations are far from each other in space (up to tens of Angstroms) and their dynamic coupling is often mediated through chains, made of pairs of residue that are energetically coupled.</p>

<title>Dynamic Coupling</title>
<p>The dynamic coupling was calculated as an average over the seven slowest modes, which approximates the overall behavior (see Model and Methods in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000164.s001">Text S1</xref>). In addition we also studied the behavior of the individual modes.</p>
<sec id="s2d1">
<title>Intrasubunit</title>
<p>The average over the slowest modes showed positive correlations between pairs of residues within each of the four structural elements, I–IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). The pattern of dynamic fluctuations between the structural elements showed that the two intracellular ones (I and IV) are positively correlated with each other, which indicates that they move in the same direction. The two extracellular ones (II and III) are positively correlated with each other too but negatively correlated with the intracellular ones (I and IV). In other words, it appears as if the two intracellular elements move together in one direction while the two extracellular elements move in the opposite direction. Together with the results of the anistropic fluctuations mentioned above, this is consistent with the corkscrew-like counter-rotation of the extracellular and cytoplasmic regions of the channel, which was also observed in previous normal-mode analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Shrivastava2">[31]</xref> and in single molecule studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Shimizu1">[7]</xref>.

<p>The motion of the inner helix, which is controlled by the primary and secondary hinges around Gly99 and Ala109, respectively, directly determines the size of the intracellular gate. In this respect, the secondary hinge may allow the minimization of the deformation in the extracellular region as the channel opens. This hinge contributes to the plasticity of the coupling between the two ends of the channel. This phenomenon was not observed in calculations of the individual subunits (data not shown), and previous normal mode analysis attributed it to the intersubunit contacts within the tetrameric structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Shen1">[41]</xref>. The motion of the intracellular termini of the inner helices away from the pore at Ala108 was observed as part of the gate-opening process in recent atomistic normal-mode and Monte Carlo simulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Miloshevsky1">[32]</xref>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in comparison to the rest of the intracellular regions (II and III), the selectivity filter displays stronger negative correlations with the ends of the inner and outer helices (regions I and IV) in the opposite end of the membrane. The selectivity filter with its flexible nature maintains this coupling, which is absent in calculations using the individual subunit. This coupling is linked to the primary (∼Gly99) and secondary (∼Ala109) hinges of the inner helix.</p>

<p>The motions of the termini of the inner and outer helices of the four subunits (I and IV) are positively correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g005">Figure 5B and 5C</xref>). Interestingly, the selectivity filter, located in the extracellular region, moves independently of the rest of the extracellular elements of its own subunit. However, it displays negatively-correlated fluctuations with elements I and IV, and positively-correlated fluctuations with the extracellular mouth of the other subunits. Similar interactions were detected also between the juxtaposed subunits but they are somewhat weaker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g005">Figure 5B and 5C</xref>). The observed correlation between the motions of the selectivity filter and the gate is in line with recent EPR spectroscopy studies, which showed that these regions control channel activation and inactivation in a coupled manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-CorderoMorales1">[9]</xref>.</p>

<p>We looked at the interaction intensities and number of residues that are energetically coupled to a given residue, and identified hotspot residues, following the criteria that are described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref> below.

<p>Our analysis showed that many of the hotspot and energetically-coupled residues have been reported to be important for proper function of the channel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000164.s001">Text S1</xref>).

<p>For example, residues in the selectivity filter were coupled to residues at the N- terminus of the inner helix, close to the hinge around Gly99. In our calculations, coupling was observed both within (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) and amongst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g006">Figure 6B and 6C</xref>) subunits. The pair of primary hinges in the inner and outer helices had higher propensities for the intra- rather than intersubunit interactions. The pairs associated with residues around the Gly99 hinge could be related to both intra- and intersubunit interactions. Interestingly, part of the cooperativity that was detected between the hinges around Gly99 and Ala109 in the inner helix seems to be more emphasized via the intersubunit interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).

<title>The isolated subunit versus the subunit within the tetramer</title>
<p>The most significant difference in the comparison of the intramolecular correlations of an isolated subunit vs. the subunit within the context of the tetrameric structure was the absence of any correlation between the selectivity filter and the intracellular termini of the inner and outer helices in the former (data not shown). This is a key correlation that involves communication between the two ends of the permeation pathway. Also, the hinge around Ala109 in the inner helix, which is a generic hallmark of the isolated subunits of both KcsA and MthK, did not contribute to the structural fluctuations of the individual subunit (see Dynamic Couplings). This observation is mainly due to the absence of the intermolecular energetic connectivity (see Energetic Couplings).</p>

<title>Cooperativity</title>
<p>We identified a network of cooperative fluctuations that facilitates the communication between the two openings of the pore, i.e., from the selectivity filter in one end to the gate in the other. The fluctuations of these two regions may be in the same or opposite directions, depending on the motion frequency. The determinants of this communication are mechanically-informative regions of the structure, which are subjected to intra- and intersubunit interactions. Here we relate our results on the cooperative behavior to previous investigations.</p>
<p>Yifrach and MacKinnon found gating-sensitive mutations both in the extra- and intracellular sides of the channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Yifrach1">[11]</xref>. Our results agree with their findings in that we saw dynamic and energetic couplings between residues at the two ends of the permeation pathway. A hinge-lever motion could maximally amplify the fluctuations at the extracellular side by small movements at the intracellular side <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Shen1">[41]</xref>. The calculations attributed this behavior to the hinges in the transmembrane helices, which are intrinsic to the individual subunits. On the other hand, intersubunit interactions facilitated the coupled fluctuations between the selectivity filter and gate region. The same is true for the role of the secondary-hinge around Ala109 in flipping the sense of the coupling between these two regions and reducing the deformation of the intacellular termini of the inner helices. Overall, our results provide further support to the notion that the selectivity filter is also an activation gate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Berneche1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-CorderoMorales1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Chapman1">[47]</xref>, as well as to the importance of the intracellular sides of the helices in the gating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Radkiewicz1">[17]</xref>. Further, we showed that the intersubunit contacts contribute significantly to the emergence of these functionally-important motions.</p>

Interestingly, this interaction is predominantly due to intersubunit couplings of the fluctuations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g005">Figure 5A–C</xref>) and changes with respect to the sense of the coupling between the selectivity filter and gate region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000164.s002">Figure S1A–F</xref>).

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The K<sup>+</sup> channels are able to undergo conformational transitions in response to external forces, such as ligand binding or electrical signals, that lead to the opening or closing of the pore, i.e., the gating. Recently, Miloshevsky and Jordan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Miloshevsky1">[32]</xref> used a hybrid method, based on atomistic normal-mode analysis and Monte Carlo simulations, and suggested a molecular mechanism for the opening of the KcsA channel. Their approach is based on atomistic representation (and elaborated calculations). Thus, one cannot expect perfect matching between the motion pathway that they suggest and the results obtained using coarse-grained approaches of the type that was used here. Furthermore, the normal-mode analysis suggests only projections of the real motion. Nevertheless, the channel-opening pathway that was observed in the simulations of Miloshevsky and Jordan is similar to the motion suggested in the present normal-mode analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000164-g001">Figure 1A–C</xref>) and in Shrivastava and Bahar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Shrivastava2">[31]</xref>, both of which are based on a single parameter. It is important to note that in contrast to the study of Miloshevsky and Jordan, our goal was not to suggest a hypothetical pathway for channel opening but rather to suggest the molecular underpinnings of the motion.</p>
<p>The main concern regarding our calculations, perhaps with computational analysis in general, is to determine how much of the results are biologically relevant. For example, how many of the slowest modes should be considered in order to capture the functional dynamics of the channel? The analysis of the slow modes individually, and in groups of similar frequencies, suggests their contribution to the overall dynamics and allows considering these that reflect the intrinsic behavior of the structure. Here we used two elastic network models, namely anisotropic normal-mode and Gaussian network model analyses, which complement and assure the predictions at the same time. On the other hand, we conducted calculations using two different structures of the KcsA channel and obtained, in essence, the same results. We also carried out calculation for another K-channel: MthK, and obtained similar results. In this respect, it is important to notice that KcsA and MthK share the same fold but only 25% sequence identity. They represent two states of the channel: Open and closed; and they are significantly different in the lengths of the helices and the intersubunit contacts. Thus, the fact that they share similar modes of motion is far from being trivial. It is noteworthy that Ivet Bahar's lab analyzed five different structures of potassium channels and showed convincingly that essentially these structures share the same slow modes of fluctuation (although their order of importance changes) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Shrivastava2">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>As another mean to examine the validity of the results, we investigated the coupling between amino acids based on two complementary methods, i.e., we looked at dynamic- and energetic-coupling and analyzed this coupling with respect to the channel function. As we pointed out above, there is good correlation between our results and previous computational and experimental studies.</p>
<p>Our analysis provided a plausible fingerprint of the network of coupled dynamic fluctuations that may govern K-channel gating. This network revealed coupling between the selectivity filter and gate region that are located in the opposite sides of the membrane. The change in the direction of the couplings between the fluctuations of these two regions is the reminiscent of the interplay between these two regions and may refer to the different states of the channel. Each subunit includes inherent modes of motion, but gating results from cooperative effects of the tetrameric structure rather than independent motions of the individual subunits. In general, the results implied that the gating and cooperativity in this process are determined by the overall channel architecture rather than the details as reflected in the amino acid sequence.</p>

<p>We mutated, in silico, single residues or pairs of residues to Ala, while keeping the rest of the amino acids unaltered. For simplicity, we assumed that mutant and wild type have the same backbone and side chain conformations. Taking the wild type as a reference, we calculated the energy of the singly- and mutated protein. The absolute difference in the energy of the double mutant in comparison to that of the corresponding single mutants was taken as a measure of the degree of energetic-coupling. The larger the magnitude of the difference, the more coupled the residues were. This strategy is related to the experimental studies of Yifrach and MacKinnon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000164-Yifrach1">[11]</xref>.</p>

<title>The Detection of Hotspot Residues</title>
<p>Hotspots are defined as residues that are energetically-coupled strongly to ample residues. Here they were detected using the following criteria. First, we included only coupling that was stronger than a preset threshold that was defined based on <italic>z</italic>-score analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000164.s001">Text S1</xref>). Second, we required coupling to a total of seven residues. This value was determined ad hoc based on the distribution of the number of interactions per residue. A bimodal distribution was observed: most of the residues interacted with a small number of residues, and a minority of the residues interacted with 7 or more. The latter were considered to be hotspot residues.</p>
