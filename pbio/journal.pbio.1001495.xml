        <p>Gps1 provides a novel molecular polarity cue at the cell division site that guides Rho1- and Cdc42-dependent polarization during and after cytokinesis in budding yeast.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>The spatiotemporal control of cell polarity is crucial for the development of multicellular organisms and for reliable polarity switches during cell cycle progression in unicellular systems. A tight control of cell polarity is especially important in haploid budding yeast, where the new polarity site (bud site) is established next to the cell division site after cell separation. How cells coordinate the temporal establishment of two adjacent polarity sites remains elusive. Here, we report that the bud neck associated protein Gps1 (GTPase-mediated polarity switch 1) establishes a novel polarity cue that concomitantly sustains Rho1-dependent polarization and inhibits premature Cdc42 activation at the site of cytokinesis. Failure of Gps1 regulation leads to daughter cell death due to rebudding inside the old bud site. Our findings provide unexpected insights into the temporal control of cytokinesis and describe the importance of a Gps1-dependent mechanism for highly accurate polarity switching between two closely connected locations.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>In budding yeast, cell polarization (or the asymmetric distribution of subcellular components) ensures the targeted transport of proteins and membrane material to the sites of cell growth or cell division in late mitosis. Two conserved members of the Rho-GTPase family, Rho1 and Cdc42, are master regulators of cell polarity. While Rho1 has a well-established role in cytokinesis and cell separation, Cdc42 helps to establish the new polarity site from which the future daughter cell will grow after cytokinesis. Interestingly, despite the fact that Cdc42 is recruited to the site of cell division at the same time as Rho1, the new daughter cell never emerges from the site previously used for cytokinesis during the preceding cell cycle, and it remains elusive how cells coordinate the distinct functions of Rho1 and Cdc42 during cytokinesis. Here, we show that the novel protein Gps1 marks the cell division site, where it maintains Rho1-dependent polarity until cell separation is completed. We also demonstrate that Gps1 prevents activation of Cdc42 at the site of cell division during cytokinesis. We propose that Gps1 provides a novel polarity cue that guides the establishment of a new polarity site, away from the old site of cell division, where the new daughter cell then emerges.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cell polarization, i.e., the asymmetric distribution of subcellular structures and components, is critical for a variety of biological processes in uni- and multicellular organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-MartinBelmonte1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Park1">[3]</xref>. Rho GTPases are the major evolutionarily conserved regulators of polarity in yeast and mammalian cells. Of these G-proteins, RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1, in particular, play essential roles in establishing polarity in different contexts, including asymmetric cell division, wound healing, apical–basal polarity of epithelial cells, and front–rear polarity of migrating cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Park1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Benink1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The activation of Rho GTPases is under tight spatiotemporal control in response to extra- or intracellular polarity cues (e.g., chemical gradients, cell–cell interactions, or other landmarks) during the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Iden1">[4]</xref>. In this context, membrane-associated proteins often mediate activation or inhibition of Rho GTPases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-MartinBelmonte1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-McCaffrey1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Iden1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Nelson1">[6]</xref>. Another feature of polarity establishment and maintenance is that Rho GTPases can be either simultaneously activated at various locations to fulfill different functions (e.g., during cell migration) or sequentially activated at the same location through cross-talk mechanisms (e.g., during single cell wound healing) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Benink1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Nelson1">[6]</xref>. Both mechanisms require elaborate systems that enable both temporal and spatial separation of Rho GTPase activation.</p>
      <p>In budding yeast, the Rho GTPases Rho1 (RhoA homolog) and Cdc42 are essential for bud growth, mating, and cell separation. Although Rho1 and Cdc42 share common effectors (formins, exocyst), they play distinct roles during the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Park1">[3]</xref>. Unlike Cdc42, Rho1 has a well-established role in cytokinesis and cell separation. During anaphase, the Rho1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Tus1 recruits Rho1 to the cell division site (bud neck), thereby promoting the formation of the contractile actomyosin ring (AMR), which drives membrane ingression and primary septum formation during cytokinesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Tolliday1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Yoshida1">[8]</xref>. Rho1 remains at the cell division site after the AMR has contracted and is important for the final step of cell abscission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Yoshida2">[9]</xref>. In budding yeast, abscission is a two-step process that involves the formation of the secondary septum (cell wall deposition) and septum cleavage mediated by a set of hydrolases. Both processes rely upon targeted vesicle transport, and both are mediated by the Rho1 effectors Bni1 (formin) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Kohno1">[10]</xref> and Sec3 (part of the exocyst complex) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Guo1">[11]</xref>. Cell wall deposition also depends on the Rho1 effector Fks1 (β-1,6-glucan-synthase) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Qadota1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although Cdc42 co-localizes with Rho1 at the bud neck during cytokinesis and abscission, its contribution to the physical process of cell separation remains elusive. After completion of cytokinesis, Cdc42 establishes the new polarity site, from which the future daughter cell (bud) will emerge, thereby determining the new cell polarity axis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Park1">[3]</xref>. Interestingly, the new bud never emerges from the site used for cytokinesis during the preceding cell cycle, despite the fact that Cdc42 is recruited to the bud neck at the same time as Rho1. These observations raise important questions regarding the role that Cdc42 plays at the cell division site and whether mechanisms are in place to inhibit Cdc42-dependent bud emergence at the bud neck during cytokinesis. One possibility could be that Cdc42 is restrained in an inactive state at the cell division site. Alternatively, Cdc42 may activate effectors at the bud neck different from those employed at the new bud site. The scaffold protein Bem1 and the GEF Cdc24 are major regulators of Cdc42 localization and activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Park1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Gulli1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Kozubowski1">[16]</xref>. Given that both molecules co-localize with Cdc42 at the bud neck and bud site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Park1">[3]</xref>, it is unlikely that they are responsible for the specificity of Cdc42 towards different effectors. Nevertheless, the shift of the Cdc42-associated polarity site suggests that regulatory mechanisms are in place to couple the establishment of a new cell polarity site with the successful completion of cytokinesis and cell separation. However, such mechanisms have not been reported so far.</p>
      <p>Here, we show that the uncharacterized gene product of <italic>YPL158C</italic>, which we named Gps1 (GTPase-mediated polarity switch 1), functions as a novel polarity cue at the cell division site and is required for both Cdc42 and Rho1 function at this site. Our data show that Gps1 regulates both Rho1- and Cdc42-dependent signaling in parallel. Gps1 marks the closed cell division site post–AMR contraction and is required to maintain the Rho1-dependent polarization that is necessary for secondary septum formation and cell separation. At the same time, Gps1 specifically inhibits Cdc42-dependent activation of the p21-activated kinase Cla4 at the bud neck. This inhibition of Cla4 is essential to prevent budding inside the established cell division site. Failure in Gps1 regulation leads to the death of the daughter cell. We therefore propose that Gps1 is a critical polarity cue that confers a high degree of accuracy in polarity switching between two closely connected locations.</p>

        <title>Gps1 Interacts with Cdc42 and Rho1 and Forms a Disc-Like Structure at the Bud Neck</title>
        <p>The highly conserved Cdc42 GTPase has a well-known function in polarity establishment during bud growth, which is consistent with its localization at the incipient bud site. However, Cdc42 forms a ring-like structure at the bud neck before AMR contraction, is reorganized as a disc-like structure after AMR constriction, and then splits into two well-separated signals just before cell separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001495.s001">S1A</xref>). This complex pattern of localization at the bud neck during cytokinesis implies that Cdc42 may either perform an important function during cytokinesis or be inhibited during AMR contraction. To understand the regulation and function of Cdc42, we screened for bud neck proteins that interact with Cdc42 using the yeast two-hybrid system. We identified the protein Gps1 as a putative Cdc42 interactor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Gps1 is a protein of uncharacterized function that was previously reported to localize at the bud neck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Huh1">[17]</xref>.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>Co-immunoprecipitation using a pair-wise combination of functional tagged proteins confirmed that Gps1 and Cdc42 interacted with one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that Gps1 also associated with the Rho GTPase Rho1 in the yeast two-hybrid system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). In addition, tryptic peptides corresponding to Rho1 were identified by mass spectrometry analysis of purified Gps1-TAP complexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001495.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). To map the Cdc42 and Rho1 interaction domain of Gps1, we generated several Gps1 truncations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). We found that the N-terminal 290 residues of Gps1 (Gps1-1-290) were sufficient to interact with both Rho1 and Cdc42 in the yeast two-hybrid system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g001">Figure 1D</xref>; data not shown). These interactions were most likely direct, as bacterially purified 6His-Gps1-1-290 associated with purified GST-Cdc42 or GST-Rho1 but not GST in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Interestingly, Gps1-1-290 bound to both GDP- and GTP-locked mutants of Cdc42 and Rho1 in the yeast two-hybrid system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001495.s002">Figure S2A and S2B</xref>) and in vitro (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001495.s002">Figure S2C</xref>), indicating that Gps1 interacts with Cdc42 and Rho1 independently of their nucleotide-bound forms. Given that the temporal recruitment of Rho1 to the bud neck was similar to that of Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g001">Figures 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001495.s001">S1A</xref>, and 
    
    
    <xref ref-type="other" rid="pbio.1001495.s001">S1B</xref>
    
    
    S1B), we postulated that both Rho1 and Cdc42 are functionally linked to Gps1.</p>
        <p>Live cell imaging showed that Gps1 formed a ring-like structure at the bud neck that co-localized with Myo1 before the onset of AMR contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g001">Figure 1F and 1G</xref>). However, Gps1 did not contract with the AMR. Instead, the Gps1 signal spread over the area defined by the initial ring and now formed a disc-like structure after AMR constriction. This area was confined by the septin ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g001">Figures 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001495.s001">S1D</xref>). The septin complex may therefore act as a diffusion barrier to maintain Gps1 at the bud neck region after AMR contraction, as previously suggested for other components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Dobbelaere1">[18]</xref>. Importantly, despite its localization with Cdc42 and Rho1 at the bud neck during cytokinesis, Gps1 differed from either partner protein, by not relocating to the new polarization site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001495.s001">Figure S1D</xref>), suggesting that Gps1 does not play any role at the new bud site. Together, the data indicate that Gps1 is a novel Cdc42- and Rho1-interacting protein that defines a unique micro-domain at the bud neck region that might have a specific role in late steps of cytokinesis and cell separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g001">Figure 1I</xref>).</p>

We hypothesized that the thinning of the secondary septum at the bud/birth scar in <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells would engage the cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway.

        <title>The Swi5 Transcriptional Factor Plays a Role in Cytokinesis through Gps1</title>

Swi5 is activated at the transition from mitosis into the G1 phase of the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Visintin1">[24]</xref>. Accordingly, Gps1-6HA protein levels strongly increased as cells exited mitosis, as monitored by the decline in the level of the mitotic cyclin Clb2 and the accumulation of the mitotic cyclin inhibitor Sic1, whose expression is also under Swi5 control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Toyn1">[25]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g002">Figure 2J</xref>).

        <p>The deletion of <italic>SWI5</italic> impeded secondary septum formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g002">Figure 2E and 2F</xref>), engaged the CWI pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g002">Figure 2L</xref>), and led to the accumulation of cells with a DNA content that exceeded 2C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g002">Figure 2M</xref>), in a manner that was comparable to <italic>GPS1</italic> deletion. We therefore postulated that <italic>GPS1</italic> might be the most important, if not the sole, gene under Swi5 control that is required for cytokinesis. In agreement with our hypothesis, the thickness of the secondary septum, the lethality of <italic>swi5Δ slt2Δ</italic> cells, and the accumulation of multi-nucleated cells were all rescued by expressing <italic>GPS1</italic> from a Swi5-independent promoter (pTEF2-<italic>GPS1</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g002">Figure 2E, 2F, 2L, and 2M</xref>).

        <title>Gps1 Controls Secondary Septum Formation through Rho1</title>
        <p>The interaction between Gps1 and Rho1 suggested that Gps1 controls secondary septum formation via activation of Rho1. Rho1 activates the cell-wall- and septum-synthesizing Fks1 and two proteins that target this transmembrane protein to the bud neck: the formin Bni1 and the exocyst landmark protein Sec3. To determine whether Gps1 does indeed regulate Rho1, we monitored the distribution of Rho1. For this, we used a <italic>GFP-RHO1</italic> fusion expressed from the Rho1 endogenous promoter in a strain carrying untagged Rho1. Our GFP-Rho1 is partially functional, as it could promote the growth of Rho1-depleted cells once expressed at higher expression levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001495.s004">Figure S4</xref>). As previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Yoshida2">[9]</xref>, GFP-Rho1 was recruited to the bud neck shortly before the onset of AMR contraction and persisted there until the cells separated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). This temporal bud neck association is consistent with the role of Rho1 in AMR assembly/contraction as well as in secondary septum formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Tolliday1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Qadota1">[12]</xref>. In <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells, Rho1 was recruited to the bud neck shortly before AMR contraction, as in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>; 
    <xref ref-type="other" rid="pbio.1001495.s019">Video S1</xref>). Moreover, Rho1 accumulated to similar levels at the bud necks of both wild-type and <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>; 
    
    
    <xref ref-type="other" rid="pbio.1001495.s020">Video S2</xref>), which is consistent with our observation that AMR and primary septum assembly were not affected by <italic>GPS1</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g002">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001495.s003">S3</xref>). However, whereas Rho1 levels increased at the bud neck of wild-type cells after AMR contraction, they declined sharply in <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells and only reappeared at the tip of the newly emerging bud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g003">Figure 3A [arrowhead] and 3B</xref>;

This reduced bud neck sequestration was also found for the Rho1 effectors Bni1, Sec3, and Fks1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Consequently, actin and myosin polarization toward the bud neck was, in general, impaired after AMR ring contraction in <italic>gps1Δ</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001495.s005">Figure S5A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001495.s005">S5F</xref>).

        <p>We postulated that the levels of Rho1 at the bud neck after AMR contraction in <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells would be insufficient to promote efficient Fks1 targeting and activity, thereby explaining the marked reduction of secondary septum material in these cells.

One prediction arising from this observation is that increasing Rho1 activity or tethering Rho1 to the bud neck independently of Gps1 function should rescue the secondary septum defect of <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells. We observed that low overexpression of <italic>RHO1</italic> partially rescued the growth defect of <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001495.s006">Figure S6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001495.s016">Table S1</xref> provides an overview of genetic manipulations that rescued <italic>gps1Δ</italic> defects), whereas higher levels of <italic>RHO1</italic> caused a toxic effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001495.s006">Figure S6B</xref>). In addition, we found that the rapid cycling mutant Rho1-C25A (expressed from the Rho1 endogenous promoter), but not wild-type or GTP-locked Rho1, partially rescued the growth and secondary septum formation defects of the <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001495.s006">Figure S6C–S6F</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Yoshida2">[9]</xref>. Next, we targeted Rho1 artificially to the bud neck in <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells using the GFP-binding protein (GBP) strategy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Bertazzi1">[26]</xref>. <italic>GFP-RHO1</italic> wild-type, GTP-locked, or rapid cycling mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Yoshida2">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Delley1">[27]</xref> were expressed in cells in which the septin Shs1 was fused to GBP.

Whereas GFP-Rho1 was mainly lost from the bud neck in <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells after AMR contraction, GFP-Rho1 remained at the bud neck in <italic>GPS1</italic>, <italic>GPS1 SHS1-GBP</italic>, and <italic>gps1Δ SHS1-GBP</italic> cells until the cells had completed cell separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, red arrowheads indicate the time point of cell separation). The growth defect, the reduction in secondary septum assembly, and the impaired Rho1 effector localization in <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells were all partially rescued by bud neck targeting of GFP-Rho1 via Shs1-GBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g003">Figures 3F, 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001495.s006">S6G</xref>, and S6H). In this context, rapid cycling Rho1 mutants rescued the growth defect of <italic>gps1Δ</italic> mutants even better than wild-type Rho1, whereas GTP-locked mutants showed no or just a little rescue ability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001495.s006">Figure S6D–S6F</xref>). A similar inability of GTP-locked Rho1 mutants to rescue cytokinesis defects was reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Yoshida2">[9]</xref>. Importantly, the increased bud neck targeting of the other bud-neck-residing Rho-GTPases, Rho2, Rho4, and Cdc42, failed to rescue the growth of <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001495.s007">Figure S7A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001495.s007">S7D</xref>). This indicated that Rho2 and Rho4 did not influence the bud neck localization of Rho1 effectors, which is in line with the observation that the deletion of neither <italic>RHO2</italic> nor <italic>RHO4</italic> impaired the recruitment of Sec3 to the bud neck (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001495.s007">Figure S7E</xref>). These findings highlight the specificity of Gps1 function in promoting Rho1 bud neck association.</p>

        <title>Gps1 Regulates Rho1 Bud Neck Localization by Mechanisms That Are Independent of the Rho1 GEFs Tus1 and Rom2</title>
        <p>We next assessed how Gps1 promotes the retention of Rho1 at the bud neck. The recruitment of Rho1 to the bud neck in late anaphase has been shown to depend upon GEF proteins, which themselves are targeted to the bud neck in a cell-cycle-dependent manner. During anaphase, the GEF Tus1 localizes at the bud neck and recruits Rho1 to promote AMR contraction and primary septum formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Yoshida1">[8]</xref>. As both processes occurred normally in <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells, we excluded the possibility that Gps1 controls Rho1 by regulating Tus1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001495.s003">Figure S3</xref>). After mitotic exit, the GEF Rom2 controls Rho1 localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Yoshida2">[9]</xref>. Rom2 localizes at the bud neck after AMR contraction in a manner that is dependent upon phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Audhya1">[28]</xref>. However, neither the bud neck localization of Rom2 nor the accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate at the bud neck was impaired in <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells (Figures S8 and S9). Furthermore, constitutive targeting of either Rom2 or other Rho GEFs to the bud neck failed to rescue the growth phenotype of <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001495.s009">Figure S9</xref>). This reinforces the view that Gps1 promotes Rho1 bud neck targeting in a Rom2-independent manner.</p>
        <p>Given that Gps1 did not promote Rho1 GEF localization, we asked whether Gps1 could negatively influence Rho1 GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Interestingly, deletion of <italic>LRG1</italic>, but not of other Rho GAP genes, rescued the growth defect of <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g003">Figures 3I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001495.s010">S10A</xref>). Since Lrg1 levels at the bud neck were not altered in <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001495.s010">Figure S10B and S10</xref>C), we concluded that, although Rho1 was transiently recruited to the bud neck in both <italic>gps1Δ</italic> and <italic>gps1Δ lrg1Δ</italic> cells, deletion of <italic>LRG1</italic> led to the accumulation of higher amounts of active Rho1 that compensated for its function in secondary septum formation. In agreement with this hypothesis, the deletion of <italic>LRG1</italic> could negate the need for <italic>GPS1</italic> in secondary septum formation, most likely because of the increased targeting of Rho1 effectors to the bud neck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g003">Figure 3C, 3H, and 3I</xref>). However, since <italic>LRG1</italic> deletion in <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells did not completely restore Rho1 effectors at the bud neck to the same levels observed in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), we consider it unlikely that Gps1 regulates Rho1 exclusively through inhibition of Lrg1.</p>
        <p>Taken together, our data indicate that Gps1 regulates Rho1 bud neck localization by a mechanism that is independent of Rho1 GAP or GEF bud neck targeting.</p>

        <p>Analysis of <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells by live cell imaging revealed a high percentage of daughter cells (30%–40%) that lysed shortly after AMR contraction and, consequently, were of dark appearance and stained by the cell death marker propidium iodide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001495.s011">Figure S11</xref>;

Given that Cdc42 interacted with Gps1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g001">Figure 1B–1E</xref>), we pursued the idea that daughter cell death in <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells could be a consequence of mis-regulation of Cdc42.</p>
        <p>To investigate whether Gps1 controls Cdc42, we compared Cdc42 localization in wild-type and <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g004">Figure 4A</xref>; Videos

In wild-type and <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells, Cdc42 was recruited to the bud neck prior to AMR contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, 2–4 min, white asterisk; Videos <xref ref-type="other" rid="pbio.1001495.s022">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="pbio.1001495.s023">S5</xref>). However, whereas Cdc42 moved to the new bud site in every wild-type cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, white arrows), Cdc42 returned to the bud neck in more than 30% of <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, red asterisk). Strikingly, this backward migration of Cdc42 correlated with the death of the daughter cell, as indicated by the shrinkage and darkening of the bud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, red arrowhead; 
    
    
    <xref ref-type="other" rid="pbio.1001495.s023">Video S5</xref>). Thus, Gps1 inhibits Cdc42-dependent repolarization and budding at the site of former cell division. Consistently, TEM revealed that more than 30% of <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells underwent budding inside the old bud neck, which was marked by the formation of two or more layers of cell wall material at the bud neck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, additional collars). To test whether active Cdc42 remained associated with the bud neck in the absence of <italic>GPS1</italic>, we made use of the established in vivo marker for active Cdc42 (Gic2-PBD-RFP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Tong1">[29]</xref>. We found that Gic2-PBD-RFP accumulated at the bud neck after AMR contraction in <italic>gps1Δ</italic> but not in wild-type cells, where Gic2-PBD-RFP became concentrated next to the cell division site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g004">Figure 4C and 4D</xref>). Furthermore, we observed that the Cdc42-activating GEF, Cdc24, was enriched at the bud neck in <italic>gps1Δ</italic> but not in wild-type cells after AMR contraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001495.s012">Figure S12</xref>).

        <p>Interestingly, Cdc42 activation at the old cell division site and the “budding inside the old bud neck” phenotype has previously been reported for Rga1-deficient cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Tong1">[29]</xref>. Rga1 acts as a GAP that inactivates Cdc42. Consequently, <italic>RGA1</italic> deletion causes the bud neck accumulation of active Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g004">Figure 4C and 4D</xref>). We thus postulated that Gps1 may work either together with, or in parallel to, Rga1 to control Cdc42. We took a genetic approach to discriminate between these possibilities. The deletion of <italic>RGA1</italic> alone did not affect cell growth but compromised the viability of <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g004">Figure 4E</xref>).

Thus, our results suggest that Gps1 may work in a parallel mechanism to the Cdc42 GAP Rga1 to regulate Cdc42 function after AMR contraction.</p>

        <title>Gps1 Creates a Cdc42-Related Inhibition Zone around the Cell Division Site</title>
        <p>An important function of Cdc42 is to organize the actin cytoskeleton to allow growth of the new bud. We hypothesized that Gps1 may create an inhibitory zone at the old bud neck to locally impede Cdc42 function after cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Based on the growth pattern of yeast cells, we expected this regulation to be especially important in haploid cells, where the new polarity site is formed adjacent to the old division site (axial budding pattern). In contrast, diploid cells establish a new polarity site distally (bipolar budding pattern). The establishment of the axial polarity site depends on a set of proteins (Bud3, Bud4, Axl1, and Axl2) that localize at the septin rings at the previous division site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Casamayor1">[30]</xref>. To test whether the mode of bud patterning would affect the survival of <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells, we deleted genes reported to activate axial budding in haploid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). The deletion of these genes causes a shift from an axial to a bipolar or random budding pattern in haploid cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Casamayor1">[30]</xref>. Interestingly, the deletion of the activators of axial budding rescued the growth defect of <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), without affecting secondary septum formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g005">Figure 5D and 5E</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that diminishing the probability of having a new bud site close to the old one increases the viability of <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells. Conversely, one could imagine that forcing diploid cells to bud axially would have the opposite effect, i.e., would compromise the viability of diploid <italic>gps1Δ/gps1Δ</italic> cells, which were otherwise viable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g005">Figure 5F</xref>).

        <title>Gps1 Regulates Specificity of Cdc42 towards Its Effectors to Facilitate the Establishment of a New Cell Polarity Axis</title>
        <p>Cdc42 activates several downstream effectors, including the kinases Cla4 and Ste20. To understand the function of Cdc42 that is regulated by Gps1 at the old bud neck after cytokinesis, we assessed the behavior of established Cdc42 loss-of-function mutants in the <italic>gps1Δ</italic> background. If Gps1 inhibits Cdc42 activity, the down-regulation of Cdc42 function should rescue the growth phenotype of <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells. In agreement with this hypothesis, a mutation in the effector binding switch I region of Cdc42 (<italic>cdc42-T35A</italic>) rescued the growth defect of <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).

        <p>To gain a deeper insight onto Cdc42-T35A function in vivo, we monitored its subcellular localization during cytokinesis and polarity establishment in the presence of wild-type Cdc42. Cdc42-T35A was recruited to the bud neck during cytokinesis like wild-type Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). However, in contrast to Cdc42, Cdc42-T35A failed to move to the new polarity site after cytokinesis (as judged by the recruitment of Myo1 to the new bud neck) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Rather, Cdc42-T35A persisted at the old bud neck. Consequently, we suggest that Cdc42-T35A may compete with Cdc42 at the bud neck and probably compensates for the absence of the inhibitory function of Gps1 towards wild-type Cdc42.</p>
        <p>Given that Cdc42-T35A has a weaker interaction with effectors, deletion of the gene that encodes the effector protein should also promote the growth of <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells. Interestingly, the deletion of <italic>CLA4</italic>, but no other Cdc42 effector, improved the growth fitness of <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g006">Figures 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001495.s014">S14</xref>), suggesting that activation of Cla4 by Cdc42 impairs cell growth in the absence of <italic>GPS1</italic>. Consistently, ectopic overexpression of <italic>CLA4</italic> reduced the viability of <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Surprisingly, deletion of the Cdc42 effector kinase <italic>STE20</italic> had the opposite impact of <italic>CLA4</italic> deletion, as <italic>gps1Δ ste20Δ</italic> cells were unable to survive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), and overexpression of <italic>STE20</italic> rescued the growth lethality of <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Importantly, the effect of <italic>CLA4</italic> and <italic>STE20</italic> on the growth of <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells was dependent upon both the kinase activity and the CRIB-domain that mediates the binding of Cla4 and Ste20 to Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g006">Figure 6E and 6F</xref>). We therefore concluded that Cdc42-dependent Cla4 activation must be down-regulated, while Cdc42-dependent Ste20 activation must be promoted, to provide viability of cells lacking <italic>GPS1</italic>.</p>
        <p>To examine how Cla4 and Ste20 influence the growth of <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells, we analyzed the phenotype of <italic>gps1Δ ste20Δ</italic> and <italic>gps1Δ cla4Δ</italic> cells in detail. The synthetic defect of <italic>ste20Δ gps1Δ</italic> double mutants was based on an increased “budding inside the old bud neck” phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g006">Figure 6G</xref>). Interestingly, Ste20 is required to promote bipolar budding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Ni1">[31]</xref>, suggesting that increased budding in close proximity to the bud neck may account for the lethality of <italic>ste20Δ gps1Δ</italic> cells. Indeed, the lethality of <italic>ste20Δ gps1Δ</italic> double mutants was reverted upon deletion of <italic>BUD1</italic> or <italic>BUD4</italic> to switch the budding pattern from proximal to bipolar or random (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g006">Figure 6H</xref>). This suggested that Ste20 activity may be especially important to place the new bud site next to the old cell division site. Analysis of <italic>cdc42-T35A gps1Δ</italic> and <italic>cla4Δ gps1Δ</italic> cells by TEM displayed a much less pronounced “budding inside the old bud neck” phenotype than was observed for <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g006">Figure 6I</xref>), indicating that inhibition of Cla4 activity at the bud neck is required to avoid rebudding inside the old bud neck.</p>
        <p>Taken together our results indicate that Gps1 inhibits Cdc42-dependent polarity establishment at the old bud neck most likely by promoting Ste20 and inhibiting Cla4 activation.</p>

        <title>Gps1 Prevents Premature Cla4 Activation at the Old Cell Division Site</title>
        <p>To determine whether Gps1 prevents premature activation of Cla4 at the old bud neck, we analyzed the phosphorylation status of Cdc24, a well-known substrate of Cla4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g007">Figure 7A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Gulli1">[13]</xref>.

To investigate the timing of Cdc24 phosphorylation, we transiently arrested wild-type and <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells in metaphase and followed cell cycle progression and Cdc24 hyperphosphorylation after release from the metaphase block. Both wild-type and <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells progressed through the cell cycle and completed anaphase with similar kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g007">Figure 7A</xref>).

If Cla4 is prematurely activated at the old bud neck in <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells, the septin ring should be formed and/or maintained at the old bud neck after cytokinesis. Indeed, whereas the septin ring disappeared from the mother cell bud neck after AMR constriction and reappeared at the incipient bud in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g007">Figure 7D</xref>, <italic>GPS1</italic>, red arrowheads), it persisted at the mother cell bud neck of all <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells in which the daughter cell died after cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g007">Figure 7D</xref>, <italic>gps1Δ</italic>, white arrowheads).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We understand little about the spatiotemporal coordination of events that follow the contraction of AMR and lead to cell separation and establishment of a new cell polarity axis in budding yeast. The two major Rho GTPases, Cdc42 and Rho1, are recruited to the cell division site prior to the onset of AMR contraction. Rho1 contributes to the formation of the AMR and, subsequently, to secondary septum biogenesis and cell separation. The functions executed by Cdc42 at the cell division site remain to be elucidated. Puzzlingly, Cdc42 plays an important role in the establishment of the axial polarity and bud growth that occurs adjacent to the site of the previous cell division. Although Cdc42 is recruited to the site of cell division prior to AMR contraction, bud growth does not begin at this site during cytokinesis. How this specific Cdc42 function is inhibited during cytokinesis is unknown. Here, we identified the protein Gps1 as a bud neck polarity cue that integrates polarity signaling by maintaining Rho1 and inhibiting Cdc42 at the old cell division site. We propose that the Gps1-mediated mechanism facilitates and safeguards a polarity switch between adjacent sites (old bud neck and new bud neck), thereby coordinating cell division with the establishment of a new cell polarity axis.</p>
      <p>We identified Gps1 as a direct interactor of both Rho1 and Cdc42 in the yeast two-hybrid system and established by in vitro and in vivo pull-down experiments that Gps1 is in complex with Rho1 and Cdc42. Live cell imaging of Gps1-GFP revealed an intricate pattern of bud neck recruitment. During AMR constriction and primary septum growth, a new membrane compartment is established by the fusion of membrane material provided by the secretory pathway. Gps1 covered exclusively this emerging disc-like compartment that forms after AMR contraction. Our data show that the Gps1 disc is confined at the bud neck by the splitted septin rings, which act as a diffusion barrier for membrane proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Dobbelaere1">[18]</xref>. Gps1 may then be maintained at the cell division site through a direct or indirect interaction with the membrane or transmembrane protein. Alternatively, Gps1 may associate with the septins via the septin interactors Nap1, Nba1, and Nis1, which were found in the purified Gps1 complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001495.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
      <p>Our data are consistent with a role for Gps1 in the coordination of Rho1 and Cdc42 function after AMR contraction. During cytokinesis, actin repolarization towards the bud neck is required for both AMR assembly/contraction and targeted delivery of components involved in septum formation. Rho1, but not Cdc42, plays an important role in actin assembly and vesicle delivery through activation of the formin Bni1 and the exocyst landmark Sec3 at the bud neck. In late anaphase, Rho1 accumulates at the bud neck through its GEF, Tus1. This initial pool of active, GTP-bound Rho1 is required for the completion of AMR assembly and contraction and primary septum formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Yoshida1">[8]</xref>. Our data now indicate that Tus1 can sustain Rho1 at the bud neck for a very limited period, the time of AMR constriction. The maintenance of Rho1 localization at the bud neck post–AMR contraction was largely dependent upon Gps1. Accordingly, the localization of Rho1 effectors, including Fks1, Bni1, and Sec3, was impaired in cells lacking <italic>GPS1</italic>, which reflected the diminished density of actin cables and the absence of secondary septum formation at the bud neck after AMR contraction in <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells. Since the localization of other bud-neck-residing Rho1 GEFs such as Rom2 was not impaired, we suggest that Gps1 is directly responsible for the maintenance of Rho1 at the bud neck. Supporting this view, engineered tethering of Rho1 to the bud neck partially relieved the requirement of Gps1 for cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g003">Figure 3E and 3F</xref>).</p>
      <p>In contrast to Rho1, Gps1 inhibited the activation of Cdc42 at the old cell division site after cytokinesis. Consequently, in cells lacking <italic>GPS1</italic>, frequent budding inside the old bud neck was observed by TEM analysis. A similar phenotype has been described for cells bearing hyperactive Cdc42 upon GAP depletion (<italic>rga1Δ</italic> cells) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Tong1">[29]</xref>. Rga1 co-localizes with the septin ring that surrounds the cell division site and the Gps1 disc. The synthetic lethal phenotype observed upon co-deletion of <italic>GPS1</italic> and <italic>RGA1</italic> suggests that Gps1 and Rga1 may act in different pathways to inhibit Cdc42. We therefore suggest a model whereby Rga1 regulates the temporal activation of Cdc42, whereas Gps1 dictates directionality by inhibiting Cdc42 at the old cell division site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g008">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

      <p>Importantly, in contrast to <italic>rga1Δ</italic> cells, <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells displayed a strong correlation between relocation of Cdc42 to the old bud neck and death of the daughter cell. Genetic manipulations that rescued secondary septum formation improved the growth viability of <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells without reverting the phenotype of budding inside the old bud neck (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001495.s016">Table S1</xref>). Conversely, genetic manipulations that decreased the probability of axial budding in haploid cells rescued the growth fitness of <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells independently of secondary septum biogenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001495.s016">Table S1</xref>). This indicates that <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells die as a consequence of two combined defects: formation of a new bud at the old bud neck, and an incorrectly formed secondary septum at that location. We therefore concluded that Gps1 is required for cell viability through the temporal coordination of both the Cdc42 and Rho1 pathways.</p>
      <p>Which function of Cdc42 does Gps1 inhibit? Cdc42 and its GEF, Cdc24, associate with the cell division site prior to the onset of AMR contraction. Although the function of Cdc42 at the bud neck at this early stage of cytokinesis is unclear, it is well established that GTP-bound Cdc42 activates several effectors required for polarized growth, including the kinase Cla4. Several lines of evidence indicate that Gps1 inhibits premature Cla4 activation. First, deletion of <italic>CLA4</italic>, but not other Cdc42 effectors, rescued the growth defect caused by deletion of <italic>GPS1</italic>. Second, unlike the normal controls seen in wild-type cells, where Cla4 weakly associated with the bud neck, Cla4 accumulated to high levels at the bud neck and prematurely phosphorylated Cdc24 in <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g007">Figure 7A–7C</xref>). Finally, the Cdc42-T35A protein, which fails to activate Cla4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Gulli1">[13]</xref> but efficiently localizes at the bud neck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), rescued budding inside the old bud neck and cell viability of <italic>gps1Δ</italic> cells. Thus, we postulate that Gps1 specifically inhibits Cdc42-dependent Cla4 activation at the old bud neck, thereby supporting budding outside the area where cytokinesis takes place. Why should a cell prevent budding inside the old bud scars? First, budding inside the old site of cell division makes cells more vulnerable to defects in secondary septum biogenesis, which may be inheritable (as in case of <italic>GPS1</italic> knock-out) or induced by drugs/toxins that affect cell wall formation. Second, electron micrographs show that recurrent budding at the same position narrows the diameter of the bud neck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). A narrower bud neck may hinder chromosome segregation or partitioning of organelles between mother and daughter cells. In either case, budding inside the old site of cell division increases the probability of cell death.</p>
      <p>Cell cycle progression is mainly regulated by differential gene expression, post-translational modifications, and protein degradation. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the hallmark of the mitotic exit is the activation of the phosphatase Cdc14, which drives the M–G1 phase transition and is a prerequisite for cytokinesis. Cdc14 counteracts mitotic Cdk1, thereby activating the transcription factors Ace2 and Swi5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-Visintin1">[24]</xref>. Ace2 is well known for its cytokinesis-related function in activating the daughter-specific expression of the chitinase and glucanases that are responsible for the final cleavage of the daughter from the mother cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001495-ColmanLerner1">[33]</xref>. In contrast to Ace2, a direct role for Swi5 in cytokinesis and cell separation has remained obscure to date. We showed that Swi5 is essential for Gps1 expression and consequently also for secondary septum formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001495-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). This dependency can be overcome by expressing <italic>GPS1</italic> under the control of a Swi5-independent promoter. The finding that Swi5 regulates secondary septum formation, whereas Ace2 is essential for the following cell cleavage, raises the question whether there is a cross-talk between Swi5- and Ace2-dependent activation to ensure the correct order of function of the Swi5- and Ace2-dependent targets.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the analysis of Gps1 function presented here has provided novel insights into the spatiotemporal coordination of polarity during the late cytokinetic and early morphogenetic events that are under control of Rho1 and Cdc42 signaling. We anticipate that similar mechanisms might coordinate the final stages of division and the reestablishment of cell polarity in other systems in which membrane-associated polarity cues act as a Rho GTPase positioning system and/or promote Rho GTPase activation and inactivation to ensure either a switch-like change of polarity or the maintenance of a stable polarity gradient that is characterized by a spatial separation of Rho GTPase activity.</p>
