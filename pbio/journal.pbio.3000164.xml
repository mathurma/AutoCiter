<abstract>
<p>Throughout the last several decades, vaccination has been key to prevent and eradicate infectious diseases. However, many pathogens (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], influenza, dengue, and others) have resisted vaccine development efforts, largely because of the failure to induce potent antibody responses targeting conserved epitopes. Deep profiling of human B cells often reveals potent neutralizing antibodies that emerge from natural infection, but these specificities are generally subdominant (i.e., are present in low titers). A major challenge for next-generation vaccines is to overcome established immunodominance hierarchies and focus antibody responses on crucial neutralization epitopes. Here, we show that a computationally designed epitope-focused immunogen presenting a single RSV neutralization epitope elicits superior epitope-specific responses compared to the viral fusion protein. In addition, the epitope-focused immunogen efficiently boosts antibodies targeting the palivizumab epitope, resulting in enhanced neutralization. Overall, we show that epitope-focused immunogens can boost subdominant neutralizing antibody responses in vivo and reshape established antibody hierarchies.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Vaccines are one of the most valuable instruments to prevent and control infectious diseases. Their primary correlate of protection is the level of induction of neutralizing antibodies that target critical antigenic sites and thereby block infection. Natural infections with pathogens such as the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or influenza induce a broad repertoire of antibodies that target multiple epitopes. Among those, functional antibodies with key specificities are often subdominant (present in low titers). Thus, a central goal for vaccine development is to focus antibody responses on such neutralization epitopes. Here, we show that a computationally designed, epitope-focused immunogen mimicking an important RSV neutralization epitope (site II) can focus antibodies onto this well-defined epitope. In a scenario of preexisting immunity, in which site II–specific antibodies were subdominant, the epitope-focused immunogen selectively boosted site II–specific antibodies, resulting in an increased viral neutralization through this epitope. We propose that rationally designed immunogens spotlighting defined epitopes have a unique potential to focus antibody responses on functionally conserved sites in cases of preexisting immunity. Our results have broad implications for vaccine design as a strategy to steer preexisting antibody responses away from immunodominant, variable epitopes and toward subdominant epitopes that confer broad and potent neutralization.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The development of vaccines has proven to be one of the most successful medical interventions to reduce the burden of infectious diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref001">1</xref>], and their correlate of protection is the induction of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that block infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p>In recent years, advances in high-throughput B cell technologies have revealed a plethora of potent nAbs for different pathogens that have resisted the traditional means of vaccine development for several decades, including HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref003">3</xref>], influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref004">4</xref>], respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref006">6</xref>], Zika [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref008">8</xref>], dengue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref009">9</xref>], and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref012">12</xref>]. A major target of these nAb responses is the pathogen’s fusion protein, which drives the viral and host cell membrane fusion while undergoing a conformational rearrangement from a prefusion to a postfusion state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref013">13</xref>]. Many of these nAbs have been structurally characterized in complex with their target, unveiling the atomic details of neutralization epitopes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref015">15</xref>]. Together, these studies have provided comprehensive antigenic maps of the viral fusion proteins, which delineate epitopes susceptible to antibody-mediated neutralization and provide a road map for rational and structure-based vaccine design approaches.</p>
<p>The conceptual framework to leverage nAb-defined epitopes for vaccine development is commonly referred to as reverse vaccinology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref018">18</xref>]. Although reverse vaccinology-inspired approaches have yielded a number of exciting advances in the last decade, the design of immunogens that elicit such focused antibody responses remains challenging. Successful examples of structure-based immunogen design approaches include conformational stabilization of RSV fusion protein (RSVF) in its prefusion state, which induces superior serum neutralization titers when compared to immunization with RSVF in the postfusion conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref019">19</xref>]. In the case of influenza, several epitopes targeted by broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) were identified within the hemagglutinin (HA) stem domain, and an HA stem–only immunogen elicited a broader nAb response than full-length HA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref021">21</xref>]. Commonly, these approaches have aimed to focus antibody responses on specific conformations or subdomains of viral proteins. In a more aggressive approach, Correia and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref022">22</xref>] computationally designed a synthetic immunogen presenting the RSV antigenic site II and provided a proof of principle for the induction of site-specific, RSV nAbs, using a synthetic immunogen.</p>
<p>The absence of a potent and long-lasting immune response upon natural infection is a major challenge associated with RSV, influenza virus, and other pathogens. Whereas a single exposure to pathogens like poliovirus confers life-long immunity, RSV, influenza, and other pathogens have developed mechanisms to subvert the development of a durable and potent nAb response, thereby allowing such pathogens to infect humans repeatedly throughout their lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref023">23</xref>]. One of the major factors hindering the induction of long-lasting protection after the first infection is related to the antibody specificities induced. Upon exposure to a pathogen, such as influenza, the human antibody responses predominantly target strain-specific antigenic sites, whereas potent bnAbs are subdominant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref024">24</xref>]. This phenomenon is generally referred to as B cell immunodominance, which describes the unbalanced immunogenicity of certain antigenic sites within an antigen, favoring strain-specific, variable, nonneutralizing epitopes to the detriment of conserved, neutralization-sensitive epitopes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref025">25</xref>]. The factors that determine the antigenicity of specific epitopes remain unclear, making the categorization of immunodominant and subdominant epitopes an empirical classification based on serological analysis. The presence of high levels of antibodies directed against immunodominant epitopes can sterically mask surrounding subdominant epitopes that may be targeted by bnAbs, preventing the immune system from mounting productive antibody responses against subdominant epitopes and potentially limiting vaccination efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref027">27</xref>].</p>
<p>The immunodominance hierarchy is established within the germinal center, where B cells undergo a binding affinity–based competition for available antigen and subsequently initiate a clonal expansion stage, ultimately becoming long-lived plasma cells or memory B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref028">28</xref>]. Controlling this competition and driving antibody responses toward the increased recognition of subdominant, neutralizing epitopes is of primary importance to enable development of novel vaccines against pathogens that have resisted traditional strategies. One of the few strategies to guide antibody maturation was tested in the HIV field and is referred to as germline targeting, which relies upon the activation and expansion of rare but specific B cell lineages in naïve individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref030">30</xref>]. In contrast, under conditions of preexisting immunity acquired during natural infection or previous vaccination, the challenge is to manipulate already established B cell immunodominance hierarchies and reshape serum antibody responses toward desired specificities. In an indirect approach toward increasing subdominant B cell populations, Silva and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref031">31</xref>] have shown that the targeted suppression of immunodominant clones during an active germinal center reaction can allow subdominant B cell populations to overtake the germinal center response. Other approaches have used heterologous prime–boost immunization regimens with either alternative viral strains or rationally modified versions of the priming immunogen in order to steer antibody responses toward more conserved domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref035">35</xref>]. However, leveraging structural information of defined neutralization epitopes to guide bulk antibody responses toward specific, well-characterized single epitopes remains an unmet challenge.</p>
<p>Here, we investigate whether, under conditions of preexisting immunity, a computationally designed immunogen presenting a single epitope is able to reshape serum antibody responses toward increased recognition of a specific neutralizing epitope. To mimic a scenario of preexisting immunity against a relevant pathogen, we immunized mice with a prefusion-stabilized version of RSVF and found that antibody titers against RSV antigenic site II were present in very low levels—i.e., a subdominant site II–specific response was elicited. Based on a previously developed epitope-focused immunogen for RSV site II (FFL_001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref022">22</xref>], we engineered an optimized nanoparticle presenting this immunogen and investigated the potential of a rationally designed epitope-focused immunogen to boost these subdominant levels of site-specific antibodies.</p>
<p>We show that multivalent presentation of a designed epitope-focused immunogen elicits superior levels of epitope-specific antibodies compared to prefusion RSVF in naïve mice, indicating that the subdominance of a particular epitope can be altered through its presentation in a distinct molecular context. Repeated immunizations with RSVF failed to increase site II–specific antibodies and instead further dampened site II–specific responses. In contrast, heterologous boosts with an epitope-scaffold nanoparticle enhanced serum responses toward the subdominant site II epitope, and the boosted antibodies neutralized RSV in vitro. For the first time, to our knowledge, we provide compelling evidence that synthetic immunogens comprising a single epitope can efficiently redirect specificities in bulk antibody responses in vivo and enhance subdominant nAb responses. Such strategy may present an important alternative for pathogens in which future vaccines are required to reshape preexisting immunity and elicit finely tuned antibody specificities.</p>

<title>Design of an RSV-based nanoparticle displaying a site II epitope–focused immunogen</title>
<p>In a previous study, a computationally designed, RSV site II epitope-scaffold nanoparticle was shown to elicit serum neutralization activity in nonhuman primates (NHPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref022">22</xref>]. Despite the fact that very potent monoclonal antibodies were isolated from the immunized NHPs, the neutralization potency at the serum level was modest, indicating low titers of the potent antibodies. Therefore, our first aim was to take the best previously tested immunogen (FFL_001) and further optimize delivery and immunization conditions to maximize the induction of site II–specific antibodies. A comparative study of four different adjuvants revealed that alum, an adjuvant approved for human use, yielded the highest overall immunogenicity and elicited antibodies cross-reactive with prefusion RSVF in four out of five mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000164.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we sought to develop an improved, easily produced nanoparticle to multimerize the epitope-scaffold for efficient B cell receptor cross-linking. Previously, Correia and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref022">22</xref>] employed a chemical conjugation strategy of FFL_001 to a hepatitis B core antigen–based nanoparticle, which resulted in a difficult construct with a laborious purification process. Recently, several studies have reported the use of the RSV nucleoprotein (RSVN) as a nanoparticle platform for immunogen presentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref037">37</xref>]. When expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, RSVN forms nanorings, 17 nm in diameter, containing 10 or 11 RSVN protomers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref038">38</xref>]. We reasoned that RSVN would be an ideal particle platform to multimerize an RSV epitope-scaffold, as RSVN contains strong, RSV-directed T-cell epitopes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref037">37</xref>]. However, our initial attempts to genetically fuse FFL_001 to RSVN yielded poorly soluble proteins that rapidly aggregated after purification. We therefore employed structure-based protein resurfacing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref039">39</xref>], attempting to improve the solubility of this site II epitope-scaffold when arrayed in high density on RSVN. To guide our resurfacing design process, we leveraged information from a sequence homolog of the ribosomal recycling factor (Protein Data Bank [PDB]: 1ISE), the structural template originally used to design FFL_001. Based on a sequence alignment of the mouse homolog (National Center for Biotechnology Information [NCBI] reference: NP_080698.1) and FFL_001, we exchanged the FFL_001 amino acids for the mouse sequence homolog and used Rosetta fixed backbone design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref040">40</xref>] to ensure that the mutations were not energetically unfavorable, resulting in 38 amino acid substitutions (34.2% overall). We named this variant FFLM, whose expression yields in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> showed a 5-fold increase when compared to FFL_001, and it was confirmed to be monomeric in solution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000164.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm that the resurfacing did not alter the epitope integrity, we measured the binding affinities of FFLM to motavizumab, a high-affinity variant of palivizumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref041">41</xref>], and to a panel of human site II nAbs previously isolated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref005">5</xref>], using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). All antibodies bound with high affinity to FFLM, indicating broad reactivity of this immunogen with a diverse panel of human nAbs (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000164.g001">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000164.s003">S3</xref>). The tested nAbs showed approximately one order of magnitude higher affinity to the epitope-scaffold as compared to the latest version of prefusion RSVF, originally called DS2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref042">42</xref>], suggesting that the epitope is properly presented and likely further stabilized in a relevant conformation.</p>

<p>A key aspect of epitope-focused vaccines is to understand how much of the antibody response targets the viral epitope presented to the immune system. Therefore, we sought to measure the site II–specific antibody titers elicited by NRM and FFLM and compare these epitope-specific antibody responses to those elicited by prefusion RSVF. We established an SPR competition assay (described in the Methods and shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000164.s004">S4 Fig</xref>) to quantify the fraction of site II–specific antibodies elicited by each immunogen (FFLM, NRM, or prefusion RSVF). Briefly, the respective antigen was immobilized on the sensor chip surface, and the fraction of the serum antibody response competed by motavizumab was measured, serving as a proxy for site II–specific antibodies. We observed that NRM elicited site II–specific antibody responses superior to those elicited by RSVF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000164.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). This was surprising, given that the ratio of site II epitope surface area to overall immunogen surface is similar in both NRM and RSVF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000164.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). To confirm this finding through a direct binding assay rather than a competitive format, we measured the binding levels of sera to the site II epitope in a peptide ELISA, where the site II peptide was immobilized on a streptavidin-coated surface. Peptides mimicking site II are known to be conformationally flexible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref043">43</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000164.s005">S5 Fig</xref>) but have been show to adopt a very similar conformation upon antibody binding to the one presented in the context of pre- and postfusion RSVF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref044">44</xref>]. Consistent with the previous experiment, we found that NRM elicited site II–specific responses that were two orders of magnitude higher than those of RSVF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000164.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Together, we concluded that an epitope-focused immunogen, despite similar molecular surface area, can elicit substantially higher levels of site-specific antibodies compared to a viral fusion protein.</p>

<title>NRM induces low levels of RSVF cross-reactive antibodies with low neutralization potency</title>
<p>Given the substantial site II peptide–specific serum titers elicited by NRM in mice, we investigated whether these antibodies cross-reacted with prefusion RSVF and were sufficient to neutralize RSV in vitro.</p>
<p>Following three immunizations with NRM, all the mice (<italic>n</italic> = 10) developed detectable serum cross-reactivity with prefusion RSVF (mean serum titer = 980) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000164.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Sera also cross-reacted with the postfusion conformation of RSVF (mean serum titer = 380), but binding to virus-infected cell lysate was negligible for mice immunized with the epitope-scaffold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000164.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). The overall quantity of RSVF cross-reactive antibodies elicited by immunization with an immunogen presenting a single epitope was found to be more than two orders of magnitude lower than those of mice immunized with prefusion RSVF, which comprises at least six antigenic sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref005">5</xref>]. Similarly, a B cell enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISpot) revealed that NRM-immunized mice presented prefusion RSVF-reactive antibody-secreting cells, but their frequency was approximately one order of magnitude lower than it was upon immunization with prefusion RSVF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000164.g003">Fig 3C</xref>).</p>

Whereas for certain classes of nAbs the antibody lineages and their sequence features are well-defined (e.g., HIV neutralizing VRC01 class antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref046">46</xref>] or RSV-neutralizing MPE8-like antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref047">47</xref>]), antibodies targeting RSV antigenic site II seem to be derived from diverse precursors and do not show HCDR3 sequence convergence in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref005">5</xref>]. Although we did not expect to find dominant lineages or HCDR3 sequence patterns in mice, we used next-generation antibody repertoire sequencing (NGS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref048">48</xref>] to ask whether NRM could elicit antibodies with similar sequence signatures to those elicited by prefusion RSVF. Indeed, we found 300 clonotypes, defined as antibodies derived from the same VH gene with the same HCDR3 length and 80% sequence similarity, that overlapped between NRM and the prefusion RSVF–immunized cohort, suggesting that at the molecular level, relevant antibody lineages can be activated with the NRM immunogen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000164.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Nine out of the 20 most expanded clonotypes in the NRM cohort were also present in mice immunized with prefusion RSVF, albeit not as expanded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000164.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). This finding might reflect the enrichment of site II–specific antibodies in the NRM cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000164.g002">Fig 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>We further investigated whether these low levels of prefusion RSVF-binding antibodies were sufficient to neutralize RSV in vitro. Although three immunizations with prefusion RSVF elicited potent RSV-neutralizing serum titers (mean IC<sub>50</sub> = 10,827), for NRM we only detected low levels of RSV-neutralizing serum activity in three out of 10 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000164.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). This result is consistent with that of Correia and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref022">22</xref>], who observed no serum neutralization in mice but succeeded in inducing nAbs in NHPs with prior RSV seronegativity.</p>
<p>Altogether, we concluded that despite NRM’s superior potential to induce high levels of site II–specific antibodies, the majority of antibodies activated from the naïve repertoire are not functional for RSV neutralization. A potential explanation, stemming from structural comparison between the epitope-focused immunogen and RSVF, is that these antibodies do not recognize the site II epitope in its native, quaternary environment in prefusion RSVF or on virions in sufficient amounts and with high enough affinity to potently neutralize RSV.</p>

<title>NRM boosts site II–specific antibodies under conditions of preexisting immunity</title>
<p>Although vaccination studies in naïve animal models are an important first step to validate novel immunogens, previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref022">22</xref>] and results presented here imply that epitope-scaffolds may not be able to elicit robust RSV-neutralizing serum activity from a naïve antibody repertoire. However, given the high affinity of the epitope-scaffold toward a panel of site II–specific nAbs, together with the ability to elicit high titers of site II–specific antibodies in vivo, we hypothesized that such an epitope-focused immunogen could be efficient in recalling site II–specific B cells in a scenario of preexisting immunity, thereby achieving an enhanced site-specific neutralization response.</p>
<p>Our initial immunization studies with prefusion RSVF showed that site II–specific responses were subdominant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000164.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>). Given that subdominance is a common immunological phenotype for many of the neutralization epitopes that are relevant for vaccine development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref049">49</xref>], we sought to test if NRM could boost subdominant antibody lineages that should ultimately be functional and recognize the epitope in the quaternary environment of the viral protein. To test this hypothesis, we designed a mouse immunization experiment with three cohorts, as outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000164.g004">Fig 4A</xref>. Following a priming immunization with RSVF, cohort 1 was boosted with adjuvant only (“prime-only”), cohort 2 received two boosting immunizations with prefusion RSVF (“homologous boost”), and cohort 3 received two boosts with NRM (“heterologous boost”).</p>

<title>Heterologous prime–boost reshapes antibody responses enhancing levels of site II–specific antibodies.</title>
<p>(A) Heterologous prime–boost study groups. Three mouse cohorts were immunized with either 1x RSVF (“prime-only”), 3x RSVF (“homologous boost”), or 1x RSVF followed by two boosts with NRM (“heterologous boost”). (B) Antibody titers directed against prefusion RSVF. Mice receiving homologous boosting immunizations show slightly higher RSVF-specific serum titers compared to the prime-only cohort, whereas heterologous boosting yielded statistically comparable titers to the prime-only group. The difference between the homologous and heterologous boost cohorts was statistically significant. (C) Site II–specific titers measured by ELISA showed that the heterologous boost significantly increases site II–specific titers compared to both prime and homologous boost groups. Albeit not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.06), mice receiving a homologous boost had lower levels of site II–specific antibodies compared to prime-only group. (D) SPR competition assay with motavizumab on a prefusion RSVF-coated sensor chip. Sera from indicated groups were diluted 1:100, and RSVF binding responses were quantified. Site II was then blocked with motavizumab, and the remaining serum response was quantified. The heterologous (“heterol.”) boost induced a significantly higher fraction of site II–directed antibodies that competed with motavizumab for RSVF binding, as compared to both prime-only and homologous (“homol.”) boost groups. (E) Quantification of site II–specific responses in a competition ELISA. Binding was measured against prefusion RSVF, and the AUC was calculated in the presence of NRM competitor, normalized to the AUC in the presence of RSVN as a control competitor. Compared to the prime-only group, the homologous boost resulted in significantly lower site II–specific serum titers, confirming the trend observed in (C). The heterologous boost increased the fraction of site II–targeting antibodies within the pool of prefusion RSVF-specific antibodies compared to both control groups. Data presented are from at least two independent experiments, with each sample assayed in duplicates.

<p>A comparison between the prefusion RSV-immunized groups prime-only and homologous boost revealed that the two additional boosting immunizations with RSVF only slightly increased overall titers of prefusion RSVF-specific antibodies (<italic>p</italic> = 0.02), indicating that a single immunization with adjuvanted RSVF is sufficient to induce close to maximal serum titers against RSVF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000164.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Following the heterologous boost with NRM, overall RSVF-specific antibody titers remained statistically comparable to the prime-only group (<italic>p</italic> = 0.22).</p>
<p>Next, we quantified the site II–specific endpoint serum titers in a peptide ELISA format (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000164.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). The homologous boost with prefusion RSVF failed to increase site II–specific antibody levels, reducing the responses directed to site II to the lower limit of detection by ELISA. This result is yet another example of the underlying complexity inherent to the fine specificity of antibody responses elicited by immunogens and how important specificities can be dampened throughout the development of an antibody response. In contrast to the homologous boost, the heterologous boost with NRM significantly increased site II peptide–specific serum titers (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001).</p>
<p>In order to understand whether this increase relied at least partially on an actual recall of antibodies primed by RSVF, or rather on an independent antibody response irrelevant for RSVF binding and RSV neutralization, we dissected the epitope specificity within the RSVF-specific serum response. In an SPR competition assay, a significantly higher fraction (<italic>p</italic> = 0.02) of prefusion RSVF-reactive antibodies were competed by motavizumab in mouse sera primed with prefusion RSVF and boosted with NRM (mean percent blocking = 37.5% ± 14.5%), as compared to mice immunized once or three times with prefusion RSVF (21.5% ± 12.1% or 19.5% ± 3.7%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000164.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Control mice immunized that were not primed with prefusion RSVF and instead were immunized three times with NRM did not yield detectable binding signals against prefusion RSVF in an SPR assay, despite detectable ELISA signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000164.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Thus, while the heterologous boost with NRM will also prime antibodies that do not bind RSVF, the increased fraction of prefusion RSVF-binding, site II–specific antibodies is likely to arise from a recall of RSVF-primed, site II–specific antibodies. Similarly, a competition ELISA revealed that a significantly larger fraction of overall RSVF reactivity was attributed to site II–specific antibodies upon heterologous boost, as compared to both control groups (mean percent competition = 36.1% ± 2.5% versus 22.6% ± 9.1% or 14.4% ± 5.9%, respectively, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002 and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). In contrast, site II–specific antibodies were significantly higher in mice that received only one as opposed to three RSVF immunizations, indicating that RSVF boosting immunizations further dampened site II–specific antibody titers (<italic>p</italic> = 0.03) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000164.g004">Fig 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, we have shown that the serum antibody specificity can be steered toward a well-defined antigenic site by boosting preexisting, subdominant antibody levels with an epitope-focused immunogen. This is an important and distinctive feature of the epitope-focused immunogen compared to an immunogen based on a viral protein (prefusion RSVF), which was shown to decrease already subdominant antibody responses under the same conditions. These results may have broad implications for strategies to control antibody fine specificities in vaccination schemes, both for RSV and other pathogens.</p>

<title>Boosted antibodies neutralize RSV in vitro</title>
<p>The enhanced reactivity to site II observed in the heterologous prime–boost scheme led us to investigate if the antibodies boosted by a synthetic immunogen were functionally relevant for virus neutralization. In bulk sera, we observed 2.3-fold higher serum neutralization titers in mice receiving the heterologous boost (mean IC<sub>50</sub> = 7,654) compared to the prime-only control group (mean IC<sub>50</sub> = 3,275) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000164.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).

<p>To characterize the RSV-neutralizing activity mediated by site II–specific antibodies, we pooled sera from each cohort, enriched site II–specific antibodies, and measured viral neutralization (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000164.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). Briefly, we incubated pooled sera from each group with streptavidin beads, which were conjugated to biotin-labeled antigenic site II peptide, and eluted bound antibodies. To control for the quality of the enrichment protocol, we verified by ELISA that the column flow-through was depleted of site II–specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000164.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). In agreement with the different site II peptide–specific serum levels shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000164.g004">Fig 4</xref>, the overall quantity of site II–specific antibodies purified from equivalent amounts of sera differed between groups, with the heterologous boost and the 3x NRM groups showing the highest levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000164.s009">S9 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we tested neutralization of this polyclonal pool of site II–specific antibodies. We found that the heterologous boost cohort showed a 15-fold greater site II–specific neutralization titer (IC<sub>50</sub> = 99.6) as compared to the prime-only and homologous boost cohorts (IC<sub>50</sub> = 6.6 and IC<sub>50</sub> = 4.9, respectively). It is important to note that although the homologous boost with RSVF showed increased serum neutralizing activity compared to the prime-only control group, site II–mediated neutralization was similar. This finding is consistent with our observation that site II–specific antibodies do not increase with repeated immunizations of prefusion RSVF. Enriched antibodies from the 3x NRM group were nonneutralizing, despite the high concentration of site II–specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000164.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). Thus, NRM significantly enhances site II–mediated RSV neutralization but requires the priming of a relevant subset of RSVF-binding antibodies. Finally, we addressed whether this increase in site II–mediated neutralization was due to higher amounts of site II–specific antibodies or the intrinsic neutralization potency of the same antibodies. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000164.g005">Fig 5D</xref>, antibodies from the prime-only, heterologous boost, and homologous boost cohorts exhibit similar neutralization potencies (IC<sub>50</sub> ranging from 1.7 μg/ml to 4.9 μg/ml) of site II–specific antibodies. Consequently, the heterologous boosting scheme yielded higher amounts of site-specific, functional antibodies, rather than an increased potency of the same antibodies.</p>
<p>Altogether, we dissected the mode of action of the synthetic immunogens when used as heterologous boosters, in which the observed enhanced neutralization resulted from the increase of sheer amounts of antibodies directed to site II.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite a rapid increase in our atomic-level understanding of antibody–antigen interactions for various pathogens, the translation of structural information into efficacious immunogens that elicit antibody responses specific to bona fide epitopes remains a key challenge for next-generation vaccine development.</p>
<p>Multiple strategies have been investigated to focus nAb responses on defined neutralization epitopes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref050">50</xref>]. Among them, epitope-scaffolds have been shown to elicit RSV site II–specific nAb responses in naïve NHPs. Although the overall serum neutralization was modest, a monoclonal antibody induced by vaccination showed superior neutralization potency to that of palivizumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref022">22</xref>]. However, a major limitation of epitope-scaffold immunogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref051">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref052">52</xref>] is that the quaternary environment of the epitope presented in the native viral protein is lost. Thus, the binding mode of a significant fraction of the elicited antibodies is likely incompatible with the epitope in its native environment. This observation is reinforced by our finding that although NRM elicited high serum levels of site II peptide–specific antibodies, only low levels were cross-reactive with RSVF, and neutralizing activity was residual. This finding is consistent with previous studies using epitope-scaffolds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref054">54</xref>]. Together, these results highlight the limitations of synthetic scaffolds in an epitope-focused vaccine approach in naïve individuals.</p>
<p>However, our finding—that an epitope that is subdominant (site II) in its native environment (prefusion RSVF) is readily targeted by the immune system when presented in a distinct molecular context (NRM)—supported the potential use of synthetic immunogens to reshape antibody responses toward such well-defined antigenic sites. Preexisting immunity against a viral protein (RSVF, influenza HA, or others), in which certain antibody specificities are subdominant, is a common scenario in humans that have encountered repeated natural infections throughout their life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref055">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref057">57</xref>]. Therefore, a major challenge for vaccine development is to boost preexisting, subdominant antibodies and enhance site-specific neutralization.</p>
<p>To date, boosting nAbs that target specific epitopes under conditions of preexisting immunity has been challenging. For instance, strong antibody responses against immunodominant epitopes can sterically mask the neutralization epitope, preventing the induction of a potent antibody response targeting the subdominant site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref058">58</xref>]. Overcoming these established immunodominance hierarchies is complex, as such hierarchies seem to be impacted by multiple factors, including serological antibody levels, their specificity, memory B cell counts, adjuvants, and the immunization or infection route [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>Heterologous prime–boost schemes are a promising strategy to guide the fine specificity of antibody responses and to focus these responses on vulnerable antigenic sites. Several vaccine studies have been conducted for influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref035">35</xref>], RSV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref032">32</xref>], and HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref029">29</xref>], in which the heterologous immunogens were alternative strains or modified viral fusion proteins but yet not as heterologous as a computationally designed epitope-scaffold. It is possible that immunogens based on modified viral proteins retain immunodominant signatures that steer antibody responses away from the target epitopes. Although this scenario may not be fully absent in synthetic epitope-scaffolds, it is at least mitigated by the fact that the protein has not evolved under the pressure of escaping the immune system.</p>
<p>Our study demonstrates that a heterologous boosting immunogen that optimally presents a single neutralization epitope can boost preexisting, subdominant antibody responses that target this epitope, yielding increased epitope-mediated neutralization. The ability to narrowly focus antibody responses to a single epitope that mediates clinical protection underlines the potential of rationally designed immunogens for vaccine development against elusive pathogens. In particular, our results demonstrate that although single-epitope immunogens may not be the most powerful to select functional antibodies from a naïve repertoire, they have a unique ability to boost neutralizing epitope-specific antibodies primed by a viral protein. Further studies in more relevant animal models will reveal if nAbs primed by natural infection with RSV can also be boosted, mimicking a more realistic vaccination scenario.</p>
<p>Given that the approach presented here is generalizable and that epitope-scaffold nanoparticles can be proven successful in boosting nAbs specific for other sites, this strategy holds great potential to tune levels of antibody specificities through heterologous prime–boost vaccination schemes, which are now frequently used for challenging pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref059">59</xref>].</p>
<p>The original antigenic sin theory in the influenza field describes that the first viral exposure permanently shapes the antibody response, which causes individuals to respond to seasonal vaccines in a manner dependent on their immune history [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref060">60</xref>]. Seasonal vaccines generally fail to boost antibodies targeting broadly neutralization epitopes on the HA stem region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref024">24</xref>]. Focusing antibody responses on these defined epitopes may remove the need for annual vaccine reformulation and may also protect against emerging pandemic strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref061">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref062">62</xref>]. The influenza vaccine challenge seems particularly well suited to our approach, considering that the human population has preexisting immunity to influenza, including some subdominant bnAbs that seasonal vaccines fail to stimulate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
<p>Lastly, vaccine development against antigenically related viruses such as Zika and dengue could benefit from the approach presented here, as antibodies mounted against the envelope protein of a dengue subtype can facilitate infection with Zika [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref063">63</xref>] or other dengue subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref064">64</xref>]. A site conserved between all four dengue subtypes and Zika envelope protein has been structurally characterized and suggested for the development of an epitope-focused immunogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>When seeking to apply an immunofocusing strategy to other antigenic sites and pathogens, one challenge is the development of epitope-scaffolds stably presenting the epitope in a synthetic immunogen that is compatible with antibody binding. Whereas the RSV antigenic site II is a structurally simple helix-turn-helix motif, many other identified neutralization epitopes comprise multiple, discontinuous segments. However, continuous advances in rational protein design techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref065">65</xref>] will allow the design of more complex protein scaffolds to stabilize increasingly complex epitopes.</p>
<p>Altogether, we have shown how an optimized presentation of a computationally designed immunogen in an RSVN-based nanoparticle can reshape bulk serum responses and boost subdominant nAb responses in vivo. This is a distinctive feature compared to using prefusion RSVF as a boosting immunogen and underscores how subdominant epitopes can be converted to immunodominant epitopes when presented in a different environment. We foresee the great promise of this strategy to overcome the challenge of boosting and focusing preexisting immunity toward defined neutralization epitopes, potentially applicable to multiple pathogens.</p>

Samples were then pooled and NGS was performed on the Illumina MiSeq platform with a MiSeq Reagent Kit V3, 2 × 300 bp paired-end (Illumina, #MS-102-3003), using an input concentration of 10 pM with 10% PhiX.</p>

<title>Error and bias correction</title>
<p>Error and bias correction was performed using molecular amplification fingerprinting pipeline, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref072">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref073">73</xref>]: (1) For bioinformatic preprocessing, paired-end FASTQ files obtained from Illumina MiSeq were imported into CLC Genomics Workbench 10 on the ETH Zurich Euler High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster. A preprocessing workflow was run containing the following steps: trimming of low-quality reads, merging of paired-end reads, removal of sequences not aligning to mouse IGH constant sequences, and length filtering. (2) For error correction by consensus building, after preprocessing all datasets were downsampled to contain the same amount of sequencing reads as the dataset with the lowest overall number of reads (361,749 sequencing reads). For error correction, a custom Python script was used to perform consensus building on the sequences, for which at least three reads per UID were required. VDJ annotation and frequency calculation was then performed by our in-house aligner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref072">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref073">73</xref>].

<title>Sequence analysis and data visualization</title>
<p>Data analysis was done by customized scripts in R. For the identification of clonotypes, hierarchical clustering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref073">73</xref>] was utilized to group CDR3 sequences together. The following criteria were used: identical IGHV and IGHJ gene segment usage, identical CDR3 length, and at least 80% CDR3 amino acid similarity to one other sequence in the given clonotype (single linkage). The overlap of clonotypes between both cohorts was analyzed by extracting the 20 most expanded clonotypes from each cohort and visualizing their size, occurrence, and Vgene usage by a circos plot using R software circlize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref074">74</xref>]. CDR3 sequence similarities between overlapping clonotypes were represented graphically with the R software motifStack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000164.ref075">75</xref>]. All scripts are available upon request.</p>

<p>Female Balb/c mice (five animals/group) were immunized three times (days 0, 21, 42) with 10 μg FFL_001 monomer adsorbed to different adjuvants, and serum was analyzed on day 56. (A) Immunogenicity of FFL_001 formulated in different adjuvants. Serum titers were determined against FFL_001 at day 56 of the immunization protocol. FFL_001 adsorbed to alum showed highest overall immunogenicity. (B) Prefusion RSVF cross-reactivity of FFL_001 immunized mice after three immunizations. Four out of five mice immunized with FFL_001 formulated in alum showed serum cross-reactivity with prefusion RSVF.

Determined mass in solution is 14.7 kDa ± 3.5%, which is close to the theoretical molecular weight of 14.4 kDa. (C) Relative surface area of RSVF antigenic site II in prefusion RSVF (PDBID 4JHW), FFLM, and NRM (model based on RSVN structure with PDBID 2WJ8). The motavizumab epitope is highlighted in red, blue patches indicate sequence changes of FFLM compared to FFL_001, and pie charts show the fraction of antigenic site II surface area compared to overall immunogen surface area. SASA was computed in PyMol in presence and absence of motavizumab. Percent SASA of antigenic site II is nearly identical when comparing RSVF and NRM, whereas the FFLM monomer shows approximately 3-fold greater relative surface area of antigenic site II, because of its small size.

<title>Mice immunized with synthetic immunogen show low levels of cross-reactivity with recombinant RSVF and negligible binding to viral lysate.</title>
<p>Mice were immunized three times with prefusion RSVF, NRM, or FFLM as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000164.g002">Fig 2</xref>. (A) Sera from day 56 were analyzed by ELISA for binding to prefusion and postfusion RSVF. Prefusion RSVF–immunized mice showed lower reactivity to postfusion RSVF than to the prefusion form. FFLM- and NRM-immunized mice showed low levels of cross-reactivity with pre- and postfusion RSVF. Data shown are from one out of three independent experiments. (B) Day 56 sera from 10 mice were pooled and tested for binding to lysate of Hep2 cells, which had been infected for 48 hours with RSV. As background control, noninfected Hep2 cell lysate was prepared, and curves shown were background-subtracted. NRM-immunized mouse sera strongly react with viral lysate, whereas mice immunized with FFLM only showed negligible binding to viral lysate. The strong reactivity of NRM-immunized mice derives from antibodies raised against the RSVN carrier protein. Sera from prefusion RSVF–immunized mice are shown as control. Data shown are from one experiment performed in triplicates. Data are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000164.s011">S1 Data</xref>.

<title>Enrichment of site II–specific antibodies from mouse sera.</title>
<p>(A) Experimental setup. Streptavidin agarose beads were conjugated to biotinylated antigenic site II peptide. As control, unconjugated streptavidin beads were prepared. Sera from 10 mice within each cohort were pooled and mixed with conjugated and unconjugated beads. Column flow-through and elution fractions were analyzed by ELISA (B, C), and eluted site II–specific antibodies were analyzed in an RSV neutralization assay (D). (B) Analysis of column flow-through for site II peptide reactivity by ELISA. Immunization groups as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000164.g004">Fig 4</xref> (prime-only, homologous boost, heterologous boost, and 3x NRM). ELISA signal (OD at 450 nm) for site II peptide reactivity is shown for column flow-through from serum fractionation as depicted in (A). Streptavidin beads that were not coupled to antigenic site II peptide were used as controls and did not deplete site II reactivity in the flow-through. Data and error bars presented are averaged from two independent experiments. (C) ELISA against antigenic site II peptide of the elution fractions as shown in (A). Antibodies eluted bound specifically to the antigenic site II peptide.

<title>Competition ELISA with motavizumab antibody control.</title>
<p>Plates were coated with prefusion RSVF as described in the Methods. Three-fold serial dilutions of motavizumab (initial concentration = 30 nanomolar) were prepared in presence of different competitors (RSVN, NRM, or none). Following overnight competition at 4°C, binding of motavizumab to RSVF was measured. As expected, RSVN competition did not affect RSVF binding of motavizumab. In contrast, NRM efficiently competed with RSVF for motavizumab binding at the indicated competitor concentration.
