<abstract>
<p>In eukaryotes, the highly conserved U3 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) base-pairs to multiple sites in the pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) to promote early cleavage and folding events. Binding of the U3 box A region to the pre-rRNA is mutually exclusive with folding of the central pseudoknot (CPK), a universally conserved rRNA structure of the small ribosomal subunit essential for protein synthesis. Here, we report that the DEAH-box helicase Dhr1 (Ecm16) is responsible for displacing U3. An active site mutant of Dhr1 blocked release of U3 from the pre-ribosome, thereby trapping a pre-40S particle. This particle had not yet achieved its mature structure because it contained U3, pre-rRNA, and a number of early-acting ribosome synthesis factors but noticeably lacked ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) that surround the CPK. Dhr1 was cross-linked <italic>in vivo</italic> to the pre-rRNA and to U3 sequences flanking regions that base-pair to the pre-rRNA including those that form the CPK. Point mutations in the box A region of U3 suppressed a cold-sensitive mutation of Dhr1, strongly indicating that U3 is an <italic>in vivo</italic> substrate of Dhr1. To support the conclusions derived from <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis we showed that Dhr1 unwinds U3-18S duplexes <italic>in vitro</italic> by using a mechanism reminiscent of DEAD box proteins.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Ribosomes are intricate assemblies of RNA and protein that are responsible for decoding a cell’s genetic information. Their assembly is a very rapid and dynamic process, requiring many ancillary factors in eukaryotic cells. One critical factor is the U3 snoRNA, which binds to the immature ribosomal RNA to direct early processing and folding of the RNA of the small subunit. Although U3 is essential to promote assembly, it must be actively removed to allow completion of RNA folding. Such RNA dynamics are often driven by RNA helicases, and here we use a broad range of experimental approaches to identify the RNA helicase Dhr1 as the enzyme responsible for removing U3 in yeast. A combination of techniques allows us to assess what goes wrong when Dhr1 is mutated, which parts of the RNA molecules the enzyme binds to, and how Dhr1 unwinds its substrates.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ribosome biogenesis is fundamental to cellular growth. In bacteria that have undergone extreme genome reduction, ribosomes are apparently assembled without the use of specialized assembly factors [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], indicating that the information needed for the correct rRNA folding and protein assembly is intrinsic to the ribosomal components themselves. Similarly, functional bacterial ribosomes can be assembled from purified components <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Despite their general conservation of structure, eukaryotic ribosomes require a large number of protein and RNA trans-acting factors that assist in their assembly [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A central outstanding question in the field is how RNA-RNA and RNA-protein structural rearrangements, which mark the transition from one step to the next, are directed and regulated.</p>
<p>Pre-ribosomal particles initially assemble on the nascent pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) transcript, which undergoes cleavage to separate the pre-40S and pre-60S complexes. This critical event in ribosome biogenesis requires the U3 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA). U3 is highly conserved among eukaryotes and base-pairs with multiple sites of the pre-rRNA to coordinate early folding and cleavage events [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The U3-associated proteins Imp3 and Imp4 promote the U3-pre-rRNA interactions <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and are thought to serve a similar role <italic>in vivo</italic>. U3 binding to the 5′-external transcribed spacer (5′-ETS) and 18S regions of the pre-rRNA is required for the cleavage events at sites A0 within the 5′-ETS, at A1 that generates the mature 5′ end of 18S and at site A2, within internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1), which separates the earliest pre-40S and pre-60S particles [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Within the 18S rRNA, U3 binds to the sequence close to the 5′ end of the 18S rRNA that will form the 5′ side of the central pseudoknot (CPK), a long range interaction that is a key architectural feature of the small ribosomal subunit (SSU) in all domains of life [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. U3 also has the potential to base-pair to the sequence that will form the 3′ side of the CPK and is located more than 1 Kb away in the 18S rRNA (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), although this interaction has not been experimentally verified. These U3 interactions are believed to both facilitate formation of the CPK and control the timing of this key maturation step. However, U3 must be unwound from the pre-rRNA for CPK formation to occur. Furthermore, <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies indicate that the spontaneous dissociation rate of U3–18S interactions in the absence of accessory factors is too slow to support the rates of ribosome assembly observed <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], suggesting that a helicase is needed.</p>

<p>Nineteen RNA helicases are involved in ribosome biogenesis in yeast, 17 of which are essential [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These helicases are classified as either DEAD or DEAH/RHA enzymes based on conserved sequence motifs. DEAD box proteins do not unwind duplexes in a processive fashion. Rather, ATP-dependent binding to short duplex regions results in duplex destabilization and strand separation. Thus, ATP hydrolysis is not needed for duplex unwinding, but it is required for rapid product release to recycle the enzyme for multiple substrate turnovers. Processivity has also not been observed in DEAH/RHA enzymes but they have been less studied in mechanistic detail [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Identifying <italic>in vivo</italic> substrates for the RNA helicases has generally been challenging, and specific substrates have not yet been identified for most of the pre-ribosomal helicases. Previous analyses suggested two candidate helicases for the removal of U3 snoRNA from the CPK region. The DEAH helicase Dhr1 (Ecm16) was reported to be associated with U3 [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], whereas depletion of the DEAD enzyme Has1 leads to retention of snoRNAs, including U3, in pre-ribosomal particles [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Here, we provide genetic, <italic>in vivo</italic> cross-linking and biochemical evidence that Dhr1 is the helicase that directly displaces U3 from the pre-rRNA to permit formation of the CPK.</p>

<title>Dhr1<sub>K420A</sub> Accumulates a Novel ∼45S Particle Containing SSU Components</title>
<p>In a previous analysis of RNA helicases involved in SSU biogenesis in yeast, conserved motifs were systematically mutated to generate mutants defective in ATP binding and/or hydrolysis [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Over-expression of Dhr1 with a Lys420 to Ala mutation (Dhr1<sub>K420A</sub>) in the Walker A motif gave a dominant negative lethal phenotype, and inhibited pre-rRNA processing, primarily at sites A1 and A2 [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The dominant negative phenotype implies that this mutant efficiently competes with wild-type (WT) protein, possibly by binding unproductively to its substrate, but no specific RNA substrate was identified. We hypothesized that Dhr1 is involved in dissociation of U3 from the pre-rRNA and that the Dhr1<sub>K420A</sub> mutant might block dissociation of the U3 complex.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we ectopically expressed c-myc epitope-tagged, WT Dhr1 and the Dhr1<sub>K420A</sub> mutant proteins in cells in which genomic <italic>DHR1</italic> gene was under control of the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter and could be rapidly depleted by growth in glucose. This <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>GAL1</italic></sub> HA-<italic>DHR1</italic> strain was unable to grow on glucose-containing medium (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig.</xref>) and HA-tagged Dhr1 was depleted to levels below detection within 6 h of repression by glucose (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B Fig.</xref>). <italic>DHR1</italic>–13myc fully complemented loss of <italic>DHR1</italic>, whereas <italic>dhr1</italic><sub><italic>K420A</italic></sub>-13myc was unable to support growth (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig.</xref>).</p>
<p>To identify the function of Dhr1, extracts from cells expressing Dhr1–13myc or Dhr1<sub>K420A</sub>-13myc were fractionated by sedimentation through sucrose density gradients. A strong 40S biogenesis defect in the mutant polysomes profile was evident from the loss of free 40S subunits and reciprocal increase in free 60S subunits in the <italic>dhr1</italic><sub><italic>K420A</italic></sub> mutant compared to WT (Fig. <xref rid="pbio.1002083.g002" ref-type="fig">2A</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002083.g002" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). This reduction in free 40S was also evident from loss of Rps8 (eS8) from the 40S fraction in the <italic>dhr1</italic><sub><italic>K420A</italic></sub> gradient compared to WT (Fig. <xref rid="pbio.1002083.g002" ref-type="fig">2C</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002083.g002" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). Western blotting for Dhr1 revealed that WT Dhr1 was almost entirely at the top of the gradient (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, lanes 2 and 3), indicating that the interaction of Dhr1 with pre-ribosomes is either very transient or unstable following cell lysis. In contrast, Dhr1<sub>K420A</sub> sedimented at ∼45S (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, lane 7), indicative of stable association with pre-40S particles. The sedimentation at ∼45S was unexpected because Dhr1 was previously characterized as a factor that acts in the context of the 90S processome [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The altered Dhr1 sedimentation was accompanied by changes in the sedimentation of U3 (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, lanes 8–10 in WT and lane 6 in mutant) and its associated proteins Mpp10 and Imp4, with a significant fraction of these small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) components co-sedimenting with Dhr1<sub>K420A</sub> (compare <xref rid="pbio.1002083.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> lanes 9–11 with <xref rid="pbio.1002083.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, lane 7).</p>

<p>Comparison of pre-rRNAs present in the strains expressing Dhr1 and Dhr1<sub>K420A</sub> (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, lanes 1–4) revealed the loss of the 27SA2 pre-rRNA, accompanied by accumulation of an aberrant 21S species. The 5′ end of 27SA2 is generated by cleavage at site A2, whereas 21S is generated by cleavage at sites A1 and A3 in the absence of A2 cleavage. Notably, there was little accumulation of the 23S RNA, which is generated by A3 cleavage in the absence of cleavage at sites A0, A1, and A2, and is commonly seen in 40S subunit biogenesis mutants. These findings show that expression of Dhr1<sub>K420A</sub> specifically impairs pre-rRNA cleavage at site A2. A reduced level of 20S pre-rRNA was detected in the mutant (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, lanes 3 and 4), showing that inhibition of A2 cleavage was not complete.</p>

<p>Pre-RNA species present in particles associated with Dhr1–13myc and Dhr1<sub>K420A</sub>-13myc were compared by immunoprecipitation (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, lanes 5–8). The mutant particle contained low levels of 35S and 32S pre-rRNAs, and was enriched for 21S and 20S pre-rRNAs (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). 21S RNA represented 36% and 20S represented the remaining 64% of the combined 21S + 20S signal.</p>
<p>We used mass spectrometry (MS) for a comprehensive analysis of the protein composition of the Dhr1<sub>K420A</sub> particle (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002083.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Epitope tagged (13xmyc) and untagged Dhr1<sub>K420A</sub> particles were immunoprecipitated, digested with trypsin, and subjected to MS. The U3 snoRNA is specifically associated with the Mpp10 complex (Mpp10, Imp3, and Imp4) and Rrp9, as well the common box C/D snoRNA binding proteins Nop1, Nop56, Nop58, and Snu13. All were detected with the exception of Snu13, which is very small. Among the early binding factors, independently assembled complexes have been defined and termed the UtpA, B, and C complexes and Rrp5. The MS analysis detected seven of the eight subunits of Utp-A complex, all six components of the Utp-B complex, two Utp-C components, Rrp5, and 19 of the 33 SSU ribosomal proteins (r-proteins). Notably absent were the late assembling r-proteins, including Rps2 (uS5), Rps3 (uS3), and Rps23 (uS12). The absence of Rps2, Rps3, and enrichment of Imp4 and Mpp10 were confirmed by Western blotting (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig.</xref>). Numerous additional 40S biogenesis factors, including the GTPase Bms1 and the putative A2 endonuclease Rcl1 [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] were also present, but late biogenesis factors, such as Ltv1, were not detected. Surprisingly, nine of the 11 subunits of the nuclear exosome were identified together with its cofactor, the RNA helicase Mtr4 [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The presence of the nuclear exosome could reflect its activity in removing the cleaved fragments of the 5′-ETS or recognition of the particle as defective by the nuclear surveillance machinery. The protein and RNA composition of this particle indicates that it is arrested at an early stage in pre-40S assembly, in which U3 and the SSU-processome complex remain associated with the pre-rRNA [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
<p>Mapping the r-proteins present in the Dhr1<sub>K420A</sub> particle to the mature 40S structure revealed a remarkable absence of r-proteins surrounding the CPK (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). In particular, Rps2, the primary r-protein that binds to the CPK, and Rps23 were absent from this particle. Comparison with the bacterial <italic>in vivo</italic> assembly map [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] revealed that almost all of the primary and secondary binding r-proteins were present but tertiary binding proteins were absent. We propose that the absence of proteins surrounding the CPK allows flexibility in the ribosomal RNA structure to enable access of assembly factors, including Dhr1 and the U3 snoRNA, to the CPK.</p>

<title>U3 Remains Base-Paired with 18S in a <italic>dhr1</italic> Mutant</title>
<p>If Dhr1 is responsible for displacing the U3 from the pre-18S, then U3 should remain base-paired with 18S in the ∼45S particle that accumulates in Dhr1<sub>K420A</sub> expressing cells. To examine this possibility, we used chemical modification with dimethyl sulfate (DMS), which modifies N1 of adenines and N3 of cytosines, and primer extension. When the pre-18S is base-paired with U3, A1139 is predicted to be in a standard Watson-Crick A-U base pair and thus protected from DMS (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> top) [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In contrast, in the mature CPK A1139 is involved in a non-Watson-Crick base triple [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and N1 is susceptible to DMS modification (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, bottom) [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Thus, the DMS susceptibility of A1139 is diagnostic for whether the CPK has formed or remains base-paired with U3.</p>

<p>Extracts from cells expressing Dhr1 or Dhr1<sub>K420A</sub> were fractionated by sucrose density gradient sedimentation, and fractions corresponding to ∼45S were collected. We anticipated that in WT cells this fraction would primarily contain mature 40S particles whereas in the mutant, the limited pool of 40S would rapidly recycle into translating ribosomes and the stalled intermediate containing Dhr1<sub>K420A</sub> would accumulate. Pooled fractions were treated with DMS or mock and purified mature 40S subunits were treated for a control. Modification of A1139 was readily detected in mature 40S subunits (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, compare lane 5, no DMS, with lanes 6–8) and in 45S fractions from the WT gradient (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, lanes 9–11). However, A1139 modification was substantially reduced in the mutant (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, lanes 12–14). The particularly strong signal for A1139 in mature subunits probably reflects the hypersensitivity of this position to DMS, as reported for A915 of the bacterial ribosome (analogous to yeast A1139) [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The relative decrease of A1139 modification was quantified and normalized to intensities of nearby peaks that were relatively constant between WT and mutant (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, lane quantification, far right). Reactivity of A1139 to DMS was reduced 80% in the mutant compared to WT. This low reactivity indicates that A1139 remains base-paired with U3 in the Dhr1<sub>K420A</sub> particle.</p>

<title>Dhr1 Directly Binds U3 snoRNA Elements Required for Base-Pairing with Pre-rRNA</title>
<p>To identify direct RNA binding sites of Dhr1, we performed UV cross-linking and analysis of cDNA (CRAC) experiments on strains expressing Dhr1 with a tripartite C-terminal tag, consisting of His6—tobacco etch virus protease (TEV) cleavage site—protein A (Dhr1-HTP), and untagged Dhr1 as a negative control [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). UV cross-linking of Dhr1 <italic>in vivo</italic> yielded a strong RNA cross-linked species for Dhr1-HTP but not for the control (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). As other RNA helicases have been shown to be required for the release of snoRNAs from the pre-rRNA, we compared the read density of Dhr1 across all snoRNAs in yeast. The snoRNAs have been divided into two large groups termed box C/D and box H/ACA (Fig. <xref rid="pbio.1002083.g005" ref-type="fig">5B</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002083.g005" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>), on the basis of conserved sequence elements and common proteins. Dhr1 had a strong preference for cross-linking only to the box C/D U3 (encoded by U3A and U3B, <xref rid="pbio.1002083.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>); no other snoRNA was significantly enriched. Within U3 most of the reads overlapped within the box A motif in the 5′ end of the RNA, with smaller numbers of hits at the 3′ terminal stem and box D (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). In CRAC analyses, the locations of micro deletions or substitutions in the cDNAs indicate the precise sites of protein-RNA cross-linking. These contact sites could be to the helicase active site itself or to other surfaces of the protein that bind to RNA. Deletions in the Dhr1 reads were rare but U29, C39, G47, and A48 were frequently substituted (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>), indicating that Dhr1 directly contacts these nucleotides in U3. Notably, U29 is located in the box A motif directly downstream of the predicted U3 interaction with the 3′ side of the CPK while C39, G47, and A48 flank a U3 binding site for the 5′-ETS (Figs <xref rid="pbio.1002083.g005" ref-type="fig">5E</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002083.g006" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>).</p>

Dhr1 cross-linking was detectable at many sites on pre-rRNA, but three peaks, in helices H11, H23, and H44 in the SSU, were reproducibly identified as strong cross-linking sites in two independent experiments (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4A</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002083.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref> Figs).

<title>Mutations in U3 Suppress a Cold-Sensitive <italic>dhr1</italic> Mutant</title>
<p>We hypothesized that cold-sensitive mutations in Dhr1 might stall a reaction intermediate containing the U3–18S duplex. If this duplex is indeed the target of Dhr1, then mutations in U3 that destabilize the duplex might suppress the <italic>dhr1</italic> mutation. Cold-sensitive <italic>dhr1</italic> mutants were therefore identified by screening cells expressing randomly mutagenized <italic>DHR1</italic>. Yeast cells carrying <italic>dhr1-cs2</italic> were strongly cold-sensitive (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6A Fig.</xref>), displayed a strong 40S biogenesis defect (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6B Fig.</xref>), and, like the K420A mutant, accumulated U3 at the position of ∼45S in a sucrose density gradient (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6B Fig.</xref>). Sequencing <italic>dhr1-cs2</italic> revealed multiple mutations: E330G, K399E, T422A, A557G, T633A, and K892E. We then randomly mutagenized <italic>SNR17A</italic> (encoding U3A) by highly mutagenic PCR. PCR product was recombined into a U3 expression vector <italic>in vivo</italic> in a <italic>dhr1-cs2</italic> and conditional U3 mutant strain and transformants were screened for improved growth at low temperature. In cases where <italic>SNR17A</italic> contained multiple mutations, these were separated by subcloning. This screen identified five single point mutations that suppressed the cold-sensitivity of <italic>dhr1-cs2</italic> (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Notably, all of the suppressing mutations mapped to the extreme 5′-end of U3, from residues G1 to A28 (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>), despite the fact that the entire gene was mutagenized. A28G was the most frequently recovered mutation (present in seven of 12 suppressing mutants), with the double mutation of G1A/A28G showing the strongest growth suppression.</p>
<p>The position of these mutations was remarkably coincident with our CRAC data in which Dhr1 most strongly protected residues 22 to 55 of U3 immediately downstream of the suppressing mutations (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Moreover, the residue most frequently substituted in cDNAs from our CRAC analysis was U29, adjacent to A28, the residue most commonly mutated in our suppressor screen. Such genetic suppression of a helicase mutant by mutations in an RNA provides strong evidence that the RNA is an <italic>in vivo</italic> target of the helicase.</p>

<p>To examine whether ATP hydrolysis is required for unwinding, we carried out reactions under the pre-steady state conditions described above using the ATP binding mutant Dhr1<sub>K420A</sub> and the catalytically impaired mutant Dhr1<sub>D516A/E517A</sub>. In the presence of ATP, unwinding activity of Dhr1<sub>D516A/E517A</sub> was indistinguishable from that of WT Dhr1 (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>, compare lanes 5 and 10, and <xref rid="pbio.1002083.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>). In contrast, no unwinding activity was observed for Dhr1<sub>K420A</sub> in the presence of ATP or with Dhr1<sub>D516A/E517A</sub> in the presence of ADP. These results indicate that ATP binding but not hydrolysis is needed for duplex unwinding activity.</p>
<p>To test whether product release requires ATP hydrolysis we measured duplex unwinding activity under steady state conditions in which duplex substrate was present in excess over enzyme. To circumvent the problem of the labeled substrate re-annealing, we used excess unlabeled ETS2 in a strand exchange regime [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Under these conditions, repeated release of unwound product by Dhr1 is necessary for efficient unwinding. Unwinding by WT Dhr1 was observed under steady state conditions in the presence of ATP. In contrast, neither mutant was active under these conditions in the presence of ATP (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref>). Thus, two lines of evidence indicate that ATP hydrolysis by Dhr1 is required for product release from the enzyme but not for duplex unwinding. First, the catalytically impaired Dhr1<sub>D516A/E517A</sub> supported unwinding activity in the presence of ATP under pre-steady state but not steady state conditions. Second, Dhr1<sub>K420A</sub>, which is impaired in ATP binding, was inactive under both conditions. This requirement of ATP hydrolysis by Dhr1 for efficient enzyme recycling but not duplex unwinding suggests that Dhr1 shares a common mechanism with DEAD box proteins [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>

<title>Dhr1 Unwinds a U3–18S Duplex <italic>In Vitro</italic></title>
<p>We also tested the ability of Dhr1 to unwind a second duplex, U3–18S, composed of box A’/A of U3 hybridized to nts 6–22 of 18S (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>). We previously developed an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay for formation of the U3–18S duplex [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] using a minimal system containing nts 4–50 of U3, designated U3 MINI, and nts 6–22 of 18S rRNA to mimic the U3-18S duplex (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>). This duplex does not form spontaneously but forms rapidly in the presence of Imp3, which unfolds stem-loop structures in the U3 and pre-rRNA to expose the sites of hybridization [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Our genetic results indicate that the U3–18S duplex mimics a <italic>bona fide</italic> Dhr1 substrate.</p>
<p>As was observed with the U3-ETS2 duplex, unwinding of the U3–18S duplex was observed in the presence of ATP under pre-steady state conditions, but was not observed either in the absence of ATP or in the presence of ADP (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9C</xref>, lanes 5–7, and <xref rid="pbio.1002083.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9D</xref>). Moreover, unwinding activity was observed for the Dhr1<sub>D516A/E517A</sub> mutant in the presence of ATP, but not for Dhr1<sub>K420A</sub> with ATP (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9D</xref>). These data suggest that unwinding requires ATP binding but is independent of ATP hydrolysis. Although we expect that rapid product release from the U3–18S substrate requires ATP hydrolysis, we were unable to observe unwinding by Dhr1 under steady state conditions with this substrate. The extent of unwinding of the U3–18S duplex by Dhr1 was less than that observed for the U3-ETS2 duplex reaction, presumably because unwinding by Dhr1 competes with strand annealing promoted by Imp3, which is present in excess. Imp3 does not appear to contribute to duplex unwinding, irrespective of the presence of ATP in the reaction (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9C</xref>, lane 4). Moreover, Imp3 binding decreased the RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis by Dhr1 (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). Because the presence of Imp3 is necessary to maintain the U3–18S duplex [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], we have not been able to separate RNA unwinding from RNP remodeling activity with this substrate. Thus, it is currently unclear whether the activity of Dhr1 removes Imp3 directly, destabilizes the U3–18S duplex, or both.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>RNA helicases are required for many steps in RNA metabolism, including splicing, RNP assembly, translation, and RNA degradation. However, there are few cases in which clear genetic relationships between substrate and helicase or <italic>in vitro</italic> assays with a relevant substrate have been established. Here, we have combined genetic, CRAC, and biochemical evidence to conclude that Dhr1 is the helicase that displaces U3 from the 5′ end of the 18S RNA portion of the pre-rRNA to allow formation of the CPK. Our data show that mutant Dhr1 traps a preribosome particle in which U3 remains base-paired with 18S rRNA. Dhr1 cross-links to U3 immediately adjacent to the U3–18S duplex and mutations in U3 suppress a cold-sensitive mutation in Dhr1. <italic>In vitro</italic>, ATP-dependent strand displacement activity is observed with substrates that mimic U3-pre-rRNA interactions.</p>
<sec id="sec011">
<title>What Is the Nature of the Dhr1 Substrate In Vivo?</title>
<p>RNA helicases generally act on RNP complexes rather than on naked duplex RNA. This is also likely to be the case for Dhr1, as formation of the U3–18S duplex requires additional proteins [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and occurs in the context of the SSU processome, a highly complex assemblage of RNA and protein [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The genetic suppression of a <italic>dhr1</italic> cold-sensitive mutant by mutations in the region of U3 that base-pairs with the 18S portion of the pre-rRNA provides compelling evidence that the U3–18S duplex is the <italic>in vivo</italic> substrate of Dhr1. However, several of the suppressing mutations affect residues that are not predicted to be involved in base-paired interactions. These include nucleotide G1, at the extreme 5′-end of U3, C11, in the bulge between box A’ and box A in the U3–18S duplex, and A28, adjacent to the duplex predicted to form between box A and nts 1139–1142 of 18S. We suggest that mutations at these positions affect protein-RNA interactions within the pre-ribosome. Partial disruption of these interactions by mutations in U3 may partially overcome defects of a <italic>dhr1</italic> mutant. Proteins that may stabilize U3-pre-rRNA interactions include the U3-associated proteins Imp3 and Imp4. Imp3 is an RNA chaperone that unfolds the 5′-stem loop of U3 to allow its hybridization with 18S <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The specific function of Imp4 is not known, but it could work in concert with Imp3 to stabilize the short duplex formed between U3 box A and nts 1139–1143 of 18S, on the 3′ side of the CPK (Figs <xref rid="pbio.1002083.g001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002083.g006" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>). We noted that residues C11 and A28 of the U3 contribute to the U3 box A/A’ stem structure that forms when this RNA is not engaged with the pre-rRNA. We considered that Dhr1 might disrupt a competing intramolecular U3 stem-structure, rather than the U3–18S duplex. However, mutation of CGU to UAC at position 36–38 in U3, predicted to destabilize the base of the box A/A’ stem, did not suppress <italic>dhr1-cs</italic> mutant.

<title>Do DEAH/RHA Box Helicases Use a DEAD Box-Like Mechanism?</title>
<p>We showed that Dhr1 <italic>in vitro</italic> unwinding activity depends on ATP binding but not hydrolysis (Figs <xref rid="pbio.1002083.g008" ref-type="fig">8</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002083.g009" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). In contrast, rapid product release and enzyme recycling requires ATP hydrolysis. This activity differs from the well-characterized viral DExH helicases that require ATP hydrolysis for processive strand displacement [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, it is similar to the behavior of DEAD box proteins that can destabilize and unwind short duplexes prior to ATP hydrolysis [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. To our knowledge Dhr1 is the first DEAH/RHA helicase for which the mechanistic steps associated with ATP binding and hydrolysis have been identified. We think it is likely that other DEAH/RHA enzymes utilize a similar mechanism with regards to ATP binding and hydrolysis.</p>
<p>Dhr1 cross-linked to U3 at a position immediately 3′ of the U3–18S duplex, identified in our genetic analysis as an <italic>in vivo</italic> target of Dhr1. Because Dhr1 does not appear to be a processive helicase, this raises the question of how Dhr1 acts on the adjacent U3–18S duplex. It should be noted that the CRAC cross-links are not restricted to active site residues within Dhr1. Thus, Dhr1 could be tethered to U3 while disrupting a nearby duplex. Alternatively, Dhr1 may be recruited to the complex by protein interactions that allow it to go through cycles of binding, local duplex unwinding and dissociation, as is the case for DEAD box proteins.</p>

<title>Dhr1 Identifies an Intermediate of 40S Assembly</title>
<p>Using CRAC experiments, we identified Dhr1 binding sites in 18S rRNA with the highest density of reads in helix 11. Strong cross-linking signals at U319 and U320 indicate direct contact to those positions. Reads also mapped to helices 23 and 44 (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). In the fully folded mature subunit, RNA elements of the platform as well as the top of helix 44 would appear to block access of a bulky helicase to the region of the CPK. In support of this idea, the rRNA region surrounding the CPK was devoid of r-proteins in the Dhr1<sub>K420A</sub> particle (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, left panel). In particular, the tertiary binding proteins Rps23 (uS12) [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which lies below the decoding center in the mature subunit, and Rps2 (uS5), which coordinates the CPK, were absent (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). We therefore envisage that in the U3-bound pre-ribosome, tertiary interactions have not yet been established to allow remodeling of the functional center of the SSU. Notably, intermediates containing an unfolded CPK have also been identified in the bacterial assembly pathway [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. As Dhr1 acts in the context of the preribosome, perhaps one role of additional SSU processome factors is to hold the rRNA structure in a more open conformation to allow access of U3 snoRNA and enzymes including Dhr1.</p>
<p>Our CRAC data also revealed binding sites that for Dhr1 that are removed from the functional center, the most notable being helix 23 in the platform. This site overlaps the binding site for Rps14. However, Rps14 was present in the Dhr1<sub>K420A</sub> particle, indicating that its loading was not blocked. Whether or not Dhr1 plays a role at sites other than in the region of the CPK remains to be determined. In addition, while our results demonstrate that Dhr1 is required for U3 unwinding, they do not exclude the possibility that additional factors participate in this process <italic>in vivo</italic>, potentially including another helicase, such as Has1.</p>

<title>Does Dhr1 Activity Trigger CPK Formation?</title>
<p>The pre-40S particles accumulated in the Dhr1<sub>K420A</sub> mutant strain retain U3 and the SSU processome, but have largely undergone cleavage at sites A1 and A2. The appearance of high levels of the 21S demonstrates cleavage at site A3 prior to A2 cleavage, strongly indicating delayed A2 processing, and this is supported by the loss of the 27SA2 pre-rRNA in the mutant. We predict that release of U3 normally precedes (and very likely stimulates) pre-rRNA cleavage at site A2. However, in the absence of U3 release some level of pre-rRNA cleavage still occurs. More importantly, it seems clear that the loss of Dhr1 activity not only blocked release of U3, but also of many r-protein factors of the SSU processome. The isolation of U3 suppressors of the Dhr1 mutants suggests that U3 dissociation by Dhr1 is a key step in triggering release of core components of the SSU Processome.</p>

The column was washed with Buffer A (30 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 5% [v/v] glycerol, 5 mM sodium acetate, and 1 mM DTT). Protein was eluted with a 21 CV gradient from 0% to 60% buffer B (buffer A plus 1 M NaCl). Dhr1 containing fractions were pooled, dialyzed (30 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 10% [v/v] glycerol, 5 mM sodium acetate, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT), and concentrated to ∼5 μM. Aliquots were flash frozen and stored at −80°C (<xref rid="pbio.1002083.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig.</xref>). Yield for WT and mutant Dhr1 was approximately 0.5 mg/liter.</p>

<title>Mass-Spectrometric Analysis of Dhr1<sub>K420A</sub> Particles</title>
<p>The yeast strain AJY3711 containing pAJ3090 (dhr1<sub>K420A</sub>-TEV-13myc LEU2 CEN) or pAJ3100 (dhr1<sub>K420A</sub> LEU2 CEN) was grown in SD Leu- containing 2% glucose for 6 h to deplete endogenouse Dhr1. Extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitation was carried out as described under “Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting” except Protein-G magnetic Beads (Pierce) were used. After binding for 2 h, beads were washed three times, resuspended in 100 μl of the extraction buffer, and TEV was added. Samples were incubated for 2 h at 16°C with gentle rotation. The supernatants were layered onto 100 μl sucrose cushions (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 100 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 15% sucrose) and centrifuged in a TLA100 rotor (Beckman) for 15 min at 70,000 rpm at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH8), 4% SDS. Samples were run into a 7% Mini-Protean TGX polyacrylamide gel (BioRad) for 5 min 100 V and stained with Imperial Protein stain (Thermo Scientific). The protein-containing band was diced and prepared for in-gel digestion essentially as in [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. After standard acetonitrile elution of digested peptides, the gel pieces were swelled in 6 M urea and eluted with 75% acetonitrile.

<p><bold>RNA substrates</bold>. All RNAs were as previously described [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and were purified by gel electrophoresis and refolded except for the ETS2 and 18S oligomers.</p>
<p><bold>ATPase assay</bold>. All the reactions were performed at RT. Dhr1 was pre-incubated in reaction buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 40 mM KCl, 2 mM DTT), with either U3 snoRNA or poly(A) for 2 min and in some reactions Imp3 was added (0.5 μM final concentration). Reactions were initiated by rapid addition and mixing of equimolar mixture of ATP and MgCl<sub>2</sub> with trace [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP. Final reaction conditions were 1 mM ATP, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 μM Dhr1, 60 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 40 mM KCl, 15 mM NaCl, 4% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mM sodium acetate and 2.4 mM DTT. For reaction with RNA, final concentration was either 60 μM U3 snoRNA or 4 mg/ml poly(A). Aliquots of the reaction mixtures were withdrawn at different time intervals and quenched by addition of 3 volumes of stop buffer (90% [v/v] formamide, 50 mM EDTA). To separate reaction products 0.8 μl of quenched sample was spotted on thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates, dried, and developed for 10 min with developing buffer (0.8 M acetic acid, 0.8 M LiCl). The TLC plate was then exposed on a Fuji imaging plate (BAS 2024), scanned by a Typhoon 9400 (Amersham Biosciences, GE), and quantified using Image Quant TL 7.0 (GE Healthcase Life Sciences). Normalized band intensity quantification was displayed using PRISM 6 (GraphPad, Inc.). Kinetic parameters of Dhr1 were determined by fitting the initial ATPase hydrolysis activity dependence on ATP concentration to the Michaelis–Menten equation using PRISM 6.</p>
<p><bold>Unwinding reactions</bold>. All unwinding reactions were performed at RT. Pre-steady state U3–18S reactions: to pre-form U3–18S duplex, U3 MINI was incubated with Imp3 for 10 min [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. After addition of <sup>32</sup>P-18S the reaction was further incubated for 30 min. The pre-formed U3–18S duplex was then incubated with Dhr1 for 5 min. Reactions were initiated by rapid addition and mixing of equimolar mixture of ATP and MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Final concentrations were 1 mM ATP, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 40 nM U3 MINI, ≤1.2 nM <sup>32</sup>P 18S, 1.2 μM Imp3, 0.5 μM Dhr1, 60 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 40 mM KCl, 15 mM NaCl, 4% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mM sodium acetate, 50 mM urea, 2.4 mM DTT, 0.2 mg/ml BSA and 0.8 units/μl RNasin. Aliquots were withdrawn at different times and quenched on ice. Ice was used instead of a stop solution containing SDS because this detergent removes Imp3, resulting in the release of 18S RNA.</p>
<p>Pre-steady state U3-ETS2 reactions: to form the U3-ETS2 duplex, U3 was first incubated with <sup>32</sup>P-ETS2 for 10 min followed by 10 min with buffer supplemented with MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The pre-formed U3-ETS2 duplex was incubated with Dhr1 for 5 min and reactions were initiated by rapid addition of 1 mM mixture of ATP and MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The final concentrations were 1 mM ATP, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 nM U3 snoRNA, ≤0.3 nM <sup>32</sup>P ETS2, 0.5 μM Dhr1, 25 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 40 mM KCl, 15 mM NaCl, 7% (v/v) glycerol, 2.4 mM DTT, 0.8 units/μl RNasin, and 0.2 mg/ml BSA. Reactions were sampled and quenched by addition of one-half volume of stop buffer (150 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 0.3% [w/v] SDS, and 150 mM EDTA).</p>
<p>All unwinding reactions in the strand exchange regime were performed at RT. Steady state U3-ETS2 reactions: the reaction procedure was essentially the same as for pre-steady state reactions described above, but with several differences. Instead of using U3 snoRNA, 5 μM U3 (1–76) was incubated with 0.5 μM ETS2 with trace <sup>32</sup>P-ETS2 to form the U3-ETS2 duplex. Activity under these conditions was not observed with full length U3 snoRNA, presumably owing to non-specific binding of Dhr1 to the 3′ region of U3 that includes the K-turn motifs in box B/C and box C/D. After pre-incubating the duplex with 0.1 μM Dhr1, reactions were initiated by rapid addition of 5 μM ETS2 and 6 mM mixture of ATP and MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The remaining buffer conditions are the same as those in the pre-steady reactions. The amount of duplex and single stranded RNA for both of the above helicase reactions were resolved by EMSAs [<xref rid="pbio.1002083.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
