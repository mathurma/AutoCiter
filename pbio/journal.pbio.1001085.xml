        <article-title>Will Ion Channels Help Coccolithophores Adapt to Ocean Acidification?</article-title>
      </related-article><abstract>
        <p>Marine coccolithophorid phytoplankton are major producers of biogenic calcite, playing a significant role in the global carbon cycle. Predicting the impacts of ocean acidification on coccolithophore calcification has received much recent attention and requires improved knowledge of cellular calcification mechanisms. Uniquely amongst calcifying organisms, coccolithophores produce calcified scales (coccoliths) in an intracellular compartment and secrete them to the cell surface, requiring large transcellular ionic fluxes to support calcification. In particular, intracellular calcite precipitation using HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> as the substrate generates equimolar quantities of H<sup>+</sup> that must be rapidly removed to prevent cytoplasmic acidification. We have used electrophysiological approaches to identify a plasma membrane voltage-gated H<sup>+</sup> conductance in <italic>Coccolithus pelagicus ssp braarudii</italic> with remarkably similar biophysical and functional properties to those found in metazoans. We show that both <italic>C. pelagicus</italic> and <italic>Emiliania huxleyi</italic> possess homologues of metazoan H<sub>v</sub>1 H<sup>+</sup> channels, which function as voltage-gated H<sup>+</sup> channels when expressed in heterologous systems. Homologues of the coccolithophore H<sup>+</sup> channels were also identified in a diversity of eukaryotes, suggesting a wide range of cellular roles for the H<sub>v</sub>1 class of proteins. Using single cell imaging, we demonstrate that the coccolithophore H<sup>+</sup> conductance mediates rapid H<sup>+</sup> efflux and plays an important role in pH homeostasis in calcifying cells. The results demonstrate a novel cellular role for voltage gated H<sup>+</sup> channels and provide mechanistic insight into biomineralisation by establishing a direct link between pH homeostasis and calcification. As the coccolithophore H<sup>+</sup> conductance is dependent on the trans-membrane H<sup>+</sup> electrochemical gradient, this mechanism will be directly impacted by, and may underlie adaptation to, ocean acidification. The presence of this H<sup>+</sup> efflux pathway suggests that there is no obligate use of H<sup>+</sup> derived from calcification for intracellular CO<sub>2</sub> generation. Furthermore, the presence of H<sub>v</sub>1 class ion channels in a wide range of extant eukaryote groups indicates they evolved in an early common ancestor.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The production of calcium carbonate structures by marine organisms has a major influence on the Earth's carbon cycle and is responsible for the eventual formation of sedimentary rocks such as chalk and limestone. The major contributors to marine calcification are the coccolithophores, a family of unicellular algae which surround themselves in calcified plates known as coccoliths. Unlike many other calcifying organisms, coccolithophores produce their calcified structures inside the cell, enabling precise control of this process. However, the other product resulting from the calcification reaction, H<sup>+</sup>, must be rapidly removed to maintain the pH inside the cell. In this study, we show that coccolithophores possess a voltage-gated H<sup>+</sup> channel, which removes H<sup>+</sup> rapidly from the cell during calcification and helps maintain a constant pH. We identify the gene encoding this H<sup>+</sup> channel, HVCN1, and find that it is a distant relative of those recently identified in animal cells, suggesting that H<sup>+</sup> channels may be present in many other types of eukaryote organism. As calcifying organisms may be affected by ocean acidification, the identification of an H<sup>+</sup> channel in coccolithophores gives us an important mechanistic understanding of cellular pH regulation during the calcification process, and may give insight into the response of coccolithophores to future changes in ocean pH.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Coccolithophores represent a pan-global group of oceanic phytoplankton, often forming massive monospecific blooms in oceanic waters. These unicellular eukaryote algae produce highly intricate calcium carbonate scales, known as coccoliths, and are the most numerous calcifying organisms in our oceans. Globally abundant species such as <italic>Emiliania huxleyi</italic> and <italic>Coccolithus pelagicus spp braarudii</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Saez1">[1]</xref> play fundamental roles in long-term carbon deposition, marine biogeochemical cycling, and atmospheric chemistry through their direct effects on surface ocean alkalinity and through ballasting of organic carbon fluxes to deeper waters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Rost1">[2]</xref>. Anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are predicted to have a significant impact on calcifying organisms, due to a decrease in both ocean surface water pH and the saturation state of calcium carbonate. However, there is currently significant debate regarding the effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and decreased ocean pH on coccolithophores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-IglesiasRodriguez1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Rost2">[7]</xref>, due in part to a lack of understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying calcification. Improved knowledge of coccolithophore cell biology is therefore necessary for both predicting the physiological consequences of ocean acidification and identifying experimental versus physiological sources of variability observed in experimental manipulations on this ubiquitous group of phytoplankton.</p>
      <p>In contrast to other major marine calcifyers such as corals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Allemand1">[8]</xref> and foraminifera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Bentov1">[9]</xref>, coccolithophores produce calcite scales (heterococcoliths) entirely within intracellular compartments (the coccolith vacuole, CV) which are secreted to the cell surface forming the external coccosphere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Taylor1">[10]</xref>. Intracellular calcification requires large sustained fluxes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and inorganic carbon (C<sub>i</sub>) to the coccolith vacuole. The bulk of experimental work supports HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> as the primary C<sub>i</sub> species transported into the cell to sustain calcification, resulting in 1 mole of H<sup>+</sup> generated for every 1 mole of calcite precipitated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Brownlee1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Paasche1">[12]</xref>. Our calculations, based on published calcification rates, indicate that H<sup>+</sup> production during calcification without H<sup>+</sup> removal or consumption will cause rapid cytoplasmic acidification of ∼0.3 pH min<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001085.s008">Table S1</xref>). Metabolic pH balance may arise through photosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Anning1">[13]</xref>, though the degree to which this occurs has been questioned by studies that indicate no mechanistic dependence of photosynthesis on calcification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Herfort1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Leonardos1">[15]</xref>. It follows that in the absence of rapid metabolic H<sup>+</sup> consumption, sequestration, or removal, the cytosol of calcifying coccolithophore cells would be subject to significant acidosis. Our data show that a plasma membrane voltage-activated H<sup>+</sup> channel, novel for photosynthetic organisms, plays a crucial role in short-term cellular pH homeostasis which is in turn required for maintenance of calcification.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>In order to understand the membrane transport processes which underlie the extraordinary process of intracellular calcification in coccolithophores, we applied the patch clamp technique following removal of the external calcite coccolith scales by brief treatment with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator ethyleneglycol-O, O'-bis(2-aminoethyl)-N, N, N', N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001085.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Patch clamp recordings revealed a slowly activating plasma membrane ion current in <italic>C. pelagicus</italic> in response to depolarisations more positive than the equilibrium potential for H<sup>+</sup> (E<sub>H</sub><sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001085-g001">Figures 1A,B</xref>). Tail current analysis demonstrated a reversal potential (E<sub>rev</sub>) very positive of E<sub>K</sub><sup>+</sup> and E<sub>Cl</sub><sup>−</sup>, and closest to E<sub>H</sub><sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001085-g001">Figures 1C,D</xref>). A strong Nernstian relationship between E<sub>rev</sub> and transmembrane pH gradient (ΔpH) in the presence of various bath (pH<sub>ο</sub> 6.5–8.0) solutions showed that the current is selective for H<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001085-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). The outward current was depressed and voltage activation shifted more positive in response to decreased pH<sub>ο</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001085-g001">Figure 1E,F</xref>), a characteristic of animal H<sup>+</sup> currents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Decoursey1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-DeCoursey1">[17]</xref>. Reducing pH<sub>i</sub> from 7.5 to 6.5 (with pH<sub>o</sub> held at 8.0) resulted in a greater outward current amplitude at all membrane potentials (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001085.s002">Figure S2</xref>), although it was not possible to determine accurately the activation potential of the H<sup>+</sup> current at pH<sub>i</sub> 6.5 as E<sub>H</sub><sup>+</sup> was too close to the activation potential for the inward Cl<sup>−</sup> current <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Taylor2">[18]</xref>.</p>

To confirm that K<sup>+</sup> or Cl<sup>−</sup> was not contributing significantly to the outward current, tail current analysis was performed using a range of pipette solutions. In all cases the reversal potentials of <italic>C. pelagicus</italic> outward currents were consistently close to E<sub>H</sub><sup>+</sup> regardless of large changes in E<sub>K</sub><sup>+</sup> or E<sub>Cl</sub><sup>−</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001085-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The small deviation observed from E<sub>H</sub><sup>+</sup> may be due to incomplete pH buffering by the pipette solution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-DeCoursey2">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-DeCoursey3">[22]</xref> or a small contribution from an additional unidentified conductance. Application of the Goldman, Hodgkin, Katz equation for relative permeabilities of the ions in the pipette solutions (H<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and Cl<sup>−</sup>) from the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001085-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001085-g002">2</xref> gives permeability ratios in excess of 10<sup>6</sup> for gH<sup>+</sup> relative to K<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>−</sup>. The extremely high selectivity for H<sup>+</sup> is consistent with other reported values for H<sup>+</sup> channels (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Decoursey1">[16]</xref>). The observed H<sup>+</sup> current magnitudes in <italic>C. pelagicus</italic> are comparable to the large currents found in activated granulocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-DeCoursey2">[21]</xref> and more than adequate to dissipate calcification associated H<sup>+</sup> production in the absence of metabolic consumption or sequestration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001085.s008">Table S1</xref>). While a range of H<sup>+</sup> transport and homeostatic mechanisms are likely to contribute to pH<sub>i</sub> regulation, the H<sup>+</sup> efflux channel identified here possesses the transport capacity and kinetics that would enable rapid short-term regulation of potentially large pH<sub>i</sub> fluctuations.</p>

For each recording condition, outward currents were activated by a depolarising voltage pulse to +110 mV and tail currents subsequently recorded at a range of voltages. The upper panels show representative tail current traces for (A) 80 mM KCl, (B) 400 KCl, and (C) 200 K-glutamate pipette solutions. Dotted lines represent zero current and voltages for representative traces are indicated. The initial activated outward currents are truncated to emphasise the tail currents. Lower plots illustrate average tail current-voltage plots for a minimum of 4 cells for each condition (±SE). Arrows indicate the predicted reversal potential for each of the major ions. The tail current reversal for the <italic>C. pelagicus</italic> outward currents are consistently close to E<sub>H</sub><sup>+</sup> regardless of E<sub>Cl</sub><sup>−</sup> and E<sub>K</sub><sup>+</sup>, suggesting whole cell currents activated by depolarisation are primarily carried by H<sup>+</sup> ions in calcifying cells. The slightly positive reversal indicated may be due in part to the weakly buffered pipette solution used in these experiments or because of a minor contribution by endogenous cation currents carried by Mg<sup>2+</sup> Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Na<sup>+</sup> (predicted equilibrium potentials of +26, +182, and &gt; +300 mV for each ion, respectively).</p>

The coccolithophore sequences exhibit a weak overall similarity to mammalian H<sub>v</sub>1 channels at the amino acid level (EhH<sub>v</sub>1 has 19% identity, 33% similarity to human H<sub>v</sub>1), but have similar organisation including four predicted transmembrane domains and conserved features including the critical voltage sensing arginine residues in transmembrane domain S4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001085-g003">Figure 3A–C</xref>). Notable differences are the non-conservation of histidine residues required for Zn<sup>2+</sup> inhibition in mammalian H<sub>v</sub>1 channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Ramsey1">[19]</xref> and extension of the putative extracellular loop between the S1 and S2 domains.

          <p>(A) Multiple sequence alignment of animal and coccolithophore H<sub>v</sub>1 proteins. The multiple sequence alignment indicates transmembrane residues conserved between animal and coccolithophore H<sub>v</sub>1 proteins. Shading indicates residues that are identical or similar in 80% of the sequences (BLOSUM62 matrix), and boxes represent predicted transmembrane domains in human H<sub>v</sub>1. The three arginine residues in S4 required for voltage sensing are conserved (numbers below alignment correspond to R205, R208, and R211 in human H<sub>v</sub>1). Many of the acidic residues (aspartate and glutamate) appear conserved (D112, E119, D123, E153, D174), although Asp185 is replaced by glutamate and Glu171 is not conserved. Several of these acidic residues are conserved amongst voltage sensor domain proteins and may function in voltage sensing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Ramsey2">[29]</xref>. In contrast, the other basic residues (lysine) are not conserved in coccolithophores (K125, K157, K169, K221). Polar serine residues (S143, S181) are conserved in <italic>E. huxleyi</italic>, although Ser181 is replaced by alanine in <italic>C. pelagicus</italic>. Similar sequences identified in the diatoms <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> and <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> are also shown in the alignment.

Shading indicates identical residues in 5 out of 10 sequences displayed. In this analysis the only conserved residues that are exclusive to H<sub>v</sub>1 proteins correspond to human H<sub>v</sub>1 residues D112, D123, and S143.

      <p>As the external histidine residues associated with Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding in human H<sub>v</sub>1 (H140, H193) are not conserved in coccolithophore H<sub>v</sub>1 proteins, we hypothesised that Zn<sup>2+</sup> must bind alternative residues in order to inhibit the H<sup>+</sup> conductances in these channels. We identified two histidine residues in the predicted S1–S2 extracellular loop region which are completely conserved across the available coccolithophore and diatom H<sub>v</sub>1 sequences and used site-directed mutagenesis of EhH<sub>v</sub>1 to examine whether they contributed to inhibition by Zn<sup>2+</sup>. Replacement of either histidine residue (H197 or H203) with an alanine residue resulted in a very substantial reduction in the extent of inhibition induced by 500 µM Zn<sup>2+</sup> (from 84% to 27% or 28%, respectively, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001085.s004">Figure S4</xref>), suggesting that whilst the individual histidine residues concerned are not conserved between animal and algal H<sub>v</sub>1 proteins, the mechanism of inhibition by Zn<sup>2+</sup> may be similar. We conclude that coccolithophores express functional homologues of mammalian voltage gated H<sup>+</sup> channels which exhibit highly similar biophysical properties to the outward H<sup>+</sup> conductance observed in <italic>C. pelagicus</italic>, strongly suggesting that this conductance is generated by CpH<sub>v</sub>1.</p>
      <p>As the biophysical characteristics of the outward conductance in <italic>C. pelagicus</italic> and H<sub>v</sub>1 channel homologues are consistent with those described for animal H<sub>v</sub>1 channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-DeCoursey1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Ramsey1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-DeCoursey2">[21]</xref>, we hypothesized a role in rapid H<sup>+</sup> efflux during pH homeostasis. Using simultaneous patch clamp and pH imaging, we verified that direct activation of the <italic>C. pelagicus</italic> H<sup>+</sup> current induced significant changes in cytoplasmic pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001085-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). The application of a 10 s depolarization more positive of E<sub>H</sub><sup>+</sup> activated the H<sup>+</sup> current and induced significant reversible cytoplasmic alkalinisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001085-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). The mean increases in pH<sub>i</sub> following voltage steps from −50 mV to +20 or +70 mV were 0.22 (±0.04 SE) and 0.36 (±0.04 SE, <italic>n</italic> = 7) pH units, respectively. These results are consistent with H<sup>+</sup> efflux through a voltage-sensitive conductance as described in animal systems (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-DeCoursey2">[21]</xref>). Following the depolarising pulses, pH<sub>i</sub> recovered approximately exponentially over 30–60 s, which is faster but not substantially different from recovery times reported in animal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Kapus1">[24]</xref>. The faster pH recovery reported here may reflect a number of factors, including the rate of diffusion of buffer from the patch electrode and a significantly lower relative cytoplasmic volume of coccolithophore cells which contain large chloroplasts, vacuoles, and coccolith vacuole. Hyperpolarizing pulses that activate a large inward Cl<sup>-</sup> current <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Taylor2">[18]</xref> caused no significant pH<sub>i</sub> change (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001085.s005">Figure S5</xref>).

      <p>In order to understand how the outward H<sup>+</sup> current operates to regulate cytoplasmic pH, we determined the resting membrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>) in <italic>C. pelagicus</italic>. Using sharp microelectrodes, V<sub>m</sub> of intact <italic>C. pelagicus</italic> cells was measured at −45.7 mV (±4.8 SE, <italic>n</italic> = 10) in ASW at pH<sub>o</sub> 8.0. At pH<sub>o</sub> 6.5 V<sub>m</sub> depolarised to −29.0 mV (±3.1 SE, <italic>n</italic> = 10). The measured V<sub>m</sub> at pH<sub>o</sub> 8.0 is very close to E<sub>H</sub><sup>+</sup> (−48 mV, assuming a resting pH<sub>i</sub> of 7.2 typical of eukaryote cells), suggesting that the H<sup>+</sup> conductance will be close to its activation potential under normal conditions.</p>
      <p>In a model whereby channel-mediated H<sup>+</sup> efflux regulates pH<sub>i</sub>, treatments that inhibit the H<sup>+</sup> current may cause cytosolic acidification in calcifying cells. Accordingly, the vast majority of <italic>C. pelagicus</italic> cells (85%, <italic>n</italic> = 44, 7 independent experiments) showed a strong dependence of pH<sub>i</sub> upon pH<sub>o</sub>, exhibiting reversible acidification when external pH was rapidly shifted from pH 8.0 to pH 6.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001085-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). This is consistent with the sensitivity of the H<sup>+</sup> conductance to the H<sup>+</sup> electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane. The direct effect of pH<sub>o</sub> on pH<sub>i</sub> also implies that <italic>C. pelagicus</italic> is not able to maintain intracellular pH in the face of transient shifts in pH<sub>o</sub>, which is consistent with evolution in the open ocean where pH is relatively stable.</p>
      <p>To address the requirement for the H<sup>+</sup> conductance during calcification, we examined the effect of Zn<sup>2+</sup> on pH<sub>i</sub> in actively calcifying cells. Treatment with 30 µM free Zn<sup>2+</sup> for 2.5 min caused an immediate decrease in cytosolic pH in calcifying cells (mean ΔpH  =  −0.13±0.02 SE, <italic>n</italic> = 62, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001085-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Conversely, in cells where calcification was inhibited by incubation in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free artificial seawater <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Leonardos1">[15]</xref> Zn<sup>2+</sup> did not induce a large decrease in pH<sub>i</sub> (mean ΔpH  =  −0.02±0.02 SE, <italic>n</italic> = 29, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001085-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). The inward Cl<sup>−</sup> rectifier is also sensitive to Zn<sup>2+</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Taylor2">[18]</xref> but is unlikely to influence the observed acidification as inhibition of this conductance would act to depolarise V<sub>m</sub> resulting in cytoplasmic alkalinisation. We conclude that the plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup> conductance plays an important role in release of H<sup>+</sup> from the cytosol in actively calcifying cells.</p>
      <p>To address further the role of pH<sub>i</sub> homeostasis during calcification, we manipulated pH<sub>i</sub> whilst measuring calcification rates with a non-invasive in vivo method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001085-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001085.s006">Figure S6</xref>). A reversible decrease in pH<sub>i</sub> induced by a brief reduction in extracellular pH<sub>o</sub> (10 min at pH<sub>o</sub> 6.5, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001085.s007">Figure S7</xref>) caused a 69.0% ± 11.4% inhibition of calcification rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001085-g006">Figure 6A,B</xref>). As changes in pH<sub>o</sub> also affect extracellular C<sub>i</sub> speciation, we used a pulse of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (10 mM, 10 min, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001085.s007">Figure S7</xref>) to induce intracellular acidification while maintaining constant pH<sub>o</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Roos1">[27]</xref>. This resulted in a 67.0% ± 8.7% inhibition of calcification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001085-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Inhibition of calcification continued for up to 2 h post-treatment, suggesting that down-regulation of the calcification machinery operates in response to disruption of pH<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001085-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Whilst indirect effects of pH<sub>o</sub> and NH<sub>4</sub>Cl treatments may contribute to the inhibition of calcification, the similar effects of different treatments imply a direct relationship between pH<sub>i</sub> homeostasis and calcification. The sensitivity of calcification to fluctuations in pH<sub>i</sub> highlights the requirement for efficient regulation of pH<sub>i</sub>, which is in turn dependent on the voltage-gated H<sup>+</sup> conductance, and strongly supports a role for the coccolithophore H<sub>v</sub> channels as a key component in the calcification process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001085-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

          <p>The scheme illustrates the requirement for efficient H<sup>+</sup> efflux pathways in coccolithophores as a result of intracellular calcification. Mature coccoliths are arranged on the extracellular surface, surrounding the cell to form a coccosphere (A). However, coccolith formation occurs within the intracellular Golgi-derived coccolith vacuole. Calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) precipitation requires the production of carbonate (CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup>) from bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>) and results in the net production of H<sup>+</sup> (B). H<sup>+</sup> must be rapidly removed from the coccolith vacuole in order to maintain a suitable pH for CaCO<sub>3</sub> precipitation. Once in the cytosol (C), some H<sup>+</sup> may potentially be utilised by photosynthesis in the production of CO<sub>2</sub> from HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, however H<sup>+</sup> efflux provides an efficient mechanism to prevent cytosolic acidosis during fluctuations in photosynthetic rate. At normal seawater pH 8.2, pH<sub>i</sub> of 7.2, and V<sub>m</sub> ∼−46 mV maintained by a Cl<sup>–</sup> inward rectifier (D) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Taylor2">[18]</xref>, a drop in pH<sub>i</sub> alone or in combination with membrane depolarisation would result in a net outward proton motive force across the plasma membrane. This enables passive H<sup>+</sup> efflux via a plasma membrane localised H<sup>+</sup> channel (E), providing a rapid mechanism for maintaining constant intracellular pH. Other membrane transporters (yet to be characterised) are likely involved in longer term maintenance of cytoplasmic pH (F). Nevertheless, the pH- and voltage-sensitive gating mechanism of the H<sup>+</sup> channel coupled to its high transport capacity suggests it plays a major role in the modulation of intracellular pH in coccolithophores. Patch clamp studies indicate that Cl<sup>–</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> are the dominant transmembrane conductances in coccolithophores.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In combination with the emerging genomic information, our data provide clear evidence for physiological features that are novel for photosynthetic eukaryotes. <italic>C. pelagicus</italic> expresses a homologue of animal voltage-gated H<sup>+</sup> channels and exhibits an H<sup>+</sup>-selective conductance that is activated by depolarization and dependent upon the H<sup>+</sup> electrochemical gradient. As with metazoan H<sup>+</sup> channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-DeCoursey1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-DeCoursey4">[28]</xref>, the properties of the <italic>C. pelagicus</italic> H<sup>+</sup> conductance appear ideally suited to mediating rapid H<sup>+</sup> efflux during metabolic acidosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-DeCoursey4">[28]</xref>. Our data also support a functional link between the coccolithophore H<sup>+</sup> conductance and sustained intracellular calcification via regulation of pH<sub>i</sub>. Our electrophysiological and molecular analyses lead us to propose the following model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001085-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Calcification in coccolithophores is likely to generate H<sup>+</sup> at a relatively constant rate, whereas the rates of H<sup>+</sup> consumption by metabolic processes (e.g., photosynthesis) are likely to fluctuate rapidly (e.g., with changes in light intensity). The net H<sup>+</sup> load resulting from calcification will therefore vary constantly. In calcifying coccolithophores, two dominant conductances are expressed in the plasma membrane: an inward Cl<sup>−</sup> rectifier activated by hyperpolarisation and dependent upon E<sub>Cl</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Taylor2">[18]</xref> and an outward H<sup>+</sup> conductance activated by depolarisation and dependent upon E<sub>H</sub><sup>+</sup> (this study). Excursions of V<sub>m</sub> more negative of resting V<sub>m</sub> will have no effect on pH<sub>i</sub> because only the inward Cl<sup>−</sup> current is activated (as evidenced in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001085.s005">Figure S5</xref>) and those positive of E<sub>H</sub><sup>+</sup> will induce outward H<sup>+</sup> flow and changes in pH<sub>i</sub> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001085-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Our calculations suggest that the H<sup>+</sup> conductance will be very close to its activation potential under normal conditions (i.e., at pH<sub>o</sub> 8.0 and pH<sub>i</sub> 7.2, V<sub>m</sub> is −46 mV and E<sub>H</sub><sup>+</sup> is −48 mV). Cytoplasmic acidification would also activate H<sup>+</sup> efflux by shifting E<sub>H</sub><sup>+</sup> more negative (i.e., independent of any change in V<sub>m</sub>). Therefore a calcifying cell in which H<sup>+</sup> production is not balanced by metabolic H<sup>+</sup> consumption will generate an acid load on the cytosol which will trigger activation of the H<sup>+</sup> outward current. Combined depolarisation of V<sub>m</sub> and acidification would act synergistically to induce potentially rapid H<sup>+</sup> efflux and subsequent membrane hyperpolarization. This efflux may be sustained by activation of the sensitive inward Cl<sup>−</sup> current (Cl<sup>−</sup> efflux) at more negative V<sub>m</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Taylor2">[18]</xref>, which will balance the charge and facilitate maintenance of H<sup>+</sup> removal during calcification. Thus, we propose that outward rectifying H<sub>v</sub>1 channels and inward rectifying Cl<sup>−</sup> channels work together to sustain H<sup>+</sup> efflux.</p>
      <p>H<sub>v</sub>1 homologues are not universally present in marine algae, being absent from the genomes of prasinophytes (both <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> and <italic>Micromonas</italic>) and the brown macroalga, <italic>Ectocarpus siliculosus</italic>, suggesting that these channels play specialised cellular roles in coccolithophores and diatoms. Interestingly, a protein exhibiting weak similarity to EhH<sub>v</sub>1 is also present in the genomes of the moss <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> and other land plants, although in these predicted proteins a conserved arginine in S4 (corresponding to human R205) is replaced by a threonine residue. Moreover, a plasma membrane voltage-gated H<sup>+</sup> conductance has not been described in land plants, indicating that such homologues play distinctly different functional roles in these organisms.</p>
      <p>Comparative studies of H<sub>v</sub>1 proteins from such divergent eukaryote taxa have the potential to provide critical insight into the conserved features required for the novel mechanisms of H<sup>+</sup> conductance within this group of ion channels (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001085-g003">Figure 3A–C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-DeCoursey1">[17]</xref>. As H<sub>v</sub>1 proteins lack a classic pore, the mechanism of H<sup>+</sup> permeation through H<sub>v</sub>1 proteins is not fully understood. Ionisable residues in the transmembrane domains may contribute to H<sup>+</sup> conduction via a hydrogen bonded chain mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-DeCoursey1">[17]</xref>, although recent evidence from a combined mutagenesis and structural modelling approach suggests that H<sup>+</sup> may be conducted via an internal water wire, rather than the ionisable side chains of transmembrane residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Ramsey2">[29]</xref>. Analysis of the transmembrane domains of coccolithophore H<sub>v</sub>1 proteins indicates that the acidic residues are broadly conserved, along with the arginine residues associated with voltage gating in S4.</p>
      <p>Physiological studies so far have not allowed a clear distinction between HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> and direct CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup> uptake for calcification. However, this knowledge is critical for understanding the impacts of reduced ocean surface pH on calcification, because predicted changes in ocean chemistry will bring about significant reductions in ocean surface [CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup>] <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Feely1">[30]</xref>. The presence of an effective mechanism to dissipate excess H<sup>+</sup> is consistent with HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> as the primary seawater C<sub>i</sub> substrate for calcification and suggests there is no obligate requirement for H<sup>+</sup> derived from calcification to be utilized for intracellular CO<sub>2</sub> generation.</p>
      <p>The effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub>/decreased seawater pH on coccolithophores vary according to species, strain, and experimental conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-IglesiasRodriguez1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Muller1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Langer2">[31]</xref>. Understandably, much attention has been paid to the effects of a decrease in calcite saturation on the dissolution of extracellular coccoliths. However, our studies identify a mechanism through which predicted ocean pH scenarios <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Caldeira1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Sabine1">[33]</xref> may also have a direct impact on the intracellular production of coccoliths <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Langer1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Muller1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Riebesell2">[34]</xref> via the pH-dependent properties of the plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup> channel. An understanding of the combined effects of ocean acidification on both calcite saturation and intracellular pH homeostasis is likely to be critical for unravelling the factors underlying the variation seen in laboratory studies of coccolithophore responses to ocean acidification. Based upon molecular phylogenetic evidence, coccolithophores evolved ∼250 MYA, with the earliest heterococcolith fossils dating between 204 and 217 MYA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Bown1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-deVargas1">[36]</xref>. Over this time period the oceans have remained supersaturated with regard to calcite, although surface ocean pH likely varied within the range of pH 7.6–8.2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001085-Ridgwell1">[37]</xref>, suggesting ancestral coccolithophores have previously experienced and survived in significantly lower ocean pH. The gating dependence of the H<sup>+</sup> current on membrane ΔpH implies that its activity may be negatively impacted by reduced seawater pH. The expression and biophysical properties of the coccolithophore H<sup>+</sup> conductance are likely to be important factors in determining how coccolithophores may themselves respond to predicted future changes in ocean pH. The sensitivity of calcification to transient changes in cytoplasmic pH is also evident from our results. This suggests an additional level of control of calcification whereby the calcification machinery may shut down under conditions where rapid control of cytoplasmic pH is compromised, relieving the cell of additional H<sup>+</sup> load.</p>
      <p>Whilst the H<sup>+</sup> conductance is strictly dependent on the transmembrane H<sup>+</sup> gradient, the gating properties of the H<sup>+</sup> conductance and the magnitude of H<sup>+</sup> flux described here are also under tight control of membrane potential. This may impart a degree of tolerance and physiological plasticity to the calcification process since effects of decreased pH<sub>o</sub> on H<sup>+</sup> efflux may be countered by slight adjustments of membrane voltage to maintain H<sup>+</sup> efflux.</p>

Changes in intracellular pH were monitored by the ratio of the fluorescence emission at 525±25 nm when excited sequentially with 488 and 458 nm (LSM 510 confocal microscope, Zeiss, Jena, Germany). For each excitation wavelength, the average fluorescence intensity was determined for a region of interest encompassing the whole cell and used to calculate the ratio. Background fluorescence was minimal and was not subtracted. In patch clamp experiments, pH was calibrated using mean steady state fluorescence ratio (F<sub>488</sub>/F<sub>458</sub>) at pH<sub>i</sub> 7.5 and pH<sub>i</sub> 6.5 (<italic>n</italic> = 10 and <italic>n</italic> = 5, respectively).

Predicted external histidine residues that are conserved across algal H<sub>v</sub>1 proteins were mutated in EhH<sub>v</sub>1-GFP to examine whether these residues played a role in the inhibition of the H<sup>+</sup> conductance by Zn<sup>2+</sup>. <italic>EhHVCN1-GFP</italic> (control), <italic>H197A</italic>, and <italic>H203A</italic> were expressed in HEK293 cells and currents were recorded in response to a voltage step from −60 mV to 100 mV. 500 µM Zn<sup>2+</sup> was added to the external solution. The pipette solution contained (in mM) NMDG 65, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 3, EGTA 1, and HEPES 150 glucose 70, pH 7.0 (P4, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001085.s009">Table S2</xref>), and the bath solution contained in (mM) NMDG 75, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 3, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1.0, glucose 160, and HEPES 100, pH 7.8 (E4, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001085.s009">Table S2</xref>).</p>

          <p>Hyperpolarisation of the <italic>C. pelagicus</italic> plasma membrane does not induce an increase in pH<sub>i</sub>. Simultaneous patch clamp and pH imaging was performed in order to examine the effect of hyperpolarisation on pH<sub>i</sub>. Decalcified cells were loaded via the patch pipette with 300 µM BCECF free acid. A voltage step to −90 mV or −110 mV from a holding potential of −50 mV does not result in a change in pH<sub>i</sub>. Hyperpolarisation therefore activates a significant inward current (the Cl<sup>−</sup> inward rectifier), but this current does not influence pH<sub>i</sub>. A representative of three replicate experiments is shown. Internal and external solutions are as used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001085-g005">Figure 5A</xref> (P1b, E1).</p>

          <p>Determination of in vivo calcification rate by cross-polarized light microscopy. The figure shows the increase in cross-polarized light intensity monitored as decalcified cells produce coccoliths and the resultant calcite accumulates in the field of view. Stills from the time-lapse video illustrate the increase in grey-scale intensity during the 20 h incubation. Initial cross-polarised light intensity level at the start of the plot is due to the presence of internal coccoliths which are not removed by the decalcification protocol. The birefringence of calcite enables real time imaging of coccolith production. Birefringence in initial images is due to the presence of internal coccoliths which are not removed by the decalcification protocol. Time-lapse images were captured at a frame rate of 20 images h<sup>−1</sup>. Scale bar, 100 µm.</p>
