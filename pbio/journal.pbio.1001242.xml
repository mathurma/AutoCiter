        <p>Characterization of a large family of outer membrane channels from gram-negative bacteria suggest how they can thrive in nutrient-poor environments and how channel inactivation can contribute to antibiotic resistance.</p>

        <p>Many Gram-negative bacteria, including human pathogens such as <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, do not have large-channel porins. This results in an outer membrane (OM) that is highly impermeable to small polar molecules, making the bacteria intrinsically resistant towards many antibiotics. In such microorganisms, the majority of small molecules are taken up by members of the OprD outer membrane protein family. Here we show that OprD channels require a carboxyl group in the substrate for efficient transport, and based on this we have renamed the family Occ, for <underline>o</underline>uter membrane <underline>c</underline>arboxylate <underline>c</underline>hannels. We further show that Occ channels can be divided into two subfamilies, based on their very different substrate specificities. Our results rationalize how certain bacteria can efficiently take up a variety of substrates under nutrient-poor conditions without compromising membrane permeability. In addition, they explain how channel inactivation in response to antibiotics can cause resistance but does not lead to decreased fitness.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Emerging antibiotic resistance in the treatment of infectious disease is an increasing problem that urgently requires new drug development. In Gram-negative bacteria, the outer membrane (OM) prevents permeation of small molecules, including antibiotics. A family of channel-forming proteins, called OprD proteins, are present in the OM to enable uptake of nutrients required for growth and cellular function. Since these channels also transport antibiotics, understanding how molecules are recognized and transported by these proteins should enable the design of more effective antibiotics. Here, we have characterized by biophysical and biochemical methods the structures and substrate-specificities of nine members of the OprD channel family of a common multidrug-resistant pathogen, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. Because we demonstrate that efficient passage through these channels requires the presence of a carboxyl group in the substrate, we renamed this channel family <underline>o</underline>uter membrane <underline>c</underline>arboxylate <underline>c</underline>hannels, or Occ. This broad substrate specificity suggests that such efficient transport allows bacteria to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. We also show markedly varied substrate specificities among the family members, especially for antibiotics, suggesting that mutation of a single channel can result in antibiotic resistance. These results provide the framework for studying the interaction of antibiotics with OM uptake channels, which will facilitate the development of more permeable and thus effective drugs.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>To acquire water-soluble, low-molecular-weight compounds that are required for cell growth and function, Gram-negative bacteria contain uptake channels within the outer membrane (OM). These channels mediate uptake by passive diffusion along a concentration gradient that is present across the OM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Nikaido1">[1]</xref>. Two classes of channels can be distinguished, which differ in the way they interact with substrates. The non-specific channels or porins (e.g., <italic>E. coli</italic> OmpF and OmpC) do not bind their substrates with measurable affinities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Nikaido1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Nikaido2">[2]</xref>. Hence, such channels are thought to be most effective when the external substrate concentrations are high. Moreover, porins have rather large pores, allowing the passage of any polar compound below a certain size limit (∼600 Da for OmpC/F), including many antibiotics.</p>
      <p>The other class of OM diffusion channels consists of substrate-specific channels. As the name implies, these channels have binding sites for their substrates and are therefore substrate specific. Substrate-specific channels occur in all Gram-negative bacteria and are dedicated to the uptake of different classes of substrates: examples in <italic>E. coli</italic> are the sugar channel LamB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Dutzler1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Luckey1">[4]</xref> and the nucleoside channel Tsx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Benz1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Ye1">[7]</xref>. Functionally, the binding of substrates by these channels may render them effective when the external substrate concentrations are low. Hence, they are especially prevalent in bacteria that thrive in nutrient-poor environments, such as pseudomonads. In fact, pseudomonads and related bacteria do not have large-channel porins and rely on substrate-specific channels for the acquisition of small water-soluble compounds. As a consequence, the OM of such bacteria is approximately two orders of magnitude less permeable than that of porin-containing bacteria such as <italic>E. coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Yoshimura1">[8]</xref>. The intrinsic low permeability of the OM poses an obvious and severe problem for the treatment of infections mediated by such organisms, most notably <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>. These organisms are notoriously resistant to many antibiotics and are responsible for many hospital-acquired infections within the United States <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Hancock1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Peleg1">[11]</xref>. The intrinsic antibiotic resistance can be compounded by acquired resistance, which includes inactivation of OM channels that mediate antibiotics uptake.</p>
      <p><italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> has substrate-specific OM channels dedicated to the uptake of, e.g., phosphate (OprP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Benz2">[12]</xref>) and sugars (OprB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Trias1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Hancock2">[14]</xref>). However, most of the water-soluble small molecules are thought to be taken up by members of the <underline>O</underline>uter membrane <underline>c</underline>arboxylic acid <underline>c</underline>hannel (Occ) family (formerly OprD family; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s019">Text S1</xref> for Supporting Discussion and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s016">1</xref>). This family is notable for the presence of many members in pseudomonads and related bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Stover1">[15]</xref>. The 19 family members present in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and the five family members in <italic>A. baumannii</italic> have 35%–45% pairwise identity. Phylogenetic analysis suggests a division into OccD (formerly OprD) and OccK (formerly OpdK) subfamilies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Tamber1">[16]</xref>. The OccD1 (OprD) channel is the archetype of the entire family and is thought to be a channel for basic amino acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Trias2">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Tamber2">[18]</xref>. In addition, OccD1 has attracted much interest since it appears to serve as the entry portal for carbapenem β-lactam antibiotics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Huang1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Trias3">[20]</xref>, one of the few classes of antibiotics that are effective against <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Based on indirect approaches, putative substrate specificities of several additional OccD and OccK subfamily members have been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Tamber1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Tamber2">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Huang2">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Tamber3">[22]</xref>. Experimental evidence for this is, however, lacking.</p>
      <p>X-ray crystal structures of OccD1 and OccK1 have previously been determined at medium resolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Biswas1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Biswas2">[24]</xref>. Both proteins form monomeric 18-stranded barrels with a central channel that is constricted by two extracellular loops. A striking feature in both structures is the presence of a “basic ladder,” a row of arginine and lysine residues that leads to and away from the constriction, and which was hypothesized to interact with a substrate carboxyl group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Biswas1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Moraes1">[25]</xref>. These structures allowed us to begin to understand the transport mechanism of Occ family members and the basis for their putative substrate specificity.</p>
      <p>In order to elucidate the substrate preferences and putative specificities of Occ channels, we report here the characterization of a number of Occ channels by a multidisciplinary approach involving X-ray crystallography, electrophysiology, and in vitro transport experiments. Together, the data establish that the Occ family consists of carboxylate transport channels with markedly varied substrate specificities, especially for antibiotics. Our results not only provide insight into bacterial physiology, but also form a starting point for understanding the interactions of antibiotics with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> OM channels, which should lead to the rational design of novel compounds with superior permeation properties.</p>

        <title>Crystal Structures of Occ Family Members Show Large Variations in Pore Sizes</title>
        <p>To determine if the phylogenetic subdivision <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Tamber1">[16]</xref> of Occ proteins exists at the structural level, we determined X-ray crystal structures for seven Occ family members (OccD2, OccD3, and OccK2–K6; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s017">Table S2</xref>). In addition to these new structures, we obtained much higher resolution data and more complete structures for OccD1 (formerly OprD; 2.15 Å versus 2.9 Å previously) and OccK1 (formerly OpdK; 1.65 Å versus 2.8 Å previously). All channels crystallize as monomers. As expected from pairwise sequence identities that range from 35%–50%, the Occ proteins share a similar architecture, with a slightly off-center constriction formed by the inward-folded extracellular loops L3 and L7 and residues in the barrel wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001242-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Biswas1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Biswas2">[24]</xref>. A notable exception to the constriction architecture is OccD3 (formerly OpdP). This channel has an N-terminal extension of 25–30 residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s001">Figure S1</xref>), and this extension is responsible for constricting an otherwise large-diameter pore within the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

        <p>A comparison of the crystal structures suggests that the division into the OccD and OccK subfamilies occurs on a structural level as well; the OccD subfamily members of which structures were determined have much smaller pores than those of the OccK subfamily. In fact, OccD2 (formerly OpdC) is closed in the crystal structure. OccD1 does have a very small pore, which is not visible in the orientation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001242-g001">Figure 1</xref> since it is obstructed by part of an approximately eight-residue-long insertion in loop L7 (Arg287-Gly294; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s002">Figure S2</xref>). This L7 insertion is present only in a few OccD subfamily members and absent in the OccK subfamily (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s001">Figure S1</xref>). An abundance of small residues (<sup>287</sup>RNGSGAGG<sup>294</sup> in OccD1) makes the L7 segment likely to be flexible. Indeed, residues 287–292 were not visible in the original crystal structure of OccD1 (PDB ID: 2ODJ), and the remainder had a different conformation compared to the current structure. As a result, the new OccD1 structure has a smaller pore than previously observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>The pore sizes of all OccK subfamily members for which structures were determined are substantially larger than those of the OccD1–3 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001242-g001">Figure 1</xref>), suggesting that the OccD and OccK subfamilies have different substrate specificities. As a comparison, the OccK1 pore is slightly larger in diameter than that of <italic>E. coli</italic> LamB, which is a channel specific for sugars <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Dutzler1">[3]</xref>. The pores of the proteins within the OccK subfamily show a considerable variation in size and shape, suggesting differences in substrate preferences within subfamilies as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001242-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s003">Figure S3</xref>). This notion is borne out by the fact that the sequence conservation among the residues that line the pore constriction is very low, with the exception of certain basic ladder residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

The side chains of these residues point into the lumen of the barrel and were proposed to form an electrophoretic conduit that would bind substrate carboxylate groups to guide the substrates towards the constriction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Biswas1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Biswas2">[24]</xref>. The structural data now show that the basic ladders are likely present in all Occ channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001242-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s001">Figure S1</xref>). In most family members, 6–8 residues contribute to the ladder, but in some channels only the three central ladder residues closest to the constriction are present (Arg389, Arg391, and Arg410 in OccD1), suggesting that the other basic residues may be dispensable. Thus, the basic ladder is conserved in Occ proteins, an observation which strongly suggests that this structural feature is important for substrate selectivity. Interestingly, the closed state of the OccD2 channel observed in the crystal structure features a strong interaction between the carboxyl group of Asp294 and the side chain of the central basic ladder residue Arg389. We speculate that the carboxylate in this interaction mimics that of the substrate during transport.</p>

        <title>Electrophysiology Data Show That Occ Channels Are Dynamic</title>
        <p>To complement the crystal structures with time-resolved information of the channels in native-like environments, we recorded single-channel planar lipid bilayer data for all over-expressed Occ proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001242-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s004">Figure S4</xref>). The observed traces are generally consistent with the available crystal structures. For example, the dominant states of OccD1 and OccD2 have very small conductance values (∼15 pS), in accordance with the small/closed pores observed in the crystal structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001242-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Interestingly, both channels show occasional upward spikes in conductance, suggesting the occurrence of infrequent gating events that form a larger pore. Remarkably, the conductance of the dominant state of OccD3 is the largest of all channels analyzed (∼700 pS), which is clearly not compatible with the small pore observed in the crystal structure of this protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001242-g001">Figure 1</xref>). However, a displacement of the N-terminal segment caused by the conditions in the electrophysiological experiments (high ionic strength, applied voltage) would generate a large-diameter pore (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s002">Figure S2</xref>). OccD3 does show an infrequent state characterized by a very low conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001242-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), which could correspond to a pore where the N-terminus forms part of the constriction, as observed in the crystal structure.</p>

        <p>Interestingly, the remaining members of the OccD subfamily that were characterized (OccD4–D6) show dominant states with conductance values ranging from very low (OccD5) to relatively large (OccD6) comparable to that measured previously for OccK1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Thus, the single-channel data suggest that the crystal structure-derived division into OccD and OccK subfamilies based on pore sizes is too simplistic, and that some OccD proteins may have similar-sized pores as OccK proteins. All channels exhibit states that are characterized by very small conductance values and that are populated to different extents. Thus, the single-channel data suggest that OccD subfamily members have dynamic channels that are characterized by several states that range from virtually closed to having sizeable openings. The observed gating is unusual, but not unprecedented for diffusion-driven channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Tanabe1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Lepore1">[27]</xref>. The ability to observe different states of the same channel is a clear advantage of electrophysiology, complementing the static high-resolution information from X-ray crystal structures.</p>
        <p>For OccK channels, conductance values are on average somewhat larger than those of OccD subfamily members, ranging from ∼50 pS for OccK4 to ∼300 pS for OccK1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Biswas1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Cheneke1">[28]</xref>, OccK5, and OccK7. These data are consistent with the fairly large pores observed in the six crystal structures of members of this subfamily. Generally speaking, the observed conductance values are in the same range as that of other substrate-specific channels recorded under similar conditions (e.g., LamB monomer, ∼155 pS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Benz3">[29]</xref>), but considerably lower than those of general, non-specific porins (e.g., OmpF monomer, ∼700 pS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Saint1">[30]</xref>). Finally, the conductance data show that most OccK channels are dynamic and characterized by several substates as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001242-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

        <title>In Vitro Transport Data Show That Occ Channels Are Substrate Specific</title>
        <p>We sought to define the substrate specificities of a number of Occ proteins to answer the question of whether, and to which extent, these channels are substrate specific. To do this we investigated several in vitro systems. We performed two types of experiments: (i) “direct” uptake assays using radiolabeled substrates and (ii) measurement of radiolabeled substrate uptake in the presence of excess amounts of unlabeled compounds. In principle, the latter experiments only provide information about substrate binding to the channel constriction and not necessarily about transport. However, the absence of binding in such experiments is a strong indication that a compound is not a good transport substrate. Moreover, due to the large number of required radiolabeled compounds, a comprehensive definition of substrate specificity by direct transport assays alone is not practical.</p>
        <p>We initially performed uptake measurements using proteoliposomes with purified OccD1 and <sup>3</sup>H-arginine as substrate. However, even after extensive optimization efforts we could only obtain uptake levels that were ∼5-fold of that of empty liposomes, even when a substrate-binding protein was included in the proteoliposome lumen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s005">Figure S5</xref>). We next developed a system in which we overexpressed Occ channels on an inducible plasmid in the porin-deficient <italic>E. coli</italic> strain Bl21 omp8, followed by the production of total membrane vesicles. Using this system we could obtain transport activities for a number of substrates of up to 50-fold of that of the background vesicles. Since the levels of the proteins within the vesicles are not identical, we have expressed substrate uptake as specific activities, i.e., the uptake activities are corrected for the different amounts of Occ channels in our vesicles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s006">Figure S6</xref>). The observed uptake levels are very high for diffusion-based transport and are probably caused by a non-random, “right-side-out” orientation of the channels within the vesicles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Importantly, the results are produced using physiologically relevant, very low substrate concentrations (sub-µM for most substrates; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s008">Figure S8</xref>).</p>
        <p>We based our choice of substrates on the predictions made by Hancock et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Tamber1">[16]</xref> and on their availability in radiolabeled form. We tested arginine (potential substrate for OccD1), benzoate (various OccK family members), vanillate (OccK1), glucuronate (OccK2), pyroglutamate (OccK3), phenylacetate (OccK4), and citrate (OccK5). We also tested glucose as a substrate due to the general importance of sugars as carbon sources. Substrate concentrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s008">Figure S8</xref>) and uptake times (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s009">Figure S9</xref>) were determined for each individual substrate using one channel with good activity; these conditions were subsequently used for the entire panel of channels. In addition to 13 Occ channels we also tested <italic>E. coli</italic> OmpG and <italic>E. coli</italic> FadL. OmpG is a monomeric porin of unknown function with a large pore that likely forms a non-specific channel (positive control). FadL is a specific channel for the uptake of long-chain fatty acids (negative control). As an additional positive control we used vesicles made from C43 (DE3) cells, which contain all the OM proteins that are lacking in omp8 cells (i.e., OmpF, OmpC, OmpA, and LamB).</p>
        <p>The uptake experiments for arginine are striking in that they show a clear functional distinction between both Occ subfamilies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001242-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). All OccD channels, with the exception of OccD4, show good levels of arginine uptake. By contrast, the OccK channels have arginine transport activities that are around background levels. Thus, good substrates for OccD channels are poor substrates for OccK channels. The efficient arginine uptake mediated by OccD3 is noteworthy since this protein was shown, like OccD1, to mediate arginine uptake in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Tamber2">[18]</xref>. Since several OccD channels besides OccD1 and OccD3 mediate arginine uptake, our data also explain the observation that an <italic>occD1/occD3</italic> double knockout still grows in the presence of arginine as a sole carbon source <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Tamber2">[18]</xref>.</p>

        <p>We next asked whether putative OccK substrates, such as aromatic acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Tamber1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Sampathkumar1">[31]</xref>, are transported by OccD family members. First, we tested benzoate. This compound is indeed a good substrate for OccK proteins and a poor substrate for OccD family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001242-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The most efficient benzoate uptake was observed for OccK1, which correlates well with the prediction of this protein as a vanillate channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Tamber1">[16]</xref> and with its high structural similarity to the putative benzoate channel BenF from <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Sampathkumar1">[31]</xref>. Vanillate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s010">Figure S10</xref>), while being transported by OccK1, is clearly not the preferred substrate for this channel since relatively high substrate concentrations (10 µM) and long uptake times had to be used to obtain relatively low specific activities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s008">Figure S8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s011">Figure S11</xref>). This result is consistent with previous single-channel experiments, where the affinity of vanillate for OccK1 was found to be quite low (∼2 mM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Biswas1">[23]</xref>. Moreover, extensive soaking and co-crystallization experiments of vanillate with OccK1 have not been successful. Notably, while the current OccK1 structure contains two vanillate molecules, they are not bound at positions relevant for transport (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s012">Figure S12</xref>), confirming that vanillate is not a good substrate for OccK1. The final aromatic acid tested was phenylacetic acid, proposed to be a substrate for OccK4 and OccK11 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Tamber1">[16]</xref>. OccK4 was indeed the most efficient phenylacetate uptake channel of the proteins tested; however, the specific activities are very low and, as for vanillate, high substrate concentrations had to be used (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s008">Figure S8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s011">Figure S11</xref>). Thus, phenylacetate is not a preferred substrate for any of the tested channels.</p>
        <p>We next assayed the substrate couple glucuronate/glucose, to test the importance of the presence of a carboxyl group in the substrate on transport (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s010">Figure S10</xref>). Like benzoate, glucuronate is a good substrate for OccK channels but not for OccD subfamily members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001242-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). The highest transport rates are observed for OccK2, which agrees well with previous predictions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Tamber1">[16]</xref>. It should be noted that glucuronate is not transported by OccD1 in our assay, a finding that contrasts with previous results obtained in growth experiments with high (mM) substrate concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Huang2">[21]</xref>. Strikingly, glucose, as is evident from the low specific activities, is a poor substrate for all Occ channels tested, with the exception of low uptake levels mediated by OccK6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001242-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). The glucuronate/glucose results show that the presence of a carboxyl group in the substrate is required for efficient transport by Occ channels.</p>
        <p>The next substrate tested, pyroglutamate, has a similar activity profile compared to benzoate/glucuronate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001242-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). OccD proteins display transport levels that are similar to background, whereas OccK subfamily members are much more efficient. As with benzoate/glucuronate, the channel that is most efficient in pyroglutamate uptake (OccK3) was indeed predicted to transport this and related five-membered ring compounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Tamber1">[16]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Citrate, the final substrate tested, is representative of a large group of organic acids that are important carbon sources in vivo. Moreover, tricarboxylic acids were predicted to be substrates for the OccK5 channel (formerly OpdH) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Tamber1">[16]</xref>. Surprisingly, however, citrate is a very poor substrate for all Occ channels including OccK5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s008">Figure S8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s011">Figure S11</xref>), suggesting that the presence of multiple carboxylates in a substrate may be detrimental to transport. Previous electrophysiology experiments support our results, as no citrate binding to OccK5 could be detected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Tamber3">[22]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The control channels OmpG and FadL behave as expected in our transport assays, with generally efficient substrate uptake (including glucose) mediated by OmpG and no uptake observed for FadL. Efficient substrate uptake is also observed with the OmpF/OmpC porin-containing strain C43 (DE3). An important picture that emerges from these comparative data is the high efficiency of Occ channel-mediated uptake at low substrate concentrations. In many cases, Occ channels are as effective as or more effective than OmpG and OmpF/C, despite the latter proteins having much larger pores than the Occ family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001242-g005">Figure 5</xref>). These observations demonstrate that substrate-specific channels, by binding their substrates, function efficiently when substrate concentrations are low.</p>

        <title>Definition of Occ Channel Substrate Specificity</title>
        <p>Next, we set out to define the substrate specificities of Occ channels in more detail. The uptake experiments with radiolabeled substrates described in the previous section are not practical for a more comprehensive definition of substrate preferences. Instead, we have defined the substrate specificities of OccD1, OccK1, and OccK2 by monitoring transport of radiolabeled substrates in the presence of a 10-fold excess of an unlabeled compound. If that compound is a transport substrate, it will compete with the labeled substrate for binding to the channel, resulting in lower transport levels of the substrate. The main advantage of this method is that a relatively large number of compounds can be screened rapidly. The results of these experiments are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001242-t001">Table 1</xref>. The data for OccD1 are striking in that they show that the substrate specificity of this channel is quite narrow. The only compounds that lower arginine uptake when added in a 10-fold excess are basic amino acids. Agmatine affects arginine uptake only slightly, confirming the need for a carboxyl group in the substrate. The Arg-Arg dipeptide is also effective in competing with arginine uptake, suggesting that peptides containing basic residues are also substrates of OccD1. D-arginine also affects arginine uptake, but clearly not as efficiently as the L-amino acid. The other amino acids tested did not show any competition, even at a 100-fold molar excess (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s018">Table S3</xref>). Likewise, no effect on arginine uptake was observed for sugars, aromatic compounds, and organic acids. Thus, OccD1 is a very specific channel for basic amino acid uptake.</p>

        <p>Completely different profiles are observed for OccK1 and OccK2. When present in 10-fold excess, amino acids do not affect transport by these channels, with the sole exception of the cyclic amino acid derivative pyroglutamate, which lowers transport mediated by both channels effectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001242-t001">Table 1</xref>). The only sugar that is effective is glucuronate, which, together with gluconate, is the only tested sugar with a carboxyl group. The fact that gluconate does not compete with transport suggests that OccK1 and OccK2 prefer cyclic carboxyl-containing molecules as substrates. Consistent with this notion, the aromatic compounds are generally effective in lowering transport, especially for OccK1. Importantly, as judged from the substrates for which both transport and competition data are available, the competition profiles correlate well with transport, i.e., compounds that are efficient competitors are also transported well, and <italic>vice versa</italic> (e.g., pyroglutamate and OccK1 and OccK2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001242-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001242-t001">Table 1</xref>). Thus, the use of a competition assay to assess transport appears to be justified. No effect is observed for the organic acids, with the exception of the dicarboxilic acid adipate, which lowers OccK1-mediated transport fairly efficiently. An interesting finding is the efficient lowering of OccK1-mediated benzoate transport by octanoate and caproate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001242-t001">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that OccK1, but not OccD1 and OccK2, can serve as an uptake channel for medium-chain and possibly short-chain fatty acids. OccK1-mediated transport is not affected by octanol, again illustrating the importance of a carboxyl group in the substrate. In conclusion, the substrate specificities of OccK1 and OccK2 are not as narrow as that of OccD1, perhaps due to their larger pores. Various monocyclic compounds are efficient substrates for these channels, provided that they possess a carboxyl group. OccK1 is the least specific channel, also allowing the efficient passage of certain linear compounds such as medium-chain fatty acids.</p>

        <title>Occ Channels Show High Specificity for Antibiotics Uptake</title>
        <p>A very important but so far ignored point in drug design is the question of how antibiotics traverse the OM of Gram-negative bacteria. This is especially relevant for pseudomonads due to their highly impermeable OM. Since the Occ channels are substrate specific for low-molecular weight compounds (&lt;200 Da), we anticipated that the specificity might be even more pronounced for the higher molecular weight antibiotics (∼300–500 Da; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s010">Figure S10</xref>). We tested this hypothesis by determining the effect of a number of antibiotics, all of which are effective against <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in vivo, on Occ channel-mediated substrate transport. The results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001242-g006">Figure 6</xref> for OccD1–3 and OccK1–3 demonstrate that the interactions of the antibiotics with the various channels are indeed highly specific. For OccD1, inhibition of arginine uptake is caused only by imipenem and meropenem, in accordance with the known role of this channel in carbapenem antibiotic uptake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Huang2">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Quale1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Kohler1">[34]</xref>. Thus, remarkably, OccD2 and OccD3, while efficient in arginine uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001242-g004">Figure 4</xref>), are not uptake channels for carbapenems. In fact, none of the remaining antibiotics interfere substantially with arginine transport by OccD subfamily members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001242-g006">Figures 6A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s013">Figure S13</xref>). We also tested the uptake of antibiotics directly, using liposome swelling assays. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001242-g006">Figure 6D</xref> for imipenem, uptake of this antibiotic is only mediated by OccD1 and not by OccD2/D3, in accordance with the competition data. This is an important result, suggesting that channel-specific screening of antibiotic uptake can be done in vitro in a time-efficient manner by transport competition experiments.</p>

        <p>Transport mediated by OccK subfamily members is affected by different antibiotics compared to OccD channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001242-g006">Figures 6E–G</xref>), which is consistent with the different substrate specificities. The carbapenems are generally ineffective, and efficient competition is observed for only a few antibiotics out of the 10 tested. As judged by the inhibition of transport, OccK1 interacts with carbenicillin and cefoxitin. Intriguingly, OccK1-mediated transport is also affected by tetracycline, which is a non-β-lactam polyketide compound that does not have a carboxyl group. OccK2-mediated transport is also affected by carbenicillin and cefoxitin, albeit in a less efficient manner than OccK1. In addition, competition is observed with the amino-glycoside gentamycin, which also does not possess a carboxyl group. Thus, it appears that the strict requirement for a carboxyl group in low-molecular weight substrates may be less stringent in antibiotics, perhaps as a consequence of the many functional groups present in these higher molecular weight compounds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s010">Figure S10</xref>). OccK3-mediated transport is affected only with the cephalosporin cefotaxime. OccK3 thus appears to serve as a specific entry channel for this antibiotic, which is borne out by the liposome swelling experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001242-g006">Figure 6H</xref>). For the other OccK channels, none of the antibiotics affects transport efficiently, with one striking exception: OccK7-mediated transport is lowered very efficiently by meropenem, but not by the closely related imipenem. The observed selectivity of the channels in terms of antibiotic binding and transport is striking. One general implication of these findings is that acquisition of resistance towards many antibiotics may require down-regulation or inactivation of only a few channels, and in some cases perhaps just one. Consequently, antibiotics should ideally be designed to be able to pass through multiple channels.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our ability to measure efficient diffusion-mediated transport into total membrane vesicles without employing concentrative uptake assays that have been used for ion channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Garty1">[35]</xref> is perhaps surprising, making it important to demonstrate that what we are measuring is in fact transport into and not, for example, substrate binding to the outside of the vesicles. Several arguments can be given. First, substrate-specific channels have generally low affinities for low molecular-weight substrates, often in the (sub) mM range (e.g., ∼2 mM for vanillate binding to OccK1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Biswas1">[23]</xref>). In our assays, Occ protein and substrate concentrations are low (sub-µM) and similar to each other, making it unlikely that the signals we observe originate from binding to the channels. A second, important argument that favors transport over binding are the results obtained for the positive controls OmpG and <italic>E. coli</italic> C43 in our transport assays. For most substrates that we investigated, substantial amounts of radiolabel become associated with the vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001242-g004">Figure 4</xref>). It is highly unlikely that the signals are caused by binding, since OmpG and OmpF/C (in <italic>E. coli</italic> C43) are non-specific porins that do not bind substrates. Besides these indirect arguments, we have also performed control experiments to show that the accumulation of radiolabel in our assay is due to transport. When the vesicles are treated with polymixin B following substrate uptake, the radiolabel is lost, indicating that polymixin-induced permeabilization results in the loss of substrate from the vesicles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s014">Figure S14</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first time that the efficient transport of various substrates at low concentrations has been reported for outer membrane diffusion channels.</p>
      <p>The transport data demonstrate that Occ channels have a pronounced preference for substrates with a carboxyl group, due to the universal presence of a basic ladder on one side of the barrel wall. Beyond the requirement for a carboxyl group, the two Occ subfamilies have very different specificities. OccD channels are highly specific and transport basic amino acids. OccK channels, on the other hand, appear to be less selective and facilitate passage of a wider variety of substances, with a preference for cyclic compounds. Within both subfamilies, a substantial amount of substrate preference overlap is observed.</p>
      <p>The ultimate goal of the studies described here is to understand the structural basis of Occ channel specificity on an atomic level. Ideally, such an understanding should allow prediction of substrate/antibiotic preferences, including for channels for which structures are not available. In order to achieve this, co-crystal structures of Occ channels with their substrates are required. Thus far, we have focused on obtaining such structures for OccD1 and OccK1. However, we have not yet been successful for several reasons. First, we have focused on suboptimal substrates since the results of transport experiments were not yet available (i.e., we used vanillate rather than benzoate for co-crystallization with OccK1). Second, as is the case for most diffusion channels, substrate affinities are likely to be relatively low. Therefore, substrate binding under many crystallization conditions such as low pH or high ionic strength may therefore be very weak. Another important reason for the difficulty in obtaining co-crystal structures is our finding that some Occ channels are dynamic and characterized by open and closed states. Consequently, purification and/or crystallization conditions may favor (partially) closed states. Indeed, we crystallized such a closed state for OccD2. In addition, the pores observed for OccD1 and OccD3 are likely too small to allow binding and transport of their substrates. This is especially true for OccD1 and carbapenem antibiotics. In the latter case, even a movement of the insertion in L7 that partially blocks the pore is likely not enough to generate a large enough pore for transport of the antibiotic. Intriguingly, the B-factors for OccD1 suggest that the pore-constricting loop L3 is flexible (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001242.s015">Figure S15</xref>), and we speculate that movement of this loop could enlarge the pore to allow transport. Thus, at least some Occ proteins may require conformational changes in the loops that constrict the pore to allow substrate binding and passage. Interestingly, it has been reported that the addition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to OccD1 in single-channel experiments increased the conductance of this channel ∼20-fold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Ishii1">[36]</xref>, suggesting that addition of LPS to OccD channel preparations may stabilize an open state. In any case, the availability of many Occ channels in milligram quantities, together with the identification of better substrates reported here, will facilitate the generation of co-crystal structures.</p>
      <p>In the absence of a channel-substrate co-crystal structure, some general rationalizations regarding substrate recognition can still be made. For example, OccD1 has a distinct, asymmetric charge distribution across the pore constriction reminiscent to that observed in the <italic>E. coli</italic> porins OmpF and OmpC. The side of the basic ladder forms a positively charged surface, whereas the opposite side of the channel features a negatively charged pocket due to the presence of a carboxyl group, hydroxyl groups, and a number of backbone carbonyls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Biswas1">[23]</xref>. Thus, the observed substrate requirement of OccD1 for a carboxyl group and a positively charged group some distance away can be explained in a qualitative way by the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001242-g007">Figure 7</xref>), even if the structure does not resemble the fully open channel. Interestingly, recent molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the transient interaction of ampicillin with OmpF is similar to what we propose for OccD1 and imipenem/meropenem, with interacting opposite charges on the substrate and in the constriction of the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001242-g007">Figure 7</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Kumar1">[37]</xref>.</p>

      <p>Our data explain why soil bacteria such as pseudomonads are adept at growth under nutrient-poor conditions. The uptake experiments, performed with very low substrate concentrations, suggest that the Occ channel family as a whole can mediate the efficient uptake of a substantial number of low molecular weight compounds. Since each family member transports only a limited number of substances, the OM remains an effective permeability barrier as evidenced by the generally low effectiveness of antibiotics permeation through the Occ channels. Our results also help to rationalize the adaptations of bacteria in response to antibiotics treatment and the emergence of acquired resistance. A well-studied example of this is the response of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to carbapenem antibiotics such as imipenem and meropenem. Clinical isolates of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> resistant to these compounds often show, in addition to upregulation of efflux pumps and/or expression of β-lactamases, the disappearance of OccD1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Quale1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Sanbongi1">[33]</xref>, which is normally one of the more abundant OM proteins. Although the physiological substrates of OccD1 are unknown, the overlapping substrate specificities with other OccD subfamily members (at least with respect to arginine; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001242-g004">Figure 4</xref>) suggest that a lack of OccD1 in the carbapenem-resistant <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains is unlikely to affect fitness greatly.</p>
      <p>Until now, the screening of antibiotics in drug design has largely focused on the interaction of the compound with their intracellular targets. However, the effectiveness of antibiotics in Gram-negative bacteria also depends critically on the balance of three fundamental processes that occur prior to target interaction: influx mediated by OM channels, efflux mediated by efflux pumps, and degradation mediated by periplasmic and cytoplasmic enzymes. It is logical to assume that efficient antibiotics will have enhanced permeation properties, and the rational design of such compounds will require knowledge of how they interact at the atomic level with the OM channels that mediate their passage. Surprisingly, it is completely unclear how antibiotics interact with and pass through OM channels, with the exception of <italic>E. coli</italic> OmpF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001242-Ishii1">[36]</xref>. Moreover, for virtually all antibiotics it is also unknown which channel(s) are utilized for OM permeation in vivo. Our characterization of Occ channel structure and specificity is a first step towards understanding the interaction of antibiotics with OM channels of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. The use of an integrated approach encompassing genomics, biochemistry, and structural/computational biology may allow the rational design of novel antibiotics in the future, which will greatly help the fight against emerging bacterial resistance.</p>

Cell pellets were suspended in TSB (20 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 8.0) and cells were lysed by sonication (3×40 s intervals) (Branson Digital Sonifier). Total membranes were obtained by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 40 min (45 Ti rotor, Beckman L8-70M ultracentrifuge).

The proteins were eluted with 3 CV TSB containing 0.2% DM and 200 mM imidazole. The proteins were further purified by gel filtration chromatography using 10 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.12% DM, pH 8.0. For final polishing and detergent exchange, another gel filtration chromatography step was performed. The buffer used for this column varied depending on the protein; for most of the channels, 10 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.3%–0.35% C<sub>8</sub>E<sub>4</sub> was used at pH 8.0. Typically, small amounts (0.02%–0.1%) of another detergent (either LDAO, β-OG, DM or diheptanoyl-phosphatidylcholine) were added to modify channel solubility and crystallization properties.

(A) The small OccD3 pore as present in the crystal structure and (B) the large pore that could potentially be formed after movement of the N-terminal extension (shown in red; residues 1–30), for example as a result of high ionic strength in the single channel conductance experiments. (C) The small pore in the current structure of OccD1. Note the different conformation of the insertion in loop L7 (colored green) compared to that in the original OccD1 structure (PDB ID: 2ODJ). As a consequence, OccD1 in the original structure has a larger pore (D). In all cases, the view is from the extracellular side.</p>
