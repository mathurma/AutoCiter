<abstract>
<p>The rapidly increasing amount of data on human genetic variation has resulted in a growing demand to identify pathogenic mutations computationally, as their experimental validation is currently beyond reach. Here we show that alpha helices and beta strands differ significantly in their ability to tolerate mutations: helices can accumulate more mutations than strands without change, due to the higher numbers of inter-residue contacts in helices. This results in two patterns: a) the same number of mutations causes less structural change in helices than in strands; b) helices diverge more rapidly in sequence than strands within the same domains. Additionally, both helices and strands are significantly more robust than coils. Based on this observation we show that human missense mutations that change secondary structure are more likely to be pathogenic than those that do not. Moreover, inclusion of predicted secondary structure changes shows significant utility for improving upon state-of-the-art pathogenicity predictions.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The factors that determine the robustness and evolvability of proteins are still largely unknown. In this work the authors show that different secondary structure elements of proteins (helices and strands) differ in their ability to tolerate mutations, and demonstrate that it is caused by differences in the number of non-covalent residue interactions within these secondary structure units. The results suggest that engineering de novo all-alpha proteins should be easier than all-beta ones, as more sequences can to fold to the same topology. Additionally, secondary structure can be used to improve current methods of pathogenicity predictions; mutations that change secondary structure are more likely to be pathogenic than mutations that do not, due to their strong destabilizing effect on protein structure.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In recent years, genome sequencing studies have uncovered an enormous amount of human genetic variation, both in coding and noncoding regions of the human genome. As a consequence, developing computational methods that accurately predict whether mutations have any phenotypic or pathogenic consequences is a major goal of bioinformatics, and a number of tools have been developed to address this problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref001">1</xref>], however they currently achieve only a limited accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>After evolutionary conservation, protein structural information is one of the most useful predictors of the phenotypic effects of missense mutations. Missense mutations may disrupt protein structure and function at least in two ways: either by destabilizing the entire protein fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref005">5</xref>], or by modifying functional residues, i.e. active sites or protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref006">6</xref>], and pathogenic mutations are enriched in both the buried cores of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref007">7</xref>] and in protein interfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref008">8</xref>]. The factors that make protein folds stable, i.e. robust against mutations, have been studied in an evolutionary context, as robustness against mutations, and evolutionary innovability are related concepts: protein folds that tolerate mutations better are more likely to evolve functional innovations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref009">9</xref>]. It has been suggested that the key structural property of proteins that determines their ability to accept a mutation without destabilizing the fold is the density of contacts between residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref011">11</xref>] (measured either with the length-normalized number of contacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref011">11</xref>], or the largest eigenvalue of contact density matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref010">10</xref>]), and the higher the contact density of a given fold, the more robust it is against mutations. Subsequent studies have demonstrated the validity of the concept both experimentally and also through comparative analyses, showing that more stable proteins are more likely to accept destabilizing mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref013">13</xref>], and that the number of sequences that fold into a particular SCOP (Structural Classification Of Proteins) domain, and their evolutionary rate, is positively correlated with the contact density of the fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Previous work on mutational robustness, i.e. the ability to accept mutations without change, has focused mostly on protein tertiary structure. Here we have considered secondary structure, investigating whether protein regions with different secondary structure differ in their robustness against mutations, as suggested by a previous, preliminary study by one of us [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref016">16</xref>]. We performed a large-scale analysis of SCOP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref017">17</xref>] domains and the Protein Data Bank (PDB), and show that alpha helices are more robust than beta strands, i.e. can tolerate more sequence change without changing secondary structure. This appears to be primarily due to the higher number of residue interactions in helices, and both helices and strands are more robust than regions with no secondary structure (coils). Using currently available data of human variation and disease, we also tested whether this is reflected in the distribution of pathogenic missense mutations, and found that mutations which change secondary structure are much more likely to be pathogenic than mutations that do not. Finally, we find that information on whether a mutation is likely to disrupt secondary structure can be used to improve predictions of pathogenicity.</p>

<title>Helices can accumulate more mutations than strands or coils</title>
<p>We tested whether helices are more robust to mutations than strands using the four main classes of SCOP domains: all-α, all-β, α/β and α+β domains (all-α domains contain only helices, all-β domains contain only strands, α+β domains contain both helices and strands that are segregated within the domains, while α/β domains contain alternating helices and strands). We used a comparative method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005242.g001">Fig 1</xref>); first, we made all possible pairwise structural alignments between all domains within all SCOP families with TMalign [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref018">18</xref>]; next, we determined the secondary structure of the domains in the alignments, and examined how secondary structure similarity (the percent of aligned helix residues that remained helices in both proteins) changes with sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005242.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Additionally, we determined the relative solvent accessible area (RSA) for each residue of the alignments, and the frequency of indels in the alignments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005242.s001">S1 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005242.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>Overall, our results indicate that alpha helices can accumulate significantly more mutations than beta strands without change in the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005242.g002">Fig 2</xref>), and both helices and strands change slower than coils (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005242.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). With decreasing sequence similarity, secondary structure similarity decreases significantly faster in all-β than all-α domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005242.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, p &lt; 2.2 x 10<sup>−16</sup>, ANCOVA, using alignments with 10–30% sequence similarity), and also within α+β domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005242.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, p &lt; 2.2 x 10<sup>−16</sup>, ANCOVA), even without taking into account the very different relative solvent accessibility (RSA) of helices and strands in these proteins (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005242.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>As residues close to the surface accumulate mutations and change faster than the core [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref020">20</xref>], we also calculated secondary structure similarity for residues with different RSA, using the pairwise structural alignments where sequence similarity falls between 10–20% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005242.g002">Fig 2</xref>, panels D-F), as this bin contains the highest number of pairwise alignments (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005242.g001">Fig 1</xref>). When correcting for solvent exposure, a clear, qualitatively similar, and highly significant difference is present between helix and strand residues in all four SCOP classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005242.g002">Fig 2D–2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005242.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). This indicates that, except for the most buried residues (RSA &lt; 0.1), the same number of mutations result in less change in secondary structure in helices than strands, with coils being the least resilient against mutations.</p>
<p>In comparison with point mutations, the accumulation of indels shows a less clear pattern. The frequency of indels is significantly higher in helices than strands, although this is partly due to differences in solvent accessibility (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005242.s002">S2 Fig</xref>, p &lt; 2.2 x 10<sup>−16</sup> ANCOVA). After correction for RSA, there is no qualitative difference in indel frequency in α/β domains (Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005242.g002">Fig 2</xref>), although in all-α, all-β and α+β domains the frequency of indels is significantly higher in helices than strands (p &lt; 2.2 x 10<sup>−16</sup>, ANCOVA).</p>

<sec id="sec004">
<title>The higher robustness of helices is caused by their higher number of residue-residue interactions</title>
<p>What mechanism may be responsible for the different robustness against mutations? We tested three hypotheses: first, as the number of non-covalent residue interactions (contacts) was suggested as the main cause determining the overall robustness of protein folds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref014">14</xref>], we tested whether the number of inter-residue contacts in helices is higher than in strands. We identified all non-covalent interactions in the SCOP domains with the RINerator tool, and found that helix residues have a consistently higher number of contacts than strand or coil residues, when RSA is taken into account, and that strands have more contacts than coils (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005242.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Next, using ANCOVA, we identified those helix residues with less than the average RSA-normalized number of contacts (i.e. residues that fall below the regression line <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005242.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), and those strand residues with higher than the average RSA-normalized number of contacts (the residues that fall above the regression line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005242.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), and repeated the analysis using only these residues. The results indicate that the number of residue contacts is a key factor responsible for the higher robustness of helices: using these subsets of residues, the difference between helices and strands disappears, or even reverses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005242.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>Second, we tested whether the observed higher evolutionary stability of helices is also present when amino acids are examined independently, i.e. whether it is a result of different amino acid composition of helices and strands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref021">21</xref>], or it is a property of the secondary structure itself, and the same amino acids behave differently when they are part of helices or strands. Using the pairwise alignments where sequence similarity falls between 10–20%, we calculated the fraction of helix and strand forming amino acids with the same secondary structure in both sequences, for different levels of solvent accessibility (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005242.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). The results indicate that the higher stability of helices is not simply due to different amino acid composition: all amino acids except cysteine and methionine are more likely to keep their secondary structure in a helix than strand when mutated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005242.s005">S5A–S5C Fig</xref>). Additionally, the same amino acids have significantly more residue-residue interactions when they are part of a helix than a strand (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005242.s006">S6 Fig</xref>), further corroborating the hypothesis that the different amounts of residue interactions is responsible for the differences in robustness.</p>
<p>Third, we tested whether the linear distance between the contacting residues on the amino acid sequence contributes to the observed pattern. We assumed that contacts between more distant residues are more likely to influence the overall stability of a protein fold than short-range contacts, and thus disturbing them is more likely to be deleterious (i.e. having an effect on fitness of the organism). In helices, the majority of residue interactions are formed between residues located close to each other in sequence, typically within one helical turn. In contrast, strand residues are involved in more long-range contacts, so disrupting them might be more detrimental (both helices and strands form more contacts than H-bonds, and when one considers all contacts the difference between them is less pronounced than one would expect based on H-bonds alone). Surprisingly, our results indicate that the average distance of contacting residues is not a major contributor to the higher stability of helices relative to strands (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005242.s007">S7A Fig</xref>). As expected, secondary structure similarity increases with the average contact distance of the residues (so residues forming longer-range contacts are less likely to change their secondary structure). However the trend is highly nonlinear and levels off above average contact distance of 20 residues. In addition, helix residues are more robust against mutations when residues with the same average contact distance are considered (at least below contact distance 20 residues). Finally, when only the subsets of residues with higher than average (strands), and lower than average (helices) number of contacts were used in the analysis (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005242.g003">Fig 3</xref>), the pattern reverses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005242.s007">S7B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Theoretically the lower rate of secondary structure change in helices can be the result of either stronger selection against change in helices or the higher robustness of helices. These two mechanisms however have contrasting predictions on the rate of sequence change. Residues and protein regions that can accept more mutations without a change are likely to accumulate mutations faster than regions that cannot, while regions under stronger purifying selection are likely to evolve more slowly. We tested whether the rate of sequence divergence within the same protein domains is different in helices, strands and coils. Our findings are in agreement with the hypothesis that more robust regions accumulate mutations faster: we observe a consistent trend that even within the same pairwise alignments, aligned helices are more diverged than strands, and coils are less diverged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005242.g004">Fig 4</xref>). This is also consistent with a report indicating that the evolutionary rate is higher in solvent exposed helices than in strands, and both evolve faster than coils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref022">22</xref>].</p>

<p>The traditional view is that RSA is the most significant structural determinant of residue evolutionary rate in proteins and that the independent contribution of contact density is minor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref020">20</xref>]. A few recent studies however have suggested that residue interactions (contact density) are more important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref024">24</xref>], and the independent contribution of RSA is small. As contact density is highest in buried regions, which also evolve at the lowest rate, these studies are at odds with the findings reporting that designability/evolvability is positively correlated with the number of residue-residue interactions in a domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref026">26</xref>], and also with our findings here. It is not immediately clear to us what is the solution to this paradox, however our–admittedly simple—estimates of the independent effects of contact density and RSA on amino acid change indicate that, when both these factors are taken into account simultaneously, RSA is a much stronger predictor of amino acid change than contact density (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005242.s008">S8 Fig</xref>), supporting the findings of Franzosa and Xia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref020">20</xref>].</p>

<title>Mutations that change secondary structure are more likely to be pathogenic</title>
<p>Given the above evolutionary analyses suggesting that helices are more robust to mutations than strands, we wondered whether this also could be related to observed patterns of human genetic and structural variation. First, to test whether the increased robustness of helices is still observed at the level of individual point mutations, we identified pairs of protein structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) that differ by individual amino acid substitutions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec007">Methods</xref>), and determined what fraction of point mutations change secondary structure. Similar to the pattern observed for evolutionarily diverged SCOP folds, we find that strands are much more likely to change secondary structure after a point mutation than helices, and the difference is particularly pronounced in the case of residues with high RSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005242.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). We also observe that in the case of point mutations secondary structure changing mutations are located primarily at the ends of secondary structure units (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005242.s009">S9 Fig</xref>), and that with increasing solvent accessibility, a significantly higher fraction of mutations change secondary structure. However, this is likely to also be influenced by the fact that mutations that change secondary structure within the protein core are more likely to result in proteins that do not fold properly, and thus their structures are likely to be more difficult to crystallize.</p>

<p>Next, we identified 7199 human disease-associated missense mutations and 58 863 putative neutral mutations (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec007">Methods</xref>) that could be mapped to experimentally determined structures present in the PDB. Since for the vast majority of these mutations structural data is available only for the wild type but not for the mutant, we used with PSSpred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref027">27</xref>] and PSIpred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref028">28</xref>] without the BLAST step to predict which mutations change secondary structure. We used only those predictions where PSSpred and PSIpred predicted the secondary structure of the wild-type correctly. Although the accuracy for predicting secondary structure changes is fairly low (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec007">Methods</xref>), they do support our previous observation that helices tolerate mutations more than strands, as a significantly smaller fraction of mutations are predicted to break a helix than a strand or a coil (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005242.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). Furthermore, the distribution of pathogenic mutations is significantly different in mutations that change secondary structure than in those that do not. Only a small fraction of mutations not predicted to break a helix or a strand is pathogenic (up to 15–20%, depending on relative solvent accessibility, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005242.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). In contrast, mutations that result in secondary structure change are significantly more pathogenic (up to 2-fold in the case of mutations with RSA below 0.2, although the difference is declines with increasing RSA to nearly zero, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005242.g005">Fig 5B</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we investigated whether changes in secondary structure have utility for predicting pathogenicity. Currently the most commonly used tool to predict the pathogenicity of missense mutations is PolyPhen-2 (although some more recent tools, e.g. CONDEL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref029">29</xref>], FATHMM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref030">30</xref>] or SuSPect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref031">31</xref>] seem to be more efficient), which utilizes both protein structural and evolutionary information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref032">32</xref>]. We grouped mutations into four categories on the basis of their PolyPhen-2 scores: benign (0–0.49), possibly damaging (0.5–0.89), probably damaging (0.9–0.99) and highly likely damaging (0.99–1). Although, we did not find a clear difference in pathogenicity between helix and strand breaking mutations, we find that mutations predicted to change secondary structure are consistently more likely to be pathogenic, especially for the mutations that are predicted to be more damaging (i.e. have higher PolyPhen-2 score, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005242.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). This is in line with the fact that some variant effect prediction tools utilize changes in secondary structure in prediction (SNAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref033">33</xref>]). Thus, despite the limited accuracy of the prediction of secondary structure changing mutations, it appears that information on predicted changes in secondary structure has considerable potential to improve pathogenicity predictions. For instance, a mutation predicted by PolyPhen-2 to be probably or highly likely damaging is almost twice as likely to be pathogenic if it is also predicted to change secondary structure. As PDB entries are not randomly selected proteins but are biased towards proteins with higher than average biological significance, having a PDB “hit” is itself a predictor of pathogenicity. To test whether in the absence of any structural information on the wild type secondary structure change can still be used to improve pathogenicity predictions, we repeated the above analysis for all human missense mutations, including the ones that cannot be mapped to PDB structure. As previously, we used PSSpred and PSIpred to predict mutations that change secondary structure, and we found a qualitatively similar pattern to the dataset that could be mapped to PDB: mutations that are predicted to change secondary structure are more likely to be pathogenic, particularly in the case of mutations with high PolyPhen-2 scores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005242.s011">S11 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally we examined whether the apparent pathogenicity of secondary structure breaking mutations is caused by their destabilizing effect on protein structure. For every mutation we calculated the difference between the free energy of folding of the wild type and the mutant (ΔΔG), using FoldX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref034">34</xref>]. Similarly to a recent report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref035">35</xref>], we found that disease causing mutations have a significantly more destabilizing effect on protein structure than neutral mutations, at least in the protein core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005242.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). The lack of significant difference in residues located close to the surface probably reflects the recent finding that a significant fraction of diseases with a genetic background is caused by modifications of protein-protein interactions, and not by erroneous folding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref006">6</xref>]. Mutations that result in secondary structure change have a clear destabilizing effect on protein structure irrespectively of RSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005242.g005">Fig 5E</xref>), which explains their higher pathogenicity. In contrast, secondary structure itself has only a small, although significant effect on ΔΔG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005242.s012">S12 Fig</xref>), mutations in coils are somewhat more destabilizing than in helices or strands, which is consistent with their lower robustness.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The findings presented in this study strongly indicate that alpha helices can tolerate more point mutations than beta strands (and in consequence, are more designable). Besides providing basic insights on robustness and designability of proteins, our findings may also have important practical implications: we show that the effect of a mutation on secondary structure can be used to improve predictions of the phenotypic effects of missense mutations. Additionally, the results also suggest that engineering <italic>de novo</italic> all-alpha proteins should be easier than all-beta ones, as more sequences are likely to fold to the same topology, even ignoring the distribution of long-range contacts.</p>

<title>Analysis of SCOP domains</title>
<p>SCOP 1.75 domains were downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop" xlink:type="simple">http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop</ext-link>. We used the Astral95 subset in the analysis, to remove redundancies. The secondary structure of the residues in each SCOP domain was determined with DSSP[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref036">36</xref>], relative solvent accessibility of residues was calculated as the quotient of their solvent accessible surface provided by DSSP, and the total surface area of the amino acid in Gly-X-Gly triples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref037">37</xref>].</p>
<p>In the comparative analysis, we calculated all possible pairwise structural alignments between domains of the same SCOP families with TMalign [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref018">18</xref>]. (In consequence, families with one domain could not be used.) The choice of the structural aligner does not have a qualitative effect on the results, using the RCSB Protein Comparison Tool (with CE algorithm) instead of TMalign results in a similar pattern (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005242.s013">S13 Fig</xref>). We excluded all structural alignments with a template modeling (TM) score lower than 0.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref038">38</xref>] (normalized with the longer sequence) as these are likely to represent different folds, and also domains shorter than 80aa, as they typically have very simple topologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref038">38</xref>]. In addition, we excluded the variable and constant domains of antibodies (b.1.1.1 and b.1.1.2) from all-β domains. Next, the raw pairwise alignments produced by TMalign were postprocessed: we removed the unaligned tails of the N- and C- termini, and the remaining unaligned fragments were refined with Rascal[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref039">39</xref>] (v1.34), which we modified to refine only those parts of the structural alignments that remained unaligned by TMalign, thus it did not modify the blocks that were correctly aligned using structures.</p>
<p>Secondary structure similarity in the alignments was calculated as the number of aligned (non-indel) positions with the same secondary structure divided by the total number of aligned positions being either helix, strand or coil in any of the two sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005242.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Indel frequency was calculated as the number of unaligned helix or strand residues, divided by the total number positions with helix or strand residues in the alignment. Gaps in the structures, and domains where residue numbering is not monotonously increasing were excluded from the analysis. All calculations were performed with in-house Perl scripts, available on request.</p>
<p>Non-covalent residue contacts were determined with RINerator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref041">41</xref>]. In brief, RINerator first adds hydrogens to the protein structure with Reduce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref042">42</xref>] (hydrogens are missing from most protein structures determined by X-ray crystallography), next using the van der Waals surfaces of all atoms, it determines the number and strength of contacts between residues. Residues are assigned as contacting if the van der Waals radiuses of any of their atoms are closer than 0.25Å, excluding covalent bonds.</p>

<title>Analysis of PDB point mutants and human variation</title>
<p>We used the following procedure to identify structures that differ in point mutations in the PDB. First we filtered out redundant sequences, i.e. we kept only one sequence from entries with identical amino acid sequences. Next, using usearch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref043">43</xref>] we performed an all vs. all blast search with a minimum 98% sequence identity requirement, to identify pairs of highly similar but not 100% identical sequences (excluding sequences shorter than 64 amino acids). The resulting sequence pairs were aligned with muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref044">44</xref>], and the location of each mutation was determined in the pair. For each mutation, using DSSP we determined the RSA of the affected residues, and also whether it results in a change in secondary structure. Coil residues were defined simply as residues that are neither helix nor strand. Since the same mutations can be present in several, minimally different sequences, to remove redundancies, identical mutations in homologous sequences were counted only once, irrespectively of the combination of PDB entries they occur. In case of sequence pairs that differ in more than one residue, we used only the mutations that are separated by at least 10 residues in the sequences.</p>
<p>Data on human pathogenic and putative neutral missense mutations, including PolyPhen-2 pathogenicity predictions was downloaded from the Ensembl Variation database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref045">45</xref>], release 83. Disease mutations were those annotated as pathogenic or likely pathogenic, whereas the putative neutral mutations were those with an assigned allele frequency, or annotated as benign. Although some of the low frequency variants are still likely to have a phenotypic effect or might be damaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref046">46</xref>], especially in a homozygous state, this gives us a large set mutations that should be highly enriched in those that are neutral or nearly neutral. Finally, given that many immune-related proteins are highly mutated, we excluded human proteins with immunoglobulin or HLA domains (PFAM families PF07686, PF08204, PF15910, PF07654, PF16196, PF05790, PF08205, PF07679, PF00047, PF00129). Only those mutants were included in the analysis where the wild type sequences have at least 90% sequence identity to a PDB structure and all side chain atoms for the wild type residue are observed in the structure. For each mutation, the RSA and secondary structure were determined with DSSP, using the structure. For those residues that mapped to multiple structures, we used the lowest RSA value.</p>
<p>To predict changes in secondary structure for the human variants, we used PSSpred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref027">27</xref>] and PSIpred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref028">28</xref>] without the PSI-BLAST step, and benchmarked them with the PDB point mutation dataset (see above). Previously, it has been shown that secondary structure prediction can reach up to 80–82% accuracy when applied to a complete protein sequences with a PSI-BLAST step and 65–69% without. Prediction accuracy is high for mutations that are predicted to be conservative and do not result in secondary structure change: 91% for helices, 92% for strands and 94% for coils. However we found that in the case of point mutations that are predicted to change secondary structure, current methods perform much worse. When used independently, prediction accuracy is only 30–24% for helices, 16–16% for strands and 15–14% for coils (PSSpred and PSIpred, respectively). By combining predictions from the two tools (i.e. using only the mutations for which PSSpred and PSIpred predictions are the same), the prediction accuracy is somewhat better, although still low: 38% for helices, 19% for strands and 18.7% for coils.</p>
<p>The effect of missense mutations on the free energy of folding (ΔΔG) was calculated with FoldX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005242.ref034">34</xref>]. For every mutation we used the mapping PDB structure with the highest resolution, which was minimized with the FoldX RepairPDB utility prior to the ΔΔG calculation.</p>

<title>RSA consistently predicts amino acid change better than contact density of residues (CD).</title>
<p>The graph shows a scatterplot of RSA and CD importance, after bivariate binning. We selected all pairwise structural alignments of SCOP domains with sequence similarity between 45–55% (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005242.g001">Fig 1</xref>). For each pairwise alignment, RSA and CD were determined for every residue, and a logistic regression was made, to determine the relationship between the amino acid change, RSA and CD. Amino acid change was treated as a binary variable: when the aligned residues were identical the position was assigned 0, when not, 1. The “varImp” function of the “caret” R package was used to obtain the relative importance of the two predictors for each regression (on the scale of 0–100), which were then plotted, and binned in 2D with the “hexbin” R package, for clarity. While this approach is basic, and is not suitable to determine exact rates of amino acid change, it is sufficient to obtain a qualitative comparison of the importance of the two predictors. In general, both RSA and CD predict relatively poorly whether an amino acid will change or not, nevertheless RSA consistently outperforms CD.</p>

<p>Stars indicate significant difference (*: p &lt; 0.05; **: p &lt; 0.005), after correction for false discovery rate (with the Benjamini-Hochberg method). Since the vast majority of mutations do not result in secondary structure change, secondary structure has only a small effect on ddG, nevertheless mutations in coils are consistently more destabilizing than mutations in strands or helices, except for the most buried residues with no solvent exposed area.</p>
