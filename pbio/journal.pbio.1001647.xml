<p>A structural and functional study delineates how the interaction between NF-κB subunit RelA and co-activator CBP/p300 helps drive transcription of NF-κB target genes.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>NF-κB plays a vital role in cellular immune and inflammatory response, survival, and proliferation by regulating the transcription of various genes involved in these processes. To activate transcription, RelA (a prominent NF-κB family member) interacts with transcriptional co-activators like CREB-binding protein (CBP) and its paralog p300 in addition to its cognate κB sites on the promoter/enhancer regions of DNA. The RelA:CBP/p300 complex is comprised of two components—first, DNA binding domain of RelA interacts with the KIX domain of CBP/p300, and second, the transcriptional activation domain (TAD) of RelA binds to the TAZ1 domain of CBP/p300. A phosphorylation event of a well-conserved RelA(Ser276) is prerequisite for the former interaction to occur and is considered a decisive factor for the overall RelA:CBP/p300 interaction. The role of the latter interaction in the transcription of RelA-activated genes remains unclear. Here we provide the solution structure of the latter component of the RelA:CBP complex by NMR spectroscopy. The structure reveals the folding of RelA–TA2 (a section of TAD) upon binding to TAZ1 through its well-conserved hydrophobic sites in a series of grooves on the TAZ1 surface. The structural analysis coupled with the mechanistic studies by mutational and isothermal calorimetric analyses allowed the design of RelA-mutants that selectively abrogated the two distinct components of the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction. Detailed studies of these RelA mutants using cell-based techniques, mathematical modeling, and genome-wide gene expression analysis showed that a major set of the RelA-activated genes, larger than previously believed, is affected by this interaction. We further show how the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction controls the nuclear response of NF-κB through the negative feedback loop of NF-κB pathway. Additionally, chromatin analyses of RelA target gene promoters showed constitutive recruitment of CBP/p300, thus indicating a possible role of CBP/p300 in recruitment of RelA to its target promoter sites.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The NF-κB family of transcription factors regulate the expression of numerous genes involved in the immune response, cell survival, differentiation, and proliferation. The interaction of the RelA subunit of NF-κB with the general co-activator protein CBP/p300 is vital for RelA-dependent gene transcription. Although the recruitment of RelA to its cognate genomic κB sites for target gene activation is well-established, the involvement of CBP/p300 in this process remains unclear. Through our structure/function-based approach we provide the molecular and functional details of the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction and its contribution to the regulation of distinct subsets of target genes. We also show that disruption of this interaction deregulates the NF-κB pathway by interfering with its negative feedback loop. Furthermore, our study indicates a possible reciprocal role for CBP/p300 in the recruitment of RelA to its target gene promoters.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The NF-κB family of inducible transcription factors has emerged as a major player in immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Hayden1">[1]</xref>, activating a plethora of immunoregulatory genes upon stimulation. In vertebrates, the family is comprised of five members, namely, RelA (also known as p65), RelB, c-Rel, p50, and p52. They exist in various combinations of homo- and hetero-dimers, with RelA:p50 being the most abundant NF-κB dimer present in the cell. All of the family members share a structurally conserved N-terminal rel homology region (RHR), which is responsible for DNA binding and also contains the dimerization domain (DD). RelA, RelB, and c-Rel distinguish themselves from p50 and p52 by possessing the transcriptional activation domain (TAD), which is vital for the transcriptional regulation of the NF-κB-regulated genes. In unstimulated cells, NF-κB is maintained in a latent state in the cytoplasm by the family of Inhibitor-κB (IκB) proteins, which strongly bind to the RHR domain of NF-κB dimers, thereby masking its nuclear localization signal. Upon stimulation, a cascade of signaling events led to the degradation of the IκB proteins, thus releasing the NF-κB dimers, which then enter the nucleus to regulate the transcription of NF-κB-dependent genes. In the nucleus, NF-κB activates transcription by binding to its cognate κB sites in the promoters/enhancers of its target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Natoli1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Siggers1">[3]</xref>. However, mere binding of the NF-κB to its cognate κB sites does not ensure transcriptional initiation, and further requires the assembly of the “basal transcription machinery” on the transcription start site. Assembly of the transcription initiation complex requires NF-κB to interact with the mediator complex, various transcriptional adaptors, and co-activator proteins like CREB-binding protein (CBP) and its paralog p300 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Gerritsen1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Naar1">[7]</xref>. CBP/p300 are general transcriptional co-activators that help NF-κB bridge with the basal transcription machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Merika1">[8]</xref>. CBP/p300 interact with a large array of transcription factors to integrate multiple cellular signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Blobel1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Kamei1">[10]</xref> and also possess chromatin-remodeling capabilities owing to their histone- and transcription factor–acetylating properties.</p>
<p>To date, it is widely believed that in the nucleus NF-κB recruits CBP/p300 to its target promoter sites, and in this process it must compete with various other cellular transcription factors for the limiting amounts of CBP/p300 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Hottiger1">[11]</xref>. However, in recent genome-wide analyses of gene promoters/enhancers using ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq technology, p300 has emerged as a prominent marker for enhancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Visel1">[12]</xref>. p300 is also pre-loaded in most of the promoters and enhancers of NF-κB-regulated genes marked with histone-H3 lysine 4 trimethyl (H3K4me3) and histone H3 lysine 4 monomethyl (H3K4me1), respectively, in unstimulated THP-1 and HeLa cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Jin1">[13]</xref>. In light of these new findings, the question arises that if p300 is already preloaded on the promoter/enhancer regions of the NF-κB target genes, then what is the role of NF-κB:CBP/p300 binding in the NF-κB activated transcription.</p>
<p>Among the NF-κB proteins, RelA is the most potent, ubiquitously expressed and well-studied family member. It contains a TAD, which can be further divided into two regions, TA1 and TA2, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g001">Figure 1A</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Schmitz1">[14]</xref>. Although the activation of the NF-κB pathway is extensively studied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Vallabhapurapu1">[15]</xref>, mechanistic details of the transcription initiation process by NF-κB at the promoter site are limited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-vanEssen1">[16]</xref>. This can partly be attributed to the lack of any structural information and limited overall knowledge of RelA–TAD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Schmitz2">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Zheng1">[18]</xref>. The interaction of RelA with CBP/p300 represents a key step in the initiation of transcription of a subset of RelA-activated genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Dong1">[19]</xref>. RelA interacts with CBP/p300 in a bipartite manner—the RHR domain of RelA contacts the KIX domain of CBP/p300 and the TAD of RelA contacts the TAZ1 (also known as the CH1) domain of CBP/p300 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Zhong1">[20]</xref>. The former interaction requires RelA-phosphorylation at a well-conserved Ser276 residue. Although both the RHR:KIX and TAD:TAZ1 interactions contribute to transcriptional activation of RelA-dependent genes, phosphorylation of Ser276 is considered critical for the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Zhong1">[20]</xref>. It remains unclear whether the interaction between the RelA–TAD and the TAZ1 domain of CBP/p300 can activate transcription of RelA-target genes independent of RelA(Ser276) phosphorylation or vice versa. In addition to CBP/p300, RelA also interacts with a number of other proteins for the transcriptional activation of its target genes through its TAD, and hence a detailed knowledge of the TAD:TAZ1 binding is a necessary prelude to any mutations in the RelA–TAD, which can selectively abrogate RelA:CBP/p300 interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-vanEssen1">[16]</xref>.</p>

<p>As an initial step towards elucidating the role of NF-κB:CBP/p300 interaction in transcription of NF-κB-regulated genes, we determined the solution structure of the mouse RelA–TA2 (a subdomain of TAD) in complex with the TAZ1 domain of mouse CBP. The structure reveals the high affinity binding of RelA–TA2 through its well-conserved hydrophobic sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) in a series of grooves on the TAZ1 surface. The structure enabled us to design point mutants of RelA, which selectively abrogated the RelA–TAD:CBP–TAZ1 binding, thereby allowing us to gain detailed insight into the molecular determinants of the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction. Using these RelA mutants defective in CBP/p300 binding, we performed a genome-wide analysis of the genes influenced by the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction to confirm the differential role of the two interaction sites on the RelA regulated transcriptome. We found genes like <italic>nfkbia</italic> and <italic>ptgs2</italic>, which were previously considered independent of RelA:CBP/p300 interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Dong1">[19]</xref>, were actually dependent on it. The dependence of <italic>nfkbia</italic> expression on RelA:CBP/p300 interaction explains how this interaction regulates the temporal profile of nuclear NF-κB (nNF-κB) following TNFα stimulation. Furthermore, we revisited the model of CBP/p300 recruitment by RelA using Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Our study confirmed that CBP/p300 is preloaded on the promoter regions of our set of RelA target genes, thus indicating that RelA:CBP/p300 interaction might be vital for recruitment of RelA to its target promoter sites.</p>

<title>Mapping of the CBP–TAZ1 Binding Site on RelA–TAD</title>
<p>The RelA–TAD:CBP–TAZ1 interaction was previously mapped to RelA(477–504) region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Zhong1">[20]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We found only a weak interaction between this RelA fragment and TAZ1 as compared to the whole RelA–TAD [RelA(425–549)] and therefore scanned the entire TAD for TAZ1 binding using GST pull-down assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001647.s001">Figure S1</xref>). A RelA construct spanning residues Lys425–Pro490 (in the TA2 region) emerged as the minimal fragment with maximal affinity to TAZ1. This fragment (henceforth referred to as RelA–TA2) was also optimal for structural analysis by NMR spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001647.s001">Figure S1B</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001647.s001">C</xref>). This highly acidic RelA–TA2 fragment is unstructured in its free state, as observed from the narrow dispersion of peaks in the [<sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H]–HSQC spectrum, but exhibits a well-dispersed spectrum indicative of a folded structure when in complex with TAZ1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

<title>Structure of CBP–TAZ1 in the RelA–TA2:CBP–TAZ1 Complex</title>
<p>The structure of the complex between RelA–TA2 (residues 425–490) and CBP–TAZ1 (residues 340–439) was determined using distance and dihedral angle restraints derived from heteronuclear NMR experiments (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001647-t001">Table 1</xref> for NMR statistics). TAZ1 is a scaffolding domain that interacts with intrinsically disordered TADs of various transcription factors, which fold upon complex formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Dames1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Wojciak1">[23]</xref>. The overall structure of TAZ1 in the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g002">Figure 2</xref>) resembles that of TAZ1 in its free state (RMSD 1.6 Å) and in complex with other protein targets like HIF-1α (RMSD 1.8 Å), CITED2 (1.4 Å), and STAT2 (RMSD 1.3 Å) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Dames1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Wojciak1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-DeGuzman2">[25]</xref>. As observed in our structure, the TAZ1 fold comprises four α-helices (α<sub>1</sub>, α<sub>2</sub>, α<sub>3</sub>, and α<sub>4</sub>) arranged in a roughly tetrahedral shape and is stabilized by three zinc atoms, each of which is bound to three Cys residues and one His residue. A prominent surface feature of the TAZ1 domain is a series of interlinked hydrophobic grooves that bind intrinsically disordered TADs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001647.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

<title>Structure of RelA–TA2 in the RelA–TA2:CBP–TAZ1 Complex</title>
<p>In the RelA–TA2:TAZ1 structure, the N- and C-terminal regions of the RelA–TA2 fragment used for structural analysis (Lys425–Thr433 and Ser482–Pro490, respectively) are dynamically disordered, with zero or negative [<sup>1</sup>H]-<sup>15</sup>N heteronuclear NOEs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001647.s003">Figure S3A</xref>), and hence are omitted from the structures shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g002">Figure 2A,B</xref>. Our structure shows that RelA–TA2, essentially the Leu434–Val481 region, entirely wraps around TAZ1 in a predominantly extended conformation by docking itself through its well-conserved bulky hydrophobic residues into the interlinked hydrophobic grooves of TAZ1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001647.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). The C-terminal region (Glu471–Asn477) of RelA–TA2 folds into one short helix α<sub>C</sub> that is anchored to the hydrophobic pocket formed by packing of α<sub>1</sub>, α<sub>2</sub>, and α<sub>3</sub> helices of TAZ1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Likewise, the N-terminal region (Leu434–Leu439) of RelA–TA2 also forms a short helix α<sub>N</sub>, which is docked into the shallow hydrophobic groove formed at the junction of α<sub>1</sub> and α<sub>4</sub> of TAZ1. The α<sub>N</sub> helix is dynamically disordered with only about 30% of the helical population, as calculated from the magnitude of the C-alpha and carbonyl secondary chemical shifts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Yao1">[26]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001647.s003">Figure S3B</xref>), and the small value of the [<sup>1</sup>H]-<sup>15</sup>N heteronuclear NOE (∼0.3–0.5 for the α<sub>N</sub> residues) confirms that this region is highly flexible on the nanosecond time scale (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001647.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). RelA–TA2 also forms two additional helical turns, Leu449–Leu452 and Leu465–Val468, which make hydrophobic contacts in the α<sub>1</sub>–α<sub>2</sub>–α<sub>3</sub> and α<sub>1</sub>–α<sub>3</sub> interfaces of TAZ1, respectively. The hydrophobic interactions are complemented by electrostatic interactions between the highly acidic RelA–TA2 region and the strongly electropositive surface of TAZ1. The region from Asp444–Asp448 in RelA–TA2 is particularly acidic, with four out of five residues being negatively charged, and passes through a deep cleft in the TAZ1 surface that is lined with basic residues (Lys366, Arg368, Arg369, Lys419, Lys438, Arg439) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Our structural analysis was further corroborated by ITC experiments carried out at two different salt concentrations to study the electrostatic contribution of the binding event. Increasing the NaCl concentration from 50 to 150 mM weakened RelA–TA2:TAZ1 binding by 4-fold, consistent with a significant electrostatic contribution to binding from the complementary charges on TAZ1 and the RelA–TA2 region (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001647-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>RelA–TA2 Anchors on CBP–TAZ1 Through Multiple Hydrophobic Residues</title>
<p>The structure of the RelA–TA2:TAZ1 complex revealed that several hydrophobic residues in RelA–TA2 mediate binding within the exposed hydrophobic grooves of TAZ1. The RelA–TA2 amino acid residues, which extensively interact with the hydrophobic pockets of TAZ1, belong to two ψXXψψ motifs and a ψψXXψXXψ sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), where ψ is a bulky hydrophobic residue (Leu, Val or Phe in RelA–TA2) and X can be any residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The ψXXψψ motif is a generalization of the LXXLL motifs that are known to mediate protein–protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Plevin1">[27]</xref>. Furthermore, Val481, Phe443, and the Leu residues belonging to the α<sub>N</sub> helix of RelA–TA2 also contribute to complex formation as observed from the intermolecular NOEs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001647.s004">Figure S4B</xref>).</p>

<title>RelA–TA2 docks itself onto a series of interlinked hydrophobic grooves of TAZ1 through a number of hydrophobic residues, which serve as anchor points.</title>
<p>Disruption of any of the anchor points leads to the destabilization of the whole binding architecture of the complex. ∼2,800 Å<sup>2</sup> of RelA–TA2 surface area are buried upon formation of RelA–TA2:TAZ1 complex. (A) Leu449 (left panel), Leu465 (middle panel), and Phe473 (right panel) residues of RelA–TA2 (shown as green spheres) buried into each face of the interlinked hydrophobic grooves of TAZ1. Residues of TAZ1 making contacts with the above mentioned hydrophobic residues of RelA are shown as red sticks. The other hydrophobic residues of RelA–TA2—namely, Leu452, Val468, Leu476, and Leu477—making vital contacts with TAZ1 are depicted as green sticks. (B) GST-pulldown experiments performed on the RelA–TA2 mutants binding to TAZ1. RelA fragment (Lys425–Pro490) with N-terminal GST-tag was used as the wild-type protein.

The Leu449Ala and Leu465Ala mutants in RelA–TA2 lead to diminished association constants accompanied with decreased negative enthalpy change. The Phe473Ala mutant showed no binding (NB).</p>

<p>To investigate the role of the ψXXψψ motifs, we substituted alanine for Leu449 and Phe473 of RelA, each of which represents the first ψ residue of the motif. Both Leu449 and Phe473 are deeply buried in the molecular interface and participate in extensive hydrophobic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g001">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g003">3A</xref>). We also replaced the third ψ residue of ψψXXψXXψ sequence with Ala–Leu465Ala (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, middle panel and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001647.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). All three RelA mutants showed diminished to completely abrogated TAZ1 binding in the GST-pulldown assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) and isothermal calorimetric (ITC) experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001647.s005">Figure S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001647-t002">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), confirming the critical role of hydrophobic interactions in stabilizing the complex. The Leu449Ala and Leu465Ala substitutions each led to a 7-fold decrease in the TAZ1 binding affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g003">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001647-t002">Table 2</xref>). As seen in the structure, the side chain of Leu465 is fully buried into a deep narrow hydrophobic pocket formed by Ile353, Leu357, Gln413, Ile414, His417, Trp418, Cys426, and Val428 of TAZ1 and Val468 of RelA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, middle panel and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001647.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). This interaction contributes significantly to enthalpic stabilization of the complex, since the Leu465Ala substitution greatly decreases the enthalpic contribution to TAZ1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Leu449 binds in a shallower hydrophobic pocket, and accordingly substitution by alanine causes far less enthalpic destabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, left panel). The Phe473Ala mutation led to a complete loss of TAZ1 binding. In the structure, the side chains of Phe473, Leu476, and Leu477 (all the ψ residues of this ψXXψψ motif) are accommodated in the hydrophobic groove of TAZ1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, right panel and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001647.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). This arrangement is destabilized in the Phe473Ala mutant, leading to complete loss of TAZ1 binding. We speculate that a similar effect would be observed for Leu476Ala and Leu477Ala mutants.</p>
<p>Apart from the above-mentioned residues of RelA–TA2, the contacts between TAZ1 and the disordered α<sub>N</sub> helix of RelA–TA2 contribute slightly to formation of the RelA–TA2:TAZ1 complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001647.s004">Figure S4B</xref>). N-terminal truncation to remove residues Lys425–His440, thereby eliminating the entire α<sub>N</sub> helix, decreases the affinity by only 1.6-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g003">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001647-t002">Table 2</xref>). Likewise, deletion of residues Ser486–Pro490 from the disordered C-terminal end of RelA had no effect on TAZ1 binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001647.s001">Figure S1D</xref>). However, further truncation to remove Val481–His485 greatly impaired binding by eliminating hydrophobic contacts between Val481 of RelA(TA2) and the side chains of Leu359, Leu381, and Pro382 in TAZ1. Replacement of Met483 by alanine had no effect on binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), confirming that RelA residues beyond Val481 do not contribute to the interaction.</p>
<p>In summary, our structure shows that RelA–TA2 spirals through the exposed hydrophobic pockets of TAZ1 and anchors itself on TAZ1 at a number of points. As observed from the mutation studies, disruption of any of these anchoring residues of RelA–TA2 leads to the destabilization of the entire binding architecture of the entire complex.</p>

<title>Possible Role of Phosphorylation in RelA–TA2:CBP–TAZ1 Binding</title>
<p>The RelA–TA2 region also contains a well-conserved Ser467 (Ser468 in human RelA), which is a known phosphorylation site. Depending upon the stimulus, this site can be phosphorylated by GSK3β, IKKε, or IKKβ and plays a critical role in transcriptional regulation of NF-κB dependent genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Saijo1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Mattioli1">[31]</xref>. Ser467 resides in the ψψXXψXXψ sequence of RelA–TA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), and in the complex it is close to the cluster of basic residues at the N-terminus of helix α<sub>1</sub> of TAZ1. Our ITC experiments show that a phosphomimetic mutant, RelA(Ser467Asp), binds TAZ1 with about 1.4-fold higher affinity than wild type RelA–TA2 and exhibits the same dependence on ionic strength, suggesting an enhanced but still nonspecific electrostatic interaction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001647-t002">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Thus, the increased negative charge of phosphoserine would likely enhance TAZ1 binding even further over nonphosphorylated RelA.</p>

RelA(Leu449Ala+Phe473Ala) and RelA(Leu449Ala+Phe473Ala+Ser467Ala) mutants have slower mobility on SDS-PAGE gels due to unknown reasons. The expression level of the RelA(Ser276Ala) mutant in the reconstituted cell line was lower than that for the RelA(wt) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001647.s006">Figure S6</xref>).

The RelA(Ser276Ala+Leu449Ala+Phe473Ala) mutant, which could potentially abolish the total RelA:CBP interaction, showed low and inconsistent expression and hence was not used in this study. * denotes IgG heavy chain. (D) The RelA mutants defective in RelA:CBP interaction also are defective binding to p300. The co-IP experiments for p300 was performed similarly to those in panel (C) of this figure. (E) RelA phosphorylated at Ser467 has higher CBP/p300 binding potential than the nonphosphorylated form. The immunoprecipitation assay was performed with α-RelA on CE (left column panels) and NE (right column panels) of <italic>rela</italic><sup>−</sup>/<sup>−</sup> cells reconstituted with RelA(wt) or RelA(Ser467Ala) mutant at three different time intervals after being stimulated with TNFα (5 ng/ml) in addition to the unstimulated cells. Co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed with α-CBP and α-p300 on NE in exactly the same manner as for the IP experiments above. The recruitment of nRelA by CBP/p300 is similar at 15 min relative to 30 min but diminishes at 45 min after TNFα stimulation despite the concentration of total RelA in the nucleus being significantly lower at 15 min after stimulation. Identical co-IP experiments with the RelA(Ser467Ala) mutant shows a direct proportionality in CBP/p300 binding with the concentrations of total nRelA at the different time points after stimulation. This indicates that the exclusively nuclear p-Ser467–RelA whose concentration peaks at about 10 to 15 min post-TNFα stimulation possesses a higher binding affinity for CBP/p300 compared to the nonphosphorylated form.</p>

<p>Overall, in either possible scenarios the total amount of RelA–TA2 bound to TAZ1 is significantly higher than that of RelA–RHR bound KIX, which should be reflected in a subset of RelA-activated genes that is regulated through RelA–TA2:TAZ1 interaction and is independent of p-Ser276–RelA:KIX binding.</p>

Interestingly, the RelA(Leu449Ala) mutant did not show any noticeable decrease in binding affinity, contrary to the impaired TAZ1 binding observed in our <italic>in vitro</italic> GST pulldown and ITC experiments. A possible explanation is that <italic>in vivo</italic> posttranslational modifications like the phosphorylation of the well-conserved Ser467 could potentially mitigate the effects of the Leu449 mutation, thus increasing binding affinity of the RelA–TA2 to TAZ1, as observed by ITC experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g003">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001647-t002">Table 2</xref>). Additionally, in the context of full-length RelA, the other domains of RelA could further influence the RelA–TA2:TAZ1 binding.</p>
<p>The above experiments established the minimal subset of mutations required in RelA to selectively prevent its interaction with the TAZ1 domain of CBP. These RelA mutants along with the RelA(Ser276Ala) were further tested for their interaction with endogenous CBP by coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP). Binding of all three RelA mutants [RelA(Leu449Ala+Phe473Ala), RelA(Leu449Ala+Ser467Ala+Phe473Ala), and RelA(Ser276Ala)] to endogenous CBP was impaired relative to RelA(wt) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). However, the disruption of either component of the RelA:CBP interaction—RHR:KIX or TA2:TAZ1—diminished but could not completely abrogate the entire RelA:CBP interaction. The RelA(Leu449Ala+Phe473Ala) and RelA(Ser276Ala) mutants were equally defective in binding to p300 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), whose TAZ1 domains share high sequence identity with CBP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Freedman1">[22]</xref>.</p>

<title>Role of RelA(Ser467) Phosphorylation in RelA:CBP/p300 Interaction</title>
<p>To further elucidate the role of Ser467 in RelA:CBP/p300 binding, we first studied the RelA(Ser467) phosphorylation event both spatially and temporally following TNFα stimulation. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001647.s006">Figure S6A</xref>, the amount of p-Ser467–RelA is negligible in the unstimulated cells. Phosphorylation increases within 5 min of TNFα stimulation, reaching its maximum at 10 to 15 min followed by gradual dephosphorylation starting at 20 min after stimulation. We confirmed the presence of p-Ser467–RelA exclusively in the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Moreno1">[34]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). The timing of RelA nuclear entry coincides with the p-Ser467–RelA maximum, indicating a possible correlation between the Ser467 phosphorylation event and an enhanced early RelA:CBP/p300 interaction. This correlation holds true only if Ser467 phosphorylation contributes towards increasing the affinity. To confirm this, co-IP experiments with α-CBP and α-p300 using NEs of RelA(wt) and RelA(Ser467Ala) mutants at three different time points after TNFα stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g004">Figure 4E</xref>) in addition to unstimulated condition were performed. Interestingly, in the RelA(wt) reconstituted cells, despite lower amounts of nRelA at 15 min than at 30 min of TNFα treatment, equivalent amounts of RelA co-immunoprecipitated with CBP/p300. The amount of nRelA bound to CBP/p300 at 45 min after TNFα stimulation diminished significantly. The nonlinearity of the amounts of nRelA co-immunoprecipitated with CBP/p300 with respect to the nRelA concentration is attributed to the enhanced binding affinity of p-Ser467–RelA for CBP/p300, as this nonlinearity was not observed for the identical experiment performed using RelA(Ser467Ala) mutant reconstituted <italic>rela</italic><sup>−</sup>/<sup>−</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g004">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001647.s006">Figure S6B</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the role of p-Ser467–RelA in RelA:CBP/p300 binding, RelA(Leu449Ala+Phe473Ala) mutant [henceforth known as the RelA(TA2) mutant] was selected for further gene expression experiments due to two reasons: First, it had the minimal number of mutations required to impair the RelA–TA2:TAZ1 interaction. Second, RelA(Ser467) is a key determining factor for various other processes in the NF-κB pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Saijo1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Mao1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Geng1">[36]</xref>, which could further complicate and lead to misinterpretation of our experimental observations.

The expression phenotype was determined for 99 genes that undergo at least 2-fold activation at 1 h of TNFα stimulation as compared to unstimulated RelA(wt) reconstituted <italic>rela</italic><sup>−</sup>/<sup>−</sup> cells. These TNFα-activated genes were grouped into four groups, A–D, based on the observed expression defect (with 95% confidence) with respect to RelA(wt), in the two distinct RelA:CBP/p300 interaction defective mutant cells (see main text). The gene list was sorted according to the differences between the RelA(wt) and RelA(TA2) mutant reconstituted cells at 1 h of TNFα treatment.

<p>Our qRT-PCR data demonstrated inducible expression for all of the genes in the chosen set following TNFα stimulation in the RelA(wt) reconstituted <italic>rela</italic><sup>−</sup>/<sup>−</sup> cells. However, the expression of all the nine genes was significantly diminished in the cells reconstituted with RelA(TA2) mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g005">Figure 5</xref>), suggesting that genes like <italic>ptgs2</italic> and <italic>nfkbia</italic>, which are believed to be independent of RelA:CBP/p300 interaction, are actually dependent on RelA:CBP/p300 binding through the RelA–TA2:TAZ1 component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, for the RelA(Ser276Ala) reconstituted cells, only seven of the nine genes displayed reduced gene expression.

The lower levels of <italic>nfkbia</italic> mRNA in the RelA(Ser276Ala) reconstituted cell line following TNFα stimulation as compared to those observed for RelA(wt) reconstituted cells could possibly be due to the lower expression of RelA(Ser276Ala) mutant in the cell relative to RelA(wt) and RelA(TA2) mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001647.s007">Figure S7</xref>).</p>

<title>Comparative Genome-Wide Expression Analysis Reveals That a Major Set of RelA Target Genes Is Regulated by the RelA–TA2:TAZ1 Interaction</title>
<p>To ascertain the effect of the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction on the RelA-regulated transcriptome, we carried out RNA-seq analysis of total mRNA isolated from RelA(wt/mutants) reconstituted cells prior to TNFα stimulation as well as at two different times points after TNFα stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). The set of genes activated upon TNFα stimulation was classified into four groups: Group A contains genes that are dependent on both the interaction components of the RelA:CBP/p300 complex. Group B contains those dependent only on the RelA–TA2:TAZ1 interaction. Group C contains genes that are dependent only on p-Ser276–RelA, and Group D contains TNFα activated genes, which are RelA regulated but are altogether independent of RelA:CBP/p300 interaction, or the genes that are activated by transcription factors other than RelA. The RNA-seq data revealed that a majority of the RelA:CBP/p300 target genes belong to Group B (25 genes) followed by Group A (20 genes) and Group C (six genes). A sizable number of RelA target genes belong to RelA:CBP/p300 independent Group D (48 genes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Based on these experiments, it is clear that the RelA–TA2:TAZ1 interaction regulates a subset of RelA target genes independent of p-Ser276–RelA. Thus, the subset of RelA-activated genes dependent on RelA:CBP/p300 interaction is much larger than previously believed.</p>
<p>The gene expression analysis revealed <italic>nfkbia</italic> (IκBα) and <italic>tnfaip3</italic> (A20), which control the negative feedback loop of the NF-κB pathway, are dependent on RelA:CBP/p300 interaction. IκBα essentially is the main NF-κB inhibitor, which strongly controls the negative feedback and is responsible for the fast turnoff of the NF-κB response after TNFα treatment in fibroblast cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Hoffmann1">[39]</xref>.

<title>RelA:CBP/p300 Interaction Regulates the Temporal Control of IκBα and nRelA</title>
<p>To study the effect of the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction on <italic>nfkbia</italic> expression in detail, we investigated the temporal profile of the IκBα protein in <italic>rela</italic><sup>−</sup>/<sup>−</sup> cells reconstituted with RelA(wt/mutants) following TNFα stimulation. This study was also performed to ensure that the RelA mutations did not interfere with the upstream NF-κB pathway in the cytoplasm or with the DNA binding property of RelA. <italic>nfkbia</italic> is a prominent RelA target gene, which has a robust NF-κB responsive promoter. IκBα is a strong negative regulator of nuclear NF-κB (nNF-κB) and hence a key determinant of the nNF-κB temporal profile <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Hoffmann1">[39]</xref>. The canonical NF-κB pathway stimulated by TNFα has been extensively studied and focuses on the activation of the IKK-IκB-NF-κB signaling module. A mathematical model, which accounts for experimentally observed nNF-κB activity and IκB expression profiles, has been established <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Werner1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Giorgetti1">[41]</xref>.

The protein expression levels of RelA(Ser276Ala) mutant was about three times lower than that for RelA(wt). For the quantitative estimation, the RelA to Actin signal ratio for each cell line was normalized with that for the RelA(wt) reconstituted <italic>rela</italic><sup>−</sup>/<sup>−</sup> cells (lower panel). (B) Model predictions for NF-κB (top) and total IκBα abundance (bottom) for different RelA expression levels (2×, 1.5×, 1×, 0.5×, and 0.2× relative to RelA(wt) values). In the nNF-κB curves, the peak is normalized to one for the highest level of nNF-κB activity and to zero for its levels in the resting cells (time = 0 min) for each individual expression level. Similarly, for the IκBα curves, the amount of IκBα in the resting cell (time = 0 min) is normalized to one and the minimum amount after degradation (basal levels) to zero following TNFα stimulation. (C) nRelA activity assay in response to TNFα stimulation as measured by EMSA using labeled κB probe and control NF-Y probe in the above-mentioned cells. The activity due to RelA binding to the κB probe was indicated by supershift of the EMSA band corresponding to the probe-bound NF-κB detected with anti-RelA antibody. 12 µg of NE was used for EMSA.

<p>We next compared the nuclear translocation of RelA and the temporal profile of IκBα protein following TNFα stimulation in <italic>rela</italic><sup>−</sup>/<sup>−</sup> cells reconstituted with wild-type or mutant RelA. To detect nNF-κB in NEs, the NF-κB DNA binding activity was measured by Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). nRelA levels were also monitored directly by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001647.s008">Figure S8</xref>). The time of entry of RelA(TA2) and RelA(Ser276Ala) mutants into the nucleus after TNFα stimulation is identical to that observed for RelA(wt). However, a prolonged nuclear residence time is observed for RelA(TA2) mutant relative to RelA(wt) reconstituted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g006">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001647.s008">Figure S8</xref>). We also performed similar time course experiments using the whole cell extracts (WEs) of the respective cells and monitored the IκBα protein levels by immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). While the time of IκBα degradation and RelA entry into the nucleus are identical in the RelA(wt), RelA(Ser276Ala) and RelA(TA2) mutant reconstituted <italic>rela</italic><sup>−</sup>/<sup>−</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g006">Figure 6C,D</xref>), the temporal profile of IκBα regeneration and the nuclear residence time of RelA differed significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g006">Figure 6C–E</xref>). For the RelA(TA2) mutant reconstituted cells, IκBα regeneration is delayed and does not reach its initial levels within the time course of the experiment. The RelA(Ser276Ala) mutant on the other hand did not show any significant delay in IκBα regeneration, although the IκBα level was reduced.</p>
<p>In order to address our observed results, we applied the available mathematical model of NF-κB regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Werner1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Giorgetti1">[41]</xref>. We assumed that all parameters other than the RelA protein abundance and its transcriptional activation potential remained unchanged in all of the RelA reconstituted <italic>rela</italic><sup>−</sup>/<sup>−</sup> cell lines. Identical IκBα degradation and nuclear translocation of RelA for the three cell lines validated our assumption (through 30 min after TNFα stimulation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g006">Figure 6C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001647.s008">Figure S8</xref>). Further, when the cell-line-specific RelA concentration estimates were incorporated into the model, the calculated profile for nNF-κB activity and IκBα abundance matched the experimental data of the RelA(Ser276Ala) mutant to a significant extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g006">Figure 6E</xref>, lowest panel), but did not resemble the observed profiles for the RelA(TA2) mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g006">Figure 6E</xref>, middle panel). The root mean square deviation (RMSD) was used as a measure of agreement between calculated and the observed data. The results suggest that the observed partial expression of <italic>nfkbia</italic> in RelA(Ser276Ala) mutant reconstituted cells in our qRT-PCR data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g005">Figure 5</xref>) was to a great extent due to lower expression of this RelA mutant in the cell line used here.</p>
<p>For the RelA(TA2) mutant, we investigated whether agreement between the experimentally observed and calculated data could be obtained by reducing the NF-κB-dependent IκBα mRNA production rate (k<sub>mRNA</sub>) parameter to 25%, 12.5%, or 6.25% of its value for RelA(wt) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g006">Figure 6F</xref>). We found that the lowest k<sub>mRNA</sub> of 6.25% of RelA(wt) produced the best superimposition of the calculated and experimentally determined temporal profiles of the nNF-κB activity and IκBα regeneration as determined by the RMSD score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g006">Figure 6F</xref>, top panel). It should be noted that the k<sub>mRNA</sub> is directly proportional to the transcriptional activation potential of nNF-κB. Our study suggests that the Leu449Ala and Phe473Ala mutations in RelA lower the transcriptional activation of NF-κB by impairing the RelA–TA2:TAZ1 component of RelA:CBP/p300 interaction.</p>
<p>From the above results we conclude that while <italic>nfkbia</italic> is dependent on RelA–TA2:TAZ1 interaction, it is independent of RelA–RHR:KIX interaction. Thus, our data show that disrupting the RelA–TA2:TAZ1 component of the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction disturbs the temporal profile of the nuclear activity of RelA by interfering with the negative feedback loop of the NF-κB pathway. This could further deregulate the expression of the subset of NF-κB-dependent genes, which are independent of the overall RelA:CBP/p300 interaction.</p>

<title>RelA:CBP/p300 Interaction at the RelA Target Promoters</title>
<p>To further understand the nature of RelA:CBP/p300 interaction on the chromatin, ChIP-qPCR assay was performed to analyze the chromatin at six RelA target genes in unstimulated and TNFα-stimulated RelA(wt/mutants) reconstituted <italic>rela</italic><sup>−</sup>/<sup>−</sup> cells. We examined the chromatin for RelA occupancy on its target promoter set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g007">Figures 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001647.s009">S9</xref>). As expected, we found that RelA(wt) was recruited to the promoters of all the six genes (although to a varied extent) at 30 min after TNFα treatment. This enrichment of RelA(wt) was diminished at 60 min after stimulation in congruence with its nuclear exit. The recruitment of RelA(TA2) and RelA(Ser276Ala) mutants to the promoter sites of highly expressed <italic>tnfaip3</italic>, <italic>nfkbia</italic>, and <italic>ptgs2</italic> was significantly reduced at 30 min following TNFα treatment compared to RelA(wt), while for the mutants there was no significant RelA signal detected on the promoters with low mRNA expression levels (<italic>cxcl2</italic>, <italic>csf2</italic>, and <italic>tnf</italic>). In agreement with the prolonged nuclear retention of RelA(TA2) mutant due to a defective negative feedback loop, reduced amounts of the RelA(TA2) mutant remained bound to the <italic>tnfaip3</italic>, <italic>nfkbia</italic>, and <italic>ptgs2</italic> promoters even at 60 min after stimulation. As indicated earlier, expression of <italic>tnfaip3</italic> and <italic>nfkbia</italic> were reduced but not completely eliminated. Therefore, the mRNA levels of the RelA target genes correlate well with the amounts of RelA recruited to their respective promoters. These results clearly indicate defects in promoter recruitment of RelA mutants despite their uncompromised DNA binding potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). This led us to hypothesize that CBP/p300 might be responsible for recruitment of RelA to its target gene promoters. If our hypothesis were true, then CBP/p300 should be constitutively loaded on the promoters and there should exist a direct correlation between the amounts of CBP/p300 present on the promoters to that of RelA recruited upon stimulation. To test our hypothesis, the chromatins were analyzed for CBP/p300 enrichment for our promoter set. The results show CBP/p300 enriched on all of the promoters to a varied extent, with no significant change upon TNFα stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g007">Figures 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001647.s009">S9</xref>).

<p>Since acetylation of histone-3 (H3) at Lys27 by CBP/p300 is a characteristic of active genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Holmqvist1">[44]</xref>, we further examined the levels of H3 occupancy and compared them with that of acetylated histone H3 at Lys 27 (H3K27ac). We expected to observe increased H3K27ac signals on the promoters only after TNFα treatment as a mark of activated promoters as compared to those in unstimulated cells. To our surprise we found H3K27ac enriched in the unstimulated promoters, whose levels remained constant even after TNFα stimulation. Additionally, the H3K27ac levels were directly proportional to the amount of CBP/p300 present on the specific promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). This suggests that CBP/p300 bound to promoters of RelA targets is poised for transcription initiation. Upon nuclear entry RelA is recruited to its respective promoter targets by CBP/p300, which is preloaded on these sites, leading to transcription activation.</p>
<p>Upon TNFα stimulation in RelA(TA2) or RelA(Ser276Ala) mutant reconstituted <italic>rela</italic><sup>−</sup>/<sup>−</sup> cells, the mRNA expression levels of the highly expressed genes like <italic>tnfaip3</italic> and <italic>nfkbia</italic> registered only partial reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). This is because of a reduced but significant amount of RelA recruited to their respective promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Both the promoters also maintain high levels of CBP/p300, thereby leading to recruitment of the RelA(TA2) and RelA(Ser276Ala) mutants, which possess reduced but significant CBP/p300 binding affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g004">Figure 4C,D</xref>). This further proves that the RelA-dependent gene expression is regulated by the total amount of RelA recruited on the promoter by CBP/p300.</p>
<p>Overall our study indirectly shows that CBP/p300, which marks the promoter/enhancers of genes, also aids in recruiting RelA to the promoters of its target genes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have provided the structural basis and the functional role of the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction in RelA-driven transcription. In the RelA–TA2:TAZ1 structure, the RelA–TA2 region binds within a series of interlinked hydrophobic grooves that spiral almost entirely around the globular TAZ1 domain. Due to the intrinsically disordered nature of the RelA–TA2 region, binding of an elongated ∼50 amino acid region to TAZ1 in a relatively extended configuration can be accomplished without the energetic cost that would be incurred if unfolding of preexisting globular structure was required. The interaction is mediated primarily by hydrophobic residues interspersed with acidic residues located in the RelA–TA2 region, which dock in the hydrophobic pockets in the surface of TAZ1. While RelA becomes more ordered upon interaction with TAZ1, only limited, highly localized secondary structure is formed. Contacts between the N-terminal part of the RelA–TA2 and TAZ1 are dynamic, contributing little to binding affinity, and are an example of what is frequently termed a “fuzzy” interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Tompa1">[45]</xref>. The hydrophobic contacts are complemented by electrostatic interactions involving the many acidic residues in the RelA–TA2 region. Disruption of any of the hydrophobic contacts leads to a significant decrease in binding affinity toward TAZ1. This is due to the destabilization of the ordered RelA–TA2 structure held primarily by the exposed hydrophobic grooves of TAZ1. Upon disruption of any of the anchor points, RelA–TA2 in absence of any highly stabilized secondary structural elements regains its highly dynamic unstructured high-energy state. This leads to destabilization of the complex and a decrease in TAZ1 binding affinity. Disruption of the hydrophobic anchors of RelA–TA2 can also destabilize the hydrophobic core of TAZ1, which is otherwise stabilized to a significant extent on complex formation with RelA–TA2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001647.s011">Figure S11</xref>). This interlinked core of TAZ1 holds the entire RelA–TA2 region in the complex as seen through the contacts of the core elements with the anchoring residues of RelA–TA2.</p>
<p>The mode of binding of the TAZ1 domain to RelA–TA2 is closely analogous to its interactions with the transactivation domains of the HIF-1α, CITED2, and STAT2 proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Dames1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-DeGuzman1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Freedman2">[46]</xref>. In particular, RelA binds in the same hydrophobic grooves as the HIF-1α C-terminal activation domain but in the reverse orientation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Dames1">[21]</xref>, despite the fact that the two proteins share no common sequence motifs and do not interact with TAZ1 through common secondary structures. A salient property of TAZ1 is its ability to interact with long, negatively charged 40–50 residue regions of intrinsically disordered proteins that dock in the narrow hydrophobic grooves in its surface. This interaction is further enhanced by the phosphorylation of Ser467, thereby adding another layer of regulation for a subset of early response target genes of RelA following TNFα stimulation. Similar phosphorylation events are observed in other transcription factors, which influence their interaction with CBP/p300 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Ferreon1">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Lee2">[48]</xref>.</p>
<p>To date, inducible phosphorylation of Ser276 is considered to be the decisive factor for the recruitment of CBP/p300 by RelA for the transcriptional activation of RelA-dependent genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Dong1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Zhong1">[20]</xref>. Earlier studies have shown that in the absence of Ser276 phosphorylation, histone deacetylases (HDACs) could remain bound to nNF-κB and lead to the repression of NF-κB-dependent genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Dong1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Zhong2">[49]</xref>. Upon phosphorylation at Ser276, RelA readily recruits CBP/p300, which in turn acetylates RelA at Lys310, which is further required for the transcription of a subset of RelA-dependent genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Chen1">[50]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Chen2">[51]</xref>. Our experiments show that a major subset of TNFα-inducible genes is dependent on the RelA–TA2:TAZ1 interaction. Importantly, a significant number of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, Group B genes) are activated independently of Ser276 phosphorylation. For these genes the requirement of p-Ser276–RelA could be compensated by a synergy between multiple protein factors (including transcription factors) and RelA. A similar mechanism was previously observed for <italic>cxcl2</italic> and <italic>nfkbia</italic> transcription, where the requirement for RelA:TRAP-80 interaction was waived for the expression of these genes through the recruitment of secondary transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-vanEssen1">[16]</xref>. Similarly, for <italic>tnfaip3</italic> transcription, the constitutive transcription factor Sp1 plays an important role in synergy with RelA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Ainbinder1">[52]</xref>. Moreover, the location of Ser276 in the DD of RelA could potentially influence the selectivity of its dimer formation with other NF-κB family members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Jacque1">[53]</xref>. Additionally, the proximity of Ser276 to DNA binding residues of RelA could further impact the κB site selectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Anrather1">[54]</xref>, thereby leading to differential gene expression and/or compensating for the RelA–RHR:KIX interaction.</p>
<p>In this study, for the first time we show that the negative feedback loop is directly controlled by RelA:CBP/p300 interaction through the expression of <italic>nfkbia</italic>. Similarly, A20 protein (<italic>tnfaip3</italic> gene product), another regulator of the negative feedback loop of the NF-κB pathway, is also directly controlled by RelA:CBP/p300 interaction. The impaired negative feedback loop can impact the expression profile of TNFα-induced genes. The longer residence time of RelA in the nucleus can prolong the activation of the genes that are independent of RelA:CBP/p300 interaction.</p>
<p>RelA is believed to recruit co-activator CBP/p300 to the gene promoters for transcription activation of its target genes. On the other hand, recent ChIP-seq and ChIP-chip studies have established p300 as a mark for the enhancers/promoters of active/poised genes throughout the genome including those for RelA target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Visel1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Jin1">[13]</xref>. However, the mechanism of its recruitment by RelA to the promoters remains to be established. In this study, we found that CBP/p300 was constitutively enriched on the RelA target promoters as against the TNFα-induced recruitment of RelA to these sites. This points towards a role played by CBP/p300 in recruitment of RelA to its target promoters. Although we have tested only a small set of RelA target promoters, our observation is consistent with the report by Jin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Jin1">[13]</xref>, where they could accurately predict the target selection by NF-κB in a cell-type-specific manner only when experimentally determined p300 enrichment of promoters was considered along with κB motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Chen3">[55]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001647-Sen1">[56]</xref> along the human genome.</p>

(D) GST-pulldown experiment for studying the importance of the five amino acids at the C-terminal end of the RelA fragment binding to TAZ1. (E) Gel filtration elution profile of CBP–TAZ1 domain, RelA–TA2 fragment, and RelA–TA2:CBP–TAZ1 complex. The RelA–TA2 fragment was detected at 215 nm due to lack of tyrosine and tryptophan residues. RelA–TA2:TAZ1 complex and free TAZ1 were detected at 280 nm. A slight excess of TAZ1 was used for the complex formation as can be seen in the elution profile of the complex. (F) Gel filtration elution characteristics of CBP–TAZ1 domain, RelA–TA2 fragment, and RelA–TA2:CBP–TAZ1 complex. The observed molecular weight of RelA–TA2 fragment is about 3 times that of its calculated molecular weight, which further confirms the unstructured nature of RelA–TA2 concluded from its [<sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H]-HSQC spectra in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001647-g001">Figure 1C</xref>.
