        <p>ATP-dependent nucleosome-remodeling enzymes and covalent modifiers of chromatin set the functional state of chromatin. However, how these enzymatic activities are coordinated in the nucleus is largely unknown. We found that the evolutionary conserved nucleosome-remodeling ATPase ISWI and the poly-ADP-ribose polymerase PARP genetically interact. We present evidence showing that ISWI is target of poly-ADP-ribosylation. Poly-ADP-ribosylation counteracts ISWI function in vitro and in vivo. Our work suggests that ISWI is a physiological target of PARP and that poly-ADP-ribosylation can be a new, important post-translational modification regulating the activity of ATP-dependent nucleosome remodelers.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Eukaryotic chromatin is packaged in a highly organized hierarchy of structural building blocks, all composed of the basic repeating unit of the nucleosome. ATP-dependent nucleosome-remodeling activities as well as covalent modifications of chromatin components underlie the dynamic nature of chromatin structure and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b002">2</xref>]. Although it is expected that a crosstalk should exist between ATP-dependent remodelers and covalent modifiers of chromatin, very little is known about how these activities are integrated and coordinated with each other.</p>
      <p>ISWI is the catalytic subunit of several ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling complexes. ISWI is highly conserved during evolution and is essential for cell viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b003">3</xref>]. ISWI-containing complexes are thought to play central roles in DNA replication, gene expression, and chromosome organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b004">4</xref>]. ISWI uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to catalyze nucleosome spacing and sliding reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b003">3</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, loss of ISWI function causes global transcription defects and leads to dramatic alterations in higher-order chromatin structure, including the apparent decondensation of both mitotic and interphase chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b006">6</xref>]. Recent findings indicate that ISWI controls chromosome compaction in vivo, in part through its ability to promote chromatin association with the linker histone H1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b005">5</xref>].</p>
      <p>In vitro and in vivo studies carried out in several model organisms have also shown the involvement of ISWI complexes in a variety of nuclear functions including telomere silencing, stem cell self-renewal, neural morphogenesis, and the epigenetic reprogramming that occurs during nuclear transfer in animal cloning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b008">8</xref>]. Remarkably, inactivation of ISWI interferes with the Ras pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b009">9</xref>], and loss of ISWI function seems to be associated with a subset of melanotic tumors and the human multi-systemic disease Williams-Beuren syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b010">10</xref>].</p>
      <p>The variety of functions associated with ISWI activity are probably connected to the ability of other cellular factors to regulate its ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activity. Indeed, nucleosome spacing reactions catalyzed by ISWI can be regulated by its associated subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b011">11</xref>]. However, evidences in vitro and in vivo indicate that ISWI activity can also be directly regulated by acetylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b012">12</xref>] and site-specific acetylation of histones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b013">13</xref>]. We recently found that ISWI function could be modulated in vivo by a variety of cellular factors that escaped previous biochemical analyses. Indeed, in an unbiased genetic screen for factors modifying phenotypes caused by loss of <italic>ISWI</italic> function, we identified new potential regulators of ISWI in the higher eukaryote <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b014">14</xref>].</p>
      <p>One class of mutants isolated in the screen is made up of chromatin components and nuclear enzymatic activities that could regulate ISWI function by covalently modifying histones or ISWI itself. In this class we found mutants in the gene encoding for the poly-ADP-ribose polymerase—<italic>Parp</italic>—and the gene encoding for poly-ADP-ribose glycohydrolase—<italic>Parg</italic>—[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b014">14</xref>], two conserved nuclear enzymes that catalyze the transfer and the removal, respectively, of ADP-ribose units to a wide variety of target proteins, using NAD<sup>+</sup> as a substrate, to regulate chromatin accessibility in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b015">15</xref>]. The activities of PARP and PARG have been implicated in modulating chromatin structure, gene expression and the response to DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b018">18</xref>].</p>
      <p>The genetic interactions identified between <italic>ISWI</italic>, <italic>Parp</italic>, and <italic>Parg</italic> suggest that poly-ADP-ribosylation reactions could be coordinated and integrated within the activity of the ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling factor ISWI. Here we present data showing that the nucleosome remodeling factor ISWI is poly-ADP-ribosylated in vitro and in vivo<italic>.</italic> The poly-ADP-ribosylation of ISWI inhibits its ATPase activity by reducing the affinity of ISWI with its nucleosomal substrate. We found that ISWI and PARP bind different chromatin domains and that the in vivo induction of chromatin poly-ADP-ribosylation results in loss of ISWI chromatin binding, suggesting that poly-ADP-ribosylation of ISWI might favor its dissociation from chromatin. One of the central questions in the study of PARP biology is the functional role played by the poly-ADP-ribose as a covalent epigenetic mark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b022">22</xref>]. Our data suggest a molecular mechanism to explain the coordinated functions played by ISWI and PARP in the regulation of chromatin organization in vivo, providing the first example, to our knowledge, of post-translational regulation of an ATP-dependent remodeler function by poly-ADP-ribosylation.</p>

        <title>ISWI Localizes to Distinct Domains from PARP and PARylated Chromatin Proteins on Polytene Chromosomes</title>
        <p><italic>Drosophila</italic> has a single PARP gene that spans more than 150 kb of transposon-rich centromeric heterochromatin, which is highly related to the mammalian PARP-1 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b015">15</xref>]. The NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent activity of PARP is reversed by PARG, a poly-ADP-ribose glycohydrolase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b015">15</xref>]. PARP activity in flies has been associated with the loosening of chromatin structure that precedes gene expression at heat shock puffs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b019">19</xref>]. On the contrary, ISWI preferentially associates with transcriptionally silent chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b021">21</xref>], indicating that PARP and ISWI may play opposite roles in regulating chromosome structure and gene expression.</p>
        <p>Given that ISWI and PARP are both chromatin components with enzymatic activity, one possible molecular explanation for the observed genetic interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060252-sg001">Figure S1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b014">14</xref>] could be that PARP regulates ISWI function by covalently modifying chromatin components to which ISWI binds. Double immunostaining on wild-type polytene chromosomes with antibodies directed against ISWI and PARP shows that localization of the two proteins is largely nonoverlapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g001">1</xref>D). We also examined PARP binding in salivary gland polytene chromosomes prepared from transheterozygous <italic>ISWI<sup>1</sup>/ISWI<sup>2</sup></italic> null mutant male third-instar larvae. In <italic>ISWI</italic> mutant chromosomes, showing chromosome condensation defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g001">Figure 1</xref>F) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b006">6</xref>], PARP binding levels do not change significantly as compared to wild-type chromosomes (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g001">1</xref>B with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g001">Figure 1</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g001">1</xref>F).</p>

        <p>The observation that PARP- and ISWI-bound chromatin domains appear to be nonoverlapping does not exclude the possibility that ISWI binds poly-ADP-ribosylated (PARylated) chromatin domains from which PARP has dissociated. Therefore we conducted double immunostaining with antibodies directed against ISWI and poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) to examine how the pattern of ISWI binding to chromatin domains is correlated with that of PARylated chromatin proteins. We found that like PARP itself, PARylated chromatin proteins show mainly nonoverlapping binding patterns with ISWI on wild-type polytene chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g002">2</xref>F). As with PARP binding, PARylated protein binding levels in ISWI mutant chromosomes do not change significantly when compared to wild-type chromosomes (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g002">2</xref>B with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g002">Figure 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g002">2</xref>D; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060252-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A).

        <title>ISWI Misexpression Causes Over-PARylation of Distinct Chromatin Components</title>
        <p>To better understand the functional relationship existing between the nuclear enzymatic activities of ISWI and PARP, we examined whether PARylation levels and distributions are altered by increasing the levels of chromatin-bound ISWI. Double-immunostaining with antibodies directed against PAR and ISWI shows that ISWI is overloaded on polytene chromosomes misexpressing wild-type ISWI, as compared to control chromosomes misexpressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). The increase in chromatin-bound ISWI is accompanied by a massive increase in PARylation of chromosomes. This hyper-PARylation is not dependent on ISWI ATPase activity, because misexpression of the enzymatically inactive ISWI<sup>K159R</sup> protein has a similar effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Thus, over-PARylation of chromosomes probably occurs as a consequence of the physical binding of a nonphysiological amount of ISWI on chromatin rather than as an indirect response to an increase in ISWI activity. One interesting possibility is that increased PARylation of chromatin-bound proteins, which might include ISWI itself, could be a homeostatic response designed to counteract excessive ISWI chromosome binding.</p>

        <p>Therefore, we conducted immunoprecipitations on protein extracts derived from salivary glands misexpressing ISWI.

        <title>ISWI Is Poly-ADP-Ribosylated In Vitro</title>
        <p>We next explored whether the ISWI PARylation observed in vivo could be recapitulated in vitro. Classic in vitro PARylation assays show that purified PARP is enzymatically active, showing specificity for proteins that are known to be bona fide in vivo and in vitro substrates. Since the number of PAR moieties added to a substrate by PARP is variable and generates branched polymers of ADP-ribose, PARylation in vitro is detected as a signal smearing upward from the molecular weight of the modified target protein. As evidenced by the characteristic smears in an aPAR Western blot of proteins incubated with or without PARP, and the AuroDye staining of the blotted membrane showing the protein migration in the blot, the purified PARP enzyme is able to PARylate histones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g004">Figure 4</xref>B, compare lanes 1 and 2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b023">23</xref>] and the recombinant p53 tumor suppressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g004">Figure 4</xref>B, compare lanes 3 and 4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b024">24</xref>] However, PARP shows no activity toward the recombinant p50 subunit of the NFκB complex which is not a target of PARP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g004">Figure 4</xref>B, compare lanes 7 and 8) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b025">25</xref>], while a low-background signal, derived from self-PARylation, is apparent when the same amount of PARP was incubated alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g004">Figure 4</xref>B, lane 9). Remarkably, when recombinant ISWI and PARP are incubated together, ISWI PARylation is visible as a strong smear that extends upward from the position of unmodified recombinant ISWI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g004">Figure 4</xref>B, compare lanes 5 and 6). Thus our PARylation assay clearly indicates that ISWI is a specific substrate of PARP in vitro.</p>
        <p>To identify the ISWI protein domain that is the target of PARylation, we set up PARylation assays on recombinant truncated forms of ISWI. <italic>Drosophila</italic> ISWI can be divided in two parts: the N-terminal portion containing the ATPase domain and the C-terminal portion containing the SANT and SLIDE domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060252-sg002">Figure S2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g004">Figure 4</xref>G) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b041">41</xref>]. We found that the N-terminal portion of ISWI is specifically PARylated in vitro, whereas the C-terminal portion is not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Since, both the N- and C-terminal of ISWI contribute to the interaction with nucleosomal DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b041">41</xref>], our data suggest that PARylation of the N-terminal fragment could target the nucleosomal DNA recognition element of ISWI present in the ATPase domain.</p>

        <title>PARP Associates with ISWI In Vitro</title>
        <p>If one of the enzymatic targets of PARP is ISWI, we should be able to monitor a physical interaction between the two proteins in vitro or in vivo. Immunoprecipitations conducted on wild-type larval nuclear extracts using antibodies directed against ISWI, or on extract derived from HA-epitope tagged ISWI using the aHA antibody, failed to detect a direct physical association between ISWI and PARP (unpublished data). Since PARP has been shown to be dynamically associated with its target sites on chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b026">26</xref>], we may not be able to detect a direct physical interaction with ISWI from crude nuclear extracts. Therefore, we decided to monitor in vitro the association of PARP with ISWI, by pull-down experiments using purified PARP and FLAG-epitope tagged recombinant ISWI. In the absence of DNA, the aFLAG-coupled resin can pull down FLAG-tagged ISWI together with a discrete amount of PARP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g004">Figure 4</xref>F, lanes 3 and 4). When DNA is included in the binding reaction, the enzymatic activity of PARP is stimulated, as show by the self PARylation of PARP and the PARylation of ISWI detected with aPARP and aISWI antibodies, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g004">Figure 4</xref>F, compare lanes 1 and 5). Remarkably, in the presence of DNA, the fraction of PARP that is found associated with ISWI is dramatically decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g004">Figure 4</xref>F, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 7 and 8). Interestingly, the residual fraction of PARP that associates with ISWI in the presence of DNA does not appear strongly PARylated, suggesting that actively PARylating PARP does not preferentially associates with ISWI, probably explaining PARP dynamic association with its chromatin targets observed in vivo as well as our failure to detect PARP–ISWI interaction by immunoprecipitation from crude protein extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g004">Figure 4</xref>F, compare lanes 5 with 7 and 8).</p>

        <p>Interestingly, ISWI activity in the presence of PARP is reduced by ∼60% for DNA-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g005">Figure 5</xref>A, compare lanes 2 and 4), and ∼40% for nucleosome-stimulated ATPase activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, compare lanes 2 and 4). The observed inhibition correlates with PARylation of ISWI, as indicated by aPAR Western blot analysis and the AuroDye staining of the blotted membrane of the same samples. We were unable to reverse the PARP-dependent ATPase inhibition of ISWI in the presence of 3-aminobenzammide (3-AB), a competitive inhibitor of PARP, in the reaction. However, this is because the amount of 3-AB that is sufficient to inhibit PARP activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g005">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g005">5</xref>B, lane 5), also strongly inhibits ISWI ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g005">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g005">5</xref>B, lane 6).</p>
        <p>Therefore, to verify that the ISWI ATPase inhibition was caused specifically by PARP activity, we lowered ∼50× the amount of PARP in the ATPase/PARylation assay (molar ratio ISWI/PARP ∼133). At these levels, PARP can be inhibited by 3-AB concentrations that are not inhibitory for ISWI ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g005">Figure 5</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g005">5</xref>D, open square graph). Even this very low amount of PARP exerts an inhibitory effect on both ISWI DNA-dependent and chromatin-stimulated ATPase activity over a 120-min time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g005">Figure 5</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g005">5</xref>D, compare filled diamond with filled triangle graphs). Furthermore, under these conditions, 3-AB reverses the effect of PARP, indicating that ISWI ATPase inhibition is specifically caused by PARP activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g005">Figure 5</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g005">5</xref>D, open triangle graph).</p>
        <p>Although chromatin stimulates the ATPase activity of ISWI ∼10 fold more then DNA, we observed a lower inhibition of ISWI by PARP in the presence of chromatin. However, a lower inhibition with the substrate that is able to stimulate more the ATPase activity of ISWI is expected. In fact, during the ATPase/PARylation reaction, the fraction of ISWI that is not yet PARylated should have a higher ATPase activity in the presence of chromatin than with DNA, thus explaining the lower inhibition observed in the presence of chromatin in our assay.</p>
        <p>During the ATPase/PARylation reaction, PARP can also generate free soluble PAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b018">18</xref>]. The PAR that is not covalently attached to ISWI could in theory account for the observed PARP-dependent ISWI ATPase inhibition. We show that under the conditions in which we conducted the ATPase/PARylation assay, free PAR cannot account for the observed ISWI ATPase inhibition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060252-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). Thus, we conclude that it is indeed the specific PARylation of ISWI that inhibits its DNA and nucleosome-stimulated ATPase activity.</p>

        <title>PARylation of ISWI Inhibits DNA and Nucleosome Binding</title>
        <p>The inhibition of ISWI ATPase activity by PARP could indicate either that the PARylation of ISWI directly blocks its ATPase activity after DNA or nucleosome recognition, or that this posttranslational modification counteracts ISWI ability to productively interact with its substrates. To distinguish between such alternatives and gain deeper insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibition of ISWI ATPase upon PARylation, we conducted nucleosome shift assays in which a mononucleosome-enriched polynucleosome fraction purified by sucrose gradient was used as binding substrate with increasing amounts of ISWI, in the presence or absence of PARP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060252-sg005">Figure S5</xref>A).</p>
        <p>Under the reaction conditions used, in the absence of PARP, a molar excess of ∼8 fold ISWI/nucleosomes is sufficient to shift the migration of the bulk of the nucleosome population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). In contrast, when PARP is included in the bandshift reaction, the mass excess of ISWI necessary to shift all the nucleosomes is at least 2-fold greater (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g006">Figure 6</xref>A).

        <p>To exclude the idea that posttranslational modifications of the histones—present in the purified polynucleosome fraction used as substrate—contribute to this effect, we repeated the bandshift experiments using a mononucleosome that was assembled in vitro by salt dialysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). As with the polynucleosomes, a molar excess of less than 8-fold ISWI/nucleosome is sufficient to up-shift the recombinant mononucleosome if PARP is absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). However, when PARP is added to the bandshift reaction, there is no sign of change in migration of the DNA–protein complexes even at ISWI/nucleosome mass excess of ∼16-fold and a molar ratio ISWI/nucleosome of ∼32-fold is necessary to start to appreciate a nucleosome shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g006">Figure 6</xref>B and unpublished data). Both the inhibition of PARP on ISWI binding to the purified poly-nucleosomes, and the more pronounced effect on recombinant mononucleosomes, are completely reversed by the addition of 3-AB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g006">Figure 6</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g006">6</xref>B).</p>
        <p>Core histones present in purified polynucleosomes, and in vitro assembled mononucleosomes can be themselves a target of PARylation and contribute to the reduction in nucleosome affinity observed with ISWI and PARP. However, ISWI DNA bandshift assays in the presence of PARP show a reduction in DNA affinity similar to the one observed with nucleosomal DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060252-sg003">Figure S3</xref>D), indirectly suggesting that histone PARylation does not contribute to the reduction in nucleosome affinity observed with PARylated ISWI.</p>
        <p>To exclude directly the idea that histone PARylation might contribute to the observed loss of affinity of ISWI for nucleosomes in the presence of PARP, we first PARylated ISWI and then conducted the nucleosome binding step in the presence of 3-AB, to prevent PARylation of histones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060252-sg005">Figure S5</xref>B). The presence of DNA, to first stimulate PARP activity in the absence of nucleosomes, causes an apparent loss of affinity of ISWI for purified polynucleosomes or in vitro–assembled mononucleosomes due to binding competition. Indeed, a 32-fold ISWI/nucleosome is necessary to shift poly- and mononucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g006">Figure 6</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g006">6</xref>D). As previously observed, when PARP is added to the bandshift reaction under conditions in which both histones and ISWI could be target of PARylation, there is no sign of poly- and mononucleosome shift even with a 32-fold ISWI/nucleosome ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g006">Figure 6</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g006">6</xref>D). Remarkably, when ISWI is PARylated and 3-AB is included to prevent PARylation of histones, we observe a loss of affinity of ISWI with poly- and mononucleosomes that is indistinguishable from conditions when both histones and ISWI could be subjected to PARylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g006">Figure 6</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g006">6</xref>D). Our data strongly suggest that PARylation of ISWI is sufficient to reduce its affinity with nucleosomal DNA, which in turn may be responsible for the observed reduction in ATPase activity.</p>

        <p>If PARP inhibits ISWI ATPase activity, by reducing nucleosome affinity through ISWI PARylation as suggested by our in vitro data, we would predict that the loss of PARP function in vivo might result in an increase of chromatin-bound ISWI.

        <p>Given that PARylation of ISWI causes a reduced affinity for nucleosomes in vitro, and that loss of PARP function is correlated with an increase in ISWI chromatin binding, we might also expect that an increase in PARP activity at specific chromosome domains should result in loss of ISWI binding from the same domains. The dual detection by immuno-FISH of the <italic>hsp70</italic> genes at cytological location 87A and 87C and ISWI has allowed us to establish that in the absence of heat shock conditions, ISWI very reproducibly binds the <italic>hsp70</italic> locus at 87A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g007">Figure 7</xref>B, arrowhead). However, upon heat shock, the <italic>hsp70</italic> loci acquire elevated levels of PARylated chromatin components and PARP is required in the process of chromatin decondensation that manifests itself as localized heat shocked puffs (see DAPI in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g007">Figure 7</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060252-sg006">Figure S6</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060252-sg006">S6</xref>B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b019">19</xref>]. Remarkably, after PARylation of chromatin is induced by heat shock, among other loci we observe that the specific binding of ISWI at 87A is lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g007">Figure 7</xref>C, arrowhead). If, upon heat-shock, PARP activity removes ISWI chromatin binding at the 87A <italic>hsp70</italic> locus, we would predict that in the <italic>Parp</italic> mutant, ISWI should remain bound to chromatin after heat shock. Indeed, in <italic>Parp</italic> mutant polytene chromosomes ISWI remains bound to the <italic>hsp70</italic> locus 87A after heat shock (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060252-sg006">Figure S6</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060252-sg006">S6</xref>D). In line with these findings, in heat-shocked salivary gland protein extracts, the amount of PARylated ISWI is significantly higher than in extracts obtained under non–heat-shocked conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g007">Figure 7</xref>D).</p>
        <p>Our data indicate that binding of ISWI to the <italic>hsp70</italic> gene can be counteracted by PARylation of chromatin at the 87A locus and that the loss of ISWI binding upon heat shock is a physiological response that is directly dependent upon the activity of PARP. Since ISWI is a target of PARylation both in vitro and in vivo, we propose that upon heat shock, ISWI bound at the <italic>hsp70</italic> locus could be among the chromatin components that get PARylated and this in turn promotes its release from chromatin.</p>

        <title>PARP and ISWI Could Compete for Common Chromatin Target Sites</title>
        <p>PARP is an abundant nuclear protein that plays important roles in multiple DNA repair pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b017">17</xref>]. Interestingly, high PARP enzymatic activity has also been observed in chromosomal sites where high transcriptional activity is occurring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b017">17</xref>]. One main goal in the study of the diverse physiological roles of PARP is the identification of molecular determinants that can stimulate PARP, besides DNA damage. Recently, it has been shown that PARP activity, in the absence of DNA damage, can be stimulated by transcription-coupled, TopoIIb-dependent transient double-stranded DNA breaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b027">27</xref>].</p>
        <p>Interestingly, nucleosomal histone H4 amino terminal tails have been shown to also activate PARP activity in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b026">26</xref>]. Remarkably, the amino termini of histone H4 also stimulates ISWI activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b028">28</xref>], whereas PARP's NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent activity is known to be inhibited by ATP, a substrate of ISWI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b029">29</xref>]. Moreover, ISWI and PARP have opposing effects on the binding of the linker histone H1 to chromatin; human PARP-1 competes with H1 for binding to the nucleosome linkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b031">31</xref>], while ISWI promotes chromosome condensation through the loading of histone H1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b005">5</xref>]. PARP and H1 exhibit a reciprocal pattern of chromatin binding at many RNA polymerase II–transcribed promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b031">31</xref>]. Therefore, one intriguing possibility is that PARP activity can counteract ISWI function. Indeed, ISWI and PARP appear to compete for common chromatin target sites, as supported by their nonoverlapping chromatin binding patterns. The antagonistic dominant action of PARP over ISWI may help to promote transcription at specific chromatin sites by opening chromatin and blocking higher order chromatin structure formation by ISWI, although PARP has also been shown to directly promote the formation of compact, transcriptionally repressed chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b030">30</xref>].</p>

        <title>Poly-ADP-Ribosylation Can Regulate ATP-Dependent Nucleosome Remodeler</title>
        <p>We found that ISWI is PARylated in vivo and in vitro, revealing the molecular basis of the genetic interaction we found between <italic>ISWI</italic> and <italic>Parp</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b014">14</xref>]. We show that PARylation of ISWI inhibits both its ATPase activity and its chromatin binding, in vitro and in vivo. Although, the PARylation of ISWI reduces its chromatin-stimulated ATPase activity by ∼40%, PARylated ISWI reduces its affinity for nucleosomes by nearly 10-fold. These differences can be explained by the different nature of the ATPase/PARylation and band shift assays. In contrast with the band shift assay, during the enzymatic ATPase/PARylation assay, the fraction of ISWI that is not yet PARylated can be strongly and rapidly stimulated by nucleosomes, thus masking the strong inhibition exerted by PARP on the PARylated ISWI fraction.</p>
        <p>PARP is in a dynamic equilibrium between its chromatin-bound and free nucleoplasm form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b026">26</xref>]. Indeed, our in vitro data indicate that the interaction between active PARP and ISWI is likely to be transient, highlighting the dynamic nature of this functional interaction. PARP can promote or inhibit chromatin binding of a variety of nuclear factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b033">33</xref>]. The finding that PARylation of ISWI lowers its affinity for chromatin suggests a molecular explanation for the mutually exclusive patterns of ISWI and PARP on wild-type polytene chromosomes, although other mechanisms probably regulate chromatin binding of the two proteins in vivo.</p>
        <p>Cross-linking studies have shown that ISWI contacts the nucleosome at two locations: (i) on the linker DNA near the nucleosome entry/exit site, and (ii) at an internal site about two turns from the nucleosomal dyad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b034">34</xref>]. Because ISWI needs some overhanging piece of DNA to remodel nucleosome, the inhibition of both ISWI-specific DNA and nucleosome stimulated ATPase upon PARylation probably reflects the reduced affinity of PARylated ISWI for free DNA and nucleosomal DNA that we observed in vitro. Indeed, under the conditions we conducted the <italic>ISWI<sup>K159R</sup></italic> screen, we found that the EP3570 insertion in the <italic>Parp</italic> gene can increase the level of chromatin PARylation, thus reducing ISWI binding on polytene chromosome. On the other hand, the observation that over-expression of ISWI leads to an increase in chromatin-bound PARylated ISWI does not contradict this model; PARylation of ISWI only lowers its affinity for chromatin, but does not entirely prevent it from binding in vitro.</p>
        <p>It is generally accepted that PARP plays roles in both local chromatin remodeling and the recruitment/modulation of the activity of various factors involved in DNA replication, repair, transcription, and recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b018">18</xref>].</p>
        <p>Our work presents the first example of a nucleosome remodeling activity being regulated by PARylation and the first insight into the mechanism of regulation of a chromatin remodeler by PARP activity. Although our data suggest that the modulation of ISWI activity by poly-ADP-ribosylation could be a key regulatory step acting in the context of the heat-shock induction of the <italic>hsp</italic> loci in flies, further studies will be necessary to fully understand the evolutionary conservation of this mechanism and other physiological context in which ISWI regulation by PARP occurs.</p>

        <p>The standard reaction (14 μl) contained 4 nmol of ISWI, 6.6 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 0.66 mM EDTA, 0.66 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.033 % NP-40, 1.1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 33 μM ATP, 5 μCi [γ-<sup>33</sup>P]ATP-3000 mmol-1 (GE Healthcare). Either 1 μg of activated DNA (Trevigen) or 100 ng of in vitro assembled chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b039">39</xref>] was used as substrate. In ATPase assays containing PARP, the mix was added with 1X PARP cocktail and 8 μl 100mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 1mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1mM DTT. The chromatin used as substrate in these assays was treated with UV (290–320 nm) for 20 min on ice. In ATPase time course assays, 0.03 nmol of PARP and 0.14 mM 3-AB were used. In all other ATPase assays, the samples contained 1.5 nmol PARP and 14 mM 3-AB. Unreacted ATP and free γ-phosphate were separated by thin layer chromatography as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b020">20</xref>].

        <p>Poly-nucleosomes were prepared from chicken erythrocytes by sucrose gradient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b040">40</xref>]. Mononucleosomes were assembled by salt gradient dialysis on 146-bp labeled DNA fragments as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b041">41</xref>]. Increasing amount of ISWI were incubated in the presence or absence of PARP, 3-AB, poly-nucleosomes, or in vitro–assembled mononucleosomes in 5 μl of 100mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 1mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1mM DTT, 1X PARP cocktail for 15 min at 25 °C in a final volume of 10 μl.

          <p>Loss of <italic>ISWI</italic> function, by eye-specific misexpression of the dominant negative allele <italic>ISWI<sup>K159R</sup></italic>, produces catalytically inactive ISWI that is incorporated into native complexes giving rise to rough and reduced eye phenotypes in otherwise healthy flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b021">21</xref>]. We used this in vivo eye assay to conduct an unbiased genetic screen for mutations in genes that dominantly modify phenotypes resulting from loss of <italic>ISWI</italic> function in the eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b014">14</xref>]<italic>.</italic> The rationale of the genetic screen we conducted is that if a mutation in one gene can dominantly modify the phenotype resulting from misexpression of <italic>ISWI<sup>K159R</sup></italic> in the eye, it is likely that the protein encoded by the mutated gene is involved in the same biological process as <italic>ISWI.</italic> We screened a collection of ∼2,300 <italic>Drosophila</italic> lines bearing the special EP modified transposable P-elements that can lead to the interruption of a gene or to GAL4-dependent misexpression of the genes adjacent to the insertion site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b014">14</xref>].</p>
          <p>(A) Among the loci identified in our screen, we recovered a single EP-element insertion–<italic>EP3570</italic>–that maps the natural transposon <italic>1360</italic> present in the first intron of the <italic>Parp</italic> gene. The EP3570 line was “cleaned” for a second insertion on a euchromatic locus on the third chromosome, and was subsequently mapped by FISH and iPCR using standard protocols (unpublished data). The arrowhead marks the <italic>Parp<sup>CH1</sup></italic> mutation, a previously described <italic>Parp</italic> allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b015">15</xref>], while the directional arrow indicate the <italic>EP3570</italic> insertion.</p>
          <p>(B) To validate the observed genetic interaction, we tested if other alleles of <italic>Parp</italic> and <italic>Parg</italic> genetically interacted with <italic>ISWI<sup>K159R</sup></italic>. Indeed, similarly to the EP insertions recovered in the screen, the loss-of-function alleles <italic>Parp<sup>CH1</sup></italic> and <italic>Parg<sup>27.1</sup></italic> both dominantly enhanced <italic>ISWI<sup>K159R</sup></italic> eye defects. The severity of rough/reduced eye phenotypes was scored on a scale of 1 to 6 (with 6 corresponding to the most severe; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b014">14</xref>]). The line <italic>Df(yw)</italic> was used as a wild-type negative control; The Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test (KS-test) was applied to calculate if the cumulative frequency distributions of the eye scores of the experimental and control progeny classes were statistically different (<italic>p</italic> = 0.05). For the KS-test we used the <italic>Df(yw)</italic> eye distributions or the balancer class, when available.</p>
          <p>(C) Remarkably, a single insertion near the <italic>Parg</italic> gene–<italic>EP1623–</italic> was also found to act as a weak <italic>ISWI<sup>K159R</sup></italic> enhancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b014">14</xref>]. <italic>Parg<sup>27.1</sup></italic> is a previously described <italic>Parg</italic> allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b036">36</xref>]. The genome maps for <italic>Parp</italic> and <italic>Parg</italic> were obtained from FlyBase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.flybase.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.flybase.com</ext-link>).</p>
          <p>(D) Complementation tests between <italic>Parp<sup>CH1</sup></italic>/<italic>TM3, Sb</italic>, and <italic>EP3570</italic>/<italic>TM6B, Hu, Tb</italic> or <italic>Parg<sup>27.1</sup></italic>/FM7 and EP1623 lines show that while the <italic>EP1623</italic> insertion fully complemented the <italic>Parg<sup>27.1</sup></italic> loss-of-function allele, the <italic>EP3570/Parp<sup>CH1</sup></italic> progeny is semi-lethal, suggesting that the <italic>EP3570</italic> insertion generates a partial loss-of-function allele of <italic>Parp</italic>. Numbers indicate scored progeny for each genotype.</p>
          <p>(E) Double-immunofluorescence for PAR and ISWI on polytene chromosomes extracted from <italic>eyGAL4/+; EP3570/+</italic> larvae are compared with control polytene chromosomes misexpressing the GFP (<italic>eyGAL4/+; UAS-GFP/+</italic>). The eyG<italic>AL4;EP3570</italic> polytene chromosomes show an increased level of PARylation compared to control chromosomes (∼200%). Furthermore, the increase in PARylation in <italic>eyGAL4;EP3570</italic> polytene chromosome is accompanied by a substantial reduction (∼50%) of ISWI binding, not associated with chromosome condensation defects. The levels of ISWI and PAR in the eyG<italic>AL4;EP3570</italic> and <italic>eyGAL4;UAS-GFP</italic> polytene chromosomes have been normalized with anti-Mod [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b014">14</xref>] and do not change by Western blot on larval nuclear extracts (unpublished data). Our data suggest that the eyGAL4 misexpression of PARP in the <italic>EP3570</italic> increases general chromatin PARylation that in turns reduces ISWI binding to chromatin, thus causing the enhancement of <italic>ISWI<sup>K159R</sup></italic> eye phenotypes we observed with the <italic>EP3570</italic> line. These data bring support to the notion that the antagonistic relationship between ISWI and PARP, which is presented in this manuscript, is physiological and of biological significance.</p>

It should be noted that two of the most strongly PARylated protein bands in total protein extracts from wt salivary glands are significantly underrepresented in <italic>ISWI</italic> mutant extracts. Asterisks mark the two bands that are underrepresented in <italic>ISWI</italic> salivary glands extracts.

          <p>(B) Anti-PAR Western blot to assay PARylation of recombinant ISWI incubated with: no DNA or chromatin (1): linear DNA (2); non–UV-treated chromatin (3); UV-treated chromatin (4). UV-treated chromatin stimulated PARP activity better than non–UV-treated chromatin, therefore we used the former as chromatin substrate for the ATPase/PARylation in vitro assay.</p>
          <p>(C) Upper panel: PARP (0.5 nmol) auto-PARylating activity starts to get inhibited with ATP concentration as low as 2.5 mM, (compare lanes 5 and 6). However, the trans-PARylating activity of PARP over ISWI (1 nmol) is not affected even at ATP concentration of the order of 10 mM (compare lanes 1, 2, 3, and 4). PARylation in vitro assays were allowed to proceed for 15 min. Lower panel: The same filter was stained with AuroDye (GE Healthcare) to reveal the blotted PARylated proteins.</p>
          <p>(D) Gel retardation assays with a mixed-length population of DNA fragment with average size of 300 bp purified from salmon sperm nuclei are shown after incubation with increasing amounts of ISWI, in the presence or absence of PARP and in the presence or absence of PARP plus its competitive inhibitor 3-AB. 125 ng of a mixed length DNA were incubated with 2, 4, 8, and 16 nmol of ISWI, 0.4 nmol of PARP, and 5 mM 3-AB. In the absence of PARP, a mass excess of ∼8 fold ISWI/DNA is sufficient to start to shift the bulk of the DNA population. In contrast, when PARP is included in the bandshift reaction, the mass excess of ISWI necessary to shift the DNA population to the same extent is at least 2-fold greater (16-fold). The reduction in DNA affinity is reversed in the presence of 3-AB.</p>

In conclusion, a 5-fold excess of free PAR over the amount produced in a standard ATPase/PARylation reaction does not inhibit ISWI DNA-dependent or chromatin-stimulated ATPase activity.</p>

The <italic>Parp<sup>C03256</sup></italic> mutant fails to respond to heat-shock stimuli since no puffing and no hyper-PARylation at 87A and 87C loci is observed after heat-shock. The residual PARP activity detected by the aPAR antibody is comparable to the one presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g007">Fig 7</xref>A.</p>
