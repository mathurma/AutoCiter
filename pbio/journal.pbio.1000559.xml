<p>A novel compound “longdaysin” was found to dramatically slow down the speed of the circadian clock through simultaneous inhibition of protein kinases CKIδ, CKIα, and ERK2.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>The circadian clock underlies daily rhythms of diverse physiological processes, and alterations in clock function have been linked to numerous pathologies. To apply chemical biology methods to modulate and dissect the clock mechanism with new chemical probes, we performed a circadian screen of ∼120,000 uncharacterized compounds on human cells containing a circadian reporter. The analysis identified a small molecule that potently lengthens the circadian period in a dose-dependent manner. Subsequent analysis showed that the compound also lengthened the period in a variety of cells from different tissues including the mouse suprachiasmatic nucleus, the central clock controlling behavioral rhythms. Based on the prominent period lengthening effect, we named the compound longdaysin. Longdaysin was amenable for chemical modification to perform affinity chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry analysis to identify target proteins. Combined with siRNA-mediated gene knockdown, we identified the protein kinases CKIδ, CKIα, and ERK2 as targets of longdaysin responsible for the observed effect on circadian period. Although individual knockdown of CKIδ, CKIα, and ERK2 had small period effects, their combinatorial knockdown dramatically lengthened the period similar to longdaysin treatment. We characterized the role of CKIα in the clock mechanism and found that CKIα-mediated phosphorylation stimulated degradation of a clock protein PER1, similar to the function of CKIδ. Longdaysin treatment inhibited PER1 degradation, providing insight into the mechanism of longdaysin-dependent period lengthening. Using larval zebrafish, we further demonstrated that longdaysin drastically lengthened circadian period in vivo. Taken together, the chemical biology approach not only revealed CKIα as a clock regulatory kinase but also identified a multiple kinase network conferring robustness to the clock. Longdaysin provides novel possibilities in manipulating clock function due to its ability to simultaneously inhibit several key components of this conserved network across species.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Most organisms show daily rhythms in physiology, behavior, and metabolism, which may be advantageous because they anticipate environmental changes thus optimize energy metabolism. These rhythms are controlled by the circadian clock, which produces cyclic expression of thousands of output genes. More than a dozen components of the circadian clock are called clock genes, and the proteins they encode form a transcription factor network that generates rhythmic gene expression. In this study, we set out to control the function of the circadian clock and to identify new clock proteins by means of chemical tools. We tested the effects on the clock in human cells of around 120,000 uncharacterized compounds. Here we describe identification of a novel compound “longdaysin” that markedly slows the circadian clock both in cultured mammalian cells and in living zebrafish. By using longdaysin as a chemical probe, we found new proteins that modulate clock function. Because defects of clock function have been linked to numerous diseases, longdaysin may form the basis for therapeutic strategies directed towards circadian rhythm-related disorders, shift-work fatigue, and jet lag.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A variety of physiological processes such as sleep/wake behavior, body temperature, hormone secretion, and metabolism show daily rhythms under the control of the circadian clock which is intrinsic to the organism. Perturbation of clock function has been implicated in numerous pathologies including circadian sleep disorders, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and metabolic disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Hastings1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-EckelMahan1">[4]</xref>. The close association of the circadian clock with diverse physiological processes and diseases implies that identification of clock-modulating compounds could form the basis for therapeutic strategies directed towards circadian rhythm-related disorders, shift-work fatigue, and jet lag.</p>
<p>The manifestation of circadian disorders at the level of the whole organism can be caused by dysfunction of the clock at the level of intracellular networks, as single cells exhibit circadian rhythms in a cell-autonomous manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Nagoshi1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Welsh1">[6]</xref>. In mammals, these cellular oscillators are organized in a hierarchy, in which the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus constitutes the central circadian pacemaker controlling behavioral rhythms, while peripheral clocks in other tissues control local rhythmic outputs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Hastings1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Takahashi1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Liu1">[7]</xref>. In the intracellular circadian network, the clock genes and their protein products form transcriptional feedback loops: CLOCK and BMAL1 transcription factors activate expression of <italic>Per</italic> and <italic>Cry</italic> genes, and PER and CRY proteins (PER1, PER2, CRY1, and CRY2) in turn inhibit their own transcription to generate rhythmic gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Takahashi1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Reppert1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>In addition to transcriptional regulation, post-translational modification of clock proteins provides another level of regulation, as most clock proteins undergo rhythmic phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Lee1">[9]</xref>. Hamster <italic>tau</italic> mutants showing a short period behavioral rhythm have a missense mutation in the <italic>CKIε</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Lowrey1">[10]</xref>, and human familial advanced sleep phase syndrome (FASPS) with early sleep times is attributed to missense mutations of <italic>PER2</italic> and <italic>CKIδ</italic> genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Toh1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Xu1">[12]</xref>. CKIδ and CKIε phosphorylate PER to trigger proteasomal degradation, and <italic>tau</italic> and FASPS mutations lead to higher PER degradation than wild type, consistent with the short period phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Gallego1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Meng1">[15]</xref>. Supporting the functional importance of CKIδ/ε, application of the known CKI inhibitors IC261, CKI-7, and D4476 causes period lengthening in cultured cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Vanselow1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Eide1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Reischl1">[17]</xref>. Generation of CKIε and CKIδ deficient mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Meng1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Etchegaray1">[18]</xref> as well as the development of the CKIε-selective inhibitor PF-4800567 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Walton1">[19]</xref> revealed the minimal, if any, role of CKIε in period length regulation and also demonstrated a dominant role for CKIδ. In contrast, potential roles of CKI family members other than CKIδ/ε are less characterized: They show much less binding with PER1 than that of CKIε <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Vielhaber1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Dahlberg1">[22]</xref>, and knockdown of CKIα-like, a homolog of CKIα, has no period effect in cultured cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Baggs1">[23]</xref>. Together with CKIδ/ε, GSK-3β and CK2 are also implicated in period regulation. GSK-3β phosphorylates PER2, CRY2, REV-ERBα, CLOCK, and BMAL1 for functional regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Iitaka1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Sahar1">[28]</xref>, and pharmacological and RNAi-based inhibition of GSK-3β causes period shortening in cultured cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Hirota1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Vougogiannopoulou1">[30]</xref>. Conversely, inhibition of CK2 causes period lengthening <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Hirota1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Maier1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Zhang1">[33]</xref>, and CK2-mediated phosphorylation regulates PER2 and BMAL1 functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Maier1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Tsuchiya1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Tamaru1">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>Genetic and molecular biological studies over the past two decades have identified more than a dozen genes that form the core of the mammalian circadian network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Takahashi1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Reppert1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Gachon1">[35]</xref>. However, it is clear that more clock components and modulators remain to be discovered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Takahashi2">[36]</xref>. Considering the limitations of conventional biological approaches associated with lethality, pleiotropy, and functional redundancy of closely related proteins, introduction of new strategies will accelerate the identification of novel clock mechanism. Chemical biology approaches are attractive candidates, because they utilize small molecules as proof-of-concept probes for biological systems and can be effective in discovering novel biological mechanisms and evaluating their effects in vivo by complementing the limitations of conventional biological approaches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Liu1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Ding1">[37]</xref>. Furthermore, the circadian clock network can be a good target for chemical biology approaches due to the quantitative readout of an oscillation. To discover new chemical probes for dissecting biological mechanisms, it is valuable to screen comprehensive, large-scale compound libraries containing hundreds of thousands of compounds, because a wide variation of chemical structures has the advantage of probing many classes of potential targets. Although it is technically challenging to identify proteins specifically affected by a novel compound <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Rix1">[38]</xref>, this process might also be necessary for known compounds, given that even well-characterized kinase inhibitors have off-targets unrelated to the primary effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Fabian1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Karaman1">[40]</xref>. Combined with conventional biological approaches, the chemical biology approach is expected to provide an effective way to identify novel components of the circadian clock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Hirota2">[41]</xref>.</p>
<p>We previously developed a cell-based high-throughput circadian assay system to perform compound screening <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Hirota1">[29]</xref>. In this system, <italic>Bmal1-dLuc</italic> reporter cells derived from human U2OS osteosarcoma cells show robust luminescence rhythms on 384-well plates by expressing a rapidly degradable luciferase under the control of a mouse <italic>Bmal1</italic> gene promoter. We initially tested a chemical library containing 1,280 well-characterized compounds (LOPAC; Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds) and found 11 compounds that change period length of the luminescence rhythms in a dose-dependent manner. The kinase inhibitors among the hit compounds revealed novel roles of GSK-3β and CK2 in the mammalian clock mechanism as described above. Furthermore, many of the hits were previously known to alter the circadian period in other organisms and tissue preparations, demonstrating the predictive value of the high-throughput assay system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Hirota1">[29]</xref>. Together, these observations indicate the effectiveness of small molecules as probes and/or modulators of the circadian clock mechanism. A similar LOPAC screen in NIH3T3 and U2OS cells identified CKIδ/ε-dependent phosphorylation as a chemically sensitive process of the clock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Isojima1">[42]</xref>. It was found that the CKIδ/ε-targeting compounds cause much larger period lengthening than CKIδ gene knockout <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Etchegaray1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Hirota1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Isojima1">[42]</xref>, but the molecular mechanism underlying the strong effects of the compounds remains unknown. The present study aimed to apply chemical biology methods to probe the clock mechanism with novel small molecules through a circadian screen of a structurally diverse library of ∼120,000 uncharacterized compounds. We found a purine derivative, longdaysin, that dramatically lengthens the circadian period. Identification and characterization of longdaysin-target proteins revealed the roles for protein kinases CKIα and ERK2 in period regulation, as well as confirmed the importance of CKIδ. Simultaneous inhibition of these three kinases drastically lengthened the circadian period, illustrating a new facet of the clock mechanism whose robustness is conferred in part by a multiple kinase network.</p>

<title>Identification of a Novel Compound Lengthening the Circadian Period</title>
<p>By applying a high-throughput circadian assay system using human U2OS cells with <italic>Bmal1-dLuc</italic> reporter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Hirota1">[29]</xref>, we analyzed approximately 120,000 uncharacterized compounds corresponding to diverse chemical scaffolds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Ding2">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Plouffe1">[44]</xref> at a final concentration of 7 µM. We identified a number of compounds with different scaffolds that lengthened the circadian period of cellular luminescence rhythms. Among them, we selected one purine derivative compound <bold>1</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) for follow-up studies, because it strongly lengthened the period in a dose-dependent manner and showed less effect on the amplitude of <italic>Bmal1-dLuc</italic> rhythms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000559.s001">Figure S1</xref>). A preliminary structure-activity relationship study helped to identify a derivative of compound <bold>1</bold> that is 3 times more potent and able to generate &gt;10 h period change at a concentration of 10 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000559-t001">Table 1</xref>). We termed this derivative “longdaysin” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), based on its prominent period lengthening effect. We further investigated the effect of longdaysin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g001">Figure 1C–E</xref>) by using primary cells and tissues isolated from <italic>mPer2<sup>Luc</sup></italic> knockin mice harboring a <italic>mPer2<sup>Luc</sup></italic> reporter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Yoo1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Liu2">[46]</xref> as an additional clock-controlled reporter different from <italic>Bmal1-dLuc</italic> used in the screen. Longdaysin consistently caused dose-dependent period lengthening in adult tail fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) and lung explants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), which represent peripheral clocks, and in SCN explants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g001">Figure 1E</xref>), which represent the central clock. The effect of longdaysin was reversible, as the period length returned to normal after washout of the compound (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000559.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that longdaysin potently lengthens the circadian period in multiple mammalian cells including SCN neurons.</p>

<title>Binding of Longdaysin With Protein Kinases</title>
<p>In order to identify potential biological targets of longdaysin by affinity-based proteomic approaches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Rix1">[38]</xref>, we synthesized longdaysin analogs with an aminohexyl linker, based on the preliminary structure-activity relationship analysis. Among them, compound <bold>2</bold> with a linker at the C2 position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) retained the period lengthening effect in the cell-based circadian assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). We then prepared agarose-conjugated compound <bold>3</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) and incubated it with U2OS cell lysate in the presence or absence of 100 µM longdaysin as a soluble competitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Proteins that bound to the affinity resin, and could be competed off by free longdaysin, were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This analysis yielded 10 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) including the protein kinases (highlighted in blue) CKIδ (CSNK1D), CKIα (CSNK1A1), ERK2 (MAPK1), CDK7, and p38α (MAPK14). Independent affinity chromatography followed by Western blotting with specific antibodies confirmed both the binding of the protein kinases to the affinity resin as well as decreased binding in the presence of free longdaysin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000559.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Furthermore, in vitro kinase assays revealed that longdaysin inhibited CKIδ, CKIα, ERK2, and CDK7 activities (IC<sub>50</sub> = 8.8, 5.6, 52, and 29 µM, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g002">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000559-t001">Table 1</xref>), while it had much less effect on p38α (unpublished data). In contrast, compound <bold>1</bold> inhibited CKIδ, CKIα, and ERK2 with ∼3 times less potency than longdaysin and inhibited CDK7 similarly to longdaysin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g002">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000559-t001">Table 1</xref>). The difference in potency between longdaysin and compound <bold>1</bold> against CKIδ, CKIα, and ERK2 was consistent with their cellular period effects (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000559-t001">Table 1</xref>), suggesting an involvement of these three kinases in the period regulation.</p>

<title>Lengthening of the Circadian Period by Knockdown of CKIδ, CKIα, and ERK2</title>

<p>To investigate the effects of RNAi-mediated inhibition of potential longdaysin-targeted kinases on the circadian period, we conducted knockdown experiments by applying four independent siRNAs against each gene. At least two siRNAs for <italic>CSNK1D</italic> (encoding CKIδ), <italic>CSNK1A1</italic> (CKIα), and <italic>MAPK1</italic> (ERK2) caused period lengthening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, red box), while those for <italic>CDK7</italic> and <italic>MAPK14</italic> (p38α) did not, thus proposing CKIδ, CKIα, and ERK2 as the potential clock-acting targets of longdaysin. We also tested siRNAs against the close homologs of these three kinases (<italic>CSNK1E</italic> for <italic>CSNK1D</italic>, <italic>CSNK1A1L</italic> for <italic>CSNK1A1</italic>, and <italic>MAPK3</italic> for <italic>MAPK1</italic>) and found that the homologs had little or no effect on the period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The minor period effects for <italic>MAPK14</italic>, <italic>CSNK1E</italic>, and <italic>CSNK1A1L</italic> are in line with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Baggs1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Isojima1">[42]</xref>. We further looked at the primary screening data from our genome-wide RNAi study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Zhang1">[33]</xref> in which we used four siRNAs different from this study by combining two siRNAs as a pool. Among the 10 longdaysin-interacting proteins identified by the affinity chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), only <italic>CSNK1D</italic>, <italic>CSNK1A1</italic>, and <italic>MAPK1</italic> showed period lengthening of the reporter with both siRNA pairs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000559.s004">Figure S4</xref>, red box), supporting important roles for CKIδ, CKIα, and ERK2 in period regulation as longdaysin targets. We then characterized the period lengthening effects of siRNAs against <italic>CSNK1D</italic>, <italic>CSNK1A1</italic>, and <italic>MAPK1</italic> by using an 8-point dilution series of the effective siRNAs. All siRNAs tested gave dose-dependent changes of the period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g003">Figure 3Ci</xref>) and reduction of the target gene mRNA levels without affecting the levels of closely homologous genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g003">Figure 3Cii</xref>). The only exception was CSNK1A1 si1, which has sequence similarity against <italic>CSNK1A1L</italic> mRNA (96% identical on a 23 bp stretch) and reduced its level at higher dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g003">Figure 3Cii</xref>). The correlation between period effect and mRNA knockdown effect matched well for two siRNAs against <italic>CSNK1A1</italic> or <italic>MAPK1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000559.s005">Figure S5</xref>). The proportional changes of circadian function by dose-dependent knockdown of <italic>CSNK1D</italic>, <italic>CSNK1A1</italic>, and <italic>MAPK1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) are common characteristics among the core clock components and clock modifiers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Baggs1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Zhang1">[33]</xref>. Taken together, these results illustrate the involvement of CKIα and ERK2 in the period regulation, as well as confirming the importance of CKIδ.</p>
<p>We further tested knockdown of all three kinases <italic>CSNK1D</italic>, <italic>CSNK1A1</italic>, and <italic>MAPK1</italic> in combination, in order to determine if their concomitant reduction could explain the strong effect of longdaysin as an inhibitor of all three kinases. Combinatorial knockdown of the three genes caused strong and dose-dependent lengthening of the period to &gt;10 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g003">Figure 3Di</xref>). The multiple gene knockdown effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g003">Figure 3Dii</xref>, red line) matched well with the theoretical sum of the effect of single gene knockdown (black line). These results suggest that the knockdown of these three kinases works in an additive manner to cause prominent period lengthening similar to that generated by longdaysin.</p>

<title>CKIα-Dependent Phosphorylation and Degradation of PER1</title>

To examine the interaction of CKIα and ERK2 with the core clock proteins, we co-expressed HA-tagged kinases with Flag-tagged clock proteins in HEK293T cells. Immunoprecipitation assay revealed interactions of both CKIα and ERK2 with PER1 and PER2, and to a lesser extent, CRY1 and CRY2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g004">Figures 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000559.s006">S6A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000559.s006">S6B</xref>). Co-expression of PER1 with CKIα generated lower electrophoretic mobility forms of PER1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), which disappeared upon phosphatase treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000559.s007">Figure S7A</xref>), suggesting CKIα-dependent phosphorylation of PER1. This modification relied on the kinase activity of CKIα, because the kinase-dead K46R mutant of CKIα [CKIα (KR)] <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Budd1">[48]</xref> did not cause the mobility-shift of PER1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). In contrast, ERK2 showed no detectable effect on the PER1 mobility (unpublished data). Treatment of the cells with longdaysin reduced the CKIα- and CKIδ-dependent mobility-shift of PER1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g004">Figures 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000559.s007">S7B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000559.s007">S7C</xref>), consistent with a potential mode of longdaysin action through CKIα and CKIδ.</p>

<title>Effect of CKIα on the core clock proteins.</title>
<p>(A) Interaction of CKIα and ERK2 with the core clock proteins. HA-tagged CKIα or ERK2 was co-expressed with Flag-tagged clock proteins in HEK293T cells and subjected to immunoprecipitation assay with anti-HA antibody. Because of the low level expression CLOCK, its interaction could not be tested. The interaction of ERK2 with CRY1 and CRY2 was detected as reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Sanada1">[67]</xref>. (B) CKIα-dependent phosphorylation of PER1. PER1 was co-expressed with CKIα, kinase-dead mutant of CKIα [CKIα (KR)], or CKIδ in HEK293T cells and analyzed by Western blot 2 d after transfection (left panel). Intensity profile of each PER1 band is shown in right panel by setting the peak value as 1. Bracket indicates lower electrophoretic mobility forms of PER1 whose intensity increased in the presence of CKIα or CKIδ. (C) Effect of longdaysin on CKIα- and CKIδ-dependent phosphorylation of PER1. PER1 was co-expressed with CKIα or CKIδ in HEK293T cells. The cells were treated with 10 µM longdaysin or 0.1% DMSO for 24 h, and a part of the cell extract was analyzed by Western blot. (D) Effect of CKIα on PER1 stability. Luciferase-fused PER1 (PER1-LUC) or luciferase (LUC) was co-expressed with GFP, CKIα, CKIα (KR), or CKIδ in HEK293T cells. The cells were treated with cycloheximide from time 0, and luminescence was recorded. Representative profiles for PER1-LUC and LUC are shown in the left and middle panels, respectively, by setting peak luminescence as 100%. Half-life of PER1-LUC was divided by that of LUC to cancel out the effect of LUC degradation on PER1-LUC stability (right panel). Data are the mean with SEM (<italic>n</italic> = 4). (E) Effect of longdaysin on CKIα- and CKIδ-dependent regulation of PER1 stability. PER1-LUC or LUC was co-expressed with GFP, CKIα, or CKIδ in HEK293T cells. The cells were treated with 0 to 20 µM longdaysin for 24 h and then treated with cycloheximide for luminescence recording. Representative profiles for PER1-LUC and LUC are shown in the left and middle panels, respectively. The relative half-life of PER1-LUC against LUC is indicated (right panel). Data are the mean with SEM (<italic>n</italic> = 6). (F) Effect of longdaysin on endogenous PER1 level in <italic>Bmal1-dLuc</italic> U2OS cells. Luminescence rhythms were monitored in the presence of 0, 3, or 9 µM longdaysin (Fi). In parallel, the cells were collected at indicated time points and analyzed by Western blotting (Fii). Also, the cells were collected at two time points separated by about half of the period length (40 and 52 h for 0 µM longdaysin, 40 and 55 h for 3 µM, 40 and 58 h for 9 µM) and analyzed by RT-qPCR as a mixture of the two time points (Fiii, the mean with SEM, <italic>n</italic> = 4).</p>

Luminescence changes were monitored following inhibition of <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis by cycloheximide treatment. Co-expression of CKIα but not CKIα (KR) accelerated PER1-LUC degradation relative to that of LUC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). The CKIα- and CKIδ-dependent degradation of PER1 was inhibited by longdaysin treatment in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Similar results were obtained by using PER1 without the LUC fusion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000559.s008">Figure S8A</xref>). In contrast, we found that CKIα had no effect on the stability of a PER2-LUC fusion protein while CKIδ accelerated its degradation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000559.s008">Figure S8B</xref>). These results demonstrated the selectivity of CKIα against PER1 degradation over PER2. Longdaysin inhibited the CKIδ-mediated PER2-LUC degradation in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000559.s008">Figure S8C</xref>), suggesting its role in regulating both PER1 and PER2 stabilities through CKIδ and/or CKIα.</p>
<p>We then investigated the effect of longdaysin on the protein level of endogenous PER1 in <italic>Bmal1-dLuc</italic> U2OS cells during circadian cycles. The cells were synchronized with medium change and collected every 6 h from 28 h to 58 h after the medium change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g004">Figure 4Fi</xref>). Consistent with the longdaysin-dependent shift of the second trough of <italic>Bmal1-dLuc</italic> luminescence rhythm (34, 38, and 46 h for 0, 3, and 9 µM longdaysin, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g004">Figure 4Fi</xref>), the second peak of PER1 protein rhythm shifted in parallel (40, 40–46, and 52 h for 0, 3, and 9 µM longdaysin, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g004">Figure 4Fii</xref>). Furthermore, 3 or 9 µM longdaysin treatment strongly up-regulated overall protein amount of PER1 compared with 0 µM control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g004">Figure 4Fii</xref>) without affecting its mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g004">Figure 4Fiii</xref>), demonstrating post-transcriptional increase of endogenous PER1 by longdaysin. The progressive phosphorylation of PER1 was still observed in the presence of longdaysin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g004">Figure 4Fii</xref>), possibly because of the phosphorylation by kinase(s) that was not affected by longdaysin. Collectively, these results provide a possible mechanism of longdaysin action for period regulation through the CKIα- and CKIδ-mediated control of PER1 stability.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study highlighted the effectiveness of the chemical biology approach in dissecting circadian clock mechanisms. Our large-scale small molecule screening identified a novel compound longdaysin that exhibited a drastic effect on the circadian period of not only a variety of mammalian cells but also zebrafish in vivo. As a first attempt to determine the molecular mechanism underlying such a large period effect, we conducted affinity-based proteomics and siRNA-mediated knockdown analyses. Our results revealed CKIδ, CKIα, and ERK2 as targets of longdaysin for period regulation. Effective concentrations of longdaysin against CKIδ and CKIα in a cell-based PER1 degradation assay were similar to those in in vitro kinase assays (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000559-t001">Table 1</xref>), suggesting efficient cell permeability of the compound. Treatment with 10 µM longdaysin consistently inhibited CKIδ and CKIα activities in vitro and their effects on PER1 phosphorylation and degradation, resulting in a 13 h period lengthening in U2OS cells. The increasing period effect at the range of 3 to 24 µM, in which longdaysin considerably inhibited ERK2 in vitro, supported the role of ERK2 at higher longdaysin concentration.</p>
<p>In mammals, the CKI family of Ser/Thr kinases contains seven members (α, β, γ1, γ2, γ3, δ, and ε). While the roles of CKIδ/ε in the circadian clock mechanism have been extensively studied, the inhibition of CKIδ/ε alone is insufficient to explain the drastic effect of longdaysin. Knockout of these genes has only a modest effect on period length and the effect of longdaysin was also observed in CKIδ deficient cells. We found that CKIα, in addition to CKIδ and CKIε, binds to PER1 and regulates its stability. This observation is reminiscent of the CKIα-, CKIδ-, and CKIε-mediated regulation of β-catenin and Ci, key players in the Wnt and Hedgehog signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Knippschild1">[53]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Price1">[54]</xref>. Similar to NFAT transcription factors that are the targets of CKIα and/or CKIε <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Zhu1">[55]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Okamura1">[56]</xref>, the CKI docking site of PER1/2 contains a FXXXF motif necessary for CKIε binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Okamura1">[56]</xref>. Although PER1/2 bind with CKIα/δ/ε, the affinity of CKIα is much lower than CKIδ/ε (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000559.s006">Figure S6C</xref>). A recent study demonstrated that two amino acid residues in the CKI kinase domain cause weaker affinity of CKIα for PER1 compared with CKIε <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Dahlberg1">[22]</xref>. The low affinity will be advantageous to release PER proteins from CKIα for subsequent regulations, such as phosphorylation by other kinases and degradation. Disruption of the circadian rhythm in CKIδ deficient fibroblasts by overexpression of dominant negative form of CKIε <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Lee2">[57]</xref> may be mediated also by perturbation of CKIα-dependent regulation, because of the tight binding of dominant negative CKIε with PER proteins. On the other hand, ERK1 and ERK2 MAP kinases have been well characterized in the resetting mechanism of the clock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Coogan1">[58]</xref>. Our results demonstrated a role for ERK2 in the regulation of circadian period as well. Attenuation of the circadian rhythms in SCN explants by treatment with the MEK (ERK kinase) inhibitor U0126 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Akashi1">[59]</xref> could potentially be explained by strong inhibition of both ERK1 and ERK2. Similar to CKIδ and CKIα, ERK2 bound to PER1/2, suggesting PER protein as a key node in phosphorylation-dependent period regulation by multiple kinases. The effect of ERK2 on PER phosphorylation and function will be addressed in future studies.</p>
<p>CKIδ, CKIα, and ERK2 are involved in diverse cellular processes such as cell proliferation and apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Knippschild1">[53]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Chang1">[60]</xref>. Consistently, CKIδ and ERK2 are required for normal development as revealed by gene knockout studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Etchegaray1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-SabaElLeil1">[61]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Hatano1">[62]</xref>, while CKIα deficient mice are not reported yet. In addition to the regulation of PER by these kinases, it is possible that the regulation of other clock proteins and/or changes in cellular physiology may also affect the circadian period. Therefore, it is important to identify specific residues of PER responsible for the CKIδ-, CKIα-, and ERK2-mediated period regulation. In contrast to the CKIδ-dependent progressive phosphorylation of PER1, CKIα caused a smaller mobility-shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g004">Figure 4B,C</xref>), suggesting a key role for site-specific phosphorylation rather than a global change of phosphorylation level. In <italic>Neurospora</italic>, a quantitative mass spectrometry approach identified &gt;75 in vivo phosphorylated residues of the clock protein FRQ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Baker1">[63]</xref>. Interestingly, phosphorylation of two distinct regions leads to opposing effects on FRQ stability and circadian period <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Baker1">[63]</xref>. In mammals, phosphorylation site mapping via mass spectrometry identified 21 phosphorylated Ser/Thr residues in PER2 overexpressed in HEK293 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Vanselow1">[14]</xref>. Identification of PER1 phosphorylation sites and characterization of the role of each residue will lead to the understanding of CKIδ-, CKIα-, and ERK2-mediated regulation of PER1 function and the circadian period. Furthermore, the phenotypic differences between PER1 and PER2 observed in CKIα-dependent regulation of stability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000559.s008">Figure S8B</xref>) and CKIε-mediated control of nuclear translocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Takano1">[64]</xref> could be explained by comparing phosphorylation sites and their functions.</p>
<p>We found that combinatorial knockdown of CKIδ, CKIα, and ERK2 worked additively for prominent period lengthening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), similar to that caused by longdaysin. In contrast, knockout of CKIδ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), knockdown of single kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000559-g003">Figure 3B,C</xref>), and CKI inhibitors D4476 and IC261(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000559.s010">Figure S10</xref>) all showed smaller period effects. These observations indicate that the network of multiple kinases confers robustness to the clock mechanism. A single small molecule such as longdaysin inhibiting the multiple pathways simultaneously can significantly perturb the clock system and elicit unexpectedly long period. Previous screening of the LOPAC chemical library identified several kinase inhibitors that cause large period lengthening <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Hirota1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Isojima1">[42]</xref>. These compounds have the potential to inhibit CKIδ/ε <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Fabian1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Karaman1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Isojima1">[42]</xref>, although their primary target is CDK, p38 MAPK, JNK, CK2, or VEGFR signaling pathway. Because of the high conservation of the kinase domain between CKIδ and CKIα, these compounds are also likely to inhibit CKIα. Considering our current finding, the inhibition of the primary target (CDK, p38 MAPK, JNK, CK2, or VEGFR signaling pathway) in combination with CKIδ/ε/α may be essential for the large period effect of these compounds. Supporting this idea, CK2 acts cooperatively with CKIε to regulate PER2 stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-Tsuchiya1">[32]</xref>. Having multiple targets might be a common characteristic of therapeutically effective compounds, such as sunitinib and sorafenib for cancer treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000559-SeboltLeopold1">[65]</xref>. Our zebrafish experiments clearly showed an in vivo effect of longdaysin in a vertebrate, and further optimization of longdaysin in mammalian systems may provide a chemical starting point for the identification of small molecule therapeutics specifically designed for ameliorating circadian disorders.</p>

Luminescence rhythms of <italic>Bmal1-dLuc</italic> U2OS cells were monitored after transient transfection with siRNAs. Four independent siRNAs were tested per gene as two siRNA pools (#1 and #2), each containing two independent siRNAs. Data are the mean with variation (<italic>n</italic> = 2). Asterisk indicates low amplitude rhythm, which sometimes causes wrong period estimation because of poor curve fitting. Pairs #1 and #2 for H2AFV and pair #1 for H2AFZ have highly possible off-target genes, and the result is not shown.</p>
