<abstract>
<p>Microglia are resident immune cells that play critical roles in maintaining the normal physiology of the central nervous system (CNS). Remarkably, microglia have an intrinsic capacity to repopulate themselves after acute ablation. However, the underlying mechanisms that drive such restoration remain elusive. Here, we characterized microglial repopulation both spatially and temporally following removal via treatment with the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor PLX5622. We show that microglia were replenished via self-renewal, with no contribution from nonmicroglial lineages, including Nestin+ progenitors and the circulating myeloid population. Interestingly, spatial analyses with dual-color labeling revealed that newborn microglia recolonized the parenchyma by forming distinctive clusters that maintained stable territorial boundaries over time, indicating the proximal expansive nature of adult microgliogenesis and the stability of microglia tiling. Temporal transcriptome profiling at different repopulation stages revealed that adult newborn microglia gradually regain steady-state maturity from an immature state that is reminiscent of the neonatal stage and follow a series of maturation programs, including nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) activation, interferon immune activation, and apoptosis. Importantly, we show that the restoration of microglial homeostatic density requires NF-κB signaling as well as apoptotic egress of excessive cells. In summary, our study reports key events that take place from microgliogenesis to homeostasis reestablishment.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Microglia are the brain’s primary immune sentinels. After being seeded in the central nervous system (CNS) during embryonic development, microglia form an evenly distributed grid-like population in the adult brain. In the adult, microglia have the remarkable ability to regenerate and restore their population following acute insults, but what drives this homeostatic process is unclear. Here, we addressed this question by studying regeneration following chemical ablation of microglia. In this model, we addressed the origin of repopulating cells, their spatial redistribution characteristics, and the temporal spectrum of gene-expression patterns at different stages of repopulation. We found that the restoration of microglial homeostasis during repopulation is achieved through self-renewal, proximity clonal expansion, and activation of maturation programs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Microglia are resident parenchymal macrophages in the central nervous system (CNS). Along with the perivascular, meningeal, and choroid plexus macrophages, these cells govern the innate immunity of the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref001">1</xref>]. Apart from their primary function in immune surveillance, microglia also perform a multitude of essential CNS tasks: supplying neurotrophic factors, pruning unwanted synapses, and promoting programmed cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref002">2</xref>]. Consequently, microglia have been implicated in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref003">3</xref>]. In particular, loss of microglial homeostatic control in the form of microgliosis is considered one of the key pathological hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p>During embryonic development, myeloid progenitor cells leave the blood island and travel from the yolk sac to colonize the developing fetal brain, which later become microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref006">6</xref>]. In the adult brain, microglia are maintained locally through self-division if the blood brain barrier is kept intact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref007">7</xref>]. However, how microglia repopulate the brain following microglial ablation has been intensely debated in the field. It has been shown by multiple groups that the empty microglial niche can be readily repopulated in a matter of days after ablation of more than 90% of cells using colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref009">9</xref>]. In this setting, Elmore and colleagues described a highly proliferative Nestin+ nonmicroglial population, which preceded the appearance of microglial markers, leading to the conclusion that a hidden CNS Nestin+ progenitor pool can rapidly replenish microglia deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref008">8</xref>]. Other microglial ablation studies have shown that microglia can be regenerated almost entirely via self-renewal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref010">10</xref>]. In addition, Nestin+ progenitors transitioning into adult microglia have not been detected in microglia generated under steady-state conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Microglia are territorial sentinels in the CNS. Resting-state microglia evenly tile the parenchyma, forming an intricate cellular grid, with microglial processes constantly surveilling local territories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref012">12</xref>]. This tiling pattern is largely determined during seeding of the primitive yolk sac progenitors in the embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref005">5</xref>]. However, adult microglia have the capacity to migrate over long distances through the optic nerve during microglial repopulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref013">13</xref>], making it challenging to determine whether maintenance of microglial tiling is static or dynamic.</p>
<p>Here, we applied transient 5-Ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) labeling, lineage tracing, as well as bone marrow–transplant experiments during microglial repopulation to resolve the debate over the origin of repopulating cells. Our results indicate that the repopulated microglia are exclusively derived locally from self-renewed microglia rather than a Nestin+ progenitor or circulating myeloid cells. Using a dual labeling system and spatial analyses, we investigated spatial tiling and found that microglial colonies are very stable in the CNS once they are formed.</p>
<p>In addition, to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying microglia homeostasis restoration during repopulation, we performed an RNA-seq–profiling experiment from isolated microglia at various stages of repopulation and showed that the early-stage, adult-born microglia are reminiscent of the neonatal counterpart and undergo a series of transcriptional changes to eventually regain a mature phenotype. In particular, components of immune signaling pathways, particularly nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and interferon, were highly elevated, accompanied by a high rate of apoptosis. Conditional knockout of I-Kappa-B-Kinase Beta (IKKβ), a kinase required for NF-κB activation, impaired microglial repopulation <italic>in vivo</italic>. In summary, our results provide new insights into microglial homeostatic control, demonstrating that the cells have an intrinsic regenerative capacity, activate developmental programs during regeneration, and undergo regulated apoptosis to regain homeostatic density.</p>

<title>Release from CSF1 inhibition triggers proliferation of microglia and a nonmicroglial population</title>
<p>Microglia are resident immune cells that territorially tile the entire CNS. Microglial homeostasis is tightly controlled under physiological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref011">11</xref>]. To investigate the mechanisms underlying microglial homeostatic restoration, we depleted microglia by feeding C56/BL6J mice a diet containing the CSF1R inhibitor PLX5622 (PLX). Administration of PLX for 2 weeks reduced the number of ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1+) microglia over 90%. After switching to a regular diet for 7 or 14 days, the microglial population was readily restored and exceeded steady-state level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). Similar microglial repopulation was observed following diphtheria toxin–mediated selective ablation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000134.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). In this model, microglial density was partially restored after 1 day of repopulation and surpassed normal density after 7 days of repopulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000134.s001">S1B and S1C Fig</xref>). These results indicate that repopulation is an inherent property of microglia irrespective of the method of ablation.</p>

<p>To trace the source of repopulating microglia, we injected EdU, a thymidine analog that can be incorporated into newly synthesized DNA, during the first 4 days of microglial repopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Approximately 60% of EdU+ cells were also Iba1+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000134.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Among those cells, we observed pairs of EdU+ microglia that appeared to be undergoing mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g001">Fig 1F</xref>), suggesting that microglial repopulation involves self-proliferation. In line with activation of cell cycle re-entry, live imaging of brain slices from microglia reporter mice (CX3CR1<sup>eGFP/+</sup>), which express eGFP under the myeloid promoter CX3CR1, revealed that microglia exhibited increased movement on repopulation day 6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000134.s003">S3 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000134.s013">S1</xref> Video, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000134.s014">S2 Video</xref>). However, roughly 10%–30% EdU+ cells did not express the microglial marker Iba1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). To identify the EdU+Iba1− cells, we performed staining with Nestin and an array of other common CNS markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g001">Fig 1G–1L</xref>). In contrast to what was previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref008">8</xref>], Nestin was not expressed in the EdU+Iba1− cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g001">Fig 1J</xref>, open arrow, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g001">Fig 1M</xref>) but was present in roughly 30% EdU+Iba1+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g001">Fig 1J</xref>, solid arrow, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g001">Fig 1N</xref>), indicating that Nestin may be a transient marker of young microglia.

<title>Bone marrow–derived hematopoietic myeloid cells do not contribute to the repopulated microglial pool</title>
<p>To directly test whether circulating monocytes contribute to microglial repopulation after PLX-mediated depletion, we performed bone marrow transplantation (BMT) using wild-type C57BL/6J mice as recipients and ACTB-eGFP mice as donors. The ACTB-eGFP transgenic mice constitutively express eGFP under the control of a chicken beta-actin promoter and cytomegalovirus enhancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref014">14</xref>], enabling the tracing of reconstituted circulating monocytes in the chimeric mice by the presence of eGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Since irradiation of the head can cause artificial monocyte infiltration of the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref015">15</xref>], mice were fitted with a lead helmet to shield their heads; protection was evidenced by the maintenance of pigmented head hair following irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Following BMT, mice were subjected to microglial depletion using the PLX diet for 2 weeks and then switched to normal diet for repopulation. On average, chimeric mice showed 70% myeloid reconstitution, as determined by the presence of eGFP in the CD11b+CD45+ population from blood or splenocyte suspension (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000134.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). However, immunofluorescence staining of coronal brain slices showed very few green fluorescent protein (GFP)+ cells in the parenchyma, either after 14 days or 2 months of repopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Overall, only a small fraction (&lt;0.5%) of the repopulated microglia were GFP+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Most of the GFP+Iba1+ myeloid cells were found in the choroid plexus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g002">Fig 2E</xref>), which is expected because choroid plexus macrophages are continuously replenished by peripheral monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref001">1</xref>].

<title>Repopulated microglia are not derived from Nestin+, NG2+, or PDGFra+ progenitors</title>
<p>We and others have observed that Nestin, a marker of neuroprogenitor cells, is transiently expressed in early-stage newborn microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref010">10</xref>]. To directly test if Nestin+ progenitors can also contribute to the repopulated microglial pool, as proposed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref008">8</xref>], we performed fate-mapping experiments using Nestin-CreERT2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref016">16</xref>] and the STOP<sup>flox</sup>-RFP reporter to label Nestin+ progenitor cells with red fluorescent protein (RFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Upon tamoxifen treatment, removal of the STOP cassette by the CreERT2 recombinase triggers RFP expression under a constitutive CAG promoter, thus ensuring any descendent cell divided from the labeled microglia will also be RFP+. Neuronal precursor cells were labeled with RFP in the subgranular zone (SGZ), as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>). After 3 weeks of PLX treatment, followed by 2 weeks of microglial repopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g003">Fig 3D</xref>), the number of RFP+ cells remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g003">Fig 3E</xref>), and none of the repopulated microglia expressed RFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). Thus, Nestin+ progenitors do not contribute to the repopulated microglia pool. Given that a small proportion of EdU+Iba1− express Olig2+ during microglia repopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g001">Fig 1L</xref>), we also tested whether oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) could give rise to microglia. STOP<sup>flox</sup>-RFP reporter mice were crossed with mice that express tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase under either the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFra) promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref017">17</xref>] or the neural/glial antigen 2 (NG2) promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref018">18</xref>]. While PLX treatment did not affect the number of PDGFra+ progenitor cells labeled with RFP, none of the RFP+ cells became repopulated microglia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000134.s005">S5A–S5D Fig</xref>). Similar results were seen in the NG2-CreERT2 mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000134.s005">S5E–S5H Fig</xref>).

<title>Repopulated microglia are derived from a CX3CR1+ cell lineage</title>
<p>To further investigate the origin of the repopulated microglia, we performed fate-mapping analysis using a combination of the STOP<sup>flox</sup>-RFP reporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref019">19</xref>] and the tamoxifen inducible myeloid-specific driver CX3CR1-CreERT2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref020">20</xref>] to genetically label adult microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Treating mice for 10 days with 2 mg tamoxifen/day resulted in approximately 85% efficient microglial labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g003">Fig 3G and 3H</xref>), similar to other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref021">21</xref>]. If microglia are repopulated from a nonmicroglial source, this labeling rate would be expected to drop following ablation. To test this, we subjected labeled mice to 2 rounds of microglial depletion and repopulation. We found that the percentage of RFP expression in repopulated microglia remained constant at approximately 85% for both repopulation rounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g003">Fig 3G and 3H</xref>). Thus, the repopulated microglia are almost exclusively derived from the remaining CX3CR1+ microglia, most likely via self-renewal. Notably, the second round of depletion did not exhaust the regenerative capacity of microglia, further supporting the self-renewal property of this population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g003">Fig 3I</xref>). Results from the CX3CR1+ lineage tracing suggests that microglia self-renewal alone is sufficient to repopulate the entire parenchyma after acute ablation, as also found by Bruttger and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref010">10</xref>] as well as Huang and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref009">9</xref>].</p>

Microfetti utilizes stochastic labeling of microglia with 4 fluorescent proteins: GFP, yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), and RFP. Due to fixative-induced inactivation of native fluorescent signals, we used an anti-GFP antibody to detect GFP/CFP/YFP and an anti-RFP antibody to detect RFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). After 2 weeks of PLX treatment, the CX3CR1-CreERT2/STOP<sup>flox</sup>-Brainbow mice were switched to a normal diet for repopulation over an extended period (up to 1 month) to examine the long-term clonal behavior of newborn microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g004">Fig 4B</xref>).

The NND-encoded heatmap offers an overview of the clustering patterns and shows that labeled cells form patches of clusters after repopulation, as expected from self-renewal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g004">Fig 4D and 4F</xref>). The density of NNDs near the 50-μm interval increased during repopulation, indicative of colony formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g004">Fig 4E and 4G</xref>). Because unlabeled Iba1+ microglia in naive mice have an NND value of approximately 50 μm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000134.s006">S6C Fig</xref>), we used NND of less than 50 μm to quantify changes in clustering patterns compared to controls. Using this criterion, there was an increase in the percentage of RFP+ cells with NND values less than 50 μm at 7 days and 1 month following ablation compared to the Ctrl group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g004">Fig 4H</xref>). Interestingly, there was no difference in clustering pattern between 7 days and 1 month, suggesting that once the clusters are formed, they remain stable. Similar results were obtained by analyzing GFP+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g004">Fig 4F and 4G</xref>), although NND analysis did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g004">Fig 4I</xref>), most likely because 3 fluorophores (CFP/YFP/GFP) were combined in this group, resulting in denser labeling in the controls.</p>
<p>To further confirm the results obtained from the NND analysis, we next used Ripley’s K-function analysis and its derivative H-function to survey the spatial points in a defined field with varying radii. Consistent with our NND analysis, the H-function analysis showed that the 7 day and 1 month groups shared similar clustering patterns that were quite different from the Ctrl group for both RFP+ and GFP+ cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g004">Fig 4J and 4K</xref>). Furthermore, quantification of the radius of H-function at the maximum score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref024">24</xref>] showed that the cluster sizes were indistinguishable between the 7 day and 1 month groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g004">Fig 4L</xref>), suggesting that the size of both RFP+ and GFP+ clusters remain relatively constant over time.</p>
<p>We next investigated whether distinctive clusters could merge with their neighbor through cell migration and spread. Using 2D kernel density maps generated by applying kernel smoothing to actual microglia spatial points, we examined the cluster interaction between RFP+ and GFP+ cells. In order to distinguish cluster boundaries, we used top 10% density from the kernel density map as a threshold. This method allows us to artificially outline cluster boundaries for both RFP+ and GFP+ cells at 7 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g004">Fig 4M</xref>) and 1 month of repopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g004">Fig 4N</xref>). We then measured the relative overlapping area between RFP+ and GFP+ clusters: if a cluster merged into neighboring clusters, the overlapping area would increase accordingly. The analysis showed a consistent level of overlapping area between the 7 day and 1 month groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g004">Fig 4O</xref>), suggesting that the clusters’ territories are stable with minimal migratory diffusion during the repopulation process. Together, these data indicate adult newborn microglia redistribute spatially, form distinct clusters, and maintain stable tiling pattern over long periods of time.</p>

We confirmed the RNA-seq data via quantitative PCR (qPCR) based on a few differentially expressed genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000134.s007">S7B–S7D Fig</xref>).

There was a clear separation of the adult microglia (Ctrl) and immature microglia (P4) clusters as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Interestingly, early-stage newborn microglia (4 D) samples clustered between the Ctrl and P4 microglia clusters, while medium- (14 D) and late-stage (1 Mo) microglia clustered closer to control adult microglia (Ctrl), suggesting that newborn microglia undergo progressive restoration toward a steady-state microglial transcriptional profile.</p>

<p>Next, we applied k-means clustering to arbitrarily categorize all genes into 4 distinct clusters. Among all the repopulating microglia groups, the earliest stage (4 D) showed the most transcriptional difference from Ctrl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Interestingly, genes in cluster 3 and 4 shared expression directionality between 4 D repopulated microglia and P4 neonatal microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). This suggests that the newly regenerated microglia might have partially reverted back to an immature developmental state. To assess the similarity of microglia isolated from different repopulation stages, we employed a Poisson distance matrix based on gene expression profiles. Interestingly, as repopulation time goes by, newborn microglia (4 D, 14 D, and 1Mo) showed decreasing similarity with P4 neonatal microglia but increasing similarity with steady-state microglia (Ctrl) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000134.s008">S8A Fig</xref>), suggesting that newborn microglia gradually regains maturity. In particular, we found 4 D microglia shared 34% similarity with P4 neonatal microglia and 55% similarity with Ctrl microglia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000134.s008">S8A Fig</xref>). This suggests that 4 D microglia adopt a unique immature transcriptome signature that partially overlaps with that of neonatal microglia.</p>
<p>We next performed differentially expressed (DE) gene analysis. Roughly half of the DE genes found in 4 D microglia were also present in P4 microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g005">Fig 5D and 5E</xref>). Among all of the up-regulated genes shared between 4 D and P4 microglia, many are involved in cell cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000134.s008">S8B and S8C Fig</xref>), including <italic>Mcm5</italic> and <italic>Cdk1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g005">Fig 5F and 5G</xref>). Importantly, <italic>Nestin</italic> was also elevated at this early stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g005">Fig 5H</xref>) but returned to control levels after 14 days, further validating our earlier observation that Nestin was an immature marker expressed in newborn microglia rather than a bona fide microglial progenitor marker. On the other hand, among all of the down-regulated genes shared between 4 D and P4 microglia, a large fraction is involved in Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000134.s008">S8D and S8E Fig</xref>). TGF-β signaling has been shown to be critically important for microglial development and homeostatic maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref026">26</xref>], and TGF-β signaling-related genes such as <italic>Pmepa1</italic> and <italic>Smad7</italic> were found to be down-regulated in 4 D microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g005">Fig 5I and 5J</xref>).</p>

<p>In addition, previously established mature microglia genes such as <italic>MafB</italic> and <italic>Selplg</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref025">25</xref>] and <italic>P2ry12</italic> and <italic>Tmem119</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref027">27</xref>] were also down-regulated in 4 D microglia but restored after 14 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g005">Fig 5K–5N</xref>). These results indicate that newborn microglia regain maturity over time, and this was validated in morphological analysis and immunostaining of P2ry12 and Tmem119 protein expression in separate experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000134.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). Interestingly, disease-associated microglial genes such as <italic>Trem2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref028">28</xref>] and <italic>Grn</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref029">29</xref>] were also differentially expressed in 4 D microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g005">Fig 5O and 5P</xref>). Collectively, the results gathered from the RNA-seq analyses suggest that adult microgliogenesis involves maturation steps that partially recapitulate development.</p>

<title>Adult newborn microglia exhibit distinctive temporal transcriptome profiles</title>
<p>To further dissect the underlying programs associated with microglial maturation, we classified 4 different gene sets based on their distinctive differential expression patterns during each of the repopulation stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>; log2 ratio of ±1, false discovery rate [FDR] &lt; 0.05). Fast-returning genes were differentially expressed only in 4 D microglia but returned to control levels in 14 D microglia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000134.s019">S1B Table</xref>). Medium-returning genes were differentially expressed in 4 D and 14 D microglia but not in 1 Mo microglia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000134.s019">S1C Table</xref>). Slow-returning genes were differentially expressed in all repopulation stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000134.s019">S1D Table</xref>). In addition, we also uncovered a fourth set of genes that were only differentially expressed in 14 D microglia, which we refer to as delayed-response genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000134.s019">S1E Table</xref>). We applied gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) with molecular signatures database (MSigDB) on these 4 gene sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref031">31</xref>].

Indeed, cell cycle–related genes such as <italic>Ccnb2</italic>, <italic>Cdc20</italic>, and <italic>Cdc25b</italic> were highly expressed in 4 D microglia but returned to homeostatic levels in 14 D microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g006">Fig 6D–6F</xref>).

<title>Adult newborn microglia engage a stepwise program to restore homeostatic gene expression</title>
<p>Gene enrichment analyses of fast-returning genes revealed a high degree of overlap with NF-κB pathway-related genes (41 out of 200 genes) such as <italic>Traf1</italic>, <italic>Il1a</italic>, and <italic>Il1b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g006">Fig 6G–6I</xref>).

Next, we examined the medium-return genes. Gene enrichment analysis showed strong representation of genes involved in interferon (IFN) pathways such as <italic>Stat1</italic>, <italic>Mx1</italic>, and <italic>Oas2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g006">Fig 6K–6N</xref>). The enrichment of IFN genes indicates inflammatory activation during early and middle phases of microglial repopulation that was resolved after 1 month. The gene enrichment analysis for the slow-return gene set did not have statistically significant overlapping pathways. However, gene ontology analysis focused on cellular components revealed 34% of slow-return genes are cell surface related (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g006">Fig 6O</xref>). Among the most up-regulated genes was <italic>Axl</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g006">Fig 6P</xref>), an important receptor involved in microglial phagocytic clearance of dead cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref032">32</xref>]. Other down-regulated genes include <italic>Mmp15</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g006">Fig 6Q</xref>), a metalloproteinase involved in extracellular matrix remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref033">33</xref>], and <italic>Sdc4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g006">Fig 6R</xref>), which is an important cell surface adhesion molecule involved in cell activation and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref034">34</xref>].</p>
<p>The delayed-response gene set revealed modest enrichment of GSEA hallmark genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g006">Fig 6S</xref>). Interestingly, immune-related genes across different inflammatory functions were highly over-represented. <italic>Ccl5</italic>, also known as RANTES, is an important chemotactic cytokine that modulates T-cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref035">35</xref>] and was found to be highly expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g006">Fig 6T</xref>). <italic>Rgs16</italic>, which antagonizes inflammatory activation in monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref036">36</xref>], was significantly down-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g006">Fig 6U</xref>). <italic>Gbp6</italic>, an IFN inducible guanosine triphosphatase, was found to be highly expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g006">Fig 6V</xref>).

<title>NF-κB promotes microglia repopulation</title>
<p>Among the fast-returning genes, an intricate network of NF-κB pathway-associated genes was identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). To understand the biological relationship between NF-κB signaling and early-phase microglial repopulation, we conditionally knocked out both copies of loxP-flanked I-Kappa-B-Kinase Beta (IKKβ) in microglia using CX3CR1-CreERT2/IKKβ<sup>F/F</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g007">Fig 7B</xref>).

Further quantification in 4 D microglia show that approximately 40% TUNEL+ cells were in phagocytic cups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g008">Fig 8F</xref>), while only 0.6% of microglia displayed this structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g008">Fig 8G</xref>), suggesting a high-clearance rate of dead cells in the repopulated brain and that the repopulated microglia are functionally intact. We next compared the percentage of TUNEL+ cells in 4 D microglia (EdU+Iba1+) versus resident microglia (EdU−Iba1+). We found that the TUNEL+ signal was more frequently associated with EdU+Iba1+ cells than EdU−Iba1+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g008">Fig 8H and 8I</xref>), suggesting that newborn microglia were more likely to undergo cell death. To rule out the possibility that the increased cell death might be an artifact of cell toxicity caused by EdU labeling, we compared the number of TUNEL+ cells in samples with or without EdU injection at 4 D and 14 D, which showed that EdU labeling did not skew the level of cell death (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000134.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). Thus, active cell death is closely associated with microglial proliferation, consistent with findings by Askew and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref011">11</xref>].</p>

<title>Microglia homeostatic density is re-established through steady turnover</title>
<p>Interestingly, we and others have consistently observed an overproliferative phenotype that resembles microgliosis during the first week of repopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref010">10</xref>]. We hypothesized that the resolution of microgliosis is achieved by egress of extra newborn cells. To measure the turnover rate of the repopulated microglia, we applied a pulse-chase approach using EdU labeling during the first 4 days of repopulation to track newborn microglia and extended the recovery time to 4 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). As expected, the number of EdU+Iba1+ microglia decayed over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g009">Fig 9B, 9C and 9D</xref>). By fitting the data with a nonlinear 1-phase decay model, we estimated the half-life of repopulated microglia to be 111.3 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g009">Fig 9E</xref>). A much shorter lifespan was also determined for EdU+Iba1− cells (T<sub>1/2</sub> = 21.44 days). The nonlinear 1-phase decay model assumes no additional proliferation, which was confirmed by the absence of proliferation marker Ki-67 after day 4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000134.s011">S11 Fig</xref>). We found that the turnover rate of the EdU+Iba1+ microglia was well correlated with egress of excessive microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g009">Fig 9F</xref>). Therefore, based on the decay rate of newborn microglia, microgliosis in the repopulated brain required up to 2 months to fully resolve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g009">Fig 9G</xref>). Microgliosis resolution in the repopulated brain is also likely to be facilitated by microglia self-engulfment, as we observed examples of microglia forming phagocytic cups around dead microglia in both 14 D and 4 Mo brains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000134.s012">S12 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000134.s015">S3</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000134.s018">S6 Videos</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our current study employed a chemical microglial ablation approach to query the mechanistic details of microglial homeostatic regulation. Remarkably, microglia seem to have inherent memory of their steady-state signature, as repopulated microglia eventually became almost identical to those in the resting state. The data presented here piece together a series of events that take place during microglial homeostatic restoration in adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g010">Fig 10</xref>). First, the depleted microglial pool expands through self-renewal that partially requires NF-κB signaling. Second, microglia recolonize the parenchyma from proximal clonal expansion and maintain stable spatial clusters. Third, newborn microglia re-establish maturity in a process that involves mitosis, apoptosis, interferon pathway activation, and surface molecule re-expression. Finally, homeostatic density is reached after egress of excessive newborn cells.</p>

<p>Microglia are expanded through self-renewal. First, the proliferation of repopulating microglia partially requires the NF-κB pathway. Next, newborn microglia recolonize the parenchyma forming stable spatial clusters once the cell proliferation is completed. During this process, newborn microglia re-established maturity in a process that involves mitosis, apoptosis, and IFN pathway activation. Expression of mature markers such as P2RY12, TMEM119, and MafB is restored. Finally, microglia re-establish steady-state density through passive egress of excessive newborn cells.

<p>The existence of CNS-resident microglial precursors cells has been controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref008">8</xref>]. In line with other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref039">39</xref>], our results demonstrate that the microglial pool can be replenished solely by self-renewal, with no detectable contribution from either resident CNS progenitors or peripheral circulating precursors. In the BMT chimera experiment, we observed most of the GFP+Iba1+ cells in the choroid plexus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g002">Fig 2E</xref>), in line with recent findings that choroid plexus macrophages represent a distinctive parenchyma myeloid population that constantly receives cellular exchange with circulating monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref001">1</xref>]. Consistent with a previous report by Elmore and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref008">8</xref>], we found a group of nonmicroglial cells that are highly proliferative after release from CSF1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g001">Fig 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000134.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), indicated by EdU labeling. Testing against a panel of common CNS markers, these cells appeared negative for Iba1, GFAP, NeuN, and S100β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g001">Fig 1M</xref>). Although a small subset of them appeared to be DCX+ or Olig2+, the vast majority of cells may represent an uncharacterized cell type that remains to be further investigated. Nevertheless, our lineage-tracing experiments using CX3CR1-CreERT2 unambiguously demonstrate that this population does not represent microglial precursors.</p>
<p>Spatial characteristics of microgliogenesis were largely inaccessible in the past. Stochastic labeling in microglia using the Microfetti approach now opens new possibilities to extract spatial information during microglial tiling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref022">22</xref>]. Using this approach, Tay and colleagues reported that microglia underwent clonal expansion in response to facial nerve injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref022">22</xref>]. In agreement with their finding, we found microglia also proliferate through clonal expansion following ablation. We also observed that not all seeding cells initiated clonal expansions, as evidenced by few scattered cells positioned between clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g004">Fig 4C, 4D and 4F</xref>). This might reflect the heterogenous nature of microglia, arguing for the potential existence of a subpopulation of microglia with differential “stemness.” To examine the stability of microglial tiling, we followed the retiled parenchyma over the course of 1 month. We found that microglia only migrate during clonal expansion and that tiling boundaries remained stable up to 1 month, suggesting that once microglial expansion is completed, the tiling pattern appeared to be static.</p>
<p>Originating from yolk sac progenitors, microglia follow a series of transcriptional programs to reach maturity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref025">25</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that adult microglial maturity is highly influenced by inflammatory signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref040">40</xref>]. Exposure to immune-activating agents during pregnancy has also been shown to shift microglia to a more mature stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref025">25</xref>]. In contrast, adult microglia deprived of any immune stimuli (using a germ-free environment) display an immature morphology, immature transcriptional signatures, and a dampened response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref040">40</xref>]. These results suggest that microglial maturity is not a simple continuum of their birth age but rather is shaped by external factors such as immune activation.</p>
<p>In support of a role for immune signaling in maturation, we found that genes associated with the NF-κB pathway were highly enriched during the early phase of microglial repopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Although the effects of microglia depletion under disease conditions have been investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref043">43</xref>], how NF-κB activation in repopulating microglia would impact neuropathology is unknown and needs to be addressed in future studies. Inhibiting the NF-κB pathway via conditional knockout of IKKβ resulted in partially impaired microglial repopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Furthermore, we and others have found that adult microglial renewal is closely associated with cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref011">11</xref>]. More studies are needed to clarify the biological significance for cell death during the maturation of newborn microglia.</p>
<p>Microglia have previously been considered a stable population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref044">44</xref>], but this view has been recently challenged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref011">11</xref>]. By quantifying the steady-state microglial proliferation rate, it was estimated that it takes 96 days to renew the entire rodent microglial pool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref011">11</xref>]. However, a recent study by Tay and colleagues used a similar approach and concluded that microglia are extremely stable, with a steady-state turnover rate of over 41 months in the cortex, 15 months in the hippocampus, and 8 months in the olfactory bulb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref022">22</xref>]. Although this study examined microglia in an unperturbed state, there are several caveats to its interpretation. First, assumptions regarding microglial cell cycle duration were made. Second, the labeling efficiency associated with nucleotide analogs such as EdU or Bromodeoxyuridine/5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) might not capture all proliferating microglia, resulting in an underestimation of the turnover rate. Third, sampling power was greatly limited since only a handful of cells could be captured at a given time. To overcome these limitations, we used a pulse-chase strategy with EdU labeling to directly track the decay of repopulated microglia and showed that they have a half-life of 111.3 days. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g009">Fig 9E</xref>). In other words, adult-born microglia have a lifespan of 7.5 months, such that a rodent brain could renew its entire microglial pool roughly 5 times in its lifetime. However, since our measurement started from repopulation day 14 when microglial homeostasis was not yet fully settled, 7.5 months may still be an underestimate of the actual microglial longevity. Indeed, a recent study by Füger and colleagues recorded microglial longevity via single-cell imaging and reported a lifespan of approximately 15 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref045">45</xref>]. In humans, microglial longevity is estimated be several decades long [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref046">46</xref>]. Thus, the egress of microglia that occurs following repopulation can be extremely slow and take months to fully resolve. In a way, this emphasizes the persistent nature of microgliosis in the context of sterile neuroinflammation. Therefore, strategies that can accelerate microglial turnover might be an overlooked avenue to treat neurological diseases for which microgliosis is the driving force.</p>
<p>The tremendous stability associated with microglial density over the lifetime in a rodent brain is quite remarkable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref011">11</xref>]. Even after acute ablation, microglia are able to return to the same homeostatic density. The mechanisms by which microglia are able to remember their homeostatic density is still unclear. One possible way could be due to contact inhibition. After microglial ablation, residual microglia isolated in space would lose contact inhibition exerted by neighboring microglia, thus allowing them to freely multiply. The observed overproliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000134.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref010">10</xref>] suggests that the inherent regulatory mechanism responsible for controlling density is switched off during microglial repopulation. Coincidentally, some surface molecules were still expressed at lower levels 1 month after repopulation including Syndecan-4, an important regulator of contact inhibition during cancer metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref034">34</xref>]. These genes are of great interest for future investigations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000134.s019">S1D Table</xref>). Nevertheless, the exact molecular machinery that sets the default homeostatic density remains to be characterized.</p>

Brain sections were prepared in a stereological manner. Sequential coronal planes in 30-μm thickness were collected and preserved in cyroprotectant containing 30% glycerol, 30% ethoxyethanol, and 40% PBS. Brain tissue samples were stored in −20°C before use. All staining experiments were performed on slices that were collected at the similar coronal planes.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>One or 2 coronal sections per mouse were used for each staining. Free-floating sections were washed in PBS and then permeabilized in PBST buffer (0.5% Triton X-100 diluted in PBS), followed by blocking in 3% normal donkey serum (NDS) at room temperature for 1 hour. Primary antibodies were diluted in PBST containing 3% NDS and incubated with tissues at 4°C overnight. Primary antibodies used in the study can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000134.s020">S2B Table</xref>. Secondary antibodies were then prepared the same way as primary antibodies and incubated with tissue at room temperature for 1 hour. All secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Secondary antibodies used in the study can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000134.s020">S2B Table</xref>. After secondary antibody staining, DAPI nuclear stain was conducted during the washing step as needed. Tissues were then mounted on glass slides for further processing or applied with anti-fade mounting media (Vector Laboratories, H-1000) for imaging. For detecting EdU+ cells in brain sections, Click-iT EdU-imaging kits (ThermoFisher Scientific, C10337, C10339) were used following the manufacturer’s instructions before the immunofluorescence staining procedures. For terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL), the DeadEnd Fluorometric TUNEL System (Promega, G3250) was used with minor alterations to the manufacturer’s recommendations. We adapted a method developed by Deng and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref048">48</xref>]. In brief, after the immunofluorescence staining was finished, free-floating brain sections were mounted on a charged glass slide (Fisher, 12-550-15) and dried at 55°C for 5 mins. Tissues were outlined with a hydrophobic pen (Vector Laboratories, H-4000). Mounted glass slides were then incubated in 0.5% Triton/PBS at 85°C for 20 min. After cooling to room temperature, the equilibration buffer from the kit was applied directly to the slide for 5 min, followed by application of TUNEL reaction solution and incubation at 37°C for 1 hour.</p>

<title>Image analyses</title>
<p>All image analyses were performed in FIJI V1.50i [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref049">49</xref>]. Image analyses codes used are available on GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/lihong1github/Image-analysis" xlink:type="simple">https://github.com/lihong1github/Image-analysis</ext-link>). In brief, TIFF images were processed with adaptive threshold function to generate binary cell masks (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sites.google.com/site/qingzongtseng/adaptivethreshold" xlink:type="simple">https://sites.google.com/site/qingzongtseng/adaptivethreshold</ext-link>). Then, the “Analyze Particles” function was used for cell counting. Cell density (per mm<sup>2</sup>) was calculated by normalizing cell number to the size of the analyzed area. For analyzing cells with multiple markers, the region of interest (ROI) was first generated from the base channel. Channels containing other markers of interest were thresholded to generate binary images. Each ROI generated from the base channel was then overlaid on to the binary images to calculate percent area of the marker of interest. In general, &gt;80% overlapping area is used to select ROIs that are positive for a second marker. To analyze microglia 3D morphology, confocal z-stacks with 8 focal planes of 2-μm interval were used. Three 425.1 × 425.1-μm<sup>2</sup> connecting fields of view spanning the hippocampal CA1 to CA2 were captured and stitched in ZEN Blue software (Zeiss). The stitched tile images were analyzed in IMARIS software (V9.0.2, Bitplane). Microglia processes were analyzed using IMARIS filament function.

<title>Acute brain slice imaging</title>
<p>Heterozygous CX3CR1<sup>eGFP/+</sup> mice of 3–3.5 months old were treated for 2 weeks with a PLX-containing diet and then switched to a regular diet to allow microglial repopulation for 6 days. Acute brain slices were prepared, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref047">47</xref>]. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with 20 mL of ice-cold, carbogen-saturated (95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) NMDG-HEPES artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) solution containing 93 mM NMDG, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.4 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 30 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 20 mM HEPES, 25 mM D-glucose, 5 mM ascorbic acid, 2 mM thiourea, 3 mM sodium pyruvate, 12 mM N-acetyl-L-cysteine, 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. The ACSF was adjusted to pH 7.4 before use. All reagents were obtained from Sigma. Brains were washed in NMDG-HEPES. Coronal slices (300-μm thick) were prepared using a vibratome (Microm, Walldorf, Germany) at 4°C. For imaging, hemibrain slices were transferred to a 35-mm glass bottom dish (MatTek) and secured under a slice anchor (Warner instruments). Imaging sessions were conducted within 4 hours after decapitation and preparation of the slice in order to reduce expression of activation markers by microglia. All imaging was done in non-NMDG ACSF solution containing (in mM) NaCl 92, KCl 2.5, NaH2PO4 1.4, NaHCO3 30, HEPES 20, D-glucose 25, Ascorbic acid 5, Thiourea 2, Sodium pyruvate 3, N-acetyl-L-cysteine 12, MgSO4 2, CaCl2 2, and pH 7.4 (all from Sigma). Carbogen-saturated ACSF flowed continuously over the slice using a perfusion pump system (Cole-Parmer) at a rate of 3 mL/min. Images were captured with a Zeiss Z1 Observer inverted epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Thornwood, New York) with an ORCA-Flash 4.0 sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Shizuoka, Japan) and a Zeiss Axiocam MRm monochrome camera run by Zeiss Zen imaging software. The microscope is equipped with a motorized stage and temperature-controlled incubation system. Acquisition of cortical microglia was performed at a range of 50 to 100 μm from the surface of the slice to prevent capture of activated microglia, and z-stack images (1-μm step-size) were taken every 60 seconds for 15 to 30 min at 488-nm excitation and 510-nm emission wavelengths using a 40x objective. The motility of microglia processes was analyzed using the ImageJ plugin MTrackJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000134.ref050">50</xref>] to calculate the velocity of process retraction and extension per imaged cell.</p>

<p>Female wild-type C57BL6 mice of 5–6 months were used. To identify differential gene expression during microglial repopulation, mice were treated for 2 weeks with PLX-containing diet and then switched to regular diet allowing microglial repopulation for various durations before being sacrificed for microglia isolation. These repopulation duration time points were set at 4 days (4 D), 14 days (14 D), and 1 month (1 Mo). P4 microglia were isolated from 4-day-old postnatal mice as an immature microglia control. Microglia isolated from each single mouse were used as an individual sample for downstream steps. A total of 3 pups (P4), 4 untreated adult mice (Ctrl), and 4 repopulated mice from each designed time point were used. Total RNA from fresh isolated microglia was extracted using Direct-zol RNA microprep kit (Zymo Research, R2061). cDNA library generation and RNA-seq service was performed by Novogene (Novogene Co., Ltd, Sacramento, California). RNA quality was examined by Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Genomics). RNA samples with RIN value greater than 8 were used for cDNA library. Oligo(dT) beads were used to enrich for mRNA. After chemical fragmentation, a cDNA library was generated using NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, E7530S). Quality of the cDNA library was assessed using Qubit assay for preliminary concentration, Bioanalyzer 2100 for insert size, and qPCR for effective library size. QC passed cDNA library samples were then sequenced with the HiSeq 4000 system (Illumina) at PE150.
