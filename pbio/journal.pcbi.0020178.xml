Humans, unlike other animal species, form large social groups in which cooperation among non-kin is widespread. This contrasts with the general assumption that the strong and selfish individuals are the ones who benefit most from natural selection. This being the case, how is it possible that unselfish behaviour has survived evolution? Adopting the terminology resulting from the seminal work of Hamilton, Trivers, and Wilson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b004">4</xref>], an act is altruistic if it confers a benefit <bold><italic>b</italic></bold> to another individual in spite of accruing a cost <bold><italic>c</italic></bold> to the altruist (where it is assumed, as usual, that <bold><italic>b &gt; c</italic></bold>). In this context, several mechanisms have been invoked to explain the evolution of altruism, but only recently an evolutionary model of indirect reciprocity (using the terminology introduced by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b005">5</xref>]) has been developed by Nowak and Sigmund [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b006">6</xref>], which, with remarkable simplicity, addressed “unique aspects of human sociality, such as trust, gossip, and reputation” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b007">7</xref>]. As a means of community enforcement, indirect reciprocity had been investigated earlier in the context of economics, notably by Sugden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b008">8</xref>] and Kandori [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b009">9</xref>] (see below). More recently, many studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b017">17</xref>] have been devoted to investigating how altruism can evolve under indirect reciprocity. Indeed, according to Alexander [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b005">5</xref>], indirect reciprocity presumably provides the mechanism that distinguishes us humans from all other living species on Earth. Moreover, as recently argued in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b010">10</xref>], “indirect reciprocity may have provided the selective challenge driving the cerebral expansion in human evolution.” In the indirect reciprocity game, any two players are supposed to interact at most once with each other, one in the role of a potential donor, with the other as a potential receiver of help. Each player can experience many rounds, but never with the same partner twice, direct retaliation being unfeasible. By helping another individual, a given player may increase (or not) her reputation, which may change the predisposition of others to help her in future interactions. However, her new reputation depends on the social norm used by her peers to assess her action as a donor. Previous studies of reputation-based models of cooperation reviewed recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b010">10</xref>] indicate that cooperation outweighs defection whenever, among other factors, assessment of actions is based on norms that require considerable cognitive capacities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b013">13</xref>], even when individuals are capable of making binary assessments only, in a “world in black and white” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b010">10</xref>], as assumed in most recent studies (see, however, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b006">6</xref>]). Furthermore, stable cooperation hinges on the availability of reliable reputation information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b006">6</xref>]. Such high cognitive capacity contrasts with technology-based interactions, such as e-trade, which also rely on reputation-based mechanisms of cooperation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b020">20</xref>]. Indeed, anonymous one-shot interactions between individuals loosely connected and geographically dispersed usually dominate e-trade, raising issues of trust-building and moral hazard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b021">21</xref>]. Reputation in e-trade is introduced via a feedback mechanism which announces the ratings of sellers. Despite the success and high levels of cooperation observed in e-trade, it has been found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b018">18</xref>] that publicizing a detailed account of the seller's feedback history does not improve cooperation, as compared with publicizing only the seller's most recent rating. In other words, practice shows that simple reputation-based mechanisms are capable of promoting high levels of cooperation. In view of the previous discussion, it is hard to explain the success of e-trade on the basis of the results obtained so far for reputation-based cooperation in the context of indirect reciprocity.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>A Model of Multilevel, Multigame Selection</title><p>Let us consider a world in black and white consisting of a set of tribes, such that each tribe lives under the influence of a single norm, common to all individuals (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020178-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Each individual engages once in the indirect reciprocity game (cf. Methods) with all other tribe inhabitants. Her action as a donor will depend on her individual strategy, which dictates whether she will <italic>provide help</italic> or <italic>refuse to do it</italic> depending on her and the recipient's reputation. Reputations are public: this means that the result of every interaction is made available to everyone through the “indirect observation model” introduced in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b013">13</xref>] (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b015">15</xref>]). This allows any individual to know the current status of the co-player without observing all of her past interactions. On the other hand, this requires a way to spread the information (even with errors) to the entire population (communication/language). Consistently, language seems to be an important cooperation promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b022">22</xref>], although recent mechanisms of reputation-spreading rely on electronic databases (e.g., in e-trade, where reputation of sellers is centralized). Since reputations are either <italic>GOOD</italic> or <italic>BAD,</italic> there are <bold><italic>2<sup>4</sup> = 16</italic></bold> possible strategies. On the other hand, the number of possible norms depends on their associated order. The simplest are the so-called <italic>first-order norms,</italic> in which all that matters is the action taken by the donor. In <italic>second-order norms,</italic> the reputation of one of the players (donor or recipient) also contributes to decide the new reputation of the donor. And so on, in increasing layers of complexity (and associated requirements of cognitive capacities from individuals) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020178-g002">Figure 2</xref>, which illustrates the features of third-order norms such as those we shall employ here. Any individual in the tribe shares the same norm, which in turn raises the question of how each inhabitant acquired it. We do not address this issue here. However, inasmuch as indirect reciprocity is associated with “community enforcement” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b010">10</xref>], one may assume, for simplicity, that norms are acquired through an educational process. Moreover, it is likely that a common norm contributes to the overall cohesiveness and identity of a tribe. It is noteworthy, however, that if norms were different for different individuals, the “indirect observation model” would not be valid, as it requires trust in judgments made by co-inhabitants. For a norm of order <bold><italic>n</italic></bold><italic>,</italic> there are <inline-formula id="pcbi-0020178-ex001"><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020178.ex001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>
					possible norms, each associated with a binary string of length 2<italic><sup>n</sup></italic>. We consider third-order norms (8-bit strings, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020178-g002">Figure 2</xref>): in assessing a donor's new reputation, the observer has to make a contextual judgment involving the donor's action, as well as her and the recipient's reputations scored in the previous action. We introduce the following evolutionary dynamics in each tribe: during one generation all individuals interact once with each other via the indirect reciprocity game. When individuals “reproduce,” they replace their strategy by that of another individual from the same tribe, chosen proportional to her accumulated payoff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b012">12</xref>]. The most successful individuals in each tribe have a higher reproductive success. Since different tribes are “under the influence” of different norms, the overall fitness of each tribe will vary from tribe to tribe, as well as the plethora of successful strategies that thrive in each tribe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020178-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This describes individual selection in each tribe (Level 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020178-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

The outer layer stipulates the donor's new reputation based on the three different reputation/action combinations aligned radially layer by layer: inward, the first layer identifies the action of the donor. The second layer identifies the reputation of the recipient; the third the reputation of the donor. Out of the 2<sup>8</sup> possible norms, the highly symmetric norm shown as the outer layer emerges as the most successful norm. Indeed, stern-judging renders the inner layer (donor reputation) irrelevant in determining the new reputation of the donor. This can be trivially confirmed by the symmetry of the figure with respect to the equatorial plane (not taking the inner layer into account, of course). All norms of second order will exhibit this symmetry, although the combinations of 1 and 0 bits will be, in general, different.

This norm is of <italic>second-order,</italic> which means that all that matters is the action of the donor and the reputation of the receiver. In other words, even when individuals are equipped with higher cognitive capacities, they rely on a simple norm as a key for evolutionary success. In a nutshell, helping a good individual or refusing help to a bad individual leads to a good reputation, whereas refusing help to a good individual or helping a bad one leads to a bad reputation. Moreover, we find that the final norm is independent of the specifics of the second-level selection mechanism, i.e., different second-level selection mechanisms will alter the rate of convergence, but not the equilibrium state. In this sense, we conjecture that more realistic procedures will lead to the same dominant norm.</p><table-wrap content-type="1col" id="pcbi-0020178-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020178.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Emerging Social Norm</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020178.t001" xlink:type="simple"/><!-- <table frame="hsides" rules="none"><colgroup><col id="tb1col1" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col2" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col3" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col4" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col5" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col6" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left"><hr/>b</td><td><hr/>Imitation Dynamics</td><td><hr/>Moran</td><td><hr/>Pairwise Comparison<sup>*</sup></td><td><hr/>War of Attrition</td><td><hr/>Hawk&ndash;Dove<sup>*</sup></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2</td><td>1001 1001</td><td valign= "middle">1&bull;01 1001</td><td>1001 1001</td><td>&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull; &bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;</td><td>1001 1001</td></tr><tr><td>&ge;3</td><td>1001 1001</td><td>1001 1001</td><td>1001 1001</td><td>1001 1001</td><td>1001 1001</td></tr></tbody></table> --><!-- <table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><p>For each value of the benefit b (c &equals; 1), each column displays the 8-bit norm emerging from the analysis of 500 simulations employing the selection method between tribes indicated as column headers.

On the other hand, <italic>image-score,</italic> the norm emerging from the work of Nowak and Sigmund [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b006">6</xref>], which has the attractive feature of being a simple, second-order norm (like <italic>stern-judging</italic>) does not belong to the <italic>leading-eight</italic>. Indeed, the features of <italic>image-scoring</italic> have been carefully studied in comparison with <italic>standing</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b017">17</xref>], showing that <italic>standing</italic> performs better than <italic>image-scoring,</italic> mostly in the presence of errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b012">12</xref>].</p><p>Among the <italic>leading-eight</italic> norms discovered by Ohtsuki and Iwasa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b015">15</xref>], only <italic>stern-judging</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b010">10</xref>] and the so-called <italic>simple-standing</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b031">31</xref>] constitute second-order norms (see below). Our present results clearly indicate that <italic>stern-judging</italic> is favored compared with all other norms. Nonetheless, in line with the model considered here, the performance of each of these norms may be evaluated by investigating how each norm performs individually, <italic>taking into account all 16 strategies simultaneously</italic>. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020178-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>, we carry out such comparison: we consider <italic>standing</italic> among the third-order norms, as well as <italic>stern-judging, image-scoring,</italic> and <italic>simple-standing</italic> among second-order norms. Note that, in spite of fixating the norm, errors of assessment and of implementation as well as errors of strategy update are taken into account. The results show that the overall performance of <italic>stern-judging</italic> is better than that of the other norms over a wide range of values of the benefit <bold><italic>b</italic></bold>. Furthermore, both <italic>standing</italic> and <italic>simple-standing</italic> perform very similarly, again pointing out that reputation-based cooperation can successfully be established without resorting to higher-order (more sophisticated) norms. Finally, <italic>image-scoring</italic> performs considerably worse than all the other norms, a feature already addressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b017">17</xref>]. Within the space of second-order norms, similar conclusions have been found recently by Ohtsuki and Iwasa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b031">31</xref>]. Note, however, that the result obtained here is stronger than the analysis carried out in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020178-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>, since <italic>stern-judging</italic> emerges as the most successful norm surviving selection and mutation with other norms, irrespective of the selection mechanism. In other words, <italic>stern-judging</italic>'s simplicity and robustness to errors may contribute to its evolutionary success, since other well-performing strategies may succumb to invasion of individuals from other tribes who bring along strategies that may affect the overall performance of a given tribe. In this sense, robustness plays a key role when evolutionary success is at stake. We believe that <italic>stern-judging</italic> is the most robust norm promoting cooperation.</p><p>The present result correlates nicely with the recent findings in e-trade, where simple, reputation-based mechanisms ensure high levels of cooperation. Indeed, <italic>stern-judging</italic> involves a straightforward and unambiguous reputation assessment, decisions of the donor being contingent only on the previous reputation of the receiver. We argue that the absence of constraining environments acting upon the potential customers in e-trade, for whom the decision of buying or not buying is free from further ado, facilitates the adoption of a <italic>stern-judging</italic> assessment rule. Indeed, recent experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b032">32</xref>] have shown that humans are very sensitive to the presence of subtle, psychologically constraining cues, their generosity depending strongly on the presence or absence of such cues. Furthermore, under simple unambiguous norms, humans may escape the additional costs of conscious deliberation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b033">33</xref>].</p><p>As conjectured by Ohtsuki and Iwasa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b013">13</xref>] (cf. also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b023">23</xref>]), group selection might constitute the key element in establishing cooperation as a viable trait. The present results show that even when more sophisticated selection mechanisms operate between tribes, the outcome of evolution still favors <italic>stern-judging</italic> as the most successful norm under which cooperative strategies may flourish.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We considered sets of <italic>64</italic> tribes, each tribe with <italic>64</italic> inhabitants. Each individual engages in a single round of the following indirect reciprocity game [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b010">10</xref>] with every other tribe inhabitant, assuming with equal probability the role of donor or recipient. The donor decides <italic>YES</italic> or <italic>NO,</italic> if she will provide help to the recipient, following her individual strategy encoded as a 4-bit string [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b014">14</xref>] (which takes into account the current donor and recipient status—see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020178-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>).

This action will be witnessed by a third-party individual, who, based on the tribe's social norm, will ascribe (subject to some small error probability <bold><italic>μ<sub>a</sub></italic></bold> = 0.001) a new reputation to the <italic>donor,</italic> which we assume to spread efficiently without errors to the rest of the individuals in that tribe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b014">14</xref>]. Moreover, individuals may fail to do what their strategy compels them to do, with a small execution error probability <bold><italic>μ<sub>e</sub></italic></bold> = 0.001. After all interactions take place, one generation has passed, simultaneously for all tribes. Individual strategies in each tribe replicate to the next generation in the following way: for every individual <bold><italic>A</italic></bold> in the population, we select an individual <bold><italic>B</italic></bold> proportional to fitness (including <bold><italic>A</italic></bold>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020178-b012">12</xref>].
