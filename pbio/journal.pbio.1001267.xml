        <p>A multimodal neuroimaging study of virtual spatial navigation extends the role of the hippocampal theta rhythm to human memory and self-directed learning.</p>
      </abstract><abstract>
        <p>The hippocampus is crucial for episodic or declarative memory and the theta rhythm has been implicated in mnemonic processing, but the functional contribution of theta to memory remains the subject of intense speculation. Recent evidence suggests that the hippocampus might function as a network hub for volitional learning. In contrast to human experiments, electrophysiological recordings in the hippocampus of behaving rodents are dominated by theta oscillations reflecting volitional movement, which has been linked to spatial exploration and encoding. This literature makes the surprising cross-species prediction that the human hippocampal theta rhythm supports memory by coordinating exploratory movements in the service of self-directed learning. We examined the links between theta, spatial exploration, and memory encoding by designing an interactive human spatial navigation paradigm combined with multimodal neuroimaging. We used both non-invasive whole-head Magnetoencephalography (MEG) to look at theta oscillations and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to look at brain regions associated with volitional movement and learning. We found that theta power increases during the self-initiation of virtual movement, additionally correlating with subsequent memory performance and environmental familiarity. Performance-related hippocampal theta increases were observed during a static pre-navigation retrieval phase, where planning for subsequent navigation occurred. Furthermore, periods of the task showing movement-related theta increases showed decreased fMRI activity in the parahippocampus and increased activity in the hippocampus and other brain regions that strikingly overlap with the previously observed volitional learning network (the reverse pattern was seen for stationary periods). These fMRI changes also correlated with participant's performance. Our findings suggest that the human hippocampal theta rhythm supports memory by coordinating exploratory movements in the service of self-directed learning. These findings directly extend the role of the hippocampus in spatial exploration in rodents to human memory and self-directed learning.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Neural activity both within and across brain regions can oscillate in different frequency ranges (such as alpha, gamma, and theta frequencies), and these different ranges are associated with distinct functions. In behaving rodents, for example, theta rhythms (4â12 Hz) in the hippocampus are prominent during the initiation of movement and have been linked to spatial exploration. Recent evidence in humans, however, suggests that the human hippocampus is involved in guiding self-directed learning. This suggests that the human hippocampal theta rhythm supports memory by coordinating exploratory movements in the service of self-directed learning. In this study, we tested whether there is a human analogue for the movement-initiation-related theta rhythm found in the rodent hippocampus by using a virtual navigation paradigm, combined with non-invasive recordings and functional imaging techniques. Our recordings showed that, indeed, theta power increases are linked to movement initiation. We also examined the relationship to memory encoding, and we found that hippocampal theta oscillations related to pre-retrieval planning predicted memory performance. Imaging results revealed that periods of the task showing movement-related theta also showed increased activity in the hippocampus, as well as other brain regions associated with self-directed learning. These findings directly extend the role of the hippocampal theta rhythm in rodent spatial exploration to human memory and self-directed learning.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Spatial exploration provides an ecologically valid experimental paradigm to investigate volitional behaviour and cognition across different species. In freely behaving rodents, the theta rhythm (â¼4â12 Hz) dominates the hippocampal local field potential (LFP) during translational motion, particularly prominent during initiation of movement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Vanderwolf1">[1]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Buzsaki1">[3]</xref>, and has been associated with the encoding and behavioural control of memories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Colgin1">[4]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Bast1">[5]</xref>. Notably, movement-related theta in rodents is modulated by environmental novelty <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Jeewajee1">[6]</xref> and has shown a correlation between age-related memory decline and decreased amplitude <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Tombaugh1">[7]</xref>. However, it has been difficult to disambiguate cognitive influences on the rodent hippocampus from effects of movement per se <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Kelemen1">[8]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Shin1">[9]</xref>. In human memory there has been a slightly different examination of volitional behaviour. The ability to self-initiate memory behaviours was observed as a crucial biomarker for age-related memory decline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Craik1">[10]</xref> and more recently the human hippocampus was observed to be a network hub for the volitional control of memory encoding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Voss1">[11]</xref>. Yet in the electrophysiology domain, human theta research (â¼4â8 Hz) has mostly focused on passive declarative or working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Lisman1">[12]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Fell1">[16]</xref>, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Duzel1">[17]</xref>). Thus the role of theta in self-directed learning and the correspondence between the role of theta in mnemonic processing and in self-initiated movement is unclear. Some studies have measured hippocampal theta during virtual navigation tasks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Ekstrom1">[18]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Watrous1">[21]</xref>, and these interactive human tasks may allow assessment of the roles of theta in both self-initiated virtual movement and self-directed learning within the same task.</p>
      <p>We designed a virtual exploration task that parallels foraging paradigms in rodents and behavioural and fMRI studies in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Doeller1">[22]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Doeller3">[24]</xref>. In our task, participants used a button box to move and explore a total of six novel or familiar environments (like a video game controller, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001267-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), while being scanned by a 275 sensor whole-head Magnetoencephalography (MEG) system. During the learning period of an experimental session, participants were instructed to remember (maintain spatial representations of object location) and navigate to the location of an object (either novel or familiar) in a particular trial. At the beginning of each trial, the participant would be placed in different locations within the environment and then use the button box to freely move around the environment. A single trial consists of navigation towards an object and then running over it, which marks the end of that trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001267-g001">Figure 1B</xref>; in each session there were six randomized familiar or novel objects each learned over three trials; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details). After completing the learning phase of a session, participants had a test phase for each object's location. In each test trial, participants were cued with a picture of a previously found object from that session's learning phase. Immediately after being cued, participants were placed in the virtual environment and had to navigate to the location where they had encountered the object and press a button (i.e., âreplaceâ it) to conclude the trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001267-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). As a follow-up (on a later date) with the same participants, we used fMRI functional localizer sessions composed of two analogous learning phases with familiar environments and objects. Participants subsequently completed the test phases outside of the fMRI scanner (refer to <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details).</p>

      <p>To see whether there is a human analogue for the movement-initiation-related theta rhythm found in the rodent hippocampus (type I theta, refer to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Vanderwolf1">[1]</xref>), we employed a multi-modal neuroimaging paradigm to look at human memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Gonsalves1">[25]</xref>. We looked for increased MEG theta power and hippocampal fMRI activity during the onset of self-initiated movement at any point within virtual navigation. To better corroborate movement-related theta, we also investigated the effect of environmental novelty with MEG. Additionally, we tested for relationships between subsequent memory performance and theta power, following related findings in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Klimesch1">[13]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Tesche1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Sederberg1">[26]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Rutishauser1">[31]</xref> and looked to see how this relationship interacted with any movement-related effects. We were interested to see how areas associated with movement- or performance-related theta effects might overlap with the hippocampal-dependent network observed during the active control of learning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Voss1">[11]</xref>. In this way, we aimed to clarify the functional roles of human theta oscillations in cognition and volitional behaviour, and synthesize previous findings in the hippocampus across rodents and humans. Our findings suggest that the theta rhythm supports hippocampal-dependent memory by coordinating exploratory movements in the service of self-directed learning.</p>

        <p>The average lengths of navigation trials in the learning and test periods were 10.6 s and 15.1 s, respectively (averaged over the 20 participants measured). Participants displayed a linear trend of spending less time navigating during learning (<italic>p</italic>â=â.006, <italic>F</italic>(1, 19)â=â9.416) and test (<italic>p</italic>â=â.015, <italic>F</italic>(1, 19)â=â7.105) trials in later experimental sessions. Replacement error (the distance between indicated object location and the correct location within the environment during the test phase) showed a linear trend of decreasing object replacement distance over the whole experiment (i.e., improving performance, <italic>p</italic>â=â.027, <italic>F</italic>(1, 19)â=â5.84), but no significant change in error within any individual session (<italic>p</italic>â=â.141, <italic>F</italic>(6, 19)â=â1.707, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001267.s001">Figure S1</xref>). There was no significant difference in replacement error between new and familiar environments (<italic>p</italic>â=â.141, <italic>t</italic>(19)â=ââ1.535), but performance for novel objects was significantly better than for familiar objects (<italic>p</italic>â=â.023, <italic>t</italic>(19)â=â2.464). The better memory performance for novel objects was not surprising, since familiar objects were used in a different location in a previous environment, which could lead to source interference (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001267.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

          <p>In order to perform an event-related characterization of the data, we analysed 1-s periods of movement onset or being stationary within any point of a navigation trial using five-cycle Morlet wavelets (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001267.s002">Figure S2</xref>; refer to <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details).

We used paired <italic>t</italic> tests to compare power during different types of epochs over multiple trials, where we looked for theta effects averaged across all sensors. Here and in the novelty analysis below we used a significance threshold of <italic>p</italic>&lt;.05 Family Wise Error (FWE) cluster corrected for multiple comparisons (over time and frequency) for both the movement and novelty effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Litvak1">[32]</xref>. There was a significant difference in theta power (i.e., 4â8 Hz power averaged over all sensors) for movement onset compared to stationary epochs, that peaked at â¼â50 ms (cluster-level FWE corrected <italic>p</italic>&lt;.040, <italic>t</italic>(17)â=â5.07) before the onset of movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001267-g002">Figure 2AâB</xref>). This demonstrated a significant increase in transient-induced theta power (centered around â¼5 Hz) preceding a 20 Hz (beta frequency) button press-related power increase. In both traces at the sensor level, the oscillatory nature of these differences is apparent (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001267.s003">Figure S3</xref> for an example). There was also activity at 14â16 Hz approximately 200 ms before movement, concurrent with an extension of the theta cluster. The oscillatory and temporal topography of the beta and theta oscillations on the time frequency plot (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001267-g002">Figure 2</xref>) parallels previous findings separating movement-related power changes during spatial wayfinding from simple motor planning during navigation experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Caplan1">[33]</xref>.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We sought to investigate volitional movement-related theta oscillations in and their relation to self-directed memory encoding and hippocampal fMRI activity during an ecologically valid virtual spatial memory task using MEG. We found increased theta power during movement initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001267-g002">Figure 2AâB</xref>), an effect that was enhanced in familiar environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001267-g002">Figure 2CâD</xref>). Additionally, we found performance-related theta power increases during navigation, which were stronger during volitional movement initiation than stationary periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001267-g003">Figure 3CâD</xref>). We also observed theta power increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001267-g003">Figure 3AâB</xref>) that were localized to the right hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001267-g005">Figure 5</xref>) during the static cue phase, where increases predicted subsequent spatial memory performance. fMRI functional localization of movement initiation periods revealed increased hippocampal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001267-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), and fMRI activations related to subsequent memory performance were also seen in the hippocampus during self-initiated movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001267-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>
      <p>The increase in theta power at the initiation of volitional movement parallels the increased theta power seen in rodent hippocampus during the initiation of movement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Vanderwolf1">[1]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-OKeefe1">[2]</xref> and the dominant influence of motoric contributions versus cognitive factors in rodent studies of theta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Kelemen1">[8]</xref>. These findings corroborate previous findings of virtual movement-related theta oscillations in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Ekstrom1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Caplan1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Jacobs1">[35]</xref> and rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Harvey1">[36]</xref>. In our task, the top movement speed was held constant, but there has been evidence that delta/theta power in the human hippocampus increases with virtual movement speed during navigation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Watrous1">[21]</xref>. The increase in theta power in familiar environments compared to novel ones during the initiation of movement parallels the reduction in theta frequency (but not necessarily power) found when a rat enters a novel environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Jeewajee1">[6]</xref>. These changes were only found in response to environmental familiarity versus novelty, but not object familiarity versus novelty, supporting our hypothesis of theta power changes specifically in response to environmental novelty. This is consistent with the rodent literature where processing the novelty of the environment, rather than the objects within it, is specifically dependent on the hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Save1">[37]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Lee1">[39]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In addition to motoric and environmental factors, we also found links between theta power and cognitive performance, following previous studies in humans. Theta power in the (static) cue period (where participants coordinated the retrieval of object location prior to navigation) reflected subsequent replacement accuracy, consistent with previous MEG and EEG studies of human memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Klimesch1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Sederberg1">[26]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Rutishauser1">[31]</xref>. The source of this theta effect was localized to the right hippocampus, in line with previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Doeller2">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Abrahams1">[40]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Burgess1">[43]</xref>. Notably, sensor-level peak theta power was higher in better performing participants, suggesting behavioural relevance.</p>
      <p>We next examined the relationship between the movement-initiation-related theta during learning trials and subsequent performance in test trials. We found that the theta power difference between movement-initiation and stationary periods increased in trials in which there was more accurate subsequent memory performance.</p>
      <p>Analysis of 1-s movement initiation periods with our fMRI functional localizer task demonstrated increased activity in the right hippocampus, in line with previous studies linking the right hippocampus to navigation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Doeller2">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Abrahams1">[40]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Burgess1">[43]</xref>.

Interestingly there was a notable dissociation of navigation-related fMRI activations in the medial temporal lobe: in contrast to the hippocampal activation, which was specific to movement initiation, the reverse fMRI contrast (stationary versus movement initiation) showed bilateral activation of the posterior parahippocampal cortex, consistent with its role in static scene processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Epstein1">[50]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Increased bilateral hippocampal fMRI activity related to movement initiation was seen in participants who showed better subsequent memory for the object locations. This finding suggests a link between the process of self-directed movement initiation and encoding efficiency within this task, consistent with previous findings relating hippocampal activation during encoding with subsequent memory performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Wagner1">[51]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Davachi1">[52]</xref>; for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Paller1">[53]</xref>).</p>
      <p>The presence of a performance-related increase in theta power during active exploration provides a possible link to human behavioural and fMRI studies of active versus passive learning enhancements derived from the hippocampal-dependent volitional control network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Voss1">[11]</xref>. Voss and colleagues demonstrated that the hippocampus supports volitional control of exploratory behaviour so as to optimize learning of object locations. There is significant overlap between this concept and the hypothesized functional role for hippocampal theta in behavioural control of exploration, active movement during a spatial memory task being an example of the active control of learning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-OKeefe1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Morris1">[54]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-OKeefe2">[55]</xref>. Thus in accordance with O'Keefe and Nadel, we propose that movement-related theta may aid in signalling the potential for volitional control of encoding, which is consistent with findings in rodents showing increased hippocampal theta power for volitional versus deterministic movement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Song1">[56]</xref> and humans showing increased hippocampal theta power for goal-directed versus aimless movements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Cornwell1">[20]</xref>. Notably, the possibility that movement-related theta interacts with performance-related influences on theta is further supported by our finding that both theta power and hippocampal activity for movement initiation relative to stillness correlate with performance during navigation, a time period where the participant has active control over how he or she encodes a particular spatial representation.</p>
      <p>Although we measured theta power and hippocampal blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal increases in the same 1-s time periods corresponding to navigation behaviour and memory performance in the same participants, we do not assume a direct correlation between BOLD and theta oscillatory power. The relationship between BOLD and hippocampal theta is unclear. Past work by Ekstrom and colleagues has shown decoupling between hippocampal BOLD and theta, despite findings that BOLD and theta may negatively correlate elsewhere in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Ekstrom2">[57]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Meltzer1">[59]</xref>. Additionally, it is important to emphasize that even the MEG signals on temporal sensors were not being measured specifically from the hippocampus, although we note that the analogous aspects of theta oscillations in rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Vanderwolf1">[1]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-OKeefe1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Jeewajee1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Grastyan1">[60]</xref> are known to depend on the septo-hippocampal system. Unlike the performance effect during the 3-s Cue Period, we were not able to localize the source of the movement-initiation related theta increase, possibly because its transient nature did not allow good frequency resolution. In our experiment, the participants typically moved in 1-s periods, precluding the investigation of longer time windows. Longer periods of continuous virtual movement would allow us to better investigate induced low frequency activity in the hippocampus, as seen in other experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Ekstrom1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Watrous1">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Given the literature in rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Hyman1">[61]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Jones1">[62]</xref> and humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Brown1">[63]</xref> showing hippocampal-prefrontal interactions during spatial navigation, we investigated the MEG signal from both regions. Consistent with this literature, we found virtual movement-related theta in both the frontal midline and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001267.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Numerous studies have also found task-related midline frontal theta power and phase changes during successful memory encoding and maintenance (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Klimesch2">[64]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Fell3">[66]</xref>). These performance effects are thought to underpin key neocortical-hippocampal interactions in learning and memory. Future research will investigate the probable midline frontal and hippocampal sources of the theta-band signals reported here, and their potential interactions with other brain regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Colgin1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Fell3">[66]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Penny1">[68]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our performance correlates of theta power complement previous MEG work looking at medial temporal lobe theta power before the onset of an encoding trial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Guderian1">[28]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Fell2">[30]</xref> and increased theta power for successfully encoded memories during mnemonic processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Klimesch1">[13]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Tesche1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Sederberg1">[26]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Osipova1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Rutishauser1">[31]</xref>. Furthermore, by showing enhanced subsequent memory effects during virtual movement over stationary periods, this is the first study to our knowledge that implicates self-initiated movement-related theta increases with self-directed learning.</p>
      <p>The hippocampus and corresponding theta oscillations have been hypothesized as a network hub <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Buckner1">[69]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Battaglia1">[70]</xref> and global signal integrator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-OKeefe2">[55]</xref> for information from around the brain. The potential role for hippocampal theta for guiding self-directed learning paves the way to investigate how theta and hippocampal-related active control mechanisms interact with a wide range of networks responsible for dynamic evaluative behaviours like planning and novelty processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Rutishauser1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Axmacher1">[71]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Benchenane1">[72]</xref> in which theta power and synchrony changes have been observed. For instance, evaluative behaviours relating to emotion and anxiety have been associated to theta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Gray1">[73]</xref>. Theta synchronization in rodents has been observed between the hippocampus and the amygdala during fear learning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Seidenbecher1">[74]</xref> and between the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex during anxiety <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Adhikari1">[75]</xref>. Hippocampal theta dysfunction related to learning control dynamics during encoding could possibly represent core pathology in mental illnesses, where feelings of helplessness (i.e., lack of control) in certain environments are common, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Gould1">[76]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Cornwell2">[77]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In summary, our results indicate the key role movement and the resulting self-initiated dynamic control of spatial encoding have in generating human theta oscillations and supporting hippocampal mnemonic function. Further studies into oscillatory characteristics and functional networks associated with the hippocampus and volitional learning will be necessary to clarify the role hippocampal theta has in the control of active learning. By using an interactive ecologically realistic experimental task and multi-modal neuroimaging to investigate hippocampal function, our results show that an analogue of Type I theta in the rodent hippocampus can be found in humans and likely serve to coordinate self-directed learning.</p>

        <p>Twenty right-handed male participants (mean ageâ=â23.5 years, SDâ=â5.06, range 18â35) gave written consent and were compensated for performing the experimental task, as approved by the local Research Ethics Committee. All participants were right-handed with normal or corrected-to-normal vision and reported to be in good health with no prior history of neurological disease. One participant was excluded from the analysis because of equipment malfunction, and another was excluded from analyses because of signal artifacts. Eighteen right-handed male participants were therefore analyzed in the MEG dataset, with one being excluded from the source reconstruction because of a problem with co-registration between the MEG head position and structural MR image. Fourteen of these also participated and were analyzed for the fMRI functional localizer.</p>

        <title>Virtual Reality Environment</title>
        <p>UnrealEngine2 Runtime software (Epic Games) was used to present a first-person perspective viewpoint of four different environments, a dry sandy environment surrounded by dunes (practice environment), a snowy grassy urban environment surrounded by skyscrapers, a rocky desert environment surrounded by pyramids, and a grassy plane surrounded by a circular cliff with a background of mountains, clouds, and the sun. In all environments, background cues were projected at infinity to provide orientation but not location within the arena. Participants moved the viewpoint by using their right hand to press keys to move forward or turn left or right. The viewpoint is â¼2 virtual meters above the ground, and all four environments had the same arena size (area). Virtual heading and locations were recorded every 25 ms.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s4c">
        <title>Stimuli, Task, and Trial Structure</title>
        <p>The experiment was composed of eight sessions. The first two sessions were practice sessions using the same virtual desert environment, conducted on a laptop outside the scanner. The participants first familiarized themselves with the environment by navigating around and then collecting objects in the environment by running them over and then being tested on their previous location <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Doeller2">[23]</xref>. These practice sessions lasted for about 2â3 min.</p>
        <p>In the MEG scanner, an individual trial consisted of a participant being randomly placed in an environment and having to navigate towards an object to collect and remember its location (average duration â¼10.6 s). Participants had three trials to learn the location for each of the six objects. Next, the participants were presented with a grey screen that read âPlease Blinkâ for a 1.5-s blink phase, then a 1-s intertrial baseline where a crosshair was presented on a grey screen. During the learning period of the session, there were 18 trials each consisting of a learning phase blink phase, and baseline intertrial interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001267-g001">Figure 1</xref>). After the learning period of a session was completed, there was a 30-s inter-phase rest period, when instructions on the next phase (test phase) were presented. The test phase for the location of each of the six collected objects started with a 3-s period in which an object was presented on a grey background (cue phase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001267-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Participants were then randomly placed in the environment and told to navigate to the spot where they believed the pictured object had been located (average duration â¼15.1 s). They then pressed a button to âdropâ the object or indicate its previous location. Once the button was pressed a grey screen appeared that read âPlease Blinkâ for a 1.5-s blink phase, followed by a 1-s intertrial baseline.</p>
        <p>In the fMRI functional localizer component, participants had functional scans during performance of two different learning period sessions. After they had completed both functional localizer sessions, participants had separate test sessions (i.e., first test for first learning session, second test for second learning session) for each respective learning session to gauge subsequent performance, where they were not scanned. The functional localizer had the same trial structure and amounts as the MEG experiment with the exception of an extended 4-s inter-trial interval (without a blink phase) to account for the timescale of the BOLD signal.</p>

        <title>Details of Procedure and Design</title>
        <p>Participants were instructed that they were going to navigate through a virtual environment over multiple sessions using a button box, and that they would have to pick up several different objects (six) in the environment, three times each (three objects, three times each for the two practice sessions). The order of trials was randomized but (unknown to participants) separated into three mini-blocks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Doeller2">[23]</xref>. Object location never changed within a session. After they completed this exploration phase, they were tested at the end in a test period by having to navigate to where they thought the object had been located and press a button.</p>
        <p>During MEG scanning, a new environment was presented and then re-presented at the next session as a familiar environment. This occurred on four occasions (three within the MEG), so that half of the eight environments in the experiment were novel and the others were familiar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001267-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The order of environments in the MEG sessions was randomized across participants. Each environment arena had the same distance area, but did have its own unique shape (square, circle, triangle, and rectangle) to differentiate the environment. It is also important to note that virtual movement during navigation trials consisted of continued forward button pressing causing a constant speed of forward motion.</p>
        <p>As a control measure for environmental novelty independent of other novelty effects (i.e., object-novelty) during movement initiation, participants were presented with counterbalanced familiar or novel objects within each environment. Following the practice sessions, the objects presented in an environment were comprised of objects that the participants had either collected (âfamiliarâ) or not collected (ânovelâ) in a previous session. Familiar objects were first introduced during the practice session outside of the scanner.</p>
        <p>For the fMRI functional localizer, there was no manipulation of environmental or object novelty. The two sessions were conducted in the circle mountain environment used in the MEG experiment with all novel objects for both sessions. Otherwise, the procedure was analogous to the MEG design.</p>

        <title>MEG Acquisition</title>
        <p>Recordings were made in a magnetically shielded room with a 275-channel Canadian Thin Films (CTF) system with superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)-based axial gradiometers (VSM MedTech Ltd.) and second-order gradients. Neuromagnetic signals were digitized continuously at a sampling rate of 480 Hz and behavioural responses were made via an MEG-compatible response pad. We used a high pass filter of 0.1 Hz and a low pass filter of 120 Hz. Head positioning coils were attached to nasion, left, and right auricular sites to provide anatomical coregistration. Coils were energized before and after each session to determine head movement and position within the MEG dewar. At acquisition for some participants, some sensors were corrupted. As a result, only 270 of the 275 sensors were analyzed to keep data consistent across all participants.</p>

        <title>Pre-Processing</title>
        <p>Although the total trial duration varied, to assess the effects of virtual movement and novelty, we defined fixed-length segments where the participant's state was comparable across trials at any period (learning and test) in the experiment. Epochs corresponding to movement initiation were defined as â200 to 800 ms relative to the initiation of forward displacement at any point in any navigation (learning and test periods) trial, where participants moved for at least 1,000 ms. As an equal length comparison condition within the experiment, stationary epochs were characterized as 500 ms after a participant had stopped moving for a duration of 1,000 ms without any forward displacement at any point during any navigation (learning and test periods) trial. Both of these windows were extended by an additional 1,000 ms on either side for analysis purposes. Importantly, participants' top speed remained constant during all movement periods. Within the movement-based analyses, epochs were defined as belonging to one of ten different conditions in which movement and stationary epochs were separated by whether they occurred within novel environments or during novel object trials: movement onset during a familiar object trial, movement onset during a novel object learning trial, stationary period during a familiar object learning trial, stationary period during a novel object learning trial, and the 1,000 ms inter-trial baseline condition. To look at environmental novelty, these five conditions were also defined the same way, but the extra factor of session environment (familiar or novel) was added.</p>
        <p>For the subsequent memory analysis during exploration (1-s movement and stationary epochs), the epochs were divided into well-performed trials and poorly performed trials at a median split for each participant. In this analysis there were five trial types: movement onset during a well-performed trial, stationary period during a well-performed trial, movement onset during a poorly performed trial, stationary period during a poorly performed trial, and the inter-trial baseline.</p>
        <p>On average each participant had 178.2 movement onset epochs versus 197.8 stationary epochs with 138 baseline epochs. For the environmental novelty contrast, each participant had on average 90.7 virtual movement initiation epochs in a novel environment, 87.5 virtual movement onset epochs in a familiar environment, 105.1 stationary epochs in a novel environment, 92.7 stationary epochs in a familiar environment, 69 baseline epochs in a familiar environment, and 69 baseline epochs in a novel environment. For object novelty, each participant had an average of 85.2 virtual movement onset epochs measured during novel object trials, 93 virtual movement onset epochs measured during familiar object learning trials, 98.3 stationary trials measured during novel object trials, and 99.5 stationary trials measure during familiar object trials. For the subsequent memory analysis during navigation (an average total of 273.1 epochs per participant), there were 62.9 virtual movement onset epochs during subsequent accurately performed learning trials, 62.9 virtual movement onset epochs during subsequent inaccurately performed learning trials, 73.3 stationary epochs during subsequent accurately performed learning trials, 73.9 stationary inaccurately performed learning trials, and 102 baseline trials.</p>
        <p>For the cue period analysis, the 36 3-s-long cue periods were divided into well-performed trials versus poorly performed trials. There was also a 1-s baseline prior to each 3-s-long cue period trial.</p>

        <title>Time-Frequency Analysis</title>
        <p>Two seconds of padding (one second at each end) were added to the movement epochs to capture more theta cycles. Additionally, trials were inspected and removed if they contained eyeblink artifacts. Data were downsampled to 120 Hz, and a five-cycle morlet wavelet time-frequency analysis ranging from 3 to 48 Hz with a frequency resolution of 1 Hz was conducted. Lower delta frequencies (below 3 Hz) were not measured because of the limited number of possible cycles in the short trial length and edge effects. The same analysis stream was followed for the cue phase analysis, with the exception that cue epochs lasted 3 s with another 1 s pre-stimulus baseline, in which the participant was intended to stare at a fixation cross. With 3-s-long epochs there was a lower chance of edge effects in the delta frequency band (1â4 Hz), so we extended our time-frequency analysis to 2 to 48 Hz. Still, to avoid edge effects, the 3-s-long time window was reduced to 2.5 s.</p>
        <p>Next, a weighted average (i.e., making sure that trial numbers between participants were weighted into calculated averages) of time-frequency trials was calculated within participants and session by condition. Data were then log transformed and baseline corrected (i.e., the data were expressed as a multiple of baseline power). For the movement analyses, the baseline was computed from a set of 1,000 ms baseline trials. For the cue period analysis the first 1,000 ms prior to the cue onset were used as a baseline.</p>
        <p>Time-frequency data were then converted into Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI) format. This produced a 3-D image of Channel SpaceÃTime. The frequency dimension was averaged across the theta frequency band (4â8 Hz) based on our a priori hypotheses.</p>

Coregistration to the MNI coordinates was based on three fiducial points: nasion and left and right preauricular. The forward model was derived from a single-shell model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001267-Nolte1">[79]</xref> fit to inner skull surface of the inverse normalized SPM template.

First, based on the data covariance and lead field structure, weights are calculated which linearly map sensor data to each source location. Second, a summary statistic based on the change in source power or amplitude over experimental conditions is calculated at each voxel. In this case the summary statistic at each voxel is the change in source power in the 4â8 Hz band normalized by the projected sensor white noise power. In this case, the periods under comparison were accurately and inaccurately remembered trials in a time window 500â1,500 ms after Cue onset (i.e., within the cue period).
