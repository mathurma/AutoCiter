<abstract>
<p>Centralspindlin, a constitutive 2:2 heterotetramer of MKLP1 (a kinesin-6) and the non-motor subunit CYK4, plays important roles in cytokinesis. It is crucial for the formation of central spindle microtubule bundle structure. Its accumulation at the central antiparallel overlap zone is key for recruitment and regulation of downstream cytokinesis factors and for stable anchoring of the plasma membrane at the midbody. Both MKLP1 and CYK4 are required for efficient microtubule bundling. However, the mechanism by which CYK4 contributes to this is unclear. Here we performed structural and functional analyses of centralspindlin using high-speed atomic force microscopy, Fӧrster resonance energy transfer analysis, and in vitro reconstitution. Our data reveal that CYK4 binds to a globular mass in the atypically long MKLP1 neck domain between the catalytic core and the coiled coil and thereby reconfigures the two motor domains in the MKLP1 dimer to be suitable for antiparallel microtubule bundling. Our work provides insights into the microtubule bundling during cytokinesis and into the working mechanisms of the kinesins with non-canonical neck structures.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Cell division requires coordination of many different cellular components. Cytokinesis is the process by which the cytoplasm divides between the two forming daughter cells. During cytokinesis, centralspindlin is truly central, as it organizes microtubule bundle structures, recruits other factors to the site of division, and anchors the plasma membrane at the inter-cellular bridge while the two daughter cells are waiting for the final separation. Centralspindlin is a heterotetramer composed of two molecules of a kinesin-6 motor subunit, MKLP1, and two molecules of the second subunit, CYK4. For efficient microtubule bundling, both the microtubule motor subunit MKLP1 and the non-motor CYK4 subunit are required. However, it has remained unclear how CYK4 contributes to this activity. Here, we took a combinatorial approach to investigate this process, using in vitro reconstitution and structural analyses by atomic force microscopy and Förster resonance energy transfer. We revealed that the CYK4 dimer binds to a hitherto unknown globular domain at the neck of the MKLP1 dimer and optimizes the configuration of two motor domains, making them suitable for antiparallel microtubule bundling. This provides novel insight into how other kinesin superfamily molecules with non-canonical neck structures may work.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Centralspindlin is an evolutionarily conserved, constitutive 2:2 heterotetrameric complex of a kinesin-6 subunit MKLP1 and a non-motor subunit CYK4. In this article, we shall use the term “MKLP1” to refer collectively to the orthologs of the mammalian KIF23/MKLP1 [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], such as <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> ZEN-4, and the term “CYK4” to denote the orthologs of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> CYK-4 [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], such as mammalian RACGAP1/MgcRacGAP [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Centralspindlin plays essential roles in cytokinesis by forming central spindle and midbody microtubule bundle structures, by recruiting and regulating various factors at the site of division, and by anchoring the plasma membrane in the intercellular bridge while the daughter cells are waiting for abscission [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A point mutation in KIF23/MKLP1 is the cause of congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type III, which is characterized by large multinucleated erythroblasts in bone marrow [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Both the MKLP1 and CYK4 subunits are essential for microtubule bundling by centralspindlin [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In vitro, neither MKLP1 alone nor CYK4 alone can efficiently bundle microtubules. In vivo, depletion of either component or point mutations that affect the formation of the centralspindlin heterotetramer cause the central spindle defects [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Strikingly, although genetic screens in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> for suppressors of such complex-disrupting mutations (S15L in CYK-4 or D520N in ZEN-4) so far identified 15 independent point mutations, all reside within limited regions; CYK-4 12–39 and ZEN-4 477–515. It is likely that these findings define the binding interfaces between these subunits [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] (summarized in <xref rid="pbio.1002121.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). These are included in the minimal domains of CYK-4 and ZEN-4 sufficient for in vitro reconstitution of the stable complex between them (CYK-4 1–120 and ZEN-4 435–555). These data emphasize the importance of heterotetramer formation for microtubule bundling and suggest that the tetramer assembly is achieved through compact domains without extensive contact, such as a long four-helix bundle. However, it remains unclear how CYK4 contributes to microtubule bundling.</p>

<p>Although MKLP1, a kinesin-6 [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], has the kinesin motor domain at its N-terminus, it is distinct from other N-terminal kinesins (N-kinesins). In kinesins-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, and -7, the catalytic core, which contains an ATP-binding pocket and a microtubule-binding surface, is connected to the coiled coil via a short conserved sequence motif of about 15 aa, so-called the "neck linker" [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The neck linker docks to the catalytic core in a manner bidirectionally coupled to the nucleotide and microtubule-binding states of the catalytic core. Thus, it plays crucial roles in force-generation by individual motor domains and in the mechanochemical coordination between the two heads in walking kinesin dimers. Interestingly, MKLP1 does not have a recognizable neck linker. Instead, the catalytic core of MKLP1 is connected to the coiled coil via a longer "neck" sequence of 60–70 aa, which contains dispersed helix/coil-breaking proline residues (“MKLP1” in <xref rid="pbio.1002121.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Importantly, this neck region of MKLP1 contains the CYK4 binding site. Because of these unusual mechanistic features, the molecular structure of the heterotetrameric centralspindlin complex of CYK4 and MKLP1 is of great interest. Although a recent study using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy reported a change in the mobility of ZEN-4 neck residues upon CYK-4 binding [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], it remains unclear how this influences the configuration of the two motor domains and how this modulates microtubule bundling by the complex.</p>
<p>Here we performed direct visualization of the dynamic structure of centralspindlin by atomic force microscopy. Our data indicate that CYK4 binding to the neck domain of the MKLP1 dimer remodels the configuration between the two motor domains. Furthermore, by using in vitro functional assays, we demonstrate that this reconfiguration optimizes the centralspindlin complex for the formation of and accumulation to the antiparallel microtubule bundles crucial for cytokinesis.</p>

<title>High-Speed AFM Identifies a Globular Mass at the Neck Region of ZEN-4/MKLP1</title>
<p>Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is unique in its capability to capture high-resolution images of intact biological samples in aqueous solution without chemical fixation or staining [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Recent dramatic improvement of the temporal resolution achieved by high-speed AFM (HS-AFM) enables direct observation of dynamic protein behaviors such as conformational change and association/dissociation [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Here, we utilized this technique to visualize how CYK4 is complexed with MKLP1.</p>
<p>We started by observing full-length <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> ZEN-4 kinesin tagged with a green fluorescent protein, monomeric Azami Green (Z775mAG, <xref rid="pbio.1002121.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], adsorbed onto a mica surface. Under a salt free condition (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002121.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Movie</xref>), which would promote adsorption of the protein to the mica surface and thus allow a better resolution, we observed that the tagged ZEN-4 molecule consists of a pair of globular domains (pseudocolored in yellow in the bottom rows), a nearby smaller globular mass (cyan), a short rod-like structure (magenta), flexible linkers (magenta), and another pair of fluctuating globular domains (green). Other representative examples of independent molecules of Z775mAG under this condition are found in <xref rid="pbio.1002121.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002121.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Movie</xref>. In the presence of a slightly increased salt (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002121.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Movie</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002121.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002121.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Movie</xref> for other representative images), which would minimize artificial extension of the flexible protein molecules that might be caused by excess adsorption to the surface, the images of the molecules became somewhat less clear due to the increased mobility. Nonetheless, we could detect the same features, although the fluctuating globular domains (pseudocolored green) now appeared smaller than the pair of the globular domains (yellow) with a nearby small globular domain (cyan). Hereafter, we used this condition to better preserve dynamic inter-domain configurations.</p>

<p>Z775mAG has a globular kinesin domain at its N-terminus. A small globular domain at the ZEN-4 C-terminus [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] tagged with a fluorescent protein moiety would also appear as a single globular mass by AFM. To assign these to the molecular features observed above, we then observed a ZEN-4 construct, Z601, which lacks both the C-terminal tail and the mAG tag (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A and 1C</xref>). Similarly to Z775mAG, we could detect the two large globular domains (yellow) with a nearby smaller globular mass (cyan) in Z601 (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002121.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Movie</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002121.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002121.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Movie</xref> for other representative images). On the other hand, the highly mobile globular domains (green) that were linked to the other part of the Z775mAG molecule via a flexible linker (magenta) were not detected. Thus, we conclude that these missing parts, i.e., the majority of the flexible linker and the highly mobile globular domains, correspond to the C-terminal tail of ZEN-4 and the mAG tag. This is consistent with the prediction that about two-thirds of the ZEN-4 tail (around aa 600 to 710) would be unfolded [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p>
<p>The parts commonly detected in Z775mAG and Z601 should correspond to ZEN-4 1–601, which include the kinesin motor domain (aa 20–434), regions predicted to be parallel coiled coils with high (aa ~530 to ~565, CC1) or low (aa ~566 to ~600, CC2) probabilities and the neck domain that links these parts (aa 435 to ~530) (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). A motor domain (415 aa) should form a globular domain, which is bigger than the other parts in a Z601 dimer combined (166 aa × 2). Thus, the two larger globular domains (yellow) should be assigned to the ZEN-4 motor domains. The smaller mobility of these domains than the C-terminal tail domain plus the mAG tag, especially in the absence of salt, might be due to stronger adsorption of the positively charged microtubule-binding surface to the negatively charged mica surface under this condition. Interestingly, in both Z775mAG and Z601, we observed an unexpected globular mass (cyan) at the interface between the two motor domains and the flexible linker (magenta), which largely disappeared in Z601 except for a short remnant. This indicates that at least a part of the long ZEN-4 neck sequence (aa 435 to ~530) folds into a globular structure (cyan) as, otherwise, the two motor domains would appear to be linked by long and flexible linkers similar to those in the C-terminal tail (around aa 600 to 710).</p>

<title>CYK4 Binds to the Neck Globular Mass in MKLP1</title>
<p>We then proceeded to analyze the complex of CYK-4 and ZEN-4. CYK-4 1–120 (C120), the minimum fragment of CYK-4 that is able to dimerize and form a complex with ZEN-4, was coexpressed with Z775mAG in bacteria, co-purified through affinity purification steps and gel filtration (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002121.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref> for co-elution from a gel filtration column) and subjected to HS-AFM (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002121.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Movie</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002121.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002121.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Movie</xref> for other examples). In Z775mAG/C120, all the parts found in Z775mAG alone, such as the motor domains (yellow), the neck globular mass (cyan), and the ZEN-4 C-terminal tail plus mAG, were commonly detected. In addition, a flexible tail-like structure (red) was occasionally observed protruding from the neck globular mass (cyan) on the opposite side of the flexible tail linker (magenta) in Z775mAG/C120. As this was never observed in Z775mAG alone, we ascribe this structure to the coiled coil (predicted to be aa ~40 to ~120) of CYK-4. The neck globular mass in the complex appeared bigger than that found in Z775mAG without C120, suggesting that the N-terminal non-coiled coil piece of CYK-4 (aa 1 to ~40) also contributes to this globular mass at the center of the molecule. Consistent with this assignment, a similar protrusion and increased size of the neck globular mass were observed also in a complex of Z601 with C120 (Z601/C120, <xref rid="pbio.1002121.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002121.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Movie</xref>. <xref rid="pbio.1002121.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002121.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Movie</xref> for other examples). Furthermore, this protrusion was hardly detectable in a complex with a chimera between the N-terminal 40 amino acids of CYK-4 and a shorter (~20 aa) coiled coil from a leucine-zipper transcription factor, GCN4 (C40G) (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002121.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Movie</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002121.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002121.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Movie</xref> for other examples) [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] although co-elution in size exclusion chromatography confirmed the stable complex formation between Z601 and C40G (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B Fig</xref>). This verifies our assignment that the protrusion that appears only when ZEN-4 is in a complex with C120 corresponds to the coiled coil of CYK-4. The lower visibility of the predicted ZEN-4 coiled coil in Z601 constructs than that of CYK-4 might indicate that it would be actually shorter (the region predicted with high probability is only as short as ~35 aa, <xref rid="pbio.1002121.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>, CC1) or partly embedded within the neck globular domain.</p>
<p>In the Z775mAG/C120 complex, the CYK-4 coiled coil showed direct contact neither with the ZEN-4 motor domains nor the ZEN-4 coiled coil (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>; see also <xref rid="pbio.1002121.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Movie</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002121.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Movie</xref>, and <xref rid="pbio.1002121.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Movie</xref>).

The linear arrangement of CYK-4 coiled coil, the globular mass made of the CYK-4 N-terminal piece and the ZEN-4 neck domain, and the ZEN-4 coiled coil form a molecular backbone in a dagger-like appearance. ZEN-4 motor domains tended to be positioned on the opposite sides of this molecular backbone, although occasionally they were observed on the same side (AFM image at 11.2 s in <xref rid="pbio.1002121.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002121.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002121.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Movie</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, to examine whether the molecular architecture of centralspindlin described above is conserved across species, we observed the human centralspindlin holocomplex purified from HeLa cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002121.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002121.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Movie</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002121.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Movie</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Human centralspindlin also had a long molecular backbone with a central globular mass, at which the two motor domains reside on the opposite sides. In addition, globular masses were observed at the both ends of the molecular backbone although the shapes and sizes are variable. This probably reflects the heterogeneity of this preparation due to the alternative splicing within the C-terminal tail of MKLP1 [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], post-translational modifications, interacting proteins, and partial degradations during the purification steps. In human holocomplex, rod-like structures were detected on both sides of the central globular mass (cyan) along the molecular axis (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). This is consistent with the fact that human MKLP1/KIF23 has a region of high propensity for a coiled coil (aa 535 to 660) about 2-fold longer than ZEN-4 [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p>

<p>In summary, HS-AFM revealed the unique, evolutionary conserved, molecular architecture of centralspindlin. A part of the neck domain of the MKLP1 subunit of centralspindlin folds into a globular domain, which provides the binding site for the N-terminal non-coiled coil region of the CYK4 subunit. Via this interface, the homodimers of CYK4 and MKLP1, both of which were dimerized as parallel coiled coils, assemble into a heterotetramer, forming a linear molecular backbone.</p>

<title>CYK4 Subunit Confers Antiparallel Preference to the Microtubule Bundling by Centralspindlin</title>
<p>To understand the implications of this molecular architecture of centralspindlin on its function, we then performed in vitro reconstitution experiments. Due to specific experimental design requirements for each assay as detailed below, we chose suitable dimeric ZEN-4 constructs with various C-terminal deletions. However, the common mode of CYK-4 binding to both Z775mAG and Z601 observed above independently of the C-terminal tail suggests that CYK-4 binding should influence the structure of ZEN-4 in an identical manner across the different assays.</p>
<p>Although it has been shown that the C120 can reconstitute the heterotetramer, as we confirmed at high resolution by AFM, it has not been directly tested whether this CYK-4 fragment is sufficient to reconstitute microtubule-bundling activities in a complex with ZEN-4, a critical role of centralspindlin in vivo. Previous studies demonstrated that centralspindlin oligomerizes into higher-order assemblies depending on a short motif (aa 586 to 601 in ZEN-4) within a region predicted to be a coiled coil with low propensity (CC2, <xref rid="pbio.1002121.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>) and that this clustering is required for continuous single particle motility and efficient microtubule bundling [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Without CYK-4, the minimal ZEN-4 motor construct that is able to form clusters, ZEN-4 1–601 tagged with mAG (Z601mAG, <xref rid="pbio.1002121.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>), was able to crosslink taxol-stabilized microtubules in vitro and organize them into aster-like structures (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref> i). Z601mAG strongly accumulated in the center of the aster-like structures. In contrast, the same ZEN-4 construct in a complex with C120 (Z601mAG/C120) formed microtubule bundles similar to those made by centralspindlin complexes containing longer forms of CYK-4 (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref> ii) [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. On these bundles, Z601mAG was distributed throughout the microtubule overlaps, as expected for a microtubule-bundling factor (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref> ii). These observations show that C120 in a complex with ZEN-4 is sufficient to reconstitute the microtubule-bundling activity of the full-length centralspindlin complex.</p>

Z601mAG and Z601mAG /C120 were perfused into the flow cell with non-biotinylated and brightly rhodamine-labeled microtubules with a Cy5 polarity mark at their plus-ends (MT2). The free MT2 could land on the immobilized MT1 and, in some cases, accumulate the ZEN-4 complexes. By observing the direction of ZEN-4 movement and plus end accumulation, the polarity of the immobilized microtubule could be determined.

<p>In dividing cells, centralspindlin strongly accumulates in the spindle midzone, where two sets of interpolar microtubules originating from the opposite spindle poles overlap with their plus-ends, interdigitating in an antiparallel manner. To examine the polarity of the microtubule bundles formed by centralspindlin, we set up an in vitro assay in which the polarity of two single microtubules in a bundle can be determined (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). In this system, first, biotinylated and dimly rhodamine-labeled microtubules (MT1) are immobilized on a coverslip via avidin. Following this, non-biotinylated and brightly rhodamine-labeled microtubules with a plus-end mark by Cy5 (MT2) are introduced to the chamber, in the presence of either dimeric Z601mAG, or heterotetrameric Z601mAG/C120, both of which can oligomerize into clusters [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Polarity of MT1 was determined by the plus-end-directed movement of Z601mAG or Z601mAG/C120 particles along them and by the accumulation of these motors at their plus-ends (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). Interestingly, ZEN-4 in complex with CYK-4 (Z601mAG/C120) preferentially formed antiparallel overlaps (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref> v and <xref rid="pbio.1002121.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>) while ZEN-4 alone (Z601mAG) typically formed parallel bundles (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref> i and <xref rid="pbio.1002121.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). Both types of the bundle were static, with no observable microtubule sliding for up to 10 min of observation although we cannot exclude the possibility that the sliding might occur at the very early phase of bundling, before observation began. Importantly, we observed that Z601mAG/C120 specifically accumulates on antiparallel microtubule pairs (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref> v and <xref rid="pbio.1002121.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). On parallel microtubule pairs, Z601mAG/C120 continued to move to the plus end and did not accumulate on the zone of overlap (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref> ii). Accumulation of Z601mAG/C120 on the antiparallel overlap is not just due to the polarity of the overlap but rather requires C120 for this specificity. This is clear, as less than half of the antiparallel overlaps made by Z601mAG alone showed such accumulation (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref> iii versus iv, <xref rid="pbio.1002121.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). Observing the behavior of Z601mAG/C120 at the overlaps on the level of a single molecule is difficult due to high density of fluorescent proteins. However, because many of these bleached during observation, at later time points it was possible to detect both static particles and those showing bidirectional movement (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref> v; blue box), indicating that the bundles made by centralspindlin are not totally static. Furthermore, we measured the velocity of particle movement along the microtubules. We found a large difference between Z601mAG and Z601mAG /C120, with velocities of 221 ± 4 nm/sec and 79 ± 3 nm/sec respectively (mean ± SE, <italic>n</italic> = 214 and 114) (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>). Together, these results indicate that the N-terminal piece of CYK-4 is sufficient to reconstitute a complex with ZEN-4 that has the ability to bundle microtubules in an antiparallel manner and to accumulate on the antiparallel overlaps, as observed in vivo. In addition, the CYK-4 modifies ZEN-4 motility on microtubules.</p>

<title>CYK4 Modifies the Motor Properties of MKLP1</title>
<p>How does CYK4 contribute to the antiparallel microtubule bundling? A simple possibility is that CYK4 provides an additional site for microtubule binding, allowing bridging between two microtubules by the centralspindlin complex. Alternatively, CYK4 may not directly interact with microtubules itself, but instead regulate how MKLP1 interacts with microtubules. To discriminate between these possibilities, we tested whether C120 has an ability to directly bind to microtubules independently of ZEN-4 using a microtubule sedimentation assay (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). Crucial for this type of assay is the solubility of the samples to be examined for binding to microtubules under the buffer and centrifugation conditions that should precipitate the majority of microtubules irrespective of their assembly state (e.g., dispersed, cross-linked, or bundled). C120 alone could not be used because, without ZEN-4, it forms insoluble aggregates. Instead, we evaluated the microtubule interaction of C120 by comparing the microtubule-binding activity of the complexes between C120 and soluble ZEN-4 variants with full or severely reduced microtubule-binding activity. To achieve maximal solubility and to minimize cross-linking and/or bundling of microtubules, which would obscure the interpretation, we used ZEN-4 constructs lacking the clustering domain [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. ZEN-4 has a highly positively charged tail at its N-terminus, which is required for efficient interaction with microtubules [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. As expected, co-sedimentation with microtubules in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable ATP-analog, AMP-PNP, was largely abolished by removing this N-terminal tail (ZEN-4 1–555 [Z555] versus ZEN-4 21–555 [Z555ΔN], <xref rid="pbio.1002121.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref> lanes 5 and 6 versus lanes 17 and 18). The complex of C120 with Z555 co-purified from bacteria (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2C Fig</xref>) was soluble (lanes 8 and 9) but co-sedimented with microtubules (lanes 11 and 12) in a similar manner to Z555 alone. In contrast, the complex lacking the ZEN-4 N-terminal tail (C120/Z555ΔN) did not co-sediment with microtubules, but remained in the supernatant (lanes 23 and 24). This indicates that the microtubule-binding activity of the CYK-4 and ZEN-4 complex largely depends on the interaction of ZEN-4 with microtubules and the interaction between CYK-4 and microtubules is not significant.</p>

Z555 and Z555/C120 sedimentation only occurs when bound to microtubules. In contrast, Z555ΔN failed to do so irrespective of the presence of C120, indicating that C120 itself does not bind directly to microtubules. (B) Scheme showing the surface gliding assay. The C-terminal mAG epitope on Z585mAG is immobilized on the coverslip via anti-mAG antibody. Plus-end directed motility of the motors results in gliding of microtubules with their minus-end in front.

<p>The above result suggests that it is unlikely that CYK-4 contributes to the microtubule bundling by binding microtubules. On the other hand, the velocity of the motility of Z601mAG particles was slower in the presence of C120 (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>). Thus, it is plausible that CYK-4 plays a role in modifying the interaction between ZEN-4 and microtubules. To investigate this, we examined whether CYK-4 influences the intrinsic properties of ZEN-4 as a molecular motor in two different ways.</p>
<p>First, we measured the motility of different ZEN-4 constructs using surface gliding assays, which, in contrast to the bundling assays, do not require clustering of ZEN-4. We immobilized a soluble and dimeric construct of ZEN-4 (Z585mAG, <xref rid="pbio.1002121.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>) on a glass surface using a C-terminal mAG tag (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). This exhibited microtubule movement at a velocity of 180 nm/s (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). Strikingly, when we used ZEN-4 co-purified with C120, we observed an even more dramatic reduction of the gliding velocity, to 30 nm/s (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>), than we saw in the motility of Z601mAG particles along immobilized microtubules (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>). This could be reproduced by incubation of ZEN-4 with C120 prior to the assay, under the condition in which C120 is kept soluble (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>, “C120”), showing that the decreased motility of the Z585mAG/C120 complex was not due to inactivation during the purification procedure. A point mutation (S15L) on the N-terminal piece of CYK-4, which greatly affects the affinity to ZEN-4 [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], largely abolished the effect of CYK-4 on the ZEN-4 motility (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>, “C120 S15L”), indicating the specific requirement of the interaction between CYK-4 and ZEN-4. In contrast, artificially dimerized N-terminal 40 aa of CYK-4 (C40G, <xref rid="pbio.1002121.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>) was able to decrease the motility of ZEN-4 (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>, “C40G”). These data indicate that the N-terminal 40 aa of CYK-4, if it is dimerized, is sufficient for modifying the motor activity of ZEN-4 and that the specific amino acid sequence in the CYK-4 coiled coil is not important.</p>
<p>Second, we measured the effect of CYK-4 on the microtubule-binding affinity of ZEN-4. Fluorescently labeled ZEN-4 (ZEN-4 1-585mAG, Z585mAG) alone or as a complex with C120 (Z585mAG/C120) was introduced into a chamber containing immobilized microtubules in the presence of AMP-PNP. This resulted in uniform binding all along the microtubule, and the fluorescence intensity was measured (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref>). By titrating in different ZEN-4 concentrations, the binding affinity between ZEN-4 and microtubules was determined (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5G</xref>). The microtubule-binding affinity of Z585mAG/C120 (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 41 ± 7 nM) was three times higher than that of dimeric Z585mAG alone (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 129 ± 43 nM). These data indicate that CYK-4-binding actively modifies the kinesin activity of ZEN-4 in the centralspindlin complex in a way suitable for microtubule bundling.</p>

<title>CYK4 Controls the Inter-Domain Configuration of the MKLP1 Motor Domains within Centralspindlin</title>
<p>To determine how CYK4 modulates the mode by which MKLP1 interacts with microtubules, we examined the effect of CYK-4 on the configuration of the motor domains in the heterotetrameric complex. In high-speed AFM, the detachment of CYK-4 from ZEN-4 was sometimes observed (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002121.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Movie</xref>). This provides us with an ideal opportunity to examine the difference between the inter-head configurations within a ZEN-4 dimer in the presence and absence of CYK-4. Before dissociation of C120 from Z775mAG, the head-to-head distance (i.e., the distance between the centers of mass of ZEN-4 motor domains [D<sub>H-H</sub>]) was 12 ± 3 nm (mean ± SD), whereas, after dissociation, the mean D<sub>H-H</sub> increased to 16 nm, with a larger standard deviation of 6 nm (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D and 6E</xref>; for additional movies and head-to-head distance measurements, <xref rid="pbio.1002121.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Movie</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002121.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4A–S4C Fig</xref>, respectively). In contrast, the heights of the ZEN-4 heads were constant (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). Similar effect of CYK-4 on the ZEN-4 head-to-head distance was observed in Z601 constructs. Both the mean distance and its standard deviation in the complexes with C120 and C40G (10 ± 2 and 11 ± 2 nm, respectively) were smaller than that in Z601 without CYK-4 (13 ± 4 nm). Other geometrical parameters were summarized in <xref rid="pbio.1002121.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4E Fig</xref>. These observations indicate that CYK-4 introduces a restriction in the configuration of the two motor domains of ZEN-4 through binding onto its neck domain.</p>

<p>The above observation by AFM was performed on the mica surface, which can potentially affect the CYK4-dependent dynamic configuration of MKLP1 motor domains in an unexpected artificial manner. To examine whether CYK-4 binding can also reorganize the structure of ZEN-4 in solution, we performed Fӧrster resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis by fluorescence anisotropy imaging microscopy (FAIM) (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. To probe the conformational change in the neck region of the dimeric ZEN-4, the motor domains were replaced with yellow fluorescent protein (Venus) (VenusZ434-555, <xref rid="pbio.1002121.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A and 1E</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The homo-FRET between the two Venus moieties is detected as the decrease of the fluorescence anisotropy (depolarization) (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>). To correct for fluorescence depolarization by the rotational diffusion of the whole molecule, which might also be affected by CYK-4 binding, the fluorescence anisotropy by excitation at 532 nm on the red edge of the absorption spectrum of Venus, which fails to cause homo-FRET, was also determined (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B and 7C</xref>). The FRET efficiency was calculated by comparing the fluorescence anisotropy by excitation at main band (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>) and at the red edge (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We observed a dramatic increase in the homo-FRET efficiency when the Venus-ZEN-4 neck dimer is in a heterotetrameric complex with C120 (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref>). Consistent with our observations that the specific sequence of the CYK-4 coiled coil is dispensable both for the binding to ZEN-4 and for the effects on the ZEN-4 motor activity (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>), C40G also increased the homo-FRET efficiency similarly to C120 (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref>). As homo-FRET reflects the intra-molecular geometry of the two Venus moieties, this indicates that C120 binding changes the relative positioning of the two Venus moieties in a dimer. This is consistent with a report by electron paramagnetic resonance [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and confirms that the effect of CYK-4 on the configuration of the ZEN-4 motor domains observed by HS-AFM also occurs in solution. Because the ZEN-4 construct used for this analysis did not contain the motor domain, we conclude that CYK-4 changes the structure of the neck domain of the ZEN-4 dimer.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we demonstrated that CYK4 binding to the neck of MKLP1 modulates how the twin motor domains in heterotetrameric centralspindlin complex interact with microtubules. Specifically, we observed that CYK4 binding promotes antiparallel bundling of microtubules by MKLP1 and accumulation of the complex into the antiparallel microtubule overlap. Importantly, this is associated with a change in the dynamic inter-domain configuration between the two motor domains within the MKLP1 dimer. These data are consistent with, and further extend, preceding work on the molecular basis of central spindle formation and demonstrate well the power and versatility of HS-AFM that allows us to directly visualize structural dynamics of protein molecules in solution at sub-molecular spatial and sub-second temporal resolution.</p>
<p>Previously, we proposed a model for progressive accumulation of centralspindlin to the spindle midzone based on the spindle bipolarity and the positive feedback loop of centralspindlin-clustering and microtubule bundling under temporal and spatial regulation by mitotic kinases [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Although this model did not assign centralspindlin a preference for a specific type of bundling polarity, the preferential affinity of ZEN-4 for the antiparallel microtubule overlap, augmented by CYK-4 (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>), would clearly be expected to contribute to the recruitment of centralspindlin to the spindle midzone, where antiparallel overlap of the interpolar microtubules exists even before the anaphase onset [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Furthermore, limiting accumulation on parallel microtubule bundles, such as kinetochore fibers, prevents mislocalization away from the central spindle. It will now be of great interest to discover how centralspindlin cooperates with PRC1, another microtubule-bundling factor crucial for the central spindle formation. PRC1 is homologous to yeast Ase1 and plant MAP65, which preferentially form antiparallel bundles [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p>
<p>In vivo experiments have shown that interaction between CYK-4 and ZEN-4 is critical for the formation of a robust central spindle [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This is consistent with our in vitro data showing that CYK-4 binding increases the affinity of ZEN-4 to microtubules and slows down ZEN-4 motility (Figs <xref rid="pbio.1002121.g004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002121.g005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Interestingly, we did not observe sliding of antiparallel microtubule bundles made by the CYK-4/ZEN-4 complex (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). This is in stark contrast with the sliding of antiparallel microtubule bundles by other mitotic kinesins in the kinesin-5 and -14 classes, which play important roles in formation of the metaphase bipolar spindle [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In the first cell division of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> embryos, the whole spindle is under mechanical tension produced by a dynein-dependent “cortical pulling force” that pulls spindle poles towards the cortex by hauling on the astral microtubules [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. This provides the major driving force for the anaphase B spindle elongation, with the central spindle working largely as a brake against this force [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The slower motility and stronger affinity of ZEN-4 when it is in a complex with CYK-4 might reflect an evolutionary adaptation of this class of kinesin superfamily molecules to its role as the mechanical bundler and, potentially, a brake, rather than a transporter or a microtubule sorter.</p>
<p>The flexible head-to-head coordination in the absence of CYK4 is consistent with the previous electron microscopic observation of dimeric ZEN-4 bound to microtubules [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], in which two motor domains in a single dimer bound to a microtubule in more variable positioning than observed in an Eg5 kinesin-5 dimer. Considering the 2-fold rotational symmetry that the parallel coiled coils of both CYK4 and MKLP1 should take, it is likely that CYK4 binding would fix the MKLP1 neck globular masses into the same symmetry around the linear molecular axis defined by their head-to-head association. This would result in a tendency that the two MKLP1 motor domains are positioned in the same 2-fold rotational symmetry, although there might still remain some level of flexibility due to the possible unstructured linker between the catalytic core and the neck globular domain. We speculate that the configuration of the two motor domains in 2-fold symmetry reinforced by CYK4 binding would prevent simultaneous binding of the two motor domains to the same single microtubule (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A</xref>). This would tend to facilitate antiparallel microtubule bundling, especially during the initial phase of bundling when the clustering is not yet extensive. The structural details of how the restriction in the configurations of the two motor domains in the MKLP1 dimer by CYK4 neck binding results in enhanced affinity and decreased motility remain unclear. Further experiments, including atomic-level structures of the CYK4-MKLP1 complex as well as structures of the motor complex dynamically interacting with its track [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], will be necessary to understand the mechanistic details of how the neck conformational change produced by CYK4 controls the MKLP1–microtubule interaction.</p>

<title>Model of microtubule bundling by ZEN-4-CYK-4 complex and its implications to other non-canonical N-kinesins.</title>
<p>(A) An illustration depicting a model on how the CYK4 binding to the MKLP1/ZEN-4 neck modulates the interaction between MKLP1 and microtubules. In the absence of CYK4, both the MKLP1 motor domains in a dimer, which in turn forms a higher-order cluster (for simplicity, only two dimers are illustrated), can interact with a single microtubule using its long and flexible neck (left). CYK4 binding to the neck domain of MKLP1 restricts the relative configuration of the two motor heads into a 2-fold symmetry defined by the two parallel coiled coils. This makes it difficult for two heads in an MKLP1 dimer to simultaneously bind to the same microtubule, leaving one head in an optimal position to interact with a second microtubule in an antiparallel orientation (right). (B) A bioinformatic analysis identifies additional N-kinesins with a non-canonical neck sequence. Propensities of coiled coil formation by COILS [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] and Paircoil2 [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] and of disordered structures by DISOPRED [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] are plotted, along with the kinesin catalytic core defined by multiple sequence alignment and the positions of proline residues. Binding sites to known partners are also shown. In addition to the kinesin-6 family members, other N-kinesins also have a non-canonical, long non-coiled coil neck sequence, which in some cases has been shown to be a partner-binding site.</p>

<p>While most of the N-kinesins are likely to have a stereotypical neck structure that is similar to the short neck-linker followed by the neck coiled coil found in kinesin-1, some of them, in addition to the MKLP1 orthologs, do not follow this pattern and instead contain a long non-coiled coil sequence in their neck (<xref rid="pbio.1002121.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8B</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002121.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). Interestingly, the long neck sequences of these non-canonical N-kinesins seem to serve as a binding site for their binding partners. MKLP2/KIF20A, which is crucial to recruit chromosomal passenger complex to the spindle midzone during cytokinesis, is phosphorylated and bound by Polo-like kinase 1 in this region [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. VAB-8 kinesin, which plays a role in cell migration and axonal pathfinding in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> development, interacts with UNC-51 kinase through its long non-coiled coil neck region [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. <italic>Drosophila</italic> Costal2 and mammalian KIF7 play crucial roles in the Hedgehog signaling pathway through interaction with transcription factors, Cubitus interruptus (Ci) and Gli proteins, respectively, which bind to the neck region of these kinesins [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Revealing whether and how the neck-binding proteins modulate the motor activity of these kinesins should provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of these signaling pathways as well as the general mechanochemical principle of molecular motors.</p>

A low-pass filter and a flattening filter were applied to remove spike noise and to make the XY plane flat. The XY coordinate of the center of mass of a ZEN-4 motor domain was semi-automatically determined by the following steps. First, a point within the domain likely to be highest was manually specified. Second, the actual peak position was automatically determined within the area of 5×5 pixels around the manually specified point. Third, the center of mass was calculated as the weighted mean of the XY coordinates within the 5×5 pixel area around the actual peak, using their heights as weights.</p>

Images were processed with ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/" xlink:type="simple">http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>) and data analyzed by R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.r-project.org</ext-link>).</p>
<p>For microtubule gliding assays, ZEN-4-mAG was immobilized in anti-mAG antibody coated flow cells. Motility of rhodamine-labeled microtubules [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] was observed in motility solution (10 mM potassium PIPES pH 6.9, 25 mM KCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mg/ml casein, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM ATP, 20 μM taxol, 4 mM DTT, 1 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 0.1 mg/ml catalase, and 10 mM glucose) by epifluorescence with Semrock Cy3-4040B filter set.</p>
<p>For ZEN-4 binding experiments, rhodamine-labeled microtubules were immobilized on coverslips by an anti-tubulin antibody (Sigma Aldrich, #T4026). ZEN-4-mAG complexes were perfused into the chamber in the above motility solution, with AMP-PNP substituted for ATP, and observed by total internal reflection fluorescence with a 488 nm laser and Chroma 41001 filter set. Quantification of ZEN-4 binding was achieved with ImageJ by measuring the fluorescence intensity along 2 μm of the microtubule, and subtracting the same measurement from an adjacent microtubule-free region (10–15 regions analyzed for each condition).</p>
<p>To observe microtubule bundling in solution, motor complexes were mixed with microtubules in motility solution and perfused into flow cells for observation. To observe ZEN-4 behavior on microtubule overlaps with defined polarities, biotinylated and dimly rhodamine-labeled microtubules (MT1) was first immobilized into a flow cell sequentially coated with biotin-BSA and Neutravidin (Pierce). Motility solution containing motor complexes and polarity labeled bright-rhodamine labeled microtubules (MT2) [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] was then perfused into the flow cell. Microtubule overlaps were observed by epifluorescence. Z601mAG movement and accumulation were observed by TIRF microscopy.</p>

<p>Aliquots of VenusZ435-555 preparations complexed with or without CYK-4 fragments were put on a glass coverslip containing a press-to-seal (Life Technologies Ltd., Paisley, United Kingdom) silicone isolator and covered with another glass coverslip to avoid evaporation during measurements. Repeated widefield epifluorescence anisotropy images of each solution were obtained using a modified Nikon eclipse TE 300 inverted total internal reflection (TIRF) microscope (Nikon Ltd. UK, Kingston upon Thames, United Kingdom), with a 491 nm laser (Cobolt Calypso, 100 mW) for main band illumination and a 532 nm (30 mW) laser combined with an excitation filter (FL05532-1-1, Semrock, Rochester, NY, United States) for red edge illumination. Polarization-resolved fluorescence images were obtained with a 1.47 NA TIRF objective, a Semrock Di02-R532, a BP 545–580 nm emission filter, and a polarization beam splitter which separates the polarization components onto distinct areas of an EM-CCD camera (Andor iXon DV885, Belfast, United Kingdom). For each measurement, the EM-CCD was set to −50°C, 50 ms exposure time, constant EM gain, and to average 100 frames to minimize noise. The fluorescence anisotropy was evaluated by processing the raw image data in MATLAB (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, United States): the polarization images were registered; dark current background was subtracted; the reference fluorescence measurement of the buffer solution was subtracted (affecting the final anisotropy values by less than 0.001), and the anisotropy of the samples was determined using <xref rid="pbio.1002121.e001" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 1</xref>.

G accounts for the ratio of the intensity response of the two detector channels, determined using a dilute aqueous dye solution (1 mM Oregon Green in ddH2O, Life Technologies) with a known fluorescence anisotropy of zero. The anisotropy <italic>r</italic> of each sample was evaluated on a pixelwise basis from the measured intensities (<italic>I</italic>) of fluorescence light with polarization parallel (<italic>I</italic><sub>||</sub>) and perpendicular (<italic>I</italic><sub>⊥</sub>) to the illumination polarization. The mean value of this anisotropy over the (uniform) image of the dye solution provides a single measurement of the sample fluorescence anisotropy; this measurement was repeated three times for each sample to determine instrument precision, and two such sets were taken for each solution to determine the uncertainty of fluorescence anisotropy due to solution variation. As a whole, the fluorescence anisotropy was determined with an instrument error better than 0.001 and with a total measurement uncertainty for repeated samples better than 0.004.</p>
<p>The average FRET efficiency of the Venus fluorescent protein in each solution was determined using the “red edge and main band” method [<xref rid="pbio.1002121.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], which can separate the effect of FRET from any effect of rotational diffusion on measured fluorescence anisotropy. The FRET efficiency was calculated by 1—<italic>r/r0</italic>, where <italic>r</italic> is the main band anisotropy and <italic>r0</italic> is the red edge anisotropy. ANOVA was performed by R with correction for multiple comparisons by Tukey’s method.</p>
