Nitrogen fixation in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">R. etli</named-content> occurs in the last of three developmental stages. The first developmental stage is related to the infection process of plant roots by <italic>Rhizobium</italic>. This begins when the plant excretes flavonoids which signal nodule formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b002">2</xref>]. The second stage is characterized by bacterial growth inside the plant, and the construction of a compartmentalized globular structure, called a nodule. This specialized structure protects nitrogenase, a key enzyme in nitrogen fixation, against irreversible oxidative damage by oxygen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b005">5</xref>]. Finally, the last stage involves differentiation of the bacteria into a bacteroid able to reduce atmospheric nitrogen inside the nodule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b008">8</xref>]. The computational analysis of this last stage is the main focus of this work.</p><p>Systemic understanding of nitrogen fixation in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">R. etli</named-content> requires the construction of a model able to integrate genomic and high-throughput data in a hierarchical and coherent fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b009">9</xref>]. Integrative models of this sort constitute a powerful and elegant strategy to study the mechanism of cell behavior. In particular, constraint-based models constitute such an approach, with a capacity to predict organism phenotypes operating at steady state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b013">13</xref>].

To show the utility of this analysis, the consistency between model predictions with experimental observations in some metabolic pathways is evaluated. Then we analyze the effects that some gene deletions have on symbiotic nitrogen fixation and compare them with available experimental observations. Experimental evidence on how these gene deletions affect nitrogen fixation activity are available for most cases investigated computationally, and it provides important information to validate our in silico modeling.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Metabolic Network in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Rhizobium etli</named-content></title><p>The metabolic reconstruction was generated from the KEGG annotated genome sequence for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">R. etli</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b007">7</xref>], journal publications, automated reconstruction databases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b015">15</xref>], and information found in biochemical textbooks on nitrogen fixation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b001">1</xref>].

For our analysis, we assume that symbiotic nitrogen fixation between the plant and bacterium has reached the steady state. To simulate nitrogen fixation during symbiosis, we have constructed an objective function (OF) representing a set of chemical compounds whose production in the bacteroid is essential to make this symbiotic process efficient. Instead of incorporating biomass components (phospholipids, proteins, DNA, RNA) for the organism into the OF, as has been done for other organisms such as <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Escherichia coli</named-content>, only compounds which are known or thought to be produced during symbiotic nitrogen fixation are included. The main reason for this is that the bacteroid does not grow during the stage where nitrogen fixation occurs, which is the life stage of interest in this study.</p><p>After reviewing the available literature, we can postulate an OF for use in FBA, which represents symbiotic nitrogen fixation in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">R. etli</named-content>. This OF is based on the following physiological information.</p><p>1) Plant–bacteroid exchange of some amino acids during nitrogen fixation has been suggested to be a general mechanism in <italic>Rhizobia</italic>. Aspartate and alanine play a central role in the development of nodules and in efficient nitrogen fixation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b006">6</xref>]. According to a recent hypothesis, aspartate and alanine are provided to the plant from the bacteroid, while glutamate is supplied by the plant to the bacteroid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b016">16</xref>]. In this context, we postulate that symbiotic nitrogen fixation is closely related to the efficient supply of alanine and aspartate from the bacteroid to the plant. L-lysine has been reported in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Bradyrhizobium japonicum</named-content> bacteroids, a related organism to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">R. etli</named-content>, and this amino acid was also included in the OF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b017">17</xref>].</p><p>2) Nitrogen fixation is energetically costly requiring 16 ATP molecules to reduce a di-nitrogen molecule into two molecules of ammonium, which are then exported to the plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b005">5</xref>]. The transport of ammonium from the bacteroid to the plant is crucial for establishing symbiosis with the plant.</p><p>3) During nitrogen fixation, some <italic>Rhizobia</italic> accumulate poly-ß-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and glycogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b019">19</xref>]. These compounds serve as storage for carbon that can be used when others are not present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b021">21</xref>] . The presence of PHB has been verified in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">R. etli</named-content> in the free-living and bacteroid states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b022">22</xref>]. Even though the synthesis of PHB requires energy, PHB production is important because it reduces the levels of NAD(P)H which can repress the activity of some enzymes in the citric acid (TCA) cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b021">21</xref>]. Nodules in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">R. etli</named-content> are characterized as determinate nodules, and there is experimental evidence that glycogen and PHB molecules are produced during nitrogen fixation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b005">5</xref>]. Thus, we consider the production of PHB and glycogen to be important components of the symbiotic nitrogen fixation OF.</p><p>The identified essential components produced by the bacteroid and exchanged with plant during nitrogen fixation are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030192-g001">Figure 1</xref>. The OF used to represent symbiotic nitrogen fixation is a linear combination of all the components noted above.

				</p><p>Thus, by maximizing this OF we suggest that during nitrogen fixation steady-state fluxes maximize the equal molar production of these compounds. In the rest of this work we will refer to the OF as the function that maximizes symbiotic nitrogen fixation. FBA consists of finding a flux distribution subject to steady-state mass balance and thermodynamic constraints, such that a linear OF is maximized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b014">14</xref>]. FBA was performed (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section), and the resulting flux distribution was compared with the known physiology of the organism. To verify the robustness of our results, we also ran the analysis using 1,000 different randomly weighted OFs (with weights selected from a uniform distribution) that did not assume equimolar contributions of the components shown in Equation 1 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section). We observed that the identified inactive metabolic pathways were independent of the stoichiometric coefficients of the OF (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030192-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). The exchange reactions and the corresponding constraints used in simulations can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030192-sd002">Dataset S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030192-st002">Table S2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Utilization of Central Metabolism</title><p><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">R. etli</named-content>, like most other <italic>Rhizobia</italic>, fixes nitrogen in a microaerobic environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b024">24</xref>].

The simulations suggest that under microaerobic conditions, symbiotic nitrogen fixation activity is possible and some patterns for using the central metabolic pathways can be observed. During nitrogen fixation, dicarboxylates (succinate) provided by plant are metabolized via the TCA cycle. Efficient nitrogen fixation requires a high degree of coordination between the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b005">5</xref>].</p><p>Bacterial respiration is important for nitrogen fixation for two reasons: it (1) reduces oxidative damage to nitrogenase by consuming oxygen, and (2) simultaneously generates ATP molecules needed for nitrogen fixation. <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">R. etli</named-content> is characterized by a branched respiratory chain which involves at least four terminal cytochrome oxidases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b027">27</xref>] and whose activity is regulated by the oxygen concentration in the environment. Nonzero fluxes through oxidative phosphorylation were observed in the simulation results, indicating oxidative phosphorylation is needed to maximize symbiotic nitrogen fixation. In fact, removal of all cytochrome oxidase reactions results in a complete loss of symbiotic nitrogen fixation. This result is in agreement with the reported essentiality of respiration for nitrogen fixation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b024">24</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030192-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p><fig id="pcbi-0030192-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030192.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Experimental Validation with In Silico Gene Deletions</title><p>The effects that mutations have on symbiotic nitrogen fixation was evaluated using linear (FBA) and quadratic (MOMA) programming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b035">35</xref>].

The model predicts that citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase are not used, which agrees with the enzymes suggested by experimental results to be inactive under microaerobic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b023">23</xref>]. This result is supported by flux variability analysis across alternate optimal solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b029">29</xref>], and it was insensitive to changes in the weightings in the OF coefficients of metabolites in Equation 1. The flux through these enzymes was always zero in all optimal solutions, independent of the coefficients defined in the OF.</p><p>The model also predicts that there is no flux through the Entner-Doudoroff and pentose phosphate pathways under microaerobic conditions. As above, no flux through Entner-Doudoroff and pentose phosphate pathways was observed across all optimal solutions for 1,000 randomly weighted OF. Proteomic analysis of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. japonicum</named-content> bacteroid did not detect the presence of enzymes involved in the Entner-Doudoroff pathway in agreement with the model predictions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b020">20</xref>]. However, the proteome data shows the presence of several of the pentose phosphate pathway enzymes, which contradicts the in silico predictions. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the use of this pathway could be strain-dependent. Thus, experimental measurements in <italic>R. etli</italic> bacteroids are needed to support or refute this computational result.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Ammonium Assimilation Activity</title><p>It has been shown experimentally that the glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase pathway (GS-GOGAT) constitutes the central mechanism of ammonium assimilation in free-living <italic>Rhizobia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b032">32</xref>]. FBA predicts that there is no activity in the ammonium assimilation pathway during symbiosis (a non–free-living state), which agrees with recent reported measurements where ammonium assimilation was not observed during nitrogen fixation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b032">32</xref>]. As before, flux variability analysis and random selection of the OF coefficients showed the inactivity of this metabolic pathway. The ammonium assimilatory pathways in the bacteroid are not active since most of the ammonium produced is transported to the plant. In fact, there is experimental evidence that an increase in ammonium assimilation negatively affects the nodulation process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b032">32</xref>]. It also suggests that the inactivity of ammonium assimilation establishes optimal conditions for symbiotic nitrogen fixation, where complete transport of ammonium to the plant favors symbiotic nitrogen fixation.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Myo-Inositol Utilization</title><p>Myo-inositol is an abundant compound in nodules and bacteroids, and it has an important influence on the efficiency of nitrogen fixation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b033">33</xref>]. Although its origin is not well-understood, it constitutes an essential precursor for the synthesis of rhizopines. Rhizopines may function as osmotic protectants and in some <italic>Rhizobium</italic> strains confer a competitive advantage at early stages of nodulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b034">34</xref>]. The metabolic pathway of myo-inositol catabolism has been included in the metabolic reconstruction, and simulations with high uptake rates of myo-inositol suggest that it can be used as an energy source for nitrogen fixation. In silico analysis suggests that the activity of the myo-inositol dehydrogenase enzyme, encoded by <italic>idhA</italic>, increases symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Conversely, elimination of myo-inositol dehydrogenase enzyme from the network decreases the predicted nitrogen fixation activity. These model results have been observed experimentally in an <italic>idhA</italic> mutant in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Sinorhizobium fredii</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b033">33</xref>]. The results obtained from simulations support the idea that myo-inositol catabolism plays an important role during nitrogen fixation, not only at early stages of nodulation but during nitrogen fixation as well. From a physiological point of view, there are some other possible explanations for reduced nitrogen fixation when the myo-inositol dehydrogenase enzyme is inactive. It may be a consequence of toxic levels of myo-inositol or a consequence of insufficient concentrations of myo-inositol for growth and maturation of the bacteroid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b033">33</xref>]. Experimental data suggest that the essentiality of <italic>idhA</italic> is strain-dependent, and in this reconstruction we have included this metabolic pathway in agreement with the KEGG database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b015">15</xref>]. From our in silico analysis, we observe that a deletion of myo-inositol dehydrogenase enzyme decreases nitrogen fixation activity, although it is not essential for symbiotic nitrogen fixation in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">R. etli</named-content>.

In silico analysis was conducted for deletions in PHB synthase, glycogen synthase, arginine deiminase, myo-inositol dehydrogenase, and pyruvate carboxylase. The first three enzymes are involved in PHB and glycogen synthesis and in arginine degradation, respectively. We have selected these enzymes because experimental results are available for <italic>Rhizobium</italic> on how these gene deletions affect symbiotic nitrogen fixation with respect to the wild-type strain.</p><p>To simulate gene deletions, the fluxes through reactions associated with the corresponding enzyme are constrained to zero, and the OF for FBA is constructed as before, excluding PHB or glycogen for the PHB and glycogen synthase deletion simulations, respectively (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030192-sd002">Dataset S2</xref>). Gene deletion studies for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> have shown that the method of minimization of metabolic adjustment (MOMA) makes better mutant predictions than FBA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b035">35</xref>]. Unlike FBA, MOMA identifies the flux distribution for the mutant strain that is closest to the wild-type flux distribution (measured as the Euclidean distance) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b035">35</xref>]. Predicted changes in fluxes through some key reactions in the mutant strains versus the wild-type are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030192-g003">Figure 3</xref>, where mutant predictions were done using both FBA and MOMA. Qualitatively, FBA and MOMA made similar predictions for most mutants with respect to the wild-type symbiotic nitrogen fixation flux.</p><p>For the double gene deletion (PHB and glycogen synthase), FBA and MOMA predict different results. FBA predicts an increase in symbiotic nitrogen fixation, while MOMA predicts a decrease in symbiotic nitrogen fixation; unfortunately, no experimental results are available for the double deletion mutant. For this case, we observed slight variations in exchange fluxes when using the two analysis methods. There was also a set of biochemical reactions that have no flux in the FBA solution for the double mutant but are used in the MOMA solution: aconitase (ACONT), 2 oxoglutare dehydrogenase (AKGDH), citrate synthase (CS), cystathionine b-lyase (CYSTL), cystathionine beta-synthase (CYSTS), 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-phosphogluconate aldolase (EDA), 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase (EDD), and fructose bisphosphate aldolase (FBA). Conversely, we identified three reactions, methylmalonate (MMSAD3), inositol dehydrogenase (INS2D), and inositol catabolic reaction (INSCR), whose fluxes were active in FBA, but inactive in the MOMA solution. The complete flux distributions for the double mutant predictions are included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030192-sd006">Dataset S6</xref>.</p><p>Simulations for deletions of PHB synthase predict that symbiotic nitrogen fixation increases, in agreement with the experimental observations in <italic>R</italic>. <italic>etli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b022">22</xref>]. Experimentally, deleting PHB synthase increases NADH levels and consequently reduces the NAD+ / NADH ratio. A possible physiological explanation for the increase in nitrogen fixation rate could be that the increase of reductive power (lower NAD/NADH ratio) can be channeled to nitrogen fixation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b022">22</xref>]. A similar effect on symbiotic nitrogen fixation is predicted for the glycogen synthase deletion, which also agrees with the observed physiological response reported for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Rhizobium tropici</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b036">36</xref>]. FBA suggests that the same effect would occur for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">R. etli</named-content>. The simulations predict that the flux through PHB synthase increases in the glycogen synthase mutant, and, similarly, the flux through glycogen synthase increases in the PHB synthase mutant. These results are in agreement with experimental reports suggesting that the quantities of both polymers are relatively flexible such that inhibition of one results in an accumulation of the other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b022">22</xref>], a property that is qualitatively observed in our in silico modeling.</p><p>It is unclear whether arginine is supplied to the bacteroid by the plant, and as a result the metabolic network reconstruction lacks an arginine transport reaction and ornithine degradation reactions. Recent evidence has found that the arginine deiminase pathway is active in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">R. etli</named-content> bacteroids which convert arginine into ornithine while generating ATP and CO<sub>2</sub>. By allowing the ornithine carbamoyl transferase reaction to be reversible and including an arginine–ornithine antiporter in the network, the symbiotic nitrogen fixation flux increased by more than 40% compared with the condition where arginine is not metabolized by the bacteroid (using <italic>iOR363</italic>). Deletion simulations removing arginine deiminase from this modified network predict a decrease in symbiotic nitrogen fixation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030192-g003">Figure 3</xref>), which is in agreement with experimental mutations of the <italic>arcA</italic> gene, which encodes the arginine deiminase enzyme in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">R. etli</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b037">37</xref>].</p><p>Pyruvate carboxylase is not used in the wild-type solution identified using FBA, so mutant predictions for pyruvate carboxylase are identical to the wild-type predictions.

A total of 1,000 different random OF were subsequently used individually in the gene deletion analysis. The qualitative effect of the gene deletions on symbiotic nitrogen fixation was independent of the OFs used; for example, in all 1,000 cases the deletion of PHB synthase increased symbiotic nitrogen fixation. However, quantitative prediction of gene deletion effects was dependent on the chosen OF coefficients. To improve quantitative model predictions, a better approximation of the physiological levels of the OF components is needed.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Phenotypic Phase Plane Analysis</title><p>Phenotypic phase plane (PhPP) analysis is a useful method to characterize the steady-state solution space projected in two dimensions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b042">42</xref>].

The shadow prices give us information on how the OF would change if the metabolites were additionally supplied to the network. These shadow prices can be used to classify the phenotypic phase plane into regions where the availability of different metabolites limits symbiotic nitrogen fixation.</p><p>The metabolic network for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">R. etli</named-content> was analyzed with respect to two parameters, succinate and oxygen uptake rates. The low oxygen uptake rate inside the nodules is such that it creates a microaerobic environment optimal for nitrogen fixation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b044">44</xref>]. Constraining our analysis to low uptake rates of oxygen (1 mmol/gDW/hr ), we found three regions in the PhPP, each one characterized by a qualitatively different optimal use of metabolic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b041">41</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030192-g004">Figure 4</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030192-g004">Figure 4</xref>, it is possible to identify a finite number of regions, each one characterized by the effect that oxygen and succinate uptake rates have on the OF. Region I is characterized by a single limiting substrate, succinate, which establishes an independent relationship between the OF and the oxygen uptake rate for a fixed succinate uptake rate. Region II has dual substrate limitations. In this region an increase in the uptake rate of either succinate or oxygen will increase symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Finally, in region III, an increase in succinate uptake rate produces a decrease in the symbiotic nitrogen fixation, while an increase in oxygen uptake rate increases the OF in region III. Region III is defined as a futile region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b041">41</xref>]. The line of optimality represents the optimal relation between the substrate uptake rates and the OF. In this case, it lies on the boundary between regions I and II.

At succinate uptake rates higher than this value, an inhibitory effect on symbiotic nitrogen fixation is observed.

Even with a lack of detailed experimental information, like kinetics constants and flux limitations for most reactions, we have been able to show that constraint-based methods can describe the capabilities of the metabolic network consistent with available experimental information. The construction of an OF that mimics symbiotic nitrogen fixation and qualitatively agrees with bacteroid physiology constitutes a substantial contribution in this work. Our OF was sufficient to obtain some of the main qualitative physiological characteristics for <italic>R. etli</italic> during nitrogen fixation. Thus, our model consistently reproduces, in agreement with the literature, the utilization of pathways like oxidative phosphorylation, gluconeogenesis, and PHB biosynthesis during nitrogen fixation. Additionally, the analyzed gene deletion set was in qualitative agreement with the response of the experimentally observed symbiotic nitrogen fixation activity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030192-g003">Figure 3</xref>). These particular gene deletions were selected because their effects on nitrogen fixation activity have been measured experimentally, allowing us to evaluate our computational results. This reconstruction can be used to suggest gene deletions that could enhance symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Here we show one example where a double gene deletion in PHB synthase and glycogen synthase could potentially increase symbiotic nitrogen fixation.</p><p>The advantages of this in silico framework have been shown in other organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b045">45</xref>], and we expect that for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">R. etli</named-content> such computational analysis will be useful to design and improve nitrogen fixation in plant development and agriculture. This last point constitutes a valuable scientific objective which requires integration of experimental data to improve and update the metabolic reconstruction. For instance, aspartate aminotransferase in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. japonicus</named-content> is essential, and its deletion is detrimental to nitrogen fixation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b017">17</xref>], while a deletion of glutamine synthetase increases nitrogen fixation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b017">17</xref>].

Although the production of the complete spectrum of amino acids has not been well-characterized in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">R. etli</named-content> during nitrogen fixation, we have predicted their production with the model, and compared them with the amino acids experimentally observed in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. japonicum</named-content> bacteroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030192-b017">17</xref>].
