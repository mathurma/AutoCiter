        <p>In protein folding and secretion disorders, activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling (ERSS) protects cells, alleviating stress that would otherwise trigger apoptosis. Whether the stress-surviving cells resume normal function is not known. We studied the in vivo impact of ER stress in terminally differentiating hypertrophic chondrocytes (HCs) during endochondral bone formation. In transgenic mice expressing mutant collagen X as a consequence of a 13-base pair deletion in <italic>Col10a1 (13del),</italic> misfolded α1(X) chains accumulate in HCs and elicit ERSS. Histological and gene expression analyses showed that these chondrocytes survived ER stress, but terminal differentiation is interrupted, and endochondral bone formation is delayed, producing a chondrodysplasia phenotype. This altered differentiation involves cell-cycle re-entry, the re-expression of genes characteristic of a prehypertrophic-like state, and is cell-autonomous. Concomitantly, expression of <italic>Col10a1</italic> and <italic>13del</italic> mRNAs are reduced, and ER stress is alleviated. ERSS, abnormal chondrocyte differentiation, and altered growth plate architecture also occur in mice expressing mutant collagen II and aggrecan. Alteration of the differentiation program in chondrocytes expressing unfolded or misfolded proteins may be part of an adaptive response that facilitates survival and recovery from the ensuing ER stress. However, the altered differentiation disrupts the highly coordinated events of endochondral ossification culminating in chondrodysplasia.</p>

          <p>The assembly and folding of secreted proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is exquisitely regulated by a complex mechanism that maintains an equilibrium between folded and unfolded proteins. Perturbation of this homeostasis induces ER stress, which, if not alleviated through ER stress signaling (ERSS), ultimately triggers cell death. Normal bone growth occurs through a highly coordinated differentiation program that yields specialized cartilage cells (chondrocytes); when this program is disrupted, chondrodysplasia, or malformed skeletons, can result. Chondrodysplasias caused by mutations that affect protein assembly and secretion are characterized by a disorganization of bony growth plates and distension of the ER. We tested whether these chondrodysplasia characteristics were linked to ERSS. By investigating the impact of ER stress on the cell fate of hypertrophic chondrocytes (HCs) in transgenic mice expressing mutations in collagen that prevent proper folding, we revealed a novel adaptive mechanism that helps alleviate the unfolded protein load. Instead of undergoing apoptosis, the HCs undergoing ER stress adapt, re-enter the cell cycle, and revert to a less-mature state in which expression of the mutant collagen is reduced. Our findings have broad implications for adaptive mechanisms to ER stress in vivo and for the pathophysiology underlying chondrodysplasias caused by mutations that impact on protein assembly and secretion.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Development and growth require the ability to detect, respond to, and survive stresses that compromise the normal state. Accumulation of misfolded or unfolded mutant proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) induces ER stress and may seriously affect the viability of cells. To cope with ER stress, ER-resident sensors detect misfolded or unfolded proteins and elicit the ER stress signaling (ERSS), which includes the induction of the highly conserved “unfolded protein response” (UPR). ERSS may lead to cytoprotection or death, depending on the nature of the stress and the cellular context.</p>
      <p>ERSS involves the activation of at least three independent ER stress sensors: inositol-requiring 1 (IRE1), PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), and membrane-tethered activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b001">1</xref>]. Their activation represses protein synthesis via phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α and activates signaling pathways that up-regulate the expression of ER-resident molecular chaperones and translation regulators. Activation of IRE1, PERK, and ATF6 depends on their dissociation from the molecular chaperone, binding Ig protein (BiP), a master regulator of ERSS. BiP ensures high-fidelity protein folding and prevents the accumulation of unfolded or aggregated proteins. Upon stress, unfolded proteins bind BiP and sequester it from interaction with IRE1, PERK, and ATF6. The released ATF6 and IRE1 activate the transcription factor XBP1 via production of its spliced form, XBP1<sup>s</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b003">3</xref>]. In an auto-regulatory loop, BiP activity increases further, since BiP up-regulation is partially dependent on XBP1<sup>s</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b004">4</xref>]. Induction of ERSS means that the amount of new protein translocated into the ER lumen is reduced, degradation of ER-localized proteins increases, and protein-folding capacity is enhanced.</p>
      <p>ERSS is triggered in a range of pathogenic conditions, e.g., nutrient deprivation, viral infection, and expression of mutant secretory or membrane-bound proteins, that saturate the folding machinery, leading to overload of the ER (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b001">1</xref>]). It has been suggested that physiological ER load and ERSS components regulate cellular differentiation and developmental decisions: e.g., terminal plasma cell differentiation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b005">5</xref>]) and bone and cartilage development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b006">6</xref>]. ER stress has been implicated in many diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders (Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b007">7</xref>] and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b008">8</xref>]), osteogenesis imperfecta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b009">9</xref>], and leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b010">10</xref>].</p>
      <p>Despite the detailed description of the molecular pathways in ERSS, many questions remain regarding its impact in vivo. If ER stress is not alleviated, an apoptotic program is initiated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b011">11</xref>], but how cells alleviate ER stress in vivo is not well understood. We addressed these questions by investigating the in vivo impact of ER stress on a well-defined and clinically important developmental pathway, the terminal differentiation of chondrocytes during endochondral bone formation.</p>
      <p>This depends on a highly coordinated program of differentiation, proliferation, maturation by permanent withdrawal from the cell cycle, hypertrophy, and terminal differentiation of chondrocytes within the mammalian growth plate. A snapshot of this differentiation program is captured in histological sections taken through the developing growth plate in which the differentiation stages are reflected by morphologically distinct subpopulations of chondrocytes organized in a spatial and columnar pattern and in defined relative proportions (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b013">13</xref>]). Recognizable subpopulations of chondrocytes are round resting/reserve cells; flattened proliferating cells organized into columns; larger, non-dividing (mature) prehypertrophic cells (preHCs), and the even larger terminally differentiated hypertrophic chondrocytes (HCs), which undergo apoptosis as the cartilage matrix mineralizes and is being replaced with bone. This program is regulated by a complex network of molecules such as Indian hedgehog (IHH), parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), bone morphogenetic proteins, fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), their respective receptors, and interaction between the cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b013">13</xref>].</p>
      <p>Perturbation of this differentiation program results in a malformed skeleton (chondrodysplasia). Distension of the ER is a hallmark of cells undergoing ER stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b015">15</xref>]. Disorganization of growth plate chondrocytes and distended ER are characteristics of several chondrodysplasias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b018">18</xref>], many of which are caused by mutations in genes encoding ECM proteins, such as collagens II, IX, XI, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), and aggrecan (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b019">19</xref>]) and that result in the synthesis of abnormal proteins. Cultured pseudochondroplastic chondrocytes or cells transfected with mutant COMP retain ECM proteins and chaperones intracellularly and have an increased capacity for apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b020">20</xref>]. Collagen X is an ECM protein synthesized specifically by HCs. Mutations in the human <italic>COL10A1</italic> gene interfere with collagen X trimer assembly and secretion, with retention of mutant chains in the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b023">23</xref>], resulting in metaphyseal chondrodysplasia type Schmid (MCDS) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b025">25</xref>]). Abnormal organization of chondrocytes and an expanded hypertrophic zone (HZ) have been observed in the growth plate of a swine model for MCDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b026">26</xref>].</p>
      <p>These observations raise the possibility that in chondrodysplasias caused by mutations that affect protein assembly and secretion, ERSS disrupts chondrocyte differentiation and thereby chondrocyte organization in the growth plate. In this study, we present evidence that when unfolded collagen X encoded by a murine <italic>Col10a1</italic>-equivalent of an MCDS mutation, a 13-base pair (bp) deletion within the NC1-encoding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b027">27</xref>], is expressed in transgenic mice (13del), ERSS is triggered in the growth plate. Concomitantly, HC fate and terminal differentiation are perturbed, but apoptosis is not increased. The normal terminal differentiation program is disrupted. The 13del HCs in the lower part of the HZ re-enter the cell cycle and express markers more typical of preHCs, accompanied by down-regulation of <italic>Col10a1-13del</italic> gene (hereafter referred to as <italic>13del</italic>) expression, suggesting an alteration in their cellular identity. This alteration of 13del HCs is cell autonomous, implying an association with activation of the ERSS. These findings reveal for the first time that HCs undergoing ER stress in vivo adapt, altering their differentiation status to a less-mature state in which expression of <italic>13del</italic> is reduced, thereby alleviating the unfolded protein load.</p>

        <title>The <italic>Col10a1</italic> 13del Mutation Results in Impaired Collagen X Assembly</title>
        <p>Trimer assembly of collagen X α-chains via the NC1 domain is critical for triple helix formation and for secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b024">24</xref>]. We tested the effect of the 13del mutation on collagen X trimer assembly in vitro by cell-free translation of wild-type (wt) and 13del mRNAs. Consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b022">22</xref>], the mutation resulted in collagen X α-chains that were unable to assemble into trimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Co-translation of wt <italic>Col10a1</italic> and 13del mRNAs resulted in fewer collagen X trimers, suggesting 13del α-chains reduced trimer assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Thus, this mutation would be expected to impair collagen X folding/assembly in vivo.</p>

The distances at different positions between the zone of vascular invasion at the growth plate and the proximal endpoint of the calcein label in the trabecular bone were determined using a micrometric eyepiece. The mean distance represented the rate of longitudinal bone growth over 5 d. Error bars represent ±1 standard deviation (SD). Longitudinal growth was retarded in 13del mice over 5–10 d, being only about half that in wt littermates (0.498 ± 0.013 mm for wt and 0.277 ± 0.025 mm for 13del; <italic>n</italic> = 3 for each genotype; <italic>p</italic> = 5.2 × 10<sup>−6</sup>).</p>

        <title>Abnormal Chondrocyte Differentiation in 13del Transgenic Mice</title>
        <p>To assess the impact of unfolded collagen X α-chains on the differentiation of the chondrocyte layers in vivo, we generated transgenic mice carrying the <italic>13del</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Five independent lines carrying the <italic>13del</italic> transgene all exhibited disproportionate dwarfism with shorter limbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). Histologic and morphometric analyses revealed altered proportional organization of the growth plate with a significant expansion specifically of the HZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). This expansion was detectable in 13del growth plates at late fetal stage, peaking on about day 10 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.015, <italic>n</italic> = 6), and diminishing by 4 wk (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>n</italic> = 13). By 10 wk, the height was normal and corresponded to the cessation of transgene expression (see below). Longitudinal bone growth as measured by calcein labeling was significantly reduced in 13del mice at 5- to 10-d-old (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). At 10 wk, 13del tibiae were 15% shorter than that of the wt (<italic>n</italic> = 12, <italic>p</italic> = 4 × 10<sup>−14</sup>). These results indicated that the phenotypic changes were associated with disturbed endochondral ossification.</p>
        <p>Transgenic mice overexpressing wt <italic>Col10a1</italic> in HCs under the identical regulatory sequences are phenotypically normal (unpublished data). Hence, the observed expansion in the HZ is consistent with a defect induced by the expression of the <italic>13del</italic> transgene. RNase protection assays confirmed the expression of the <italic>13del</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g001">Figure 1</xref>F). The expansion of the HZ was relatively greater in another 13del line showing higher transgene expression and was less in yet another line with lower <italic>13del</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050044-sg001">Figure S1</xref>), indicating a dosage-dependent effect. In situ hybridization using <italic>Col10a1</italic>- and <italic>13del</italic>-specific riboprobes revealed co-expression of <italic>13del</italic> mRNA with endogenous <italic>Col10a1</italic> specifically in the 13del HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). In wt littermates, <italic>Col10a1</italic> expression was largely restricted to, and maintained at a high level in the HZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). By contrast, the expression of both <italic>Col10a1</italic> and the <italic>13del</italic> transgene in 13del mice was down-regulated toward the lower portion of the hypertrophic zone (LHZ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), indicating an alteration in the differentiation program of HCs.</p>

        <title>13del HCs Retain 13del Proteins Intracellularly and Survive ER Stress</title>
        <p>Immunostaining with a 13del-specific antibody showed 13del proteins were restricted to the HCs in the growth plate. The 13del proteins were intracellular, with little or no staining in the ECM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, 13del panels), and co-localized with concanavalin A, which binds to carbohydrate moieties in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, middle panels). Endogenous wt collagen X was secreted to the ECM in mutant as in wt mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, insets). The 13del protein level varied both temporally and spatially: just before birth at 18.5 d post coitum (dpc), when the HZ expansion had not yet reached its maximum, mutant proteins appeared to be evenly present in the HZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). By contrast, there was reduced amounts of mutant protein in the LHZ of 3-wk-old 13del mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g002">Figure 2</xref>C), a time point at which the degree of expansion of the HZ relative to wt was less than for 10-d-old mice.</p>
        <p>Ultrastructural analysis revealed distended and fragmented ER in 13del HCs, but not in other growth plate zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g003">Figure 3</xref>A), raising the possibility that they were experiencing ER stress. We tested for expression of alternatively spliced <italic>Xbp1</italic> mRNA <italic>(Xbp1<sup>s</sup>),</italic> a major transducer of the ER stress signal. Both the spliced and unspliced isoforms of <italic>Xbp1</italic> were expressed in growth plate cartilage mRNA from 13del mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g003">Figure 3</xref>B), whereas only the unspliced form was found in wt littermates. Immunostaining revealed a strong induction of XBP1<sup>s</sup> protein in HCs expressing 13del protein in 13del upper HZ (UHZ) compared with wt littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g003">Figure 3</xref>C, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050044-sg003">Figure S3</xref>A).

        <p>The mRNA for the molecular chaperone BiP is strongly expressed in the UHZ in 13del mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g003">Figure 3</xref>D), concomitant with the expression of the <italic>13del</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), and gradually less so in cells toward the LHZ. This is consistent with the higher level of unfolded proteins and induction of ERSS in 13del UHZ. Immunostaining revealed markedly higher levels of BiP in HCs of the LHZ than in wt littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g003">Figure 3</xref>E).

Cytoplasmic localization of p53 is a molecular consequence of preventing apoptosis during ER stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b031">31</xref>], and we observed this in 13del HCs in the LHZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g003">Figure 3</xref>G). The ER-stressed HCs survived, which is consistent with an expansion of the HZ.</p>

        <title>Normal Rate of Chondrocyte Hypertrophy in 13del Proliferating Chondrocytes</title>
        <p>To determine whether the accumulation of HCs was due to increased rate of chondrocyte hypertrophy, we performed in vivo pulse-labeling experiments using 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU). Two hours after BrdU injection, only proliferating chondrocytes were labeled in both 13del and wt mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). There was no difference between wt and 13del in the proportion of labeled proliferating cells in the proliferating zone (PZ) (11.17% and 10.65%; <italic>p</italic> = 0.116; <italic>n</italic> = 3 for each genotype). After a 48-h chase, the position of the most distally located BrdU-labeled HCs relative to the PH was similar in 13del and wt mice, indicating that the transition to hypertrophy was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). The percentage of BrdU-labeled HCs relative to total number of BrdU-labeled chondrocytes in the PZ and HZ was also similar (<italic>p</italic> = 0.53) in 13del (31.9 ± 3.8%; <italic>n</italic> = 4) and wt mice (30.7 ± 4.4%; <italic>n</italic> = 4), indicating that the rate of chondrocyte progression to the hypertrophic state is normal in 13del. This suggests that the 13del-induced defect arises within the HZ.</p>

        <p>p57<sup>Kip2</sup> regulates cell-cycle exit and postmitotic hypertrophic differentiation in chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b033">33</xref>]. Expression of p57<sup>Kip2</sup> in the UHZ was up-regulated to a similar degree in 13del and wt mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g004">Figure 4</xref>B), which indicates that 13del cells had exited the cell cycle and entered the hypertrophic program. However, p57<sup>Kip2</sup> was significantly down-regulated in the mid to lower 13del HZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g004">Figure 4</xref>B), which suggests that the cells could have re-entered the cell cycle.</p>
        <p>The 13del expressing HCs in the mid to lower HZ, but not wt cells, were also found to express cyclin D1, a marker for the G1 phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050044-sg003">Figure S3</xref>B).

Together, these data suggest that in 13del mice, hypertrophic differentiation was initiated, but HCs in the mid to lower HZ re-entered the cell cycle. However, given that BrdU-labeled HCs were not detectable in the 13del HZ after 2 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), 13del HCs did not appear to have progressed through the G1/S checkpoint.

        <title>Re-expression of Gene Markers for Earlier Chondrocytic Lineages by 13del HCs</title>
        <p>We observed that some chondrocytes within the 13del LHZ acquired a more flattened and elongated cell shape with condensed nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g004">Figure 4</xref>B–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g004">4</xref>D). Moreover, we found that there were increased numbers of smaller chondrocytes in the 13del LHZ close to the chondro-osseous junction (29.5% ± 6.42%) compared to wt LHZ (17.8% ± 7.49%) (<italic>p</italic> = 0.04 by <italic>t</italic>-test; see Materials and Methods), indicating a change in identity. Thus, we hypothesized that the differentiation status of HCs in the HZ had been altered, contributing to the expansion of the HZ. The different subpopulations of chondrocytes display characteristic expression profiles of many genes encoding transcription factors (e.g., <italic>Sox9</italic>), signaling/growth factors (e.g., <italic>Ihh, Pthrp,</italic> and <italic>Igf2</italic>), receptors (e.g., <italic>patched [Ptc]</italic> and <italic>PTH/PTHrP receptor [Ppr]),</italic> cell-cycle regulators (e.g., <italic>p57<sup>Kip2</sup></italic> and <italic>cyclin D1</italic>), and ECM components <italic>(Col2a1, Col10a1,</italic> and <italic>Agc1)</italic>.</p>
        <p>As wt proliferating chondrocytes undergo hypertrophy, several genes are down-regulated in preparation for replacement of cartilage by bone. <italic>Col2a1</italic> is normally expressed throughout the growth plate with the highest levels in the resting zone (RZ), PZ, and PH, and the lowest in the HZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). <italic>Sox9</italic> expression parallels that of its transcriptional target <italic>Col2a1,</italic> except in the HZ, where it is absent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050044-sg005">Figure S5</xref>A). <italic>Igf2</italic> is expressed at high levels in proliferating chondrocytes and at lower levels in preHCs, and is down-regulated in HCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050044-sg005">Figure S5</xref>B). Consistent with the finding that entry into the hypertrophic phase was not affected in 13del mice, the expression of <italic>Col2a1, Sox9,</italic> and <italic>Igf2</italic> was down-regulated in the UHZ. However, 13del chondrocytes in the mid- and lower portions of the HZ re-expressed <italic>Sox9, Col2a1,</italic> and <italic>Igf2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g005">Figures 5</xref>A, S5A, and S5B).

        <title>Re-Activation of the IHH and PPR Signaling Pathways in 13del HCs</title>
        <p>To further characterize the abnormality in terminal chondrocyte differentiation, we focused on two pathways, IHH/PTC and PTHrP/PPR, which cooperate to regulate chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b034">34</xref>]. In 10-d-old wt mice, expression of <italic>Ppr</italic> (encoding PTH/PTHrP receptor) and <italic>Ihh</italic> was found predominately in both preHCs and upper HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g005">Figure 5</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g005">5</xref>C), and <italic>Ihh</italic> mRNA was diminished in the LHZ and absent from cells bordering the chondro-osseous junction. Expression of <italic>Ptc,</italic> which encodes for IHH receptor and a target gene of IHH per se, flanked the <italic>Ihh</italic>-expressing domain proximally and distally, just adjacent to the preHCs and within the osteogenic cells at the chondro-osseous junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). In 10-d-old mice, <italic>Ihh, Ptc,</italic> and <italic>Ppr</italic> were expressed in similar regions in both 13del and wt; but in 13del mice, these genes were re-expressed in some cells in the LHZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g005">Figure 5</xref>B–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g005">5</xref>D). The strong activation of <italic>Ptc</italic> transcription and re-expression of <italic>Ppr</italic> indicate that cells in the 13del LHZ are receiving and responding to IHH signal. Overall, 13del cells in the LHZ expressed markers that are more characteristic of preHCs.</p>

        <title>Altered Terminal Differentiation in 13del HCs</title>
        <p>To confirm that 13del HCs had initiated hypertrophic differentiation normally, we created <italic>Col10a1-Cre</italic>/ROSA26 CRE reporter mice that expressed CRE recombinase and β-galactosidase specifically in HCs and crossed them with 13del mice. In the compound mutant mice with or without <italic>13del</italic> transgene, all the HCs expressed β-galactosidase as shown by X-gal staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g005">Figure 5</xref>E). Some 13del HCs in the mid-lower HZ exhibited both <italic>Ppr</italic>-re-expression and positive X-gal staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g005">Figure 5</xref>E, inset in 13del panel). Because the <italic>Cre</italic> gene had been inserted into the <italic>Col10a1</italic> gene by homologous recombination, its expression is under the control of the endogenous <italic>Col10a1</italic> promoter. Therefore, the induction of β-galactosidase expression indicated that differentiation of 13del HCs was disrupted after they have initiated hypertrophy.</p>
        <p>As HCs attain the terminal stages of differentiation at the chondro-osseous junction, they express <italic>osteopontin (Opn)</italic> and <italic>matrix metalloproteinase 13 (Mmp13)</italic>. In wt mice, these genes were expressed exclusively in HCs at the chondro-osseous junction, whereas in 13del mice, expression of <italic>Opn</italic> and <italic>Mmp13</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g005">Figure 5</xref>F and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050044-sg005">Figure S5</xref>D) were delayed and scattered throughout the LHZ.

        <p>As anticipated, the growth plates of EGFP/wt chimeras were indistinguishable from wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). In EGFP/13del chimeras, the most noticeable changes were variations in the height of the HZ and an undulating chondro-osseous junction in the growth plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). Where the contribution of 13del cells was higher, the degree of expansion of HCs was likewise higher and the undulation of the chondro-osseous junction generally correlated well with the relative contribution of 13del cells. This correlation suggests that the defect in 13del HCs is a cell-autonomous one, since their abnormal differentiation could not be overcome by the presence of wt HCs.</p>
        <p>Key marker for ERSS (BiP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g006">Figure 6</xref>H), for cell-cycle progression (p57<sup>Kip2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g006">Figure 6</xref>K), and for chondrocyte differentiation <italic>(Ppr)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g006">Figure 6</xref>N) were expressed abnormally in regions containing 13del cells. 13del HCs in the LHZ of chimeras re-expressed <italic>Ppr</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g006">Figure 6</xref>N).

        <title>13del Expression Correlates with the Levels of ER Stress and Alteration in Differentiation</title>

        <p>The close correlation between <italic>Col10a1</italic> and <italic>13del</italic> expression with BiP was further shown by quantitative RT-PCR using serial transverse sections of the tibial growth plates.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Many studies have shown that factors influencing cell fate and/or differentiation are activated in ERSS, but how such changes impact differentiation programs in vivo is poorly understood. We have shown that HCs in the murine growth plate expressing unfolded collagen X experience ER stress but do not undergo apoptosis. The normal terminal differentiation process is interrupted; HCs adapt and survive via cell-autonomous reversion to a preHC-like state that results in delayed endochondral ossification and chondrodysplasia.</p>

        <title>Expression of Unfolded Collagen X Triggers ER Stress</title>
        <p>In vitro translation assays suggest that 13del mutant collagen X proteins are unable to assemble into trimers, and thus are poorly secreted. The accumulation of the 13del proteins in the ER and the low to undetectable level in the ECM of the HZs of 13del mice confirmed the secretion defect. Poor secretion is also seen with collagen X containing other MCDS mutations that prohibit subunit folding and assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b038">38</xref>].</p>
        <p>The 13del mice reveal that misfolding of mutant collagen X occurs in vivo. High-level expression of <italic>Col10a1</italic> is characteristic of chondrocyte hypertrophy. 13del HCs transcribed both endogenous <italic>Col10a1</italic> and <italic>13del</italic> transgene. Intracellular accumulation of 13del proteins suggested that the endogenous degradation machinery could not clear all the mutant protein. The distended, fragmented ER indicates that ER stress was induced in HCs expressing 13del proteins, leading to activation of ERSS. Up-regulation of <italic>BiP, CHOP,</italic> expression of <italic>Xbp1<sup>s</sup>, Edem,</italic> and cytoplasmic localization of p53 in 13del HCs are all indicators that ERSS was triggered. The co-expression of both XBP1<sup>s</sup> protein and 13del in the same cells suggests that expression of the mutant collagen directly induced ERSS.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, in contrast to the expanded HZ in 13del mice, expression of chicken collagen X chains containing a deletion within the helical domain in transgenic mice results in chondrodysplasia and a compressed HZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b039">39</xref>]. The underlying molecular mechanism is not clear, and there are no mutations reported in the helical domain of collagen X in humans for comparison. Trimerization of the mutant chicken collagen X was not affected and homo- and hetero-trimers formed efficiently in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b040">40</xref>]. Furthermore, mutant collagen X is detected in the extracellular matrix in growth plate cartilage of the transgenic mice, with little evidence for intracellular accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b040">40</xref>]. Thus, the molecular consequence to 13del mice is likely to be different, and the compression may be related to the presence of mutant chicken collagen X mixed with wt mouse collagen X or hybrid mouse–mutant chicken collagen X in the growth plate matrix, impairing the supramolecular structure of extracellular collagen X and hence tissue integrity.</p>

        <title>Visualizing Induction and Progression of ERSS in the 13del Growth Plate In Situ</title>
        <p>A single histological section of the growth plate provides a continuous snapshot of the different phases of chondrocyte differentiation as they progress from a resting state to the proliferative state, become prehypertrophic, and then enter the final stages of hypertrophy and terminal differentiation at the chondro-osseous junction. Thus, our analyses of molecular changes in 13del chondrocytes using longitudinal sections taken through the growth plate provide an in vivo picture of ER stress induction. The response of the HCs to ER stress, indicated by induction of <italic>BiP</italic> expression, can then be monitored as the HCs approach the chondro-osseous junction. In cultured cells, induction of ERSS is characterized by a rapid increase of <italic>BiP</italic> mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b042">42</xref>].</p>
        <p>In 13del, strong induction of <italic>BiP</italic> mRNA in the UHZ was observed in pre-weaning age, suggesting that HCs are experiencing ER stress soon after hypertrophy. In contrast, by 4 wk postpartum, in UHZ chondrocytes, <italic>13del</italic> transgene expression was diminishing, whereas <italic>BiP</italic> mRNA was more abundant in the LHZ where cells were expressing a higher level of the transgene and ER stress is maintained in these cells. Therefore, the stress level in 13del HCs varied during growth according to transgene expression level, and the stress response is dosage dependent.</p>
        <p>It is interesting to note that the <italic>13del</italic> transgene did not fully recapitulate the expression of the endogenous <italic>Col10a1</italic> gene in fetal and postnatal growth. It is turned on later (between 14.5 and 15.5 dpc) and turned off earlier (between 6–10 wk postpartum) when compared to the endogenous <italic>Col10a1,</italic> probably because the transgene did not contain the full complement of <italic>Col10a1</italic> regulatory elements; for example, the lack of a conserved enhancer element upstream of the transgene ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b043">43</xref>] and unpublished data). When normal <italic>Col10a1</italic> alone was expressed (14.5 dpc and at 10 wk postpartum), induction of <italic>BiP</italic> expression was not detected. This asynchrony in timing of expression between <italic>13del</italic> and the endogenous <italic>Col10a1</italic> and the qRT-PCR data serves to highlight the close association between <italic>13del</italic> expression and <italic>BiP</italic> up-regulation, further supporting the notion that 13del proteins induced ERSS directly.</p>

        <title>Surviving ER Stress Is Coupled with Altered Terminal Differentiation</title>
        <p>ERSS is primarily a response to relieve ER stress for cell survival. However, ER stress can lead to cell death as shown in various systems. In the Akita diabetic mouse, ER stress led to apoptosis via <italic>CHOP</italic> induction. In the absence of CHOP, apoptosis was reduced and the onset of diabetes was delayed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b044">44</xref>]. CHOP is also implicated for anti-apoptotic activity. In a mouse model of human Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease experiencing ER stress, CHOP protects oligodendrocytes from apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b007">7</xref>]. These contradictory results may be explained by the dependence of concurrent signaling events during ER stress. Indeed, signals both upstream and downstream of CHOP (i.e., the PERK signaling cascade) have been shown to have opposite effects on cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b045">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b047">47</xref>]. In 13del, despite raised CHOP expression in the UHZ, apoptosis was not triggered and the HCs survived. In this situation, ERSS may play a cytoprotective role. It is known that growth plate chondrocytes are destined to survive hypoxic stress during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b048">48</xref>]. This implies that they are preconditioned to survive hypoxic conditions before becoming terminally differentiated, probably through the cytoprotective actions of HIF-1α PERK, and eIF2α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b050">50</xref>]. Chondrocytes may have additional adaptive mechanisms that protect against stress-induced apoptosis or have a high stress tolerance or threshold before cell death can be triggered. One may speculate that cells that are not preconditioned to survive stress (e.g., neurons) may be much more susceptible to ER stress-induced death. Paradoxically, the cytoprotective effect of ERSS may interfere with the normal apoptotic fate of HCs, contributing to the abnormal terminal differentiation of 13del HCs.</p>
        <p>Survival of 13del HCs was associated with signs of stress alleviation. The diminished expression of <italic>Col10a1/13del</italic> in the LHZ indicates that production of the mutant collagen X chains in those chondrocytes was reduced, and ER stress was correspondingly alleviated, as revealed by the down-regulation of <italic>BiP</italic> and <italic>Chop</italic> transcript in the LHZ. The outcome of alleviation of ER stress is the reduction in synthesis of 13del proteins. In 13del, a reduction in <italic>Col10a1</italic> and <italic>13del</italic> mRNAs occurred that must contribute towards alleviation of ER stress. Such reduction could occur by nonsense-mediated decay, as suggested for MCDS caused by the nonsense mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b052">52</xref>] or by IRE1-mediated mRNA degradation recently identified to occur during the UPR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b053">53</xref>] or by regulating transcription.</p>
        <p>It is notable that the reduction in <italic>Col10a1/13del</italic> expression also correlated with the change in cell-cycle control and differentiation state of the chondrocytes in the LHZ (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g010">Figure 10</xref>B). These changes point to more complex modes of alleviating ER stress. In the 13del UHZ, the strong transcription of both wt and 13del <italic>Col10a1,</italic> up-regulated expression of p57<sup>Kip2</sup>, and extent of BrdU labeling in pulse-chase experiments indicated that 13del preHCs had exited the cell cycle and progressed into hypertrophy normally. Normal entry into hypertrophy is further confirmed by the expression of <italic>Col10a1-Cre</italic> and β-galactosidase activity in all HCs in the 13del expanded HZ. However, down-regulation of both <italic>Col10a1</italic> and <italic>13del</italic> transcripts in advance of expression of <italic>Mmp9,</italic> and delayed expression of <italic>Mmp13</italic> and <italic>Opn</italic> (relative to the onset of hypertrophy) in the 13del LHZ, indicated that terminal differentiation was disrupted.</p>
        <p>In the 13del LHZ chondrocytes, re-expression of genes <italic>(Ihh, Ppr, Ptc, Igf2, Sox9,</italic> and <italic>Col2a1)</italic> characteristic of proliferating chondrocytes/preHCs indicated a switch to preHC-like status. In addition, the down-regulation of p57<sup>Kip2</sup> and the up-regulation of PCNA and cyclin D1 are consistent with cell-cycle re-entry. This is a novel finding since HCs are terminally differentiated and are not expected to return to the cell cycle. PTHrP suppresses <italic>p57<sup>Kip2</sup></italic> expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b033">33</xref>], IGF2 antagonizes <italic>p57<sup>Kip2</sup></italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b054">54</xref>], and cyclin D1 is a target of IHH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b055">55</xref>] and IGF2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b056">56</xref>] signaling. <italic>Igf2, Ppr,</italic> and <italic>Ihh</italic> show highest expression level in wt proliferating chondrocytes or preHCs, and are down-regulated in HZ. Their re-expression in the 13del LHZ suggests a link to the observed cell-cycle re-entry. Activated PTHrP and IGF2 signaling may down-regulate p57<sup>Kip2</sup> expression, whereas activated IHH and IGF2 signaling could up-regulate cyclin D1 expression, stimulating cell-cycle re-entry. Cell-cycle re-entry for 13del LHZ chondrocytes is most likely a secondary effect due to the re-activation of signaling pathways that regulate chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy.</p>
        <p>Cells in the 13del LHZ were asynchronized in terms of their differentiation state: some of them expressed preHC markers (e.g., <italic>Ppr</italic>), some expressed markers for terminally differentiated HCs (e.g., <italic>Opn</italic>), and some expressed both <italic>Ppr</italic> and <italic>Opn</italic>. The latter can be interpreted as cells captured in a “reprogramming” process. Because, as indicated in wt mice, expression of <italic>Opn</italic> marks HCs that have progressed to the terminal status, and for <italic>Ppr</italic> to be expressed in the same 13del HCs suggests a reversion process has occurred. However, the reversal of differentiation is not absolute, as endochondral ossification does occur, albeit delayed. Therefore, the co-expression of <italic>Ppr</italic> and <italic>Opn</italic> could also indicate stress-alleviated HCs resuming terminal differentiation. These cells may bypass the intermediate hypertrophic state to avoid expressing high level of mutant collagen X.</p>

        <title>Relationship between ER Stress and Altered Terminal Differentiation</title>
        <p>The inability of wt HCs to rescue the delayed terminal differentiation, and the altered gene expression of 13del cells in chimeras, suggest that these changes are dominant and cell autonomous. The normal terminal differentiation of HCs in collagen X null mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b057">57</xref>] and identical expansion of HZ in compound <italic>13del; Col10a1</italic> null mutants (unpublished data) are consistent with such a dominant effect. Given that there is normal entry into hypertrophy and a clear demarcation region of fully differentiated HCs in the UHZ, as shown by the β-galactosidase activity in all HCs in <italic>Col10a1-Cre</italic>–Rosa 26 reporter mice, the reversion of cells in the LHZ to a preHC-like status must be due to altered terminal differentiation of the stressed HCs.</p>
        <p>The concomitant onset of ERSS in the 13del UHZ with disruption of terminal differentiation provides visual evidence for a possible link between these two processes, and is consistent with the latter occurring as a consequence of ERSS. The correlation between levels of 13del expression with degree of HZ expansion in independent lines of mice suggests a direct link between level of ER stress and the altered differentiation. In addition, the gradual loss of preHC-like cells after weaning age correlates with the down-regulation of <italic>13del</italic> and delayed <italic>BiP</italic> induction, suggesting a causal relationship between ER stress and altered HC differentiation. Co-expression in the same cells of 13del with XBP1<sup>s</sup> and with cyclin D1 proteins provides molecular evidence for a direct link.</p>
        <p>Reverting to a preHC-like state may be an adaptive or fortuitous response by which the 13del HCs alleviate and survive ER stress. This is interesting, since by reverting to a preHC-like state, both wt and 13del <italic>Col10a1</italic> transcription would be down-regulated, thereby reducing the source of the ER stress (13del proteins) to a more acceptable level. Consistent with this hypothesis, expression of <italic>13del, Col10a1,</italic> and <italic>BiP</italic> was reduced in the LHZ at 10 d and 3 wk postpartum.</p>
        <p>Chondrocytes in culture are able to re-differentiate after dedifferentiation to a fibroblastic/osteoblastic state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b059">59</xref>]. This plasticity involves changes in transcriptional profile and may be retained in HCs. The altered terminal differentiation of 13del HCs is the first in vivo demonstration of the phenotypic plasticity and capacity to revert to a preHC-like state. Unlike in cell culture, none of the 13del HCs expressed <italic>Col1a1,</italic> the osteoblast marker, suggesting that reprogrammed differentiation to a preHC-like state occurred rather than transdifferentiation to osteoblasts. This inherent plasticity may be exploited by HCs to adapt and survive ER stress in vivo.</p>
        <p>Our findings provide novel mechanistic insight into how chondrocytes overcome ER stress in vivo. Until now, it is generally accepted from in vitro studies that cells respond to ER stress either by undergoing apoptosis or by a general down-regulation of protein synthesis and up-regulation of protein-folding/degradation capacity and thereby relieve the load of unfolded proteins in the ER. However, there is no information on the impact of ER stress on the differentiation program of chondrocytes either in vitro or in vivo.</p>
        <p>We propose a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050044-g010">Figure 10</xref>C) in which, in addition to the alleviation mechanisms mediated by the UPR, 13del HCs cope with ER stress through a “reprogram, recover, and survive” adaptive mechanism. Initially, 13del protein expression induces ERSS, but not apoptosis. The differentiation program of the HCs is altered in which they “revert” or “reprogram” to a preHC-like state in which collagen X expression is reduced. The “reprogramming” involves re-activation of signaling pathways that may stimulate re-entry into the cell cycle. However, p57<sup>Kip2</sup> restricts cell-cycle progression. By reprogramming, the 13del HCs finally down-regulate endogenous <italic>Col10a1</italic> and <italic>13del</italic> mRNA levels, thereby alleviating the load of mutant protein and ER stress, providing the means to survive and complete differentiation, albeit with delayed endochondral ossification.</p>
        <p>The exact mechanisms that mediate the reversion of the differentiation pathway in 13del HCs are not known. It is conceivable that the ER stress response takes control over gene expression and protein metabolism to such a significant extent that it interferes with normal differentiation processes, which may involve complex alteration in signal transduction and transcription factors recruitment and interaction, as well as epigenetic changes upon ER stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b060">60</xref>]. Identifying and understanding the underlying mechanisms are important and issues for further study.</p>

        <title>Implications for the Pathogenesis of Chondrodysplasias</title>
        <p>Our data have broad implications for the mechanism of disrupted chondrocyte differentiation in MCDS and other chondrodysplasias caused by mutations that impair protein assembly and secretion. Although ER stress-induced apoptosis may provide a major route for pathogenesis, our study raises the possibility that chondrocytes can survive ER stress in a process that changes the normal differentiation program. Changes in the pattern of markers that characterize the differentiation status of chondrocytes have been noted in chondrodysplastic models. Mutations in collagen II that interfere with assembly and secretion, leading to chondrodysplasia, are associated with distension of the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b061">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b062">62</xref>]. In <italic>Col2a1<sup>G904C</sup></italic> mice, the fragmented ER, as well as the increased levels of BiP and CHOP in growth plate chondrocytes, indicate that ERSS is induced; abnormal terminal differentiation of HCs is indicated by the up-regulation of <italic>Col2a1</italic> and <italic>Agc1</italic> expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b036">36</xref>]. Transgenic mice expressing collagen II with a 36 amino acid deletion showed disorganized chondrocytes and fragmented ER, and there was loss of expression of the cell-cycle regulator <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> and the key differentiation markers <italic>Ihh, Col10a1,</italic> and <italic>Fgfr3</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b062">62</xref>]. In <italic>cmd/cmd</italic> mice, the distributions and co-expression patterns of several chondrocyte differentiation markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b063">63</xref>] and regulators of the cell cycle (p57<sup>Kip2</sup> and PCNA) were altered. The abnormal gene expression in these models and 13del suggest that alteration of the normal progression of differentiation, cell-cycle control, and fate change may be a common consequence of ER stress in chondrocytes. However, the phenotypic consequence in terms of differentiation pathway and growth plate architecture may differ depending on the nature of the mutation and the expressing cell type.</p>
        <p>The 13del mouse has also provided insight into the adaptive mechanisms that facilitate survival of chondrocytes in vivo in the face of ER stress. But survival is not without cost; the changes in HC differentiation do result in delayed endochondral ossification. We postulate that the change in differentiation program contributes to the disorganization of chondrocytes in the growth plate that occurs in many chondrodysplasias. Whether this strategy is peculiar to chondrocytes or can be adopted by other cell types affected in protein-folding disorders is an important issue to address in the future.</p>

The ends of the long bones were mounted in Tissue Freezing Medium (Jung, Nussloch, Germany) and growth plates fractionated by collecting 5-μm sections, 20 sections per fraction, on a Zeiss cryostat (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). In between each fraction, a single section was mounted and subjected to von Kossa and Safranin-O staining to determine cell morphology of the tissue comprising the adjacent fractions. Total RNA was prepared from growth plate fractions using the Trizol reagent. cDNA was prepared from fractions by reverse transcription of 1 μg of total RNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase and random hexamers. Quantitative PCR was carried out on an ABI 7700 real-time thermal cycler using a SYBR green qPCR kit from ABGene. Specific PCR primers designed with a melting temperature (Tm) of approximately 60 °C and to span at least one intron were used to determine gene expression profiles. The primers used are as follows: <italic>Col10a1,</italic> 5′-TTCATCCCATACGCCATAAAG and 5′-AGCTGGGCCAATATCTCCTT; <italic>BiP,</italic> 5′-TGAAACTGTGGGAGGAGTCA and 5′-TTCAGCTGTCACTCGGAGAA; <italic>Mmp9,</italic> 5′-TTCGCGTGGATAAGGAGTTC and 5′-CCTCCACTCCTTCCCAGTCT; and <italic>Actinb,</italic> 5′-GACGGCCAGGTCATCACTAT and 5′-GTACTTGCGCTCAGGAGGAG. Dissociation curves were collected for all PCR reactions to ensure specificity. <italic>Actinb</italic> was used as an internal control for normalization. The highest expression level for a particular transcript was designated arbitrarily as 1 for comparison.</p>

        <p>In situ hybridization was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050044-b063">63</xref>], using [<sup>35</sup>S]UTP-labeled ribopobes for <italic>Ihh</italic> (from A.

To detect wt and 13del <italic>Col10a1</italic> mRNA, a 77-bp (nucleotides 1,824–1,899) wt-specific short probe and a 64-bp 13del-specific short probe (same as for the wt-specific probe, but with the 13-bp deleted) were generated. The probe for <italic>BiP</italic> corresponds to position 9–1,991 in mouse <italic>BiP</italic> mRNA. <italic>BiP</italic> cDNA was synthesized by RT-PCR and cloned into pBluescript II.</p>
        <p>Marker analyses (with antibodies and/or riboprobes) were performed on sections from at least three 13del mice, and data shown is representative of consistent results.</p>

        <p>To express <italic>Cre</italic> recombinase specifically in HCs, a replacement gene-targeting vector was generated that contained <italic>Col10a1</italic> sequence extending from −2,070 to +7,680.

        <p>Fluorescence images were captured on an Axiovert 135 microscope (Carl Zeiss) using the Bio-Rad MRC-1024 laser scanning confocal imaging system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, United States). Pseudo-colored in situ hybridization images were created by overlaying bright field (blue filter) and dark field (red filter) images captured on a Axioplan 2 microscope (Carl Zeiss,) using a DKC-ST5 digital camera (Sony, Tokyo, Japan). The images were enhanced by adjusting the contrast with Photoshop 6.0 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, California, United States), and overlaid using the “Screen” blend mode of the “Layer” function to produce the final pseudo-colored image. For immunohistochemistry, images were captured on the same microscope with some images enhanced with the “Auto Levels” function in Photoshop 6.0 that automatically adjusts the tonal range to improve color contrast in each of the RGB channels with a default clip values of 0.5%.</p>
