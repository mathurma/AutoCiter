        <p>The flexibility in the structure of calmodulin (CaM) allows its binding to over 300 target proteins in the cell. To investigate the structure-function relationship of CaM, we combined methods of computer simulation and experiments based on circular dichroism (CD) to investigate the structural characteristics of CaM that influence its target recognition in crowded cell-like conditions. We developed a unique multiscale solution of charges computed from quantum chemistry, together with protein reconstruction, coarse-grained molecular simulations, and statistical physics, to represent the charge distribution in the transition from apoCaM to holoCaM upon calcium binding. Computationally, we found that increased levels of macromolecular crowding, in addition to calcium binding and ionic strength typical of that found inside cells, can impact the conformation, helicity and the EF hand orientation of CaM. Because EF hand orientation impacts the affinity of calcium binding and the specificity of CaM's target selection, our results may provide unique insight into understanding the promiscuous behavior of calmodulin in target selection inside cells.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Proteins are workhorses for driving biological functions inside cells. Calmodulin (CaM) is a protein that can carry cellular signals by triggered conformational changes due to calcium binding that alters target binding. Interestingly, CaM is able to bind over 300 targets. One of the challenges in characterizing CaM's ability to bind multiple targets lies in that CaM is a flexible protein and its structure is easily modulated by the physicochemical changes in its surroundings, particularly inside a complex cellular milieu. In order to determine structure-function relationships of CaM, we employed a combined approach of experiments, computer simulations and statistical physics in the investigation of the effect of calcium-binding, salt concentration, and macromolecular crowding on CaM. The results revealed unique folding energy landscapes of CaM in the absence and presence of calcium ions and the structural implications of CaM are interpreted under cell-like conditions. Further, a large conformational change in CaM in response to environmental impacts, dictates the packing of local helices that may be critical to its function of target binding and recognition among vast target selections.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Calmodulin (CaM) is a highly acidic protein composed of 148 amino acid residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Watterson1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Vogel1">[2]</xref>. It has four helix-loop-helix calcium binding motifs commonly named EF-hands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Two EF-hands form a lobe and the two lobes (termed N and C) are connected by a helical linker. The linker has hinge like characteristics that accounts for extensive interdomain movements. One of the most remarkable characteristics of CaM is its ability to bind over 300 targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Chin1">[3]</xref>, owing to its conformational flexibility. Without calcium binding, the crystal structure of CaM was in an extended, dumbbell structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Kuboniwa1">[4]</xref>. The EF-hand orientation is antiparallel and the hydrophobic residues are buried inside the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Kuboniwa1">[4]</xref>. However, after calcium binding, CaM becomes more compact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Sorensen1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Zhu1">[6]</xref> where the N- and C-lobes collapse and the orientation of EF hands is perpendicular <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Kuboniwa1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Zhang1">[7]</xref>. Through such conformational change, the hydrophobic residues, especially Met <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Yuan1">[8]</xref>, are exposed to the solvent and this facilitates CaM binding to targets. Although this Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced conformational transition is crucial for the binding ability of CaM to a subset of targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Tan1">[9]</xref>, there are a number of proteins that can bind to the calcium-free form of CaM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Jurado1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Bahler1">[11]</xref>. As shown in other anisotropic proteins with the ability to change shapes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Homouz1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Dhar1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Dong1">[14]</xref>, CaM structures are susceptible to macromolecular crowding effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Ellis1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Minton1">[16]</xref> under which the most probable ensemble structure of CaM is a collapsed form in the absence of calcium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Homouz2">[17]</xref>. The structural response of the N- and C-lobes to the level of crowding is different and this likely plays an important part in influencing CaM's promiscuous binding behavior. These implications suggested a complicated behavior of CaM as a signaling protein in a cell. However, our understanding of CaM conformational dynamics under conditions that more closely mimic those inside the cell is still unknown.</p>

      <p>Protein modeling and computer simulations can provide critical insights into CaM's structural flexibility. Although all-atomistic molecular dynamics simulations can reveal the structures of CaM in great detail, they are often constrained by the short simulation times accessible (e.g. nanoseconds) so they cannot fully address the conformational changes that take place on the longer time scale relevant to calcium and target binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Kobayashi1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Wriggers1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Yang1">[20]</xref>. To overcome this hurdle, coarse-grained molecular simulations (CGMS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Homouz2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Zuckerman1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Chen1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Tripathi1">[23]</xref> were developed to probe the plastic structure of CaM. CGMS is particularly efficient for studying protein dynamics under the effect of macromolecular crowding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Cheung1">[24]</xref> and this method has been used to study protein folding mechanism under cell-like conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Minh1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Homouz3">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Mittal1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Tsao1">[28]</xref>. However, the interactions between coarse-grained residues may miss important ingredients that account for the functionality of CaM. For example, pairwise Lennard-Jones potentials are deployed to represent the London dispersion forces, assuming that the electrostatic interactions are coarse-grained into a parameter in solvent-mediated interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Israelachivili1">[29]</xref>. However, this approach misses critical information related to electrostatic interactions among charged residues, particularly when they are close in space. Another approach many groups have adopted is a so called “double Go-type” interaction, but such approaches can only sample the differences between two protein states based on <italic>a priori</italic> known structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Zuckerman1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Chen1">[22]</xref>. The latter approach misses the opportunity to explore other possible compact structures in solutions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Slaughter1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Junker1">[31]</xref>. Although the electrostatic interactions between the charged amino acids or nucleic acids have been investigated by coarse-grained model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Hyeon1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Azia1">[33]</xref>, there are few combined experimental and computational studies that attempt to validate or confirm the predictions of the computational work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Turjanski1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Kleinjung1">[35]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Motivated by the need for a better description of CaM conformational dynamics under cell-like conditions, we introduced a coarse-grained protein model that takes into account the electrostatic interaction between charged residues under different ionic strength conditions through the Debye- Hückel potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Debye1">[36]</xref>. The main challenge lies on the determination of charges on CaM that are dependent on calcium binding and altered ionic strength and the resulting extent of solvent exposure in such a structure. We overcome this issue by incorporating a new approach that combines reconstruction of an ensemble of all-atomistic protein models from coarse-grained simulations (MultiSCAAL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Samiotakis1">[37]</xref>, statistical physics and quantum chemistry. With this new method, the charges distribution of apoCaM and holoCaM are reasonably computed and the effects of electrostatic interactions as a function of ionic strength on CaM, as well as the level of macromolecular crowding, can be evaluated.</p>
      <p>We have probed the structural characteristics of apoCaM in response to changes in ionic strength and macromolecular crowding effects. At high ionic strength, an extended dumbbell-like state of apoCaM is most probable and its helicity increases. At high crowding level, a collapsed compact state of apoCaM is most probable and the alignment of the two helices of an EF-hand was found to change, exposing buried hydrophobic residues. Although these two environmental factors can both result in an increased absorption of far-UV CD signals, different types of compact apoCaM structures may cause the change in the signal. This work reinforces the growing appreciation for the need to examine proteins in environments that mimic the intracellular milieu if one desires to understand their interactions and functions inside cells.</p>

          <title>Modulation of CaM's conformation and thermal stability by calcium binding</title>
          <p>CaM is a highly dynamic molecule whose conformational states in solution have been probed through the use of CD. As a prelude to investigate the impact of ionic strength and macromolecular crowding, we first analyzed the far-UV CD spectra and thermal unfolding of CaM in the absence and presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In the apo-state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), CaM displays negative bands at 207 and 222 nm consistent with the CD spectrum of a molecule with a relatively high proportion of α-helical content. In the presence of saturating Ca<sup>2+</sup>, there was a consistent and significant increase in the negative bands at both 207 and 222 nm. While some have interpreted this change as an increase in α-helical content, others have suggested that this difference in the spectrum is plausibly due to reorientation/distortions of the existing α-helices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Protasevich1">[38]</xref>. The latter suggestion is consistent with NMR data comparing apo- and holoCaM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Zhang1">[7]</xref> showing that the α-helical content of the two states are similar. We additionally examined the thermal stability of CaM by monitoring the CD spectra at 222 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) while increasing the temperature. Under these conditions of low ionic strength, apoCaM is completely unfolded at 60°C and above. The data also indicate that multiple transitions exist from the folded to the unfolded state (described in more detail below). As reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Browne1">[39]</xref>, addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> leads to a stabilization of the structure of CaM where even at temperatures of 90°C, the protein retains evidence of a partially folded state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

The base buffer was the same as in panel (A) and the CD signal was monitored at 222 nm while the temperature was ramped from 5 to 90°C at a rate of 2.5°C/min. Note that under these conditions, apo-CaM exhibited a complex unfolding profile best fit with a 3-state model. In contrast, holoCaM did not fully denature even with temperatures up to 90°C. The unfolding profile of holoCaM was best fit with a 2-state model. The base buffer for these experiments was 10 mM MES, pH 7.0, that contained either 1 mM EDTA or 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. The CaM concentration was 0.4 mg/ml.</p>

As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, step-wise increases in KCl between 0 and 250 mM, produced systematic but modest increases in the negative bands at 208 and 222 nm. A further increase to 500 mM KCl did not produce additional increases in the CD signal. The thermal stability of CaM at increasing ionic strength was also assessed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g003">Figure 3B</xref> shows averaged traces of thermal denaturation data of bulk (0 added KCl) up to 500 mM KCl. Visual inspection of the data also revealed that there was a non-monotonic shape in the melting curve suggesting the presence of at least one intermediate in the pathway from the folded to the unfolded states. To more quantitatively examine these transitions, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g003">Figure 3B</xref> were fit to a three-state model. Fitting to a two-state model produced unacceptably large residuals in some of the data, so a three-state model including an intermediate state (I) between the native folded (N) and the unfolded (U) states was employed. The use of a three-state model was also employed in an earlier report examining the thermal stability of apoCaM where the transitions were proposed to reflect the unfolding of first the C-terminal lobe, followed by the N-terminal lobe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Sorensen2">[40]</xref>. Parameter values from models fits to this data, T<sub>m</sub> and ΔH<sub>m</sub>, are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002114-t001">Table 1</xref>. Increasing ionic strength significantly increased the T<sub>m</sub> of both the C- and N-lobes of CaM (N-I and I-U, respectively). Although the errors from the fitting for the van't Hoff ΔH were large in some cases, there was a slight trend for increasing ΔH for the C-lobe (N-I), but no significant trend for the N-lobe (I-U). These data indicate that ionic bonding potential plays a significant role in stabilizing apoCaM's structure, however, the impact of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding, even in the absence of KCl, produces an even greater resistance to thermal denaturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002114-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

          <title>Modulation of apoCaM's structure and thermal unfolding by macromolecular crowding</title>
          <p>To investigate how macromolecular crowding influences the structure of CaM, the CD spectra of apoCaM was determined at increasing concentrations of the crowding agent Ficoll 70. Ficoll 70 is a non-interacting, non-ionic glucose polymer that has been used extensively to investigate crowding induced effects on protein structure and folding. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, increased concentrations of Ficoll 70 (from 100–400 mg/ml) produced systematic increases in the CD spectra of apoCaM. Note that there was a subtle change in the structure from 0–100 mg/ml, then a more significant impact at 200 mg/ml and then modest additional impact on the spectra by increasing the concentration to 300 or 400 mg/ml.</p>
          <p>We additionally assessed thermal unfolding of apoCaM by monitoring changes in CD at 222 nm in the presence of increasing amounts of Ficoll 70. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g003">Figure 3D</xref> shows that increasing concentrations of Ficoll 70 (0–400 mg/ml) produced a systematic shift to the right in the melting temperature of apoCaM. Fits of this data to a 3-state model were accomplished and the parameters from those fits are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002114-t002">Table 2</xref>. Quantitatively, the thermal midpoint temperature of the N-I transition for apoCaM increased from 24.3 to 48.4°C while the I-U transition increased from 51.8 to 65.9°C after the addition of 40% Ficoll 70.</p>

        <p>The trend observed in the far-UV CD spectra in the presence of crowders is likely caused by structural changes in apoCaM. It motivated the investigation of CaM's structures using computer simulations and physical models that may explain the phenomena in responses to the changes in solutions such as ionic strength and the volume fraction of crowders (φ<sub>c</sub>). We focused on the structural analysis in the helical content, the EF-hand orientation, and the probability and correlation of contact formation among amino acids, particularly aromatic ones such as phenylalanine and tyrosine, in both apoCaM and holoCaM.</p>

At high temperatures, R<sub>g</sub> of apoCaM reduces as the ionic strength increases (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002114.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Interactions between partially charged amino acids in apoCaM were significantly screened at [KCl] = 0.5 M, allowing a compact unfolded ensemble structure. The profile of apoCaM's R<sub>g</sub> vs Temperature at [KCl] = 0.5 M nearly overlapped with our previous study using the coarse-grained protein model without the Debye-Hückel term.

          <p>As temperature is further elevated to 1.15 k<sub>B</sub>T/ε (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), there are two major basins. In addition to M1, another basin named M2 is populated. M2 is defined in the ranges between 0.3&lt;χ&lt;0.4 and 0.03&lt;Δ&lt;0.15. The most probable structure in M2 represents a compact, spherical-like conformation. When temperature is further increased to 1.4 k<sub>B</sub>T/ε (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), only M2 exists.</p>
          <p>The population shift between M1 and M2 was also shown to be dependent on the ionic strength. At T = 1.15 k<sub>B</sub>T/ε, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g005">Figure 5</xref>, the folding energy landscape shifts from populations of M2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) to M1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g005">Figure 5C</xref>) when [KCl] increases, representing that attractions between charged amino acids are screened permitting an extended, dumbbell-like structure to become the most probable state. The screening effects also dominate the ensemble structures of the unfolded states. At a high temperature T = 1.5 k<sub>B</sub>T/ε, the unfolded state under a low ionic strength condition is found at the range of 0.7&lt;χ&lt;0.8 and 0.5&lt;Δ&lt;0.7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002114.s002">Figure S2A</xref>).

Instead, a structurally more compact and spherical ensemble emerges (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002114.s002">Figure S2B, S2C</xref>), indicating that at high ionic strength, electrostatic interactions are screened and the unfolded state of apoCaM is thus destabilized.</p>

          <title>ApoCaM's ensemble structures depend on the ionic strength</title>
          <p>In order to investigate the structural detail of the M1 and M2 states, we analyzed their characteristics in terms of helicity, the orientation of EF hands, as well as the probability of contact formation between aromatic amino acids. At low [KCl] when M2 prevails, its helicity is 46.0%. At high [KCl] when M1 dominates, its helicity is 48.8%. This result suggests that when the ionic strength increases the population shifts toward the M1 state, and the helicity of apoCaM increases. The helicity of apoCaM at different ionic strengths as a function of temperature is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g006">Figure 6A</xref>. Over a wide range of temperatures, the helicity of apoCaM at [KCl] = 0.5 M is up to 3% greater than that at [KCl] = 0.1 M and up to 2% greater than that at [KCl] = 0.2 M. These simulation results are consistent with the small but systematic increase in the negative bands in the CD spectra at 222 nm (predictive of α-helical content) as KCl increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g003">Figure 3</xref>). For a more direct comparison with the experimental data, We have computed a CD spectrum by including the calculated average helical and β-strand content from the simulations using a linear combination of the reference spectra <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Yang2">[45]</xref> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g006">Figure 6D</xref>. When the ionic strength increases, the negative bands in the calculated CD spectrum increase, which is qualitatively agreeable with the experiment data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Note that such calculations are based on oversimplifications of factors contributing to the CD spectra. For example, there is no available methodology to calculate contributions to the CD signal from tertiary structural components or rearrangements (for example, altered orientation of helices relative to each other).</p>

          <p>We further evaluated the angles of the two helices (modeled as vectors) in each of the EF hands. The vector of an α-helix is defined by pointing a direction from the averaged position of the first four residues (N) to the averaged position of the last four residues (C). This follows a similar definition used previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Kuboniwa1">[4]</xref>. The angle (Θ<sub>ij</sub>) between the two vectors drawn from the two helices, <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic>, forming an EF hand is defined by the arccosine of the inner product of these two vectors. Θ<sub>ij</sub> of apoCaM is different in each dominant ensemble structure in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002114-t003">Table 3</xref>. Regarding the M1 state where the most probable structure adopts an extended conformation, Θ<sub>AB,</sub> Θ<sub>CD</sub>, Θ<sub>EF</sub>, Θ<sub>GH,</sub> and Θ<sub>EF</sub> of each EF hand is individually much greater than a right angle, indicating that the alignment of the two helices in the EF-hands is nearly antiparallel. Regarding the M2 state where the most probable conformation resembles a collapsed compact structure, Θ of the same list of EF-hands become closer to a right angle. At a high ionic strength ([KCl] = 0.5 M), the population of M1 dominates, indicating that the ensemble average of Θ in each EF hands is closer to 180 degrees and the alignment of the two helices is nearly antiparallel.</p>

The probability of contact formation between aromatic residues is plotted as a matrix and the color is scaled from 0 to 1. The matrix elements at the upper triangle denote the contacts of a structure modeled from apoCaM's PDB structure (PDBID: 1CFD), while those in the lower triangle denote the contacts found in the states other than the PDB one (nonnative contacts). There are two groups of contact formation that can reflect the structural differences between M1 (extended, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002114.s003">Figure S3A</xref>) and M2 (collapsed, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002114.s003">Figure S3B</xref>) of apoCaM. The first group consists of contacts formed by Phe12 and Phe16 at Helix A and Phe65 and Phe68 at Helix D in the N-terminus (circled in green). The second group consists of contacts formed by Phe89 at Helix E and Tyr138 and Phe141 at Helix H in the C-terminus (circled in orange). There is a high probability of contact formation of these two regions in the M1 state, indicating the contacts between Helix A and D in the N-lobe and the contacts between Helix E and G in the C-lobe are highly similar to the structure modeled from apoCaM's PDB structure (PDBID: 1CFD). However, the probability of maintaining these contacts decreased by 5-fold in the M2 state, allowing the aromatic residues to break free from each other forming non-native contacts between the N- and C-domains. Thus, formation of nonnative contacts are prevalent in the M2 state, demonstrated by a noticeable growth of contact formation in the lower triangle in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002114.s003">Figure S3B</xref></p>

          <p>At [KCl] = 0.5 M (most populated around the M1 ensemble), contacts <italic>a</italic> (located in the N-lobe) and <italic>c</italic> (located in the C-lobe) are positively correlated (cov<sub>ac</sub> = 0.25). The interdomain correlation between <italic>a</italic> and <italic>c</italic> is established through an interdomain contact <italic>b</italic>, where cov<sub>ab</sub> = 0.32 and cov<sub>bc</sub> = 0.39. If b is formed across the two domains, then this contact formation positively contributes to the formation of contact <italic>a</italic> and <italic>c</italic>. Thus, contacts a and c are positively correlated. This is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g009">Figure 9A</xref>.</p>
          <p>At [KCl] = 0.1 M (most populated around the M2 ensemble), contacts <italic>a</italic> and <italic>c</italic> are now negatively correlated (cov<sub>ac</sub> = −0.27). As a result, a nonnative contact pair <italic>d</italic> forms between helix A and helix E. Subsequently cov<sub>ad</sub> = 0.60, the formation of the nonnative contact pair <italic>d</italic> is strongly tied to the formation of native contact <italic>a</italic>. As a result, a core structure is formed by helix A, helix D and helix E, and it excludes the interdomain contact <italic>b</italic>. In our simulation the probability of contact formation of b is close to zero. Without <italic>b</italic> in place Helix H becomes flexible and it avoids the contact formation to Helix E, which suppresses the formation of contact <italic>c</italic>. Thus, contacts <italic>a</italic> and <italic>c</italic>, despite being intradomain contacts, are negatively correlated. This is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g009">Figure 9B</xref>. Since the dominant state of holoCaM is M3 (a compacted structure) in both low and high ionic strength conditions, the contacts defined above are always negatively correlated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002114.s006">Figure S6</xref>).</p>
          <p>We also investigated the contact correlation associated with Asp93 and Asp129, studied by the previous NMR work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Xiong1">[52]</xref> about the presence of correlated interactions between N-lobe and C-lobe. We studied these contacts of apoCaM at high ionic strength where charge-charge interactions are screened and interactions between domains become less dependent on a specific charge on amino acids. There are a greater number of contacts in Asp93 than Asp129 such that the correlations of contacts pairing with Asp93 and contacts in the N-lobe are stronger, so we focused on Asp93. When we traced the contact formation of the Contact Pair Index (CPI) 204 formed by Asp93 and Ile100 (Table S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002114.s008">Text S1</xref>) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g008">Figure 8B</xref>, CPI 204 is located inside the orange box where there is a positive correlation with the contacts in the hydrophobic pocket of the N-lobe (e.g., CPI 28 involving Phe12 and Phe65). In contrast, in the simulations on holoCaM, there is negligible correlation between contacts associated with Asp 93 and Asp 129. For example, CPI 175 (involving Asp93 and Ile100; see Table S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002114.s008">Text S1</xref>) and contacts in the hydrophobic pocket of N-lobe (CPI 18, involving Phe12 and Phe 65; see Table S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002114.s008">Text S1</xref>) are weakly correlated, implying that structural fluctuations in C-domain impacts less on the exposure of hydrophobic pocket in N-domain.</p>

        <title>Conformations of apoCaM and holoCaM in aqueous solution</title>
        <p>Our simulation results indicate that apoCaM has both extended, dumbbell-like (M1) and compact, spherical-like (M2) structures in aqueous solution, consistent with published experimental results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Wyttenbach1">[53]</xref>. When the alignment of EF-hands is antiparallel, this orientation represents a “closed” state for target binding and the hydrophobic residues that dominate the initial interactions with protein targets are buried inside the lobes of apoCaM. Subsequently, the probability of contact formation among selected hydrophobic residues (e.g. aromatic amino acids) exceeds 90% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002114.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
        <p>We compared our analysis from simulations of apoCaM in the M1 state to experimental findings based on NMR measurements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Kuboniwa1">[4]</xref>; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002114-t003">Table 3</xref>. Θ<sub>AB</sub>, Θ<sub>CD</sub>, and Θ<sub>GH</sub> are close to 180 degrees which are in close agreement with experiments. Although Θ<sub>EF</sub> is off from experimental measurement, this may be due to the instability of the C-lobe relative to the N-lobe. This particular EF-hand whose Θ<sub>EF</sub> is close to a right angle may represent a semi-open state of the C-lobe which would be consistent with a NMR study examining the structure of the C-lobe of CaM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Swindells1">[54]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Regarding an ensemble of holoCaM structures, there is a remarkable lack of heterogeneity in conformations with only one compact state (M3) dominating in solution. In a coarse-grained holoCaM protein model, each of the four calcium beads is “fixed” into an EF-hand motif through springs. As a result, unlike apoCaM, the basin of free energy landscape of a holoCaM is quite narrow. In the M3 state, the alignment of two helices in each EF-hand is perpendicular to each other (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002114-t003">Table 3</xref>). This perpendicular orientation of the helices represents an “open” state for target binding and the hydrophobic residues are readily exposed. A reorientation of these helices has been suggested to lead to increased negative bands in the CD spectrum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Protasevich1">[38]</xref> and is consistent with our data comparing the Far-UV CD signal of holoCaM and apoCaM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
        <p>Note that M1 and M2 are the two dominant ensemble structures from the simulations of apoCaM. M3 is the most dominant ensemble from the simulation of the holoCaM. There is no direct correlation of these ensemble structures to the three-state model (N, U, I) for fitting the folding stability of apoCaM in experiments. The latter captures the known independent unfolding of the two lobes of CaM during the thermal denaturation process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Sorensen2">[40]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Impact of ionic strength on apoCaM and holoCaM</title>
        <p>We investigated the effect of ionic strength on the structural changes in apoCaM and holoCaM in which 30% of the amino acids in CaM are highly charged residues such as Arg, Lys, Glu, and Asp. Regarding holoCaM, the presence of four calcium beads constrains the loops of the EF-hands to such an extent that further structural changes in response to ionic strength increases is trivial (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002114.s005">Figure S5</xref>). This is consistent with the dominant effect of calcium binding over ionic strength on the resistance of holoCaM to thermal denaturation (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g002">Figures 2</xref>).</p>
        <p>However, apoCaM is a malleable protein and its conformation can be easily manipulated by perturbations in the environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Homouz2">[17]</xref>. Electrostatic interactions between the charged residues, if not screened, produce an instability of apoCaM's native state that resembles an extended dumbbell shape (M1). However, destabilizing electrostatic interactions between like-charges can be sufficiently screened out by increased ionic strength such that the population of the extended M1 state becomes highly probable; hence, the helicity of apoCaM increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). This may explains why the negative band of far-UV CD signal of apoCaM increases with the ionic strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

        <title>Effect of macromolecular crowding on apoCaM</title>
        <p>The investigation of macromolecular crowding effect on apoCaM was initiated in our previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Homouz2">[17]</xref>. Under crowded conditions that exert excluded volume interactions on apoCaM, compact forms are statistically most probable. As a result, the stability of the compact state of apoCaM increases with crowding level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002114.s001">Figure S1A</xref>), which is in agreement with experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, in our protein model of apoCaM that allows attractions between nonnative interactions, there could exist multiple compact states with various shapes. As a result, at high volume fraction (φ<sub>c</sub>) of crowding agents, the shape of compact proteins strongly influences the population shifts among themselves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Homouz1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Dhar1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Minton3">[55]</xref>. For example, the M2 state is structurally more spherical than M1. In the presence of a high volume fraction of crowders, the population of the M2 state (spherical) is more probable than the M1 state (dumbbell-like) because the former presents a smaller covolume as a sphere, as indicated by the Scaled Particle Theory (SPT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Minton3">[55]</xref>. This conclusion is also well supported by computer simulations on other anisotropic proteins under high levels of macromolecular crowding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Homouz1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Dhar1">[13]</xref>. As a result of population shifts towards a collapsed spherical M2 state under macromolecular crowding effects, while there is little impact on the helicity, the alignment of two helices in an EF-hand adopts nearly right angle conformations as shown in the M1 state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g006">Figure 6AB</xref>), which may contribute to an increase of the far-UV CD signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Although both ionic strength and crowding levels cause an increase in negative bands in the far-UV CD signal, we propose that the unique physical-chemical differences in these two conditions can favor different compact structures of apoCaM that give a similar kind of phenomenological response in the CD experiments.</p>

        <title>Effect of macromolecular crowding and ionic strength on apoCaM</title>
        <p>Our findings on CaM suggested that the ensemble of this highly charged protein is strongly dependent on the ionic strength and the macromolecular crowding effect. In CaM, the number of negatively charged residues (38) is greater than that of positively charged residues (14). A strong repulsion produced results in a higher probability of finding apoCaM in different states. At higher ionic strength such electrostatic repulsions are screened and the stability of CaM increases. This trend has also been found experimentally in other proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Pace1">[56]</xref>. At high levels of macromolecular crowding, the compact structures are populated due to depletion-induced attraction as a result of particle fluctuations, an entropic effect explained by Asakuwa and Oosawa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Asakura1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Asakura2">[58]</xref>. A competition between electrostatic interactions and macromolecular crowding effects will depend on the chemical nature of amino acid sequences and the structure of CaM. Due to the charge distribution of CaM, the specific details of our findings may be unique to this protein, however, evaluating both electrostatics and crowding as done in the present study is clearly needed to fully evaluate the impact of these factors on protein structures. Interestingly, our study may be applicable to the investigation of other biopolymers that are structurally malleable and highly charged, such as RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Pincus1">[59]</xref> and intrinsically disordered proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Vuzman1">[60]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Interdomain interaction between N- and C-lobes</title>
        <p>Experiments demonstrated that the N- and C-lobes of CaM impact one another and the two lobes cannot be treated as isolated entities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Protasevich1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Sorensen2">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Masino1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Xiong1">[52]</xref>. It was speculated that electrostatic interactions contributed to the cross-domain dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Protasevich1">[38]</xref>. Interestingly, in a recent findings with NMR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Xiong1">[52]</xref>, mutations from Asp to Ala of CaM at a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site in the C-lobe affect the target affinity of the N-lobe. However, there has not been a systematic analysis of contacts that might provide explanations for these results.</p>
        <p>Our <italic>in silico</italic> results indicate that there exist strong interdomain dynamics demonstrated by correlated contact formation in the N- and C-lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Interesting, N- and C-lobes are positively correlated at 0.5 M ionic strength and negatively correlated at 0.1 M. Notably, although the ionic strength is known to screen out electrostatic interactions, the contact formations that are affected by ionic strength in our simulations are hydrophobic residues (Phe12, Met76, Phe89, Phe141; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Thus, the electrostatic interactions appear to indirectly, rather than directly, affect the correlation between the lobes. We propose that the conformation of CaM, induced by different ionic strength, is the key to control the correlation between two lobes. In high ionic strength when interactions from like-charges are sufficiently screened out, CaM is a dumbbell-like structure; N- and C- lobes are positively correlated contributed by the interdomain contacts between Helix A and Helix H (yellow contacts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). However, in low ionic strength, CaM is a compact structure. As a result, a core structure is formed by helix A, helix D and helix E, and it excludes the interdomain contact between Helix A and Helix H (yellow contacts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). Accordingly, the contacts between Helix E and Helix H breaks (green contacts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002114-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). The overall result is the anticorrelation between N- and C-lobes.</p>
        <p>Our simulations of apoCaM at high ionic strength supports the conclusions of previous NMR work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Xiong1">[52]</xref> about the presence of correlated interactions between N-lobe and C-lobe through inter-domain interactions. In these experimental findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Xiong1">[52]</xref>, Asp to Ala mutations at the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites in the C-lobe (Asp93 and Asp129) altered the conformation of the C-lobe as well as the hydrophobic pocket of the N-lobe. This results in an increase of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding affinity of the N-lobe by decreasing the dissociation rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic>). Our findings suggested that there is a strong positive correlation between contacts associated with Asp93 (e.g., CPI 204) in the C-lobe and the hydrophobic pocket in the N-lobe (e.g., CPI 28). We can speculate that if there is a mutation to replace Asp93 to Ala that weakened CPI 204, CPI 28 involving Phe12 and Phe65 is similarly weakened. When contacts in the hydrophobic pockets are weakened, the alignment between the two helices in an EF-hand will resemble holoCaM, instead of apoCaM, favoring the retention of calcium ions. In addition, a holoCaM-like conformation indicates an increase in the solvent exposure of hydrophobic amino acids, which is in consistent with an increase of ANS-binding of CaM mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Xiong1">[52]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Charge-charge interactions in coarse-grained protein model</title>
        <p>Our combined experimental and computational effort highlights the importance of ionic strength and crowding effects on apoCaM's conformations. In the computational portion, we developed a novel algorithm to assign charges on the coarse-grained protein model in response to the absence and presence of calcium ions by combining the methods of coarse-grained molecular simulations, protein reconstruction, quantum chemistry, and statistical physics. We have discussed the charges computed by MOPAC with another high-level quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) at a Hartree-Fock level in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002114.s008">Text S1</xref>. The two sets of charges focusing on a part of CaM are in very good agreement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002114.s007">Figure S7</xref>) and it justified the use of semi empirical calculation for this study, given that it is beyond the capability of current computing resources to treat the entire CaM as the QM region for this study. To the best of our knowledge, there is no experimental data to compare with the calculations in our model. In addition, computer simulations including calcium have been limited to a small portion of CaM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Kobayashi1">[18]</xref> (e.g. a loop in an EF-hand) and unable to address the dynamics of an entire protein. Our method has provided a reasonable starting point to address the charge distribution on CaM in the absence and presence of calcium averaged over an ensemble when the conformational fluctuations were taken into account.</p>
        <p>In contrast to our previous coarse-grain protein model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Cheung2">[61]</xref> a Debye-Hückel potential is included in the Hamiltonian in order to investigate the electrostatic interactions under different ionic strength conditions. Debye-Hückel potential has been successfully employed in many systems where interactions between charged particles are critical to biological functions, such as protein sliding along DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Givaty1">[62]</xref>, RNA folding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Hyeon1">[32]</xref>, structures of intrinsically disordered proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Vuzman1">[60]</xref>, and dynamics of chromatin fiber formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Beard1">[63]</xref>. However, assignment of charge distribution in these systems has been approached in a qualitative fashion. For example, an arbitrary +1 or −1 can be assigned to charged amino acids such as Arg, Lys, Glu, and Asp in proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Givaty1">[62]</xref>. In other cases, charges on coarse-grained model were derived from all-atomistic force fields <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Dans1">[64]</xref>; however, charges from all-atomistic force fields have yet to include the effect of bound ion in proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Kobayashi1">[18]</xref>. It could be problematic when specific charge-charge interactions, such as the binding of calcium ions, are critical in CaM's dynamics and target recognition. In this report, we describe a new method that evaluates a reasonable charge distribution of a coarse-grained protein in order to investigate the relationship of conformational changes and the binding of ions in a protein (such as CaM).</p>
        <p>The challenge in this problem arises from the fact that the charges on atoms are dependent on the extent of their solvent exposure in an ensemble of structures. Our strategy was to compute the charge distributions of CaM in solutions by averaging over an ensemble of apoCaM or holoCaM conformations. To our best knowledge, we are the first to deploy a combined method of coarse-grained molecular simulation that produces an ensemble of structures, protein reconstruction and quantum chemistry methods that generate charges in atomistic details. Statistical physics is then employed to evaluate a reasonable average of charges on coarse-grained CaM proteins. With this combined approach, we now have a powerful tool to evaluate the conformations of apoCaM or holoCaM in response to changes in the physical-chemical nature of the environment. We are aware of potential pitfalls of this model, which we will address in future studies. These issues include the excessive consideration of electrostatic interactions reflected in both the Debye-Hückel potential and the London dispersion force (due to dipole-dipole interaction of charged particles) in the Lennard-Jones potential. Despite these concerns, we believe our new method provides the most accurate simulation based approach to address the effects of ionic strength on protein structure. At high ionic strength (e.g. [KCl] is 0.5 M), because the electrostatic interactions are sufficiently screened, the energy sum contributed from the Debye-Hückel potential is sufficiently small and negligible when compared to the sum from the Lennard-Jones potential. Indeed, under this condition, the structural analysis of apoCaM based on a Hamiltonian including both the Debye-Hückel potential and the Lennard-Jones potential converges with the structural analysis of apoCaM based on a Hamiltonian including only the Lennard-Jones potential. At low ionic strength, because the charge-charge interactions are less screened, the energy contribution the Debye-Hückel potential is only 9% of the Lennard-Jones potential. Such an increase of electrostatic interactions qualitatively reflects the correct physics between charged particles in solutions when the concentration of ions is low.</p>

Briefly, CaM was produced from the expression plasmid pCR2 that encodes a full-length cDNA of a codon-optimized version of CaM that is identical in amino acid sequence to vertebrate CaM.

          <p>Far-UV CD spectra were collected on a JASCO-815 spectrophotometer controlled by Spectra Manager software. Suprasil cuvettes with a 1.0 mm path length were used for all experiments. The spectrometer parameters were typically set to the following unless noted otherwise: band width, 1 nm; response time, 4 s; data pitch, 0.2 nm; scan speed 50 nm/min and two acquisitions were averaged for each measurement. Addition of Ficoll 70 (as crowder) contributed significantly to the background absorbance at wavelengths below 205 nm and this area of the scans was found to not be reliable for data fitting. Buffer only background scans were collected and subtracted from the experimental data for each condition. To produce thermal denaturation curves, temperature rate changes of 0.5°C/min, 1°C/min and 2°C/min were assessed at 220 nm. No significant differences were noted between these temperature rate changes and all data presented in this manuscript was collected at 1°C/min.</p>
          <p>The base buffer for these experiments was 10 mM MES, pH 7.0. To produce data for apo-CaM, EDTA was added to a final concentration of 1 mM while maintaining a pH of 7.0. For holo-CaM (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-saturated), EDTA was omitted and CaCl<sub>2</sub> was added to a final concentration of 1 mM. Ficoll-70 PM (Sigma/Aldrich) was used as a crowding agent and was varied between 100–400 mg/ml. To produce these solutions, a 400 mg/ml solution in base buffer was first prepared and residual insoluble material was removed by filtering through sequential 5 µm and 0.2 µm syringe filters. Then decreasing concentrations of Ficoll were prepared by diluting the 400 mg/ml stock solution with base buffer to the desired final concentrations. In some experiments, the impact of ionic strength was assessed by inclusion of KCl in a range between 0 and 500 mM final concentration. In initial experiments, CaM concentration was varied between 0.1 and 0.8 mg/ml. A concentration of 0.4 mg/ml (∼25 µM) was found to provide excellent signal/noise in the CD spectra and was chosen for the experiments presented in this manuscript. Each experimental condition was assayed in duplicate, and the results averaged.</p>

The Replica Exchange Method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Sugita1">[74]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Sanbonmatsu1">[75]</xref> was implemented to enhance the sampling efficiency where simulations were performed concertedly at 18 temperatures ranging from 1 k<sub>B</sub>T/ε to 1.63 k<sub>B</sub>T/ε. The exchange ratio was between 0.2 and 0.3. The integration time step is <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002114.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002114.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (m is the mass of particle, σ is the van der Waals' radius of the amino acid residues and ε is the solvent-mediated interaction energy). The data is sampled at every 1000 integration time step. Each exchange was attempted at every 400τ<sub>L</sub>. At least 40000 statistically uncorrelated data points were collected at each temperature. Thermodynamic properties and errors were calculated using the weighted histogram analysis method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002114-Chodera1">[76]</xref>.</p>
