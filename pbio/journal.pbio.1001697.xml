<p>During notochord formation in chordate embryos, the transcription factor Brachyury employs different regulatory strategies to ensure the sequential activation of downstream genes and thereby the deployment of a specific developmental program at the right time and place.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>The appearance of the notochord represented a milestone in Deuterostome evolution. The notochord is necessary for the development of the chordate body plan and for the formation of the vertebral column and numerous organs. It is known that the transcription factor Brachyury is required for notochord formation in all chordates, and that it controls transcription of a large number of target genes. However, studies of the structure of the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory modules (CRMs) through which this control is exerted are complicated in vertebrates by the genomic complexity and the pan-mesodermal expression territory of <italic>Brachyury</italic>. We used the ascidian <italic>Ciona</italic>, in which the single-copy Brachyury is notochord-specific and CRMs are easily identifiable, to carry out a systematic characterization of Brachyury-downstream notochord CRMs. We found that <italic>Ciona</italic> Brachyury (Ci-Bra) controls most of its targets directly, through non-palindromic binding sites that function either synergistically or individually to activate early- and middle-onset genes, respectively, while late-onset target CRMs are controlled indirectly, via transcriptional intermediaries. These results illustrate how a transcriptional regulator can efficiently shape a shallow gene regulatory network into a multi-tiered transcriptional output, and provide insights into the mechanisms that establish temporal read-outs of gene expression in a fast-developing chordate embryo.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Transcription factors control where and when gene expression is switched on by binding to specific stretches of DNA known as <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory modules (CRMs). In this study, we investigated the architecture and composition of CRMs that direct gene expression in the notochord—a transient rod-like structure found in all embryos that belong to the phylum chordata, which includes humans. Here we used the sea squirt <italic>Ciona</italic>, a simple chordate, and analyzed how the transcription factor Brachyury ensures the appropriate deployment of its target genes at specific times during the sequential steps of notochord formation. We compared CRMs found in different notochord genes downstream of Brachyury, expecting to find genes associated with greater numbers of Brachyury binding sites to be expressed at higher levels. To our surprise, we found instead that a higher number of functional Brachyury binding sites is typical of CRMs associated with genes that are expressed early in notochord development, while single-site CRMs are characteristic of genes that are turned on during the intermediate stages of this process. Finally, CRMs associated with genes expressed late in notochord development do not contain functional Brachyury binding sites but are controlled by Brachyury indirectly, through the action of intermediary transcription factors. These differences explain how a transcription factor that is present at all stages in a certain cell type can generate a sequential transcriptional output of gene expression.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The transcription factor Brachyury plays a paramount role in mesoderm formation in animals with widely diverse body plans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Kusch1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Smith1">[2]</xref>. In chordate embryos ranging from sea squirts to mice, Brachyury is required for the formation of the notochord from axial mesoderm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Chiba1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Wilkinson1">[4]</xref>. In addition to its prominent function in notochord development, Brachyury has recently been shown to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition when over-expressed in human carcinoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Fernando1">[5]</xref> and it has been described as a causative agent of chordomas, human tumors of presumed notochordal origin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Yang1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Nibu1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>Brachyury is believed to exert its multifaceted role by controlling the transcription of a large number of downstream effectors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Kispert1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Vidigal1">[10]</xref>. This point is proven by studies in various systems, including ascidians, zebrafish, mouse, and chordoma cell lines, all showing that Brachyury binds hundreds of genomic loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Takahashi1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Nelson1">[15]</xref>. Although genome-wide studies have added numerous candidates to the list of mesodermal genes whose activity is influenced by Brachyury, the specific <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mechanisms through which this factor performs its crucial function in notochord formation are still in need of elucidation. This is mainly due to the fact that detailed studies of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory modules (CRMs) are complicated in vertebrate model systems by a number of intrinsic experimental limitations, including the early pan-mesodermal expression of Brachyury, genomic complexity, scarce accessibility of the notochord, slow embryonic development, and laborious transgenic protocols. However, in the ascidian <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>, an invertebrate chordate, expression of the single-copy <italic>Brachyury</italic> (<italic>Ci-Bra</italic>) gene is restricted to notochord cells by the action of the transcriptional repressor <italic>Ciona</italic> Snail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Fujiwara1">[16]</xref>. In addition, compared to other chordates, the <italic>Ciona</italic> model system is characterized by a compact, fully sequenced genome, a readily distinguishable notochord, fast development, and ease of transgenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Davidson1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Passamaneck1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>The specificity of <italic>Ci-Bra</italic> expression in notochord cells has provided a unique experimental advantage for the initial identification of over 50 validated <italic>Ciona</italic> genes controlled by this transcriptional activator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Takahashi1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-DiGregorio1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Kugler1">[25]</xref>. More recently, the number of potential Ci-Bra target genes has surged to over 2,000 following genome-wide studies of chromatin occupancy by this factor in early embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Kubo1">[13]</xref>. These observations have led to the assumption that Ci-Bra presides over a “shallow” gene network and controls the majority of its targets directly. In support of this view, the notochord CRMs associated with two early-onset Ci-Bra downstream genes, <italic>Ci-tropomyosin-like</italic> (<italic>Ci-trop</italic>) and <italic>Ci-leprecan</italic>, have been found to be controlled by Ci-Bra directly, through non-palindromic binding sites that share the consensus sequence <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TNNCAC</named-content> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-DiGregorio1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Dunn1">[26]</xref>. Remarkably, however, even though transcripts for Ci-Bra appear in notochord cells from the 64-cell stage and persist throughout embryogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Corbo1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Yasuo1">[28]</xref>, many of its <italic>bona fide</italic> target genes are sequentially activated at various developmental stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Hotta1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Kugler1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Hotta3">[29]</xref>. The sequential deployment of Ci-Bra targets is crucial to ensure that the morphogenetic steps that lead to notochord formation progress seamlessly. As a result, within ∼8 h, notochord cells transition smoothly through invagination, convergent extension, cell-shape changes, lumen matrix secretion, and tube formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Dong1">[30]</xref>.</p>
<p>We sought to uncover how Ci-Bra establishes this sequential transcriptional output, and to this aim we analyzed the architecture and functional requirements of the notochord CRMs associated with a representative suite of Ci-Bra downstream genes expressed at different stages of notochord development. Upon completion of these analyses, the newly discovered <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mechanisms were used to identify notochord CRMs from still uncharacterized Ci-Bra downstream genes and to predict their temporal onset of expression. The <italic>in vivo</italic> occupancy of the CRMs directly controlled by Ci-Bra was assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. This investigation yielded an evolutionarily conserved consensus sequence shared by functional Brachyury binding sites, led to a classification of the direct Ci-Bra target CRMs into different groups, and uncovered a relay mechanism that ensures the activation of late-onset Ci-Bra targets. We propose that these <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory strategies concertedly create a differential temporal read-out of the steady transcriptional input provided by Brachyury.</p>

<p>The expression patterns of numerous notochord genes that are likely controlled by Ci-Bra have been described in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Takahashi1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Hotta1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Hotta2">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Kugler1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-JosEdwards1">[31]</xref>. In this study we used whole-mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (WMISH) to precisely determine the onset of notochord gene expression for a subset of <italic>bona fide</italic> Ci-Bra target genes for which this information was missing or incomplete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g001">Figures 1A–1O</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001697.s001">S1</xref>).

<title>Identification of Notochord CRMs Associated with Representative Ci-Bra Targets</title>
<p>We aimed at identifying the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mechanisms responsible for the differences observed in the developmental onset among Ci-Bra-downstream genes. To accomplish this goal, we employed a position-biased cloning strategy to identify notochord CRMs located within the genomic loci of <italic>bona fide</italic> Ci-Bra transcriptional targets representative of the early, middle and late-onset groups. Genomic fragments ranging from 1 to 3.7 kb were PCR-amplified from the 5′-flanking regions of 17 Ci-Bra target genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001697.s002">Figures S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001697.s003">S3</xref>), accounting for a total of ∼43 kb of <italic>C. intestinalis</italic> genomic DNA. The size and genomic location of the initial fragments were selected on the basis of previously published work, which has shown that <italic>Ciona</italic> CRMs are compact sequences that frequently lie either in the 5′-flanking region or in the first intron of the gene with which they are associated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Kusakabe1">[33]</xref>.</p>
<p>Each fragment was cloned into the pFBΔSP6 vector upstream of the <italic>Ci-FoxA-a</italic> basal promoter region fused to <italic>LacZ</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-OdaIshii1">[24]</xref> and tested <italic>in vivo</italic> for <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory activity by electroporation in <italic>Ciona</italic> zygotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-DiGregorio2">[34]</xref>. Ten of the 17 genomic fragments were able to activate gene expression in notochord cells; of these, five, <italic>Ci-Noto1</italic>, <italic>Ci-Noto8</italic>, <italic>Ci-Noto9</italic>, <italic>Ci-β4GalT</italic>, and <italic>Ci-ERM</italic>, map to larger genomic regions that have been reported to display notochord activity by a parallel study from another group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Johnson1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Takahashi2">[36]</xref>. In the majority of cases, the CRMs that we identified also directed expression in other tissues in addition to the notochord (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001697.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Of the remaining seven genomic regions, five, two of which from the same locus (<italic>Ci-Noto3</italic>), were found to contain CRMs active in tissues other than the notochord; the patterns of activity exhibited by some of these fragments partially recapitulated the expression of their neighboring genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001697.s003">Figure S3</xref>). In sum, of the 17 loci that were surveyed, eight harbored a notochord CRM near their 5′-end. In addition to these, one gene, <italic>Ci-Noto5</italic>, was found to contain a notochord CRM within its coding region, ∼9 kb downstream of its transcription start site, while the minimal functional sequences for <italic>Ci-ACL</italic> were found within its third intron.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Ci-Bra Directly Controls a Subset of Notochord CRMs through Multiple Binding Sites</title>
<p>The characterization of minimal notochord CRMs was achieved through the analysis of sequence-unbiased serial truncations of the initial genomic fragments. Here we define as “minimal CRMs” those enhancer sequences, usually ranging from 65 to ∼300 bp, that are still able to direct a consistent, clearly detectable notochord staining <italic>in vivo</italic>. Once identified, the minimal CRMs were subjected to sequence-biased (i.e., binding site-specific) individual and combined point-mutation analyses. Putative binding sites were identified by scanning the sequences of each CRM with previously published consensus binding sites for <italic>Ciona</italic> notochord transcription factors, as well as using available databases. In particular, we used the consensus sequence <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TNNCAC</named-content> to identify putative Ci-Bra binding sites, on the basis of previously published observations in <italic>Ciona</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-DiGregorio1">[21]</xref> as well as in other chordates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Casey1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Conlon1">[38]</xref>.</p>
<p>We first attempted the dissection of the <italic>Ci-pk</italic> upstream region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001697.s002">Figure S2</xref>). We found that the 1.2-kb <italic>Ci-pk</italic> notochord CRM that we had identified is enriched in putative Ci-Bra binding sites with the generic <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TNNCAC</named-content> core sequence (15 versus &lt;5 expected by random occurrence). However, this notochord CRM relies not only upon the numerous putative Ci-Bra binding sites that are found in its distal region, but also on additional sequences located in its proximal region (unpublished data). This structural feature prevented the isolation and further dissection of minimal sequences required for the function of this CRM.</p>
<p>In the case of <italic>Ci-thrombospondin 3</italic> (<italic>Ci-thbs3</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Kugler1">[25]</xref>, through serial truncations, we were able to reduce the original 1.96-kb genomic region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001697.s002">Figure S2</xref>) to a 116-bp minimal notochord CRM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The minimal 116-bp <italic>Ci-thbs3</italic> notochord CRM contains four Ci-Bra binding sites (numbered T1–4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), which do not affect notochord activity when individually mutagenized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g002">Figure 2A–2D</xref>). However, when three of these sites (T2, T3, and T4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) are mutated in conjunction, their synergistic activity becomes evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g002">Figure 2E–2G</xref>). These results are quantified in the graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g002">Figure 2H</xref>. In particular, the double mutations of the T2 and T4 sites, which share the same core sequence <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TCGCAC</named-content>, and of the T2 and T3 sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g002">Figure 2E, 2H</xref>, and unpublished data) leave only very little notochord activity (red arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). However, only the triple mutation of sites T2, T3, and T4 completely inactivates the CRM in notochord cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g002">Figure 2G and 2H</xref>). In general, we observed that mutations attacking the “CAC” sequence were usually more effective than the mutations that changed the “T” in the <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TNNCAC</named-content> core (unpublished data); hence these mutations were used for all Ci-Bra binding sites analyzed.</p>

<title>Notochord CRMs Controlled by Ci-Bra through Two Cooperative Binding Sites</title>
<p>Another subset of notochord CRMs were also found to require multiple Ci-Bra binding sites for their activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g003">Figure 3</xref>). These notochord CRMs are associated with the genomic loci of <italic>Ci-FCol1</italic> and <italic>Ci-Noto5</italic> and contain Ci-Bra binding sites of various core sequences. The <italic>Ci-FCol1</italic> notochord CRM was originally identified as part of a larger <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory region, spanning 2.2 kb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001697.s002">Figure S2</xref>), which also harbors muscle and endoderm CRMs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Kugler2">[39]</xref>. Truncation analyses allowed the identification of a 65-bp minimal CRM, which contains three Ci-Bra binding sites that were individually mutagenized to assess their respective roles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g003">Figure 3A–3F</xref>). Mutation of the distal-most site, with a <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TTTCAC</named-content> core, had little or no effect on <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g003">Figure 3C and 3G</xref>), but when similar mutations were introduced in the centrally located Ci-Bra binding site, with a <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TATCAC</named-content> sequence, a reduction of notochord activity was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g003">Figure 3D and 3G</xref>).

<p>The <italic>Ci-Noto5</italic> notochord CRM, which appeared to be located in the 5′-flanking region of this gene according to outdated gene models, is instead contained in an intron of gene model KH.L153.32 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001697.s002">Figure S2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Satou1">[40]</xref>. The minimal 83-bp <italic>Ci-Noto5</italic> notochord CRM contains two Ci-Bra binding sites at its extremities and a centrally located putative Fox binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g003">Figure 3H</xref>) with a <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TRTTTAY</named-content> core. This sequence was examined because it is shared with the functional Ci-FoxA-a site that is required to activate the <italic>Ci-tune</italic> notochord CRM synergistically with Ci-Bra <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Passamaneck2">[41]</xref>. Interestingly, none of the individual mutations of either Ci-Bra or Ci-Fox binding sites had any detectable effect on the <italic>Ci-Noto5</italic> CRM notochord activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g003">Figure 3I–3L</xref>); however, the combined mutation of both Ci-Bra binding sites completely abolished staining in notochord cells, leaving the activity in mesenchyme cells intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g003">Figure 3M</xref>).

<title>Ci-Bra Controls a Subset of Notochord CRMs through Single Binding Sites</title>
<p><italic>Ci-Noto1</italic> becomes detectable in notochord precursors at the late gastrula/early neural plate stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Hotta1">[22]</xref>). Its notochord expression pattern is recapitulated by a 2.1-kb genomic fragment from its 5′-flanking region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001697.s002">Figure S2</xref>). We reduced this fragment through progressive truncations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>) and found that the 170-bp minimal notochord CRM contains putative binding sites for proteins of the Fox, Ets, and ROR transcription factor families. However, differently from the minimal CRMs described thus far, the 170-bp <italic>Ci-Noto1</italic> CRM contains only one putative Ci-Bra binding site. Since previous work had shown that in addition to Ci-FoxA-a and other Fox genes, various members of the Ets and ROR transcription factor families are expressed in the notochord <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Imai1">[42]</xref>, we individually mutagenized these putative binding sites within the 170-bp CRM; however, no reduction of notochord staining was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Instead, the mutation of the single Ci-Bra binding site caused complete loss of notochord activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g004">Figure 4A and 4D</xref>). Considering the fact that <italic>Ci-Noto1</italic> was identified, along with numerous other genes, in a subtractive screen between wild-type and Ci-Bra-overexpressing embryos, we co-electroporated this construct along with <italic>Ci-FoxA-a&gt;Bra</italic>, the construct that was used to induce mis- and over-expression of <italic>Ci-Bra</italic> in endoderm, central nervous system (CNS), and notochord through the <italic>Ci-FoxA-a</italic> promoter region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Takahashi1">[11]</xref>, to test whether the 170-bp CRM was responsive to the ectopic expression of Ci-Bra. These experiments demonstrated that the 170-bp CRM is ectopically activated by the misexpression of Ci-Bra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), and that the mutation of the Ci-Bra site abolished this response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g004">Figure 4D and 4E</xref>). To further validate these results, the same mutation of the Ci-Bra binding site was introduced into a longer version (1.1-kb) of the CRM, which contains additional Ci-Bra binding sites and directs a more robust staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). Even within this broader context, the mutation of the single Ci-Bra site was still sufficient to completely obliterate notochord activity, leaving the staining in the CNS and in both papillary and tail neurons unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g004">Figure 4G</xref>). This result rules out the possibility that Ci-Bra binding sites found in the longer sequence might be able to compensate for the mutation of the main Ci-Bra binding site, and reinforces the observation that the <italic>Ci-Noto1</italic> CRM relies for activity on a single site.</p>

<p>In addition to the previous cases, another notochord CRM associated with a middle-onset gene, <italic>Ci-Noto4</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001697.s002">Figure S2</xref>), was found to be dependent upon an individual Ci-Bra binding site, with core sequence <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TGACAC</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g004">Figure 4M and 4N</xref>).

<p>We then estimated the distance of the functional Ci-Bra binding sites from the putative transcription start sites of their neighboring genes, in order to identify spatial constraints that might modulate the activity of the functional Ci-Bra binding sites within their genomic context. We referred to the 5′-end of the updated evidence-based KH gene models (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ghost.zool.kyoto-u.ac.jp/SearchGenomekh.html#CDNA" xlink:type="simple">http://ghost.zool.kyoto-u.ac.jp/SearchGenomekh.html#CDNA</ext-link>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Satou1">[40]</xref> as the transcription start sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001697.s010">Table S2</xref>). Even taking into account the position bias that characterized the approach used for the identification of the majority of the CRMs, which targeted the 5′-flanking regions, we observed that the Ci-Bra binding sites of single-site CRMs are predominantly located within &lt;600 bp of the respective putative transcription start sites, with the exception of the <italic>Ci-ABCC10</italic> Ci-Bra binding site, which lies at position +2.3 kb. The cooperatively acting binding sites can be found, on average, at higher distances from the transcription start sites, with the <italic>Ci-Noto5</italic> notochord CRM being located &gt;9 kb downstream of the <italic>Ci-Noto5</italic> transcription start site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001697.s010">Table S2</xref>). These findings do not reveal evident recurring intervals or other architectural constraints, suggesting that Ci-Bra might be able to activate transcription from its target CRMs regardless of their location within the genomic loci.</p>

<title>Two Ci-Bra-Downstream Minimal Notochord CRMs Are Devoid of Ci-Bra Binding Sites</title>
<p>The <italic>Ci-ACL</italic> CRM was first identified as a 2.15-kb fragment from the 5′-flanking region of the <italic>Ci-ACL</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001697.s002">Figure S2</xref>). This region was subsequently reduced through serial truncations to a 215-bp notochord-specific CRM, which differs from the CRMs previously described since it is devoid of apparent Ci-Bra/T-box <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TNNCAC</named-content> binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>). Among the recognizable putative binding sites that were found by scanning this sequence were two Fox sites, a Krüppel-like site and a generic homeodomain site, all of which are clustered within 40 bp at the 3′-end of the 215-bp sequence. Mutations of the putative Fox sites, both individually and combined, did not decrease notochord staining, nor did the mutation in the putative Krüppel-like binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g005">Figure 5A</xref> and unpublished data), although the truncation of the region containing both Fox sites reduced the notochord activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g005">Figure 5A and 5C</xref>). However, a mutation of 4 bp, which changes the <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">AATTAA</named-content> core binding site for homeodomain proteins to <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TTTTGC</named-content>, was sufficient to abolish over 90% of the notochord activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g005">Figure 5A and 5D</xref>). Finally, the truncation of the whole 40-bp 3′-end region of the CRM was able to completely obliterate notochord activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g005">Figure 5A and 5E</xref>). These results suggest that this 215-bp notochord CRM primarily requires a sequence that resembles the binding site for transcription factors of the homeodomain family for its activity; this sequence might function synergistically with sequences contained in the 40-bp 3′-end region, as well as with sequences found at the 5′-end region of the 215-bp CRM, as truncations of this region also weaken the notochord staining, although to a lesser extent (unpublished data).</p>

<p>Similar results were obtained through the dissection of the 2.47-kb notochord CRM identified in the 5′-flanking region of the late-onset gene <italic>Ci-β4GalT</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001697.s002">S2</xref>). The minimal <italic>Ci-β4GalT</italic> CRM is also devoid of Ci-Bra binding sites, although it does not apparently rely upon a homeodomain or any other clearly identifiable binding site (unpublished data). These results bring forth the possibility that Ci-Bra might also be controlling the <italic>Ci-β4GalT</italic> CRM through a transcriptional intermediary, which is likely distinct from the factor that regulates the <italic>Ci-ACL</italic> CRM. This “relay” mechanism is consistent with the late developmental onset of expression of the genes associated with these CRMs, which begin to be expressed at the late neural plate and at the neurula stage, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Hotta1">[22]</xref>).</p>

<title>The Number of Functional Ci-Bra Binding Sites in a Minimal CRM Correlates with the Developmental Onset of Its Notochord Activity</title>
<p>Once different categories of notochord CRMs were identified, we noticed that single-site minimal CRMs had, on average, the same qualitative “strength” as the multiple-site CRMs, i.e., they were able to direct intense notochord staining in a large number of embryos. Therefore, we investigated whether these different <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mechanisms rather influenced the developmental onsets of the CRMs. We selected representative CRMs associated with direct Ci-Bra targets of the early-onset and middle-onset groups, and to precisely determine their developmental onsets we re-cloned these CRMs upstream of their endogenous promoters. This strategy was employed to avoid possible interference from the early <italic>Ci-FoxA-a</italic> basal promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-DiGregorio3">[45]</xref> and to recapitulate the natural context of each CRM. We prepared these endogenous promoter constructs for the <italic>Ci-thbs3</italic> and <italic>Ci-FCol1</italic> CRMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g001">Figure 1</xref>), which are associated with early-onset genes, for <italic>Ci-Noto1</italic>, which is linked to a typical middle-onset gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Hotta1">[22]</xref>, and for <italic>Ci-β4GalT</italic> as a representative late-onset gene. Time-course experiments were carried out for these CRMs, which were all driving the <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter, in parallel with the 434-bp <italic>Ci-Bra&gt;LacZ</italic> CRM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Corbo1">[27]</xref>, which provided a control for temporal onset and notochord-specific staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g006">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>). The results for the <italic>Ci-FCol1</italic> and the <italic>Ci-Noto1</italic> time-courses are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g006">Figure 6C–6G</xref>. Embryos electroporated with these constructs were allowed to develop until the 110-cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g006">Figure 6A, 6C, and 6E</xref>), early gastrula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g006">Figure 6B, 6D, and 6F</xref>), and mid-gastrula stages (unpublished data), then subjected to WMISH using an antisense RNA <italic>LacZ</italic> probe and scored for <italic>LacZ</italic> expression in notochord precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g006">Figure 6G</xref>). The results revealed a sharp difference between the onset of activity of the <italic>Ci-FCol1</italic> CRM, which is first detected in notochord precursors at the 110-cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g006">Figure 6C and 6G</xref>) and increases at the early gastrula stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g006">Figure 6D and 6G</xref>), and the onset of <italic>Ci-Noto1</italic>, whose activity is first detected at the 110-cell stage, weakly and sporadically, in muscle precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g006">Figure 6E, 6G</xref>, and inset in 6F) and in early gastrulae increases in this territory, while remaining absent from the notochord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g006">Figure 6F and 6G</xref>). By late gastrulation, ∼10% of total <italic>Ci-Noto1</italic> transgenic embryos begin displaying 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) staining (top right inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g006">Figure 6F</xref>). Early onset similar to that of <italic>Ci-FCol1</italic> was determined through the time-course of <italic>Ci-thbs3</italic>, whose activity was also first detected at the 110-cell stage, as in the case of <italic>Ci-FCol1</italic>, although in a lower number of embryos (2.4% versus 10.4% of total stained embryos; unpublished data). A late onset was also detected for the single-site <italic>Ci-Noto4</italic> CRM, in which case X-Gal staining was detected in 5.2% of the stained neural plate embryos (unpublished data).</p>

<p>Lastly, we carried out a similar time-course experiment using the <italic>Ci-ACL</italic> and <italic>Ci-β4GalT</italic> constructs described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001697.s002">S2</xref>, and we detected X-Gal staining beginning at the neurula stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g006">Figure 6H</xref>). Comparable results were observed for the <italic>Ci-β4GalT</italic> CRM cloned on its endogenous promoter (unpublished data).</p>
<p>Together, these results indicate that notochord CRMs controlled by Ci-Bra through multiple binding sites display the earliest onset of activity, around the 110-cell stage, while the notochord CRMs controlled by Ci-Bra through a single binding site become active around the mid/late-gastrula stage, and the notochord CRMs controlled by Ci-Bra indirectly are activated around neurulation. The comparison between <italic>Ci-FCol1</italic> and <italic>Ci-thbs3</italic> shows that the number of cooperative Ci-Bra binding sites in a CRM does not influence the onset of activity. In conclusion, the time-course experiments indicate that the onsets of activity of the notochord CRMs mirror the onsets of expression of the endogenous genes associated with them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001697.s001">S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Applicability of the Newly Identified Mechanisms of <italic>cis</italic>-Regulatory Control</title>
<p>In an effort to test the general applicability of the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mechanisms identified through this study, we employed various combinations of functional Ci-Bra binding sites to rapidly identify genomic regions with the potential to function as notochord CRMs. We first scanned the genomic loci of known Ci-Bra target genes and identified various candidate enhancer regions, among which the most promising was a 560-bp fragment of the 5′-flanking sequence of <italic>Ci-ERM</italic>. This region contained four clustered Ci-Bra binding sites, two of which had identical core sequences and arrangement to those identified in the <italic>Ci-Noto5</italic> CRM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g003">Figure 3H</xref>), although with a narrower spacing (45 bp in the case of <italic>Ci-Noto5</italic>, 35 bp in the case of <italic>Ci-ERM</italic>). We cloned and tested this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g007">Figure 7A</xref>) and found that it was sufficient to direct strong notochord expression in <italic>Ciona</italic> embryos. Moreover, when the 560-bp CRM was subdivided into two fragments, we found that only the 362-bp proximal construct, containing the two Ci-Bra binding sites identical to those found in the <italic>Ci-Noto5</italic> CRM, was sufficient to direct strong notochord staining <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g007">Figure 7A and 7B</xref>). Site-directed mutations of the Ci-Bra binding sites showed that ablation of the distal-most site, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TAACAC</named-content>, did not affect notochord activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g007">Figure 7C</xref>), while the disruption of the proximal Ci-Bra binding site, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TCACAC</named-content>, was able to reduce both the intensity and the frequency of the notochord staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). However, as in the case of <italic>Ci-Noto5</italic>, the combined mutation of both Ci-Bra binding sites, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TAACAC</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TCACAC</named-content>, completely abolished notochord activity, leaving a residual mesenchyme staining and sporadic muscle staining comparable to the vector background staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g007">Figure 7E</xref> and unpublished data). Through time-course experiments, we found that the <italic>Ci-ERM</italic> CRM, once transferred to its endogenous promoter region, began its activity by early/mid-gastrulation (unpublished data).</p>

<p>As a next step, we attempted to extend these predictions to notochord CRMs which we had previously identified, and whose relationship with Ci-Bra was still unclear. We noticed that another minimal 122-bp notochord CRM, which we had identified through a separate set of experiments in the 5′-flanking region of the <italic>Ci-laminin gamma-1</italic> (<italic>Ci-lamc1</italic>) gene, was enriched in Ci-Bra binding sites and also contained a putative Fox binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g007">Figure 7F and 7G</xref>). After all these sites were separately mutagenized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g007">Figures 7F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001697.s006">S6</xref>) and the results were quantified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001697.s006">Figure S6</xref>), we found that the simultaneous mutation of two Ci-Bra binding sites, with sequences <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TCACAC</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TCGCAC</named-content>, respectively, was sufficient to completely abolish notochord activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g007">Figures 7H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001697.s006">S6</xref>), while mutations in the other Ci-Bra binding sites, including another site with an identical <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TCGCAC</named-content> core sequence but opposite orientation with respect to the active site, had no visible effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001697.s006">Figure S6</xref>). These data strongly suggested that <italic>Ci-lamc1</italic> could be a notochord gene under the transcriptional control of Ci-Bra. To prove this hypothesis we studied <italic>Ci-lamc1</italic> expression in embryos carrying the <italic>Ci-FoxA-a&gt;Bra</italic> transgene and observed that <italic>Ci-lamc1</italic> is highly responsive to ectopically expressed Ci-Bra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g007">Figure 7I and 7J</xref>), as is its notochord CRM (inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g007">Figure 7J</xref>). Of note, after this analysis had been completed, <italic>Ci-lamc1</italic> was also reported as an early Ci-Bra target by another study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Kubo1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>Another notochord CRM had been identified in the genomic locus of <italic>Ciona ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 10</italic> (<italic>Ci-ABCC10</italic>) through a screen of random <italic>Ciona</italic> genomic fragments (unpublished data). Interestingly, this is the first evidence, to our knowledge, of the expression of this transporter protein in the notochord. We had previously narrowed the original 2.146-kb sequence to a 772-bp fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g007">Figure 7K, 7L</xref>, and unpublished data) via sequence-unbiased truncations, and sequence inspection revealed that this shorter CRM fragment contained six putative Ci-Bra binding sites (listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001697-t001">Table 1</xref>). We focused the point-mutation analyses on the two sites that had been found to be required for the activity of other notochord CRMs. Surprisingly, the mutation of the <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TGGCAC</named-content> site, which is necessary for the <italic>Ci-Noto1</italic> and <italic>Ci-Noto9</italic> CRMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g004">Figure 4</xref>), did not affect notochord staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g007">Figure 7K</xref> and unpublished data), while the mutation of the distal <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TAACAC</named-content> site was sufficient to completely abolish notochord activity, but left the mesenchyme staining unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g007">Figure 7K, 7L</xref>, and unpublished data). On the basis of its dependence upon a single functional Ci-Bra binding site, we predicted this notochord CRM to behave as a middle-onset. To verify this point, we cloned the CRM upstream of its endogenous promoter region and carried out time-course experiments, as previously described. Through WMISH (unpublished data) and X-Gal staining, we determined that the onset of activity of this weak CRM is around the neural plate/early neurula stage, when notochord activity is detected in &gt;50% of the stained embryos (unpublished data); notochord staining increases at the initial tailbud stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g007">Figure 7M</xref>). This is consistent with the timing of <italic>Ci-ABCC10</italic> transcript accumulation in the notochord (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001697.s007">Figure S7</xref>). To assess the hierarchical relationship of <italic>Ci-ABCC10</italic> with Ci-Bra, we studied <italic>Ci-ABCC10</italic> expression in embryos carrying the <italic>Ci-FoxA-a&gt;Bra</italic> transgene and found that this gene is ectopically expressed in response to the ectopic expression of <italic>Ci-Bra</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g007">Figure 7N and 7O</xref>); a similar behavior was exhibited by the <italic>Ci-ABCC10</italic> notochord CRM in <italic>Ci-FoxA-a&gt;Bra</italic> embryos (inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g007">Figure 7O</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>In Vivo</italic> Occupancy of the Newly Identified Notochord CRMs by Ci-Bra</title>
<p>We had tested in previous studies some of the putative Ci-Bra binding sites identified in notochord CRMs for their ability to be bound <italic>in vitro</italic> by Ci-Bra via electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001697-t001">Table 1</xref>); here we assessed the occupancy of these sites <italic>in vivo</italic> through ChIP assays on mid-tailbud stage embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g008">Figure 8A</xref>) using a polyclonal Ci-Bra antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g008">Figure 8B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Aihara1">[46]</xref>. To test the specificity of the binding by Ci-Bra, we carried out ChIP over a 10-kb stretch encompassing part of the <italic>Ci-FCol1</italic> locus and its neighboring gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). The results show that the highest peak of Ci-Bra occupancy indeed corresponds to the <italic>Ci-FCol1</italic> notochord CRM (red rectangle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g008">Figure 8A</xref>); these results are comparable to those previously published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Kubo1">[13]</xref>, although not all peaks of Ci-Bra occupancy coincide (unpublished data), likely because our experiments were carried out on embryos at a much later stage (mid-tailbud versus 110-cell). We then proceeded with the ChIP assays of the remaining notochord CRMs, along with adequate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g008">Figure 8C</xref> and unpublished data). The results demonstrated that in addition to the <italic>Ci-tune</italic> minimal CRM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Passamaneck2">[41]</xref>, which served as one of our positive controls, the <italic>Ci-Noto1</italic>, <italic>Ci-Noto4</italic>, <italic>Ci-Noto5</italic>, <italic>Ci-Noto9</italic>, <italic>Ci-FCol1</italic>, <italic>Ci-lamc1</italic>, and <italic>Ci-thbs3</italic> CRMs are also bound <italic>in vivo</italic> by Ci-Bra. On the other hand, the minimal <italic>Ci-ACL</italic> notochord CRM, which we have shown to be devoid of Ci-Bra binding sites, was not specifically recognized, similar to the negative control used for these experiments, <italic>18S rRNA</italic> gene. These results confirm the findings obtained through the analysis of individual CRMs. No direct relationship was observed between the number of functional Ci-Bra sites and the enrichment of the immunoprecipitated DNA over the input; this might be due to the size of the immunoprecipitated fragments (∼200–800 bp on average), which likely contain additional sequences that are bound by Ci-Bra but are not required for the activity of the minimal CRMs.</p>

Also in the case of <italic>Ci-Noto8</italic>, the main Ci-Bra binding site was not conserved (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TAACAC</named-content> to <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TAACAT</named-content>), although some of the other putative binding sites found in the CRM were shared between the two <italic>Ciona</italic> species (unpublished data). The <italic>Ci-thbs3</italic> CRM displays a complete conservation of one of its three cooperative sites, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TAACAC</named-content>, but disruption of the other two sites, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TCGCAC</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TGGCAC</named-content>.

These observations correlate with the results of the point mutation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g003">Figure 3B–3E</xref>), which shows that the mutation of the most conserved site, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TAACAC</named-content>, is more effective than the mutation of the less conserved one. The <italic>Ci-ERM</italic> and <italic>Ci-ACL</italic> CRMs showed scattered interspecific conservation, although not in the regions directly corresponding to the functional Ci-Bra binding sites or the putative homeodomain binding site, respectively (unpublished data). Finally, for <italic>Ci-Noto5</italic> we did not find any informative sequence alignment in the regions of the <italic>C. savignyi</italic> locus corresponding to the <italic>C. intestinalis</italic> CRM, and the minimal <italic>Ci-ABCC10</italic>, <italic>Ci-β4GalT</italic>, and <italic>Ci-lamc1</italic> CRMs were poorly conserved overall (unpublished data).</p>

<title>Changes in the Number of Functional Ci-Bra Binding Sites Are Sufficient to Convert an Early-Onset into a Middle-Onset Notochord CRM</title>
<p>Our findings on multiple and single-site CRMs directly controlled by Ci-Bra imply that the conversion of a multiple-site CRM to a single-site should suffice to delay the developmental onset of its activity, thus turning it from an early-onset to a middle-onset CRM. To prove this point, we performed time-course experiments using the <italic>Ci-lamc1</italic> notochord CRM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g007">Figures 7F–7J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001697.s006">S6</xref>), after re-cloning it upstream of its endogenous promoter. On the basis of its reliance upon two functional Ci-Bra sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g007">Figure 7F</xref>), we predicted this CRM to display an early onset of activity. In support of this hypothesis, &gt;80% of mid-gastrula embryos electroporated with this construct showed X-Gal staining in notochord precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g009">Figure 9A and 9F</xref>), indicating that by the early gastrula stage transcription of <italic>LacZ</italic> directed by the <italic>Ci-lamc1</italic> CRM/promoter has already begun. This latter inference was confirmed by <italic>LacZ</italic> WMISH experiments (unpublished data).

By the neural plate stage, the number of embryos showing notochord staining had significantly increased in both mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g009">Figure 9E, 9F</xref>, and unpublished data), and had practically reached the levels observed in mid-tailbud stage embryos for these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001697-g009">Figure 9F</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Fast-developing embryos usually rely upon maternally stored transcripts and proteins and on shallow gene regulatory networks for the rapid completion of their early morphogenetic processes. For these reasons, it is generally assumed that in ascidians most transcription factors control their target genes directly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Jeffery1">[47]</xref>. Nevertheless, since the initial identification of the first Ci-Bra target genes, their staggered pattern of transcriptional activation throughout development suggested that Ci-Bra controls these genes through different <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mechanisms. This study presents a first validation of this hypothesis and shows the remarkable variety of alternative mechanisms employed by Brachyury to control its direct and indirect effectors in a simple chordate. In addition, it outlines a connection between different modes of transcriptional regulation and the temporal onset of the genes that they control.</p>

<title>Variability in the Developmental Onsets of Expression of Ci-Bra Targets in the Notochord</title>
<p>Among the validated Ci-Bra targets expressed in the notochord, the earliest is the planar cell polarity gene <italic>Ci-pk</italic>, which is required for the establishment of notochord cell polarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Jiang1">[48]</xref> and for intercalation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Hotta2">[23]</xref>. <italic>Ci-ERM</italic>, which is first detected in the notochord a few cell divisions after <italic>Ci-pk</italic>, has been shown to be required for notochord elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Hotta2">[23]</xref> and lumen formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Dong2">[49]</xref>. <italic>Ci-Noto4</italic> is first detected in notochord cells at the neural plate stage, and it is also required for midline intercalation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Yamada1">[50]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-JosEdwards2">[51]</xref>, as is the late-onset gene <italic>Ci-ACL</italic>, which plays a role also in medio-lateral polarization of notochord cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Hotta2">[23]</xref>. <italic>Ci-lamc1</italic> encodes a putative ortholog of human Laminin gamma 1, which is also found in the notochord remnants of the intervertebral discs in human embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Wiksten1">[52]</xref>. <italic>Ci-ABCC10</italic> had not been previously detected in notochord cells, and encodes an anionic pump that might be involved in lumen formation, the terminal step of notochord differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Dong1">[30]</xref>.

<title>The Notochord CRMs Directly Controlled by Ci-Bra Fall into Different Classes</title>
<p>The dissection of notochord CRMs associated with representative Ci-Bra targets allowed their categorization on the basis of the mechanisms employed by Ci-Bra to control their minimal sequences. We found that four CRMs, <italic>Ci-Noto1</italic>, <italic>Ci-Noto9</italic>, <italic>Ci-Noto4</italic>, and <italic>Ci-ABCC10</italic>, are controlled by Ci-Bra through individual binding sites, which are necessary to elicit notochord activity and to mediate the response to ectopically expressed Ci-Bra. These Ci-Bra binding sites have either the core sequence <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TGGCAC</named-content> (<italic>Ci-Noto1</italic> and <italic>Ci-Noto9</italic>) or <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TGACAC</named-content> (<italic>Ci-Noto4</italic>), while the Ci-Bra binding site in the <italic>Ci-ABCC10</italic> CRM has a <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TAACAC</named-content> core. Of note, our results show that in the case of these CRMs, additional Ci-Bra binding sites that might be present in the vicinity of the single functional site are unable to compensate for its loss.</p>
<p>In addition to single-site Ci-Bra target CRMs, we have also identified direct targets that are controlled through two cooperative Ci-Bra binding sites, <italic>Ci-FCol1</italic>, <italic>Ci-Noto5</italic>, <italic>Ci-ERM</italic>, and <italic>Ci-lamc1</italic>. This class also includes the previously characterized <italic>Ci-leprecan</italic> notochord CRM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Dunn1">[26]</xref> and unpublished data), the <italic>Ci-trop</italic> notochord CRM, which mainly relies upon a <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TCGCAC</named-content> site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-DiGregorio1">[21]</xref> but also on an adjacent <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TATCAC</named-content> site, which alone is not sufficient for activity (our unpublished results). Finally, the <italic>Ci-thbs3</italic> CRM is controlled by Ci-Bra through three binding sites and the <italic>Ci-pk</italic> CRM likely relies upon multiple Ci-Bra binding sites and additional sequences.</p>
<p>Through the analysis of the <italic>Ci-tune</italic> notochord CRM, we had previously identified another class of direct Ci-Bra target CRMs, which are controlled synergistically by Ci-Bra and Ci-FoxA-a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Passamaneck2">[41]</xref>. Notably, in the present study, we found that most notochord CRMs contained putative Ci-FoxA-a binding sites in addition to the Ci-Bra binding sites. However, site-directed mutation analyses of the Ci-FoxA-a binding sites that were related to the sites found in the <italic>Ci-tune</italic> CRM (TRTTTAY core) did not reveal an evident role in notochord activity. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that these sites might be used <italic>in vivo</italic> by Fox proteins, which are known to possess a pioneer chromatin-opening activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Cirillo1">[54]</xref>, to increase the accessibility of the CRMs within their native genomic context, or that some divergent Fox binding sites might be contributing to notochord activity.</p>

The present study revealed a considerable heterogeneity in the functional sequences found in direct Ci-Bra targets, as well as the lack of considerable homology in the sequences flanking Ci-Bra binding sites with identical cores. Nevertheless, most of the Ci-Bra functional sequences identified by this and our previous studies conform, albeit to a different extent, to the 12-bp consensus identified for Brachyenteron and vertebrate Brachyury proteins by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Kusch2">[44]</xref>, with the Ci-Bra binding sites seeming prone to higher variability in the nucleotides more distant from the central 6-bp core sequence.</p>

However, like previously characterized Ci-Bra target CRMs, the CRMs reported here predominantly rely upon half-sites.

<title>Structural Features of Predicted Notochord CRMs: Context-Dependent Activity and Architectural Flexibility of Functional Ci-Bra Binding Sites</title>
<p>We tested the general validity of the molecular mechanisms identified through these studies by using the sequences of the functional Ci-Bra binding sites to scan either the loci of other <italic>bona fide</italic> Ci-Bra target genes, or other notochord CRMs identified through cloning of random genomic sequences. Among the interesting clusters of putative Ci-Bra sites that we identified within these sequences, a region found upstream of <italic>Ci-ERM</italic> showed a striking similarity with the <italic>Ci-Noto5</italic> notochord CRM and was therefore cloned and tested <italic>in vivo</italic>, and resulted capable of directing strong notochord staining. Mutation analyses showed that also this predicted CRM relies upon two Ci-Bra binding sites, whose core sequences and arrangement are identical to those of the functional <italic>Ci-Noto5</italic> sites. Of note, the expression patterns of <italic>Ci-Noto5</italic> and <italic>Ci-ERM</italic> in the notochord are remarkably similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001697.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The spacing between the Ci-Bra binding sites varies by 10 bp (35 bp for <italic>Ci-ERM</italic> and 45 bp for <italic>Ci-Noto5</italic>), a full helical turn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Makeev1">[57]</xref>, which seemed suggestive of some flexibility in their spacing. However, when we decreased the distance between the Ci-Bra binding sites in the <italic>Ci-Noto5</italic> CRM to match the spacing found in the <italic>Ci-ERM</italic> CRM, we observed a loss of notochord activity (unpublished data).</p>
<p>When we attempted to predict the functional sites of notochord CRMs identified either through random testing of genomic sequences (<italic>Ci-ABCC10</italic>) or by position-biased cloning (<italic>Ci-lamc1</italic>), again we observed a striking context-dependent difference in the functional relevance of binding sites with identical cores. In fact, in the case of the <italic>Ci-ABCC10</italic> notochord CRM the site with the <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TGGCAC</named-content> core, which alone is necessary for the activity of both <italic>Ci-Noto1</italic> and <italic>Ci-Noto9</italic> CRMs, turned out to be fully dispensable, while the mutation of a <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TAACAC</named-content> core site was sufficient to abolish notochord activity. Similarly, within the <italic>Ci-lamc1</italic> CRM, the mutations of two identical <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TCGCAC</named-content> core sites had very different results, with the distally located site being completely dispensable and the proximal site being highly relevant for notochord activity. Despite the context dependence and the variability in the sequence and relevance of the core Ci-Bra binding sites, a common consensus sequence for functional Ci-Bra binding sites is beginning to emerge from these results; this sequence displays evolutionary conservation with the 12-bp sequence bound <italic>in vitro</italic> by both chordate and protostome Brachyury orthologs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Kusch2">[44]</xref>.</p>

<title>Identification of Minimal Notochord CRMs Lacking Ci-Bra Binding Sites</title>
<p>In addition to identifying notochord CRMs directly targeted by Ci-Bra, this study has also led to the discovery of two notochord CRMs that are physically associated with <italic>bona fide</italic> Ci-Bra target genes but are devoid of Ci-Bra binding sites in their minimal sequences. These CRMs are associated with two late-onset Ci-Bra targets, <italic>Ci-ACL</italic>, which is activated in notochord at low levels beginning around the late neural plate stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Hotta1">[22]</xref> and our unpublished results) and <italic>Ci-β4GalT</italic>, which is detected in notochord cells starting at the neurula stage. Therefore it seems conceivable that these minimal CRMs might be controlled by Ci-Bra indirectly through transcriptional intermediaries. We have previously shown that transcription factors of different families are expressed in the <italic>Ciona</italic> notochord following the onset of Ci-Bra expression, and that the expression of several of these genes is controlled by Ci-Bra <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Kugler1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-JosEdwards1">[31]</xref>; these reports, along with the results of genome-wide screens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Kubo1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Imai1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Imai2">[58]</xref> provide a number of candidate activators for these CRMs.</p>
<p>The lack of binding by the anti-Ci-Bra antibody that we observed through the ChIP assays suggests that in addition to lacking canonical Ci-Bra binding sites, the <italic>Ci-ACL</italic> notochord CRM is not likely to contain low-affinity, non-canonical Ci-Bra binding sites such as the “type B” sites described in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which are occupied by Brachyenteron but are unable per se to activate transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Kusch2">[44]</xref>. Rather, this might be the case for the <italic>Ci-β4GalT</italic> CRM, which yielded a relatively noisy ChIP signal (unpublished data). These latter results are consistent with reports in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that show that transcription factors can bind up to thousands of genomic regions which often are not involved in transcriptional events and might be non-functional <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Li1">[59]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Fisher1">[60]</xref>.</p>

<title>Distinct <italic>cis</italic>-Regulatory Mechanisms Correlate with the Sequential Developmental Onsets of Notochord Gene Expression</title>
<p>The results of this study indicate that the notochord CRMs controlled by Ci-Bra through multiple sites are frequently linked to genes that begin to be expressed early during notochord development, around the early/mid-gastrula stage, and are usually expressed at high levels in these cells. Instead, the notochord CRMs controlled by Ci-Bra through single sites are usually associated with genes that are expressed in the notochord at low levels starting around the late gastrula/neural plate stage. This hypothesis is confirmed by the observation that the removal of one of the functional Ci-Bra binding sites from the multiple-site <italic>Ci-lamc1</italic> CRM results in a delay in the developmental onset of its notochord activity. One possible scenario arising from these observations suggests that by the 110-cell stage, at a time when a substantial accumulation of Ci-Bra in the nuclei is detected (our unpublished results), the synergistic binding of Ci-Bra molecules to the multiple-site CRMs might trigger faster changes in the chromatin state and in the rate of transcriptional activation, as compared to the binding to an individual main site. Hence, transcripts for genes controlled through multiple-site CRMs are detected earlier and in larger amounts than those linked to single-site CRMs. These results might enable predictions of the expression patterns of Brachyury target genes in <italic>Ciona</italic> and possibly in other chordates. To our knowledge, this represents the first report of a correlation between the number of functional Brachyury binding sites found in minimal CRMs and the onset of transcription of their target genes in a chordate. In non-chordate model systems, it is noteworthy that another transcriptional activator, the ortholog of FoxA2/HNF3beta, is able to modulate the onset of gene expression in the pharynx of the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> through binding sites with different affinity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Gaudet1">[61]</xref>. High-affinity binding sites are associated with early expression and can be activated by low levels of FoxA2/HNF3beta during early organogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Gaudet1">[61]</xref>. This mechanism therefore resembles the spatial read-outs observed in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo in response to the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral gradients of the morphogens Bicoid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Rusch1">[62]</xref> and Dorsal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001697-Ip1">[63]</xref>, respectively. Our findings on the context-dependent behavior of Ci-Bra binding sites with identical <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TNNCAC</named-content> core sequences suggest that additional sequences, rather than the core sequences per se, might be modulating the binding affinity of Ci-Bra for its sites. Preliminary evidence suggests that a subset of the <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TNNCAC</named-content> Ci-Bra binding sites found in single-site notochord CRMs share short flanking sequences, which could be responsible for their indispensable function (DSJ-E and ADG, unpublished observations).</p>
<p>We conclude that even though Ci-Bra controls several of its target genes via direct binding, this shallow branch of its gene regulatory cascade is modulated at the level of individual CRMs by the differential mechanisms identified through this study, to ultimately result in a gradated developmental response.</p>
