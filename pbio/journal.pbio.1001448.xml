      <abstract>
        <p>Dendritic cells (DCs) are essential antigen-presenting cells for the induction of immunity against pathogens. However, HIV-1 spread is strongly enhanced in clusters of DCs and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Uninfected DCs capture HIV-1 and mediate viral transfer to bystander CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells through a process termed <italic>trans</italic>-infection. Initial studies identified the C-type lectin DC-SIGN as the HIV-1 binding factor on DCs, which interacts with the viral envelope glycoproteins. Upon DC maturation, however, DC-SIGN is down-regulated, while HIV-1 capture and <italic>trans</italic>-infection is strongly enhanced via a glycoprotein-independent capture pathway that recognizes sialyllactose-containing membrane gangliosides. Here we show that the sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin 1 (Siglec-1, CD169), which is highly expressed on mature DCs, specifically binds HIV-1 and vesicles carrying sialyllactose. Furthermore, Siglec-1 is essential for <italic>trans</italic>-infection by mature DCs. These findings identify Siglec-1 as a key factor for HIV-1 spread via infectious DC/T-cell synapses, highlighting a novel mechanism that mediates HIV-1 dissemination in activated tissues.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Mature dendritic cells (mDCs) capture and store infectious HIV-1 and subsequently infect neighboring CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in lymphoid organs. This process, known as <italic>trans</italic>-infection, is a key contributor to HIV pathogenesis, but the precise mechanism and the identity of the receptor on the mDC surface that recognizes viral particles remain controversial. Although the interaction of HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins with the C-type lectin DC-SIGN has been suggested to mediate HIV-1 capture and <italic>trans</italic>-infection, later studies revealed an envelope glycoprotein-independent virus capture mechanism in mDCs. Here, we identify Siglec-1 as the surface receptor on mDCs that boosts their uptake of HIV-1 and their capacity to <italic>trans</italic>-infect CD4<sup>+</sup> cells, leading in turn to HIV-1 disease progression. Siglec-1 captures the virus by interacting with sialyllactose-containing gangliosides exposed on viral membranes. This indicates that Siglec-1 functions as a general binding molecule for any vesicle carrying sialyllactose in its membrane, including exosomes and other viruses. We suggest that this natural pathway through mDC, which would normally lead to antigen processing and presentation, has been subverted by HIV-1 for its own storage and transmission.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>HIV-1 can infect CD4<sup>+</sup> cells of the lymphoid and myeloid lineage with a strong preference for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Myeloid DCs exhibit innate resistance against HIV-1 infection. HIV-2, on the other hand, efficiently infects myeloid DCs due to its accessory viral protein Vpx, not present in HIV-1, which is able to counteract the myeloid restriction factor SAMHD1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Laguette1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Hrecka1">[2]</xref>. Despite lacking these additional target cells, HIV-1 exhibits a higher pathogenicity than HIV-2 and has dominated the global AIDS pandemic. Indeed, myeloid DCs can contribute to the spread of HIV-1 through <italic>trans</italic>-infection of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Cameron1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Geijtenbeek1">[4]</xref>. This process requires HIV-1 binding to the DC surface, viral capture and release of trapped viruses at the infectious synapse, a cell-to-cell contact zone between uninfected DCs and interacting CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which facilitates infection by locally concentrating virus and viral receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-McDonald1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Classical myeloid DCs patrol submucosal surfaces, where they capture and internalize microbial pathogens through various cell surface receptors. Pioneering studies suggested that HIV-1 is trapped by immature DCs (iDCs) in mucosal tissues through binding of its envelope glycoproteins to the C-type lectin DC-SIGN, with subsequent transfer of infectious particles to secondary lymphoid tissues, where <italic>trans</italic>-infection occurs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Geijtenbeek1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-vanKooyk1">[6]</xref>. Later reports indicated, however, that HIV-1 captured by iDCs is rapidly degraded <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Sanders1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-IzquierdoUseros1">[9]</xref>, arguing against this original “Trojan horse” hypothesis. Conversely, maturation of DCs with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a microbial product significantly augmented in the plasma of HIV-1-infected individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Brenchley1">[10]</xref>, markedly enhanced the capacity of DCs to capture HIV-1 and mediate <italic>trans</italic>-infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-McDonald1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Sanders1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-IzquierdoUseros1">[9]</xref>. These results suggested that HIV-1 capture by LPS-matured mDCs (LPS mDCs) plays an essential role in HIV-1 pathogenesis, facilitating viral spread in the densely populated lymphoid tissue, where many uninfected T cells contact virus-presenting mDCs.</p>
      <p>Other receptors besides DC-SIGN have been identified as binding factors for HIV-1 but do not explain why LPS mDC capture of HIV-1 is independent of viral glycoproteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-IzquierdoUseros1">[9]</xref>. Instead, HIV-1 capture is markedly sensitive to reductions in viral sphingolipid content <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-IzquierdoUseros2">[11]</xref> and relies on HIV incorporation of membrane gangliosides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Puryear1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-IzquierdoUseros3">[13]</xref>. Furthermore, we recently showed that sialyllactose in gangliosides serves as the viral attachment factor for LPS mDCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-IzquierdoUseros3">[13]</xref>. Since HIV-1 and cellular secreted vesicles, termed exosomes, use the same pathway for mDC capture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-IzquierdoUseros2">[11]</xref>, HIV-1 may have hijacked a pre-existing cellular route for vesicle capture to facilitate efficient transfer to multiple target cells.</p>

Most members of the family were equally expressed in LPS mDCs and ITIP mDCs, and this was also observed for the maturation marker CD86 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). <italic>DC-SIGN</italic>, <italic>SIGLEC7</italic>, and <italic>SIGLEC14</italic> were slightly up-regulated in LPS mDCs, but this difference was not statistically significant for <italic>DC-SIGN</italic> and marginally significant for <italic>SIGLEC14</italic> and <italic>SIGLEC7</italic>, respectively (<italic>p</italic> = 0.03 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.04).

        <title>2. Siglec-1 Expressed in LPS mDCs Capture Distinct Ganglioside Containing Vesicles, Such as HIV-1 Viral-Like Particles, Liposomes, and Exosomes</title>
        <p>To test whether Siglec-1 is the surface molecule on LPS mDCs responsible for the capture of vesicles and viruses that carry sialyllactose-containing gangliosides in the outer leaflet of their membrane, we used a previously established FACS assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-IzquierdoUseros2">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-IzquierdoUseros3">[13]</xref>. This assay makes use of HIV-1 virus-like particles lacking the viral envelope glycoproteins and carrying a fusion of the viral structural protein Gag with eGFP (VLP<sub>HIV-Gag-eGFP</sub>). These fluorescent VLPs follow the same trafficking route as wild-type HIV-1 in LPS mDCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-IzquierdoUseros2">[11]</xref>. VLP capture of LPS mDCs was evaluated in the presence of antibodies (Abs) against different Siglecs or mannan, a C-type lectin inhibitor blocking the HIV-1 interaction with DC-SIGN. Besides Siglec-1, we included Abs against CD83, highly expressed in ITIP and LPS mDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g001">Figure 1B</xref>); Siglec-7, moderately up-regulated in LPS mDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g001">Figure 1B</xref>); and Siglec-5/14 too, due to their high homology to the V-set domain of Siglec-1. VLP capture was almost completely abolished when LPS mDCs were pre-treated with the α-Siglec-1 monoclonal Ab (mAb) 7D2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g002">Figure 2A</xref>; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001).

        <p>We have previously shown that Texas Red (tRed) labeled Large Unilamellar Vesicles (LUV) mimicking the size and lipid composition of HIV-1 and containing the ganglioside GM1 (LUV<sub>HIV-tRed</sub>) follow the same trafficking route as VLP<sub>HIV-Gag-eGFP</sub> in LPS mDCs. Binding and capture in both cases depends on the recognition of sialyllactose exposed in gangliosides of the vesicle membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-IzquierdoUseros3">[13]</xref>. Accordingly, capture of GM1-containing LUV<sub>HIV-tRed</sub> by LPS mDCs was efficiently and specifically inhibited by the α-Siglec-1 mAb 7D2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g002">Figure 2B</xref>; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001). The residual capture by 7D2-treated LPS mDCs was similar to that exhibited by untreated LPS mDCs capturing LUV<sub>HIV-tRed</sub> containing GM1 without the sialic acid group (Asialo GM1), confirming that sialic acid in the vesicle membrane is crucial for Siglec-1 recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g002">Figure 2B</xref>; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001). We extended this analysis to cellular exosomes, which also carry sialyllactose-containing gangliosides in their membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Fvrier1">[16]</xref> and can be internalized by LPS mDCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-IzquierdoUseros2">[11]</xref>. Fluorescent exosomes were efficiently captured by LPS mDCs, and this capture was almost abolished by mAb 7D2 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g002">Figure 2C</xref>; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001).</p>
        <p>Titration of the α-Siglec-1 mAb 7D2 revealed a dose-dependent inhibition of VLP capture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Specificity of the mAb 7D2–mediated inhibition was confirmed by pre-incubation of this mAb with different Siglec proteins. Pre-incubation with purified Siglec-1 completely restored VLP capture, while pre-incubation with purified Siglec-7, -5/14, or CD83 had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). Although the epitope recognized by 7D2 mAb might not constitute the actual viral binding site, since 7D2 Fab fragments did not lead to a block in VLP capture, titration with 7–239, a different α-Siglec-1 mAb, confirmed a dose-dependent inhibition of VLP capture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001448.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Hence, α-Siglec-1 mAb 7D2, raised against the four N-terminal domains of Siglec-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Hartnell1">[17]</xref>, or α-Siglec-1 mAb 7–239, raised against the full 17-domain protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Kirchberger1">[18]</xref>, specifically blocked sialyllactose-dependent LPS mDC capture of VLPs, LUVs, and exosomes, identifying Siglec-1 as the relevant recognition receptor.</p>
        <p>If Siglec-1 serves as a recognition receptor on DCs, its surface expression should correlate with their respective VLP capture ability. Capture was low in iDCs and stable over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g002">Figure 2F</xref>, left graph), while VLP capture was strongly enhanced following LPS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g002">Figure 2F</xref>, right graph). This increased VLP capture ability directly correlated with a strong up-regulation of Siglec-1 surface expression on LPS mDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g002">Figure 2F</xref>, right graph). We also performed quantitative FACS analysis to determine the absolute number of Siglec-1 Ab Binding Sites (ABS) on ITIP mDCs, iDCs, and LPS mDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). The VLP capture capacity of these distinct DC subtypes was strongly correlated with the mean number of Siglec-1 ABS expressed per cell (ρ = 0.9695; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). Furthermore, Siglec-1 expression also correlated with the relative VLP capturing capacity of LPS mDCs derived from the same donor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001448.s002">Figure S2</xref>). These experiments show a direct correlation between Siglec-1 expression on the DC surface and their respective VLP capture capacity.</p>

        <title>3. Siglec-1 Captures HIV-1 and Traffics with the Virus to the same Sac-Like Compartment</title>
        <p>To extend these observations to authentic virus, we performed similar experiments with infectious HIV-1. Again, LPS mDCs captured significantly more virus than iDCs or ITIP mDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The α-Siglec-1 mAb 7D2 inhibited HIV-1 capture of LPS mDCs by 80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g003">Figure 3A</xref>; <italic>p</italic> = 0.0019), while pre-treatment with mannan had no effect. Noteworthy, α-Siglec-1 mAbs also blocked binding of HIV-1 to LPS mDCs at 4°C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001448.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Similarly, pre-treatment of iDCs with the mAb 7D2 reduced HIV-1 capture by 60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g003">Figure 3A</xref>; <italic>p</italic> = 0.0005), indicating that even at lower surface expression levels of Siglec-1 on iDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), this receptor still constitutes an important capture moiety. Consistently, capture inhibition by mAb 7D2 was much weaker on ITIP mDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g003">Figure 3A</xref>; <italic>p</italic> = 0.001), which exhibited the lowest Siglec-1 surface expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). The effect of the mAb 7D2 on HIV-1 capture was dependent on blocking cell surface Siglec-1, as addition of the inhibitor after virus exposure had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Importantly, primary blood myeloid DCs exposed to LPS also up-regulated Siglec-1 expression levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001448.s004">Figure S4</xref>) and showed increased HIV-1 capture capacity that could be blocked by pretreatment with α-Siglec-1 mAb 7D2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g003">Figure 3C</xref>; <italic>p</italic> = 0.0022). These results strongly suggest that Siglec-1 is the molecule responsible for HIV-1 capture by DCs, especially upon triggering of Siglec-1 expression by LPS.</p>

        <p>Next, we investigated whether Siglec-1 traffics together with sialylated ligands, such as ganglioside-containing liposomes, VLPs, or HIV-1, reaching the same sac-like compartment where these particles are stored <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-IzquierdoUseros2">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-IzquierdoUseros3">[13]</xref>.

        <p>To assess the relevance of Siglec-1 for HIV-1 <italic>trans</italic>-infection, we pulsed distinct DCs with equal amounts of infectious virus in the presence or absence of blocking reagents and cocultured them with a CD4<sup>+</sup> reporter cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Controls performed with the protease inhibitor saquinavir, which abolishes production of infectious virus, demonstrated that this assay measured only <italic>trans</italic>-infection of reporter cells by DC-captured virus without a contribution from potentially de novo infected DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g004">Figure 4A–B</xref>, last bars). Pretreatment of LPS mDCs with the α-Siglec-1 mAb 7D2 inhibited HIV-1 <italic>trans</italic>-infection by 85% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g004">Figure 4A</xref>; <italic>p</italic> = 0.0052), while blocking DC-SIGN through mannan had no effect. Analogously, pretreatment of iDCs with 7D2 reduced HIV-1 <italic>trans</italic>-infection by 55% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g004">Figure 4A</xref>; <italic>p</italic> = 0.0091). In contrast, ITIP mDC-mediated <italic>trans</italic>-infection was not affected by 7D2 but was blocked by mannan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g004">Figure 4A</xref>; <italic>p</italic> = 0.0014). Addition of any of the inhibitors tested after DC viral pulse had no significant effect on <italic>trans</italic>-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), except for the mAb 7D2 in LPS mDCs (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0069). This latter inhibitory effect could not be explained by differences in viral capture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) but is most likely attributed to the cell-to-cell adhesion function of Siglec-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-vandenBerg1">[19]</xref>, where establishment of infectious synapses may be partially impaired when Siglec-1 is blocked in LPS mDCs. Indeed, when we analyzed infectious synapse formation between HIV-1<sub>Cherry</sub> pulsed LPS mDCs cocultured with CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, Siglec-1 polarized towards the site of the cell-to-cell contact zone where viruses were also concentrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). The importance of Siglec-1 for HIV-1 <italic>trans</italic>-infection was also confirmed for blood myeloid DCs. LPS stimulation strongly enhanced their potential for <italic>trans</italic>-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g004">Figure 4D</xref>; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001), and this increase could be abolished by pre-incubation with mAb 7D2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g004">Figure 4D</xref>; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001).</p>

        <title>5. SIGLEC1 Silencing Blocks Viral Capture and <italic>Trans</italic>-Infection, While De Novo Expression of SIGLEC1 Rescues It</title>
        <p>To verify the essential role of Siglec-1 during HIV-1 capture and <italic>trans</italic>-infection, we applied two complementary experimental strategies: RNA interference to reduce Siglec-1 expression levels in LPS mDCs and transfection of Siglec-1 into cells devoid of this receptor. In the first approach, we transduced DCs with lentiviral particles coding for different shRNAs by co-infection with vpx-expressing lentiviruses to counteract the restriction factor SAMHD1 and facilitate DC productive infection. Transduction of two different <italic>SIGLEC1</italic>-specific shRNAs, but not of a nontarget shRNA control, led to a drastic decrease in Siglec-1 surface expression and a concurrent loss of VLP<sub>HIV-Gag-eGFP</sub> capture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g005">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Furthermore, transduction of a <italic>SIGLEC1</italic>-specific shRNA, but not of a control shRNA, decreased LPS mDC capacity for HIV-1 <italic>trans</italic>-infection to a reporter CD4<sup>+</sup> cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). We next assessed whether endogenous Siglec-1 expression in cells lacking this molecule on their surface could rescue their capacity for HIV-1 capture and <italic>trans</italic>-ifection. This was first attempted for the monocytic cell line THP-1, but could not be pursued since transfection with any of the plasmids tested up-regulated Siglec-1 expression, probably through TLR signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001448.s006">Figure S6A</xref>, top panels). Thus, we chose Raji B cell line instead, which lack endogenous expression of Siglec-1 and could be efficiently transfected without unspecific up-regulation of Siglec-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001448.s006">Figure S6A</xref>, bottom panels, and S6B). Transfection of a Siglec-1 expression vector significantly enhanced VLP<sub>HIV-Gag-eGFP</sub> capture in the Siglec-1-positive cell population, and this effect was abolished by pretreatment with the α-Siglec-1 mAb 7D2 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0005; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g005">Figure 5D,E</xref>). No increased capture was seen in the Siglec-1-negative population of Siglec-1 transfected cells or following transfection of Siglec-5 or Siglec-7 expression plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g005">Figure 5D,E</xref>). Pre-incubation with sialyllactose also blocked VLP capture in Siglec-1 transfected Raji cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001448.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Accordingly, transfection of a Siglec-1 expression vector into Raji cells significantly increased their capacity for HIV-1 <italic>trans</italic>-infection to a reporter CD4<sup>+</sup> cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g005">Figure 5F</xref>), and this effect was again abolished by pre-incubation of transfected cells with the mAb 7D2 (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001448-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). Equivalent results were obtained when Siglec-1 transfected HEK-293T cells were analyzed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001448.s008">Figure S8</xref>). We finally verified that as opposed to DC-SIGN, Siglec-1 viral capture does not rely on the recognition of envelope glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001448.s009">Figure S9</xref>). Transfection of a Siglec-1 expression vector in Raji cells allowed for efficient capture of HIV-1 with or without envelope glycoproteins, whereas Raji DC-SIGN cells only captured viruses bearing glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001448.s009">Figure S9</xref>). The complementary approaches of <italic>SIGLEC1</italic> knockdown and de novo expression on heterologous cells strongly support our conclusion that Siglec-1 is a central molecule mediating HIV-1 capture and <italic>trans</italic>-infection.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Three lines of evidence identify Siglec-1 as a novel DC receptor for HIV-1 capture and <italic>trans</italic>-infection: (i) Siglec-1 expression correlates with viral capture and <italic>trans</italic>-infection capacity of DCs, (ii) mAbs against Siglec-1 specifically inhibit HIV-1 capture in a dose-dependent manner, and (iii) <italic>SIGLEC1</italic> knockdown reduces viral capture and <italic>trans</italic>-infection, while heterologous de novo expression of Siglec-1 enhances HIV-1 capture and <italic>trans</italic>-infection. An important role for Siglec-1 in HIV-1 infection is in line with previous studies reporting increased expression of Siglec-1 on CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes and macrophages in HIV-1 infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-vanderKuyl1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Zou1">[22]</xref>. However, these studies analyzed Siglec-1 interactions with sialylated viral envelope proteins, while our results clearly show that HIV-1 capture depends on sialyllactose on viral membrane gangliosides interacting with Siglec-1, but does not require viral glycoproteins.</p>
      <p>DC-SIGN was initially proposed as the HIV-1 attachment factor concentrating virus particles on the surface of DCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Geijtenbeek1">[4]</xref>, but later studies showed a variable contribution of DC-SIGN to HIV-1 capture and <italic>trans</italic>-infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Piguet1">[23]</xref>. Our results indicate that both DC-SIGN and Siglec-1 contribute to <italic>trans</italic>-infection by iDCs, while HIV-1 capture by highly <italic>trans</italic>-infecting LPS mDCs is independent of DC-SIGN and requires Siglec-1. Hence, although Siglec-1 viral binding via sialyllactose recognition does not discriminate between infectious or noninfectious HIV-1 particles, the greater the expression of Siglec-1, the greater the amount of virions captured and transmitted by DCs, diminishing the relative contribution of DC-SIGN gp120-mediated viral capture to <italic>trans</italic>-infection. Given that lectins such as DC-SIGN and Siglec-1 generally achieve high-avidity binding by clustering of both receptor and ligand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Crocker1">[15]</xref>, recognition of thousands of sialyllactose containing gangliosides in the viral membrane by Siglec-1 should be clearly superior to the interaction of DC-SIGN with only 14±7 envelope trimers per virion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Zhu1">[24]</xref>. Siglec-1 is the only Siglec family member tested that mediated HIV-1 capture, although all Siglecs interact with sialic acid through their respective V-set domains. This could be caused by different specificities, but is most likely due to Siglec-1 containing the largest number of Ig-like C2-type domains of all Siglecs; these domains act as spacers separating the ligand-binding site from the cell surface. Therefore, Siglec-1 extends beyond the glycocalix of the cell, and is thus available for interaction with external ligands, while other family members mainly bind ligands in <italic>cis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Crocker1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although Siglec-1 expression is restricted to myeloid cells, particularly to tissue macrophages found in secondary lymphoid tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Hartnell1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Munday1">[25]</xref>, its expression can be rapidly induced and up-regulated once myeloid cells are activated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Crocker2">[26]</xref>. Indeed, DCs exhibit a characteristic mature phenotype in HIV-1 viremic patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Barron1">[27]</xref>, and up-regulation of Siglec-1 on mDCs is therefore likely to play an important role in HIV-1 dissemination in lymphoid tissues, thus contributing to HIV-1 disease progression. DC maturation is probably not directly induced by HIV-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-GranelliPiperno1">[28]</xref>, but is more likely a consequence of factors released upon HIV-1 infection. Circulating LPS has been shown to be significantly augmented in HIV-1 patients due to the increased translocation of microbial products from the gastrointestinal lumen once infection is established <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Brenchley1">[10]</xref>. Thus, LPS may facilitate HIV-1 progression by local and systemic stimulation of DCs, which (i) leads to Siglec-1 up-regulation and enhanced viral spread and (ii) creates the pro-inflammatory milieu associated with HIV-1 infection and immune activation.</p>
      <p>This work together with several other recent reports indicates that HIV-1 uses a highly sophisticated strategy to evade DC immune surveillance and facilitate disease progression. Viral capture through Siglec-1 on the mDC surface is beneficial for viral spread through <italic>trans</italic>-infection, but could also be detrimental for the virus if leading to successful antigen presentation. However, captured HIV-1 do not appear to reach the endolysosomal compartment of LPS mDCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Garcia1">[29]</xref>, where antigen processing occurs. Furthermore, interaction of HIV-1 with DC-SIGN can cause down-regulation of MHC class II molecules and interferon genes, impairing antiviral immune responses while triggering infectious synapse formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Hodges1">[30]</xref>. If productive fusion of the viral and cellular membrane occurs, HIV-1 replication is blocked by the myeloid-specific restriction factor SAMHD1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Laguette1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Hrecka1">[2]</xref>, thus preventing viral antigen production. On the other hand, if DC resistance to infection is bypassed, the interaction of newly synthesized HIV-1 proteins with a cell-intrinsic sensor elicits antiviral immune responses, not typically engaged owing to the absence of DC infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Manel1">[31]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Siglec-1 captures HIV-1 through its interaction with sialyllactose-containing gangliosides exposed on viral membranes, and therefore functions as a general recognition receptor for vesicles carrying sialyllactose in their membrane. These include exosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Fvrier1">[16]</xref> and probably other sialyllactose-containing viruses. Gangliosides have been observed in the membrane of, for example, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), semliki forest virus, or murine leukemia virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Kalvodova1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Chan1">[33]</xref>, but are likely to be present in the membrane of many other enveloped viruses as well. Siglec-1-dependent viral capture may be important for direct infection of DCs in these cases, but may also enhance immune recognition, thus benefiting the host. Accordingly, Siglec-1 has been shown to efficiently capture VSV in vivo and facilitate antiviral responses and prevent viral neuroinvasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Junt1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Iannacone1">[35]</xref>. The observation that Siglec-1 also captures cellular microvesicles suggests that this pathway normally leads to antigen presentation through exosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-Thry1">[36]</xref> and has been hijacked by HIV-1 for infectious virus storage and spread. The discovery of the role of Siglec-1 in capturing sialylated viruses expands our understanding of HIV-1 transmission mechanisms and warrants novel therapeutic approaches aimed to prevent viral dissemination.</p>

        <p>LPS mDCs (2×10<sup>5</sup>) were pre-incubated at 16°C for 30 min with 10 µg/ml of α-Siglec-1 mAb 7D2 (HSn 7D2, Abcam), IgG1 isotype control mAb (107.3, BD Bioscience), α-Siglec-7 cell-adhesion neutralizing pAb (R&amp;D Systems), α-Siglec-5/14 cell-adhesion neutralizing mAb (194128; R&amp;D Systems, which recognizes both Siglec-5 and Siglec-14, sharing 99% of amino acid homology in the three extracellular distal domains) or α-CD83 mAb (HB15e; R&amp;D Systems) or with 500 µg/ml of mannan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sigma-Aldrich). Capture experiments were performed maintaining compound concentration and pulsing mDCs in parallel applying either 200 µM of the respective LUV<sub>HIV-tRed</sub> formulations or 150 ng of VLP<sub>HIV-Gag-eGFP</sub> Gag per 2×10<sup>5</sup> cells for 30 min at 37°C. Exosome<sub>DiI</sub> capture was performed pulsing 1×10<sup>5</sup> pretreated LPS mDCs with 150–250 µg of exosomes for 4 h at 37°C. After extensive washing, positive DCs were acquired by FACS. To test for potential cross-reactivity of α-Siglec-1 mAb 7D2, 2.2 µM of the mAb were pre-incubated or not with more than 100-fold molar excess of recombinant human protein Siglec-1, and more than 200-fold molar excess of Siglec-7, Siglec-5/14, or CD83 (all from R&amp;D Systems) 30 min at RT prior addition to the LPS mDCs. After incubation with mixes, LPS mDCs were pulsed with VLPs as indicated earlier. Fab fragments were generated from α-Siglec-1 7D2 and Isotype mAbs using the Fab Micro Preparation kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quality of Fab preparations was assessed with SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Titration of a different α-Siglec-1 mAb was performed with functional grade clone 7–239 (AbD Serotec). DCs were also assessed for VLP capture for 1 h as described above but starting 5 d after isolation (when LPS was added to LPS mDCs) and continuing 6, 24, and 48 h after LPS addition. In parallel, DCs were labeled with α-Siglec-1-PE 7–239 mAb and α-HLA-DR-PerCP (clone L243, BD Biosciences). The mean number of Siglec-1 Ab binding sites per cell was obtained with a Quantibrite kit (Becton Dickinson) at day 7 as previously described for DC-SIGN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-IzquierdoUseros1">[9]</xref>.</p>
        <p>HIV<sub>NL4-3</sub> capture was assessed pre-incubating 2.5–3×10<sup>5</sup> distinct monocyte-derived DCs or blood myeloid DCs at 16°C for 30 min with 10 µg/ml of the α-Siglec-1 mAb 7D2, the isotype control, or 500 µg/ml of mannan. Subsequently, DCs were pulsed with HIV<sub>NL4-3</sub> at an MOI of 0.1 (50–80 ng of p24<sup>Gag</sup> estimated by ELISA) for 5 h at 37°C. In parallel, untreated DCs equally pulsed with HIV<sub>NL4-3</sub> were exposed to inhibitors right after viral capture. After extensive washing, cells were lysed with 0.5% Triton X-100 to measure p24<sup>Gag</sup> antigen content by ELISA. HIV<sub>NL4-3</sub> binding was performed pre-incubating LPS mDCs with the indicated mAbs, but maintaining cells at 4°C during viral pulse. Cells were lysed to detect p24<sup>Gag</sup> or stained with Siglec-1-Alexa 488 7–239 mAb (Ab Serotec) to confirm arrested endocytosis of Siglec-1 at 4°C as compared to cells exposed to the virus at 37°C by FACS.</p>
        <p>To assess whether Siglec-1 traffics to the same compartment as sialyllactose-containing vesicles, we adapted our previously described method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-IzquierdoUseros3">[13]</xref>. Briefly, LPS mDCs were incubated with GM1-LUV<sub>HIV-tRed</sub>, VLP<sub>HIV-Gag-Cherry</sub>, HIV<sub>NL4-3-Cherry</sub>, or HIV<sub>NL4-3</sub> for 4 h as described above. When indicated, α-HLA-DR-Alexa 647 (Clone L243, Biolegend) was used to reveal LPS mDC membranes. Cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and labeled with Siglec-1-Alexa 488 7–239 mAb. HIV-1 was revealed with α-p24<sup>Gag</sup>-PE (Clone RD1, Coulter). To identify the cytoplasm of pulsed LPS mDCs, some permeabilized cells were also labeled with CellMask Deep Red (Molecular Probes). To detect trafficking of Siglec-1, LPS mDCs were pre-incubated with 10 µg/ml of the mAb 7D2 30 min at 16°C, revealed with a secondary Alexa 488 goat α-mouse IgG mAb (Molecular Probes), washed, and incubated 4 h at 37°C. To determine whether Siglec-1 redistributes to the infectious synapse, LPS mDCs previously pulsed with HIV<sub>NL4-3-Cherry</sub> for 4 h, extensively washed, and co-cultured with autologous or heterologous CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells for an additional 2 h were stained with α-CD4-Alexa 647 (Clone OKT4, Biolegend), fixed, permeabilized, and labeled with α-Siglec-1-Alexa 488 7–239. Confocal acquisition and analysis was performed as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001448-IzquierdoUseros3">[13]</xref>.</p>

        <p>DCs were treated and pulsed with HIV<sub>NL4-3</sub> as described above. After extensive washing, cells were co-cultured with the TZM-bl CD4<sup>+</sup> target cell line to measure <italic>trans</italic>-infection. Pulsed monocyte-derived DCs or myeloid DCs were co-cultured in quadruplicate or duplicate at a ratio of 1∶1 or 5∶1, respectively. Cells were assayed for luciferase activity 48 h later (BrightGlo Luciferase System; Promega) in a Fluoroskan Ascent FL luminometer (Thermo Labsystems). Background values consisting of non-HIV-1-pulsed co-cultures or reporter CD4<sup>+</sup> cells alone were subtracted for each sample. To detect possible productive infection of pulsed cells or re-infection events, some DCs were cocultured in the presence of 0.5 µM of the protease inhibitor Saquinavir.</p>
