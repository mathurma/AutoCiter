        <p>Analysis of the functional dynamics of human glucokinase reveals that a slow order-disorder transition governs monomeric kinetic cooperativity in response to glucose concentrations.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Glucokinase (GCK) catalyzes the rate-limiting step of glucose catabolism in the pancreas, where it functions as the body's principal glucose sensor. GCK dysfunction leads to several potentially fatal diseases including maturity–onset diabetes of the young type II (MODY-II) and persistent hypoglycemic hyperinsulinemia of infancy (PHHI). GCK maintains glucose homeostasis by displaying a sigmoidal kinetic response to increasing blood glucose levels. This positive cooperativity is unique because the enzyme functions exclusively as a monomer and possesses only a single glucose binding site. Despite nearly a half century of research, the mechanistic basis for GCK's homotropic allostery remains unresolved. Here we explain GCK cooperativity in terms of large-scale, glucose-mediated disorder–order transitions using 17 isotopically labeled isoleucine methyl groups and three tryptophan side chains as sensitive nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) probes. We find that the small domain of unliganded GCK is intrinsically disordered and samples a broad conformational ensemble. We also demonstrate that small-molecule diabetes therapeutic agents and hyperinsulinemia-associated GCK mutations share a strikingly similar activation mechanism, characterized by a population shift toward a more narrow, well-ordered ensemble resembling the glucose-bound conformation. Our results support a model in which GCK generates its cooperative kinetic response at low glucose concentrations by using a millisecond disorder–order cycle of the small domain as a “time-delay loop,” which is bypassed at high glucose concentrations, providing a unique mechanism to allosterically regulate the activity of human GCK under physiological conditions.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Glucokinase is a key metabolic enzyme that functions as the body's principal glucose sensor. Glucokinase regulates the rate at which insulin is secreted by the pancreas by using a unique but poorly understood cooperative kinetic response to increasing glucose concentrations. The physiological importance of this enzyme is underlined by the fact that mutations in the glucokinase gene lead to maturity-onset diabetes of the young type II (MODY II), permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM), and hypoglycemic hyperinsulinemia of infancy (HI). In this study, we use cutting-edge high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance methods to understand how the kinetic properties of glucokinase contribute to glucose homeostasis. We also seek to understand how a class of recently discovered small-molecule drugs, which hold promise as therapeutics for type 2 diabetes, function to enhance glucokinase activity. Our results suggest that glucokinase samples a range of conformational states in the absence of glucose. However, in the presence of glucose or a small-molecule activator, the enzyme population shifts towards a more narrow, well-structured ensemble of states. Our findings provide a new model for glucokinase cooperative kinetics, which relies on a slow order–disorder transition in response to glucose concentrations. These results also reveal a universal mechanism of glucokinase activation, which may inform the development of new antidiabetic agents.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Human pancreatic glucokinase (GCK) is the body's principal glucose sensor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-Bell1">[1]</xref>. GCK is a 52 kDa monomeric enzyme that catalyzes the formation of glucose-6-phosphate from glucose and ATP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-CornishBowden1">[2]</xref>. This chemical transformation represents the rate-limiting step of glucose catabolism in the pancreas, allowing GCK activity to regulate the rate at which insulin is secreted from β-cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-Matschinsky1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-AlHasani1">[5]</xref>. The importance of this enzyme in maintaining glucose homeostasis is emphasized by several disease states associated with GCK dysfunction. Loss-of-function mutations, of which more than 600 have been described, cause either maturity onset diabetes of the young type II (MODY-II) or permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-Vionnet1">[6]</xref>. A small number of gain-of-function mutations have also been identified in patients with the potentially fatal disease, persistent hypoglycemic hyperinsulinemia of infancy (PHHI) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-Glaser1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-Pal1">[19]</xref>. Functional characterization indicates that most PHHI-associated variant enzymes display a reduced level of positive cooperativity toward glucose. Interestingly, many of the PHHI-associated substitutions co-localize to a common region of the GCK scaffold that is distant from the active site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-Glaser1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-Pal1">[19]</xref>. In recent years, pharmaceutical research has directed significant efforts toward developing synthetic allosteric activators that target GCK as a strategy to lower blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetic patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-Grimsby1">[20]</xref>. At least one GCK activator has advanced to phase II clinical trials as an antidiabetic agent, yet the functional role and molecular basis of action of such molecules is poorly understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-Matschinsky2">[21]</xref>. Similarly, the mechanism of hyperactivity associated with PHHI-linked GCK variants is unclear.</p>
      <p>GCK's unique kinetic features are responsible for its physiological role in maintaining glucose homeostasis. The steady-state velocity shows a sigmoidal dependence upon glucose concentration, with a Hill coefficient of 1.7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-CornishBowden1">[2]</xref>. This positive cooperativity enables GCK to sensitively respond to small perturbations in blood glucose concentrations, whereby the midpoint of this steady-state response, <italic>K</italic><sub>0.5</sub>, approximates physiological blood sugar levels (4–10 mM). The kinetic cooperativity of GCK is mechanistically distinct from other modes of allostery, which involve polypeptide oligomerization or require multiple ligand binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-Wyman1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-Koshland1">[25]</xref>. Two theoretical mechanisms—the ligand-induced slow transition (LIST) and mnemonic models—have been put forth to explain kinetic cooperativity in monomeric GCK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-Ainslie1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-Richard1">[27]</xref>. In both models, cooperativity is postulated to result from slow conformational transitions that accompany glucose binding and/or product release. The models differ, however, in the relative degree of conformational heterogeneity displayed by the enzyme at various stages along the reaction coordinate. According to the LIST mechanism, two separate catalytic cycles are possible resulting from two distinct conformations of the enzyme. In contrast, the mnemonic model postulates a single catalytically active enzyme conformation with the ability to “remember” its active state for only a short period of time following turnover. Although data have accumulated over the years in support of each mechanism, a consensus has yet to be reached <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-Kamata1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-Zelent1">[33]</xref>.</p>
      <p>X-ray crystallographic structures reveal that GCK adopts a prototypic hexokinase fold, consisting of a small and large domain separated by a variable opening angle dependent upon substrate association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001452-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-Kamata1">[28]</xref>. The kinetic mechanism of GCK is strictly ordered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-CornishBowden1">[2]</xref>, with glucose binding first, accompanied by a large structural rearrangement from an open to a closed structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001452-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Binding of ATP does not induce significant additional changes to the structure of the glucose-bound state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001452-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-Petit1">[34]</xref>. The crystal structures also identify a common binding site for synthetic GCK activators at a location within the small domain that is approximately 20 Å removed from the glucose binding site.</p>

Herein, we describe the results of the first investigation of the functional dynamics of GCK at atomic detail by high-resolution NMR of specifically labeled side chains. We characterize the conformational dynamics of the wild-type enzyme as it progresses along the reaction coordinate and explain the molecular mechanism of kinetic cooperativity. We also uncover the molecular basis of activation observed in PHHI-associated variants or when a synthetic activator associates with the enzyme. Our findings suggest a model for GCK cooperativity involving a slow disorder–order cycle of an intrinsically disordered domain that is operational under low glucose concentrations but that is bypassed at elevated glucose concentrations.</p>

        <title>The Small Domain of GCK Is Intrinsically Disordered</title>
        <p>The large size and dynamic nature of GCK, combined with the poor spectral dispersion even upon perdeuteration, prevented the use of traditional NMR approaches for backbone resonance assignment and structural analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-Larion1">[32]</xref>. Instead, we focused on selected side chains only, a strategy that has proven effective for studies of other challenging protein systems and large complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-Tugarinov1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-Sprangers1">[40]</xref>. For this purpose, we introduced <sup>13</sup>C spin probes in the Cδ1 methyl groups of 17 isoleucine side chains and <sup>15</sup>N spin probes at the Nε sites of three tryptophan side chains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-Tugarinov1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-Muchmore1">[41]</xref>. The labeled residues are quite uniformly distributed throughout the enzyme's structure. The large domain contains one Trp and 10 Ile residues, while two Trp and seven Ile residues reside in the small domain (red and yellow spheres in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001452-g001">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Together these probes permit the study of internal dynamics throughout the protein. Importantly, the methyl resonances can retain narrow line widths even in high-molecular weight proteins through the methyl-TROSY effect manifested in the 2D <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HMQC experiment used here <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-Tugarinov1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-Sprangers1">[40]</xref>. Site-specific assignment of Ile and Trp resonances was achieved by single-site substitutions with Val and Phe, respectively, followed by the recording of 2D <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HMQC and <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra to identify missing cross-peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001452.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>To achieve a global portrait of the enzyme's structure and dynamics prior to glucose association, we collected <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HMQC spectra of <sup>13</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>-Ile labeled GCK. The <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HMQC of unliganded GCK displays a high degree of cross-peak overlap and heterogeneous peak intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001452-g001">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001452.s002">S2</xref>). This behavior is consistent with previously reported, unassigned <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY spectra of GCK specifically labeled on Ile backbone atoms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-Larion1">[32]</xref>. Nine Ile residues located in the large domain and two Ile side chains situated in the small domain are observable in unliganded GCK. The 2D <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum of unliganded <sup>15</sup>N-Trp labeled GCK reveals only a single cross-peak. Mutagenesis demonstrated that this cross-peak is dominated by contributions from W167 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001452.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Notably, the only small domain residues observable in the unliganded spectra—I159, I163, and W167—all reside in a loop that is absent in the X-ray structure of unliganded GCK. The sharp cross-peaks originating from these three residues, along with the nearly degenerate chemical shifts of the Ile 159 and 163, reflect the presence of extensive rapid motional averaging and indicate that this loop is disordered, both in the crystal and in solution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001452.s004">Figure S4</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-Wishart1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-Hansen1">[43]</xref>.</p>
        <p>To investigate whether the absence of the resonances of five isoleucines belonging to the small domain results from motions of these side chains occurring on the intermediate exchange regime (µs – ms time scale), we collected <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HMQC spectra of unliganded GCK at variable temperatures. Across a range of temperatures (283–313 K) compatible with retention of enzyme activity, no additional cross-peaks were observed that could be attributed to the five missing small domain isoleucine side chains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001452.s005">Figure S5</xref>). We tested whether the five missing isoleucine cross-peaks might reside in the intrinsically disordered side chain region of the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HMQC spectrum, underneath the sharp, intense peaks of I159 and I163, by constructing a variant in which I159 and I163 were replaced with leucines. These substitutions had a minimal impact upon the kinetic properties of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001452.s010">Table S1</xref>); however, the removal of I159 and I163 did not eliminate all peak intensity in the region of the spectrum where disordered side chains are expected. Therefore, residual intensity observed in the I159L–I163L double variant could stem from some of the remaining isoleucine side chains in the small domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001452.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Together these results show that the majority of the isoleucines of the small domain are subject to conformational exchange with an exchange rate <italic>k<sub>ex</sub></italic> that fulfills the NMR coalescence condition <italic>k<sub>ex</sub></italic>≈2.2Δ<italic>v</italic>, where Δ<italic>v</italic> is the chemical shift change between conformational substates of unliganded GCK. At least two isoleucines, I159 and I163, remain fully disordered in the unliganded form of GCK.</p>

        <title>Molecular Basis of Activation for PHHI-Associated Substitutions and Therapeutic Agents</title>
        <p>Although PHHI is usually associated with single amino acid replacements, we employed our previously identified hyperactive quadruple variant to fully characterize the structural and functional impacts of activating mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-Larion2">[44]</xref>. This hyperactive variant contains a redesigned α13-helix with sequence <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">ALIAAAV</named-content>. Similar to other activating PHHI-linked variants, the α13-helix variant displays a decreased glucose <italic>K</italic><sub>0.5</sub> value, a reduced level of cooperativity, and an increased equilibrium affinity for glucose compared to wild-type GCK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-Larion2">[44]</xref>. Specifically, the glucose <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value of the α13-helix variant is 50 µM, a value similar to glucose <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values of the noncooperative GCK isozymes, hexokinases I–III. In contrast to wild-type GCK, the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HMQC of the unliganded α13-helix variant displays cross-peaks originating from Ile residues in both the small and large domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001452-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). Under saturating glucose conditions, the α13-helix variant exhibits a spectrum that closely resembles the wild-type glucose-bound spectrum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001452.s007">Figure S7</xref>). These spectral characteristics are not specific to the hyperactive α13 variant, as similar effects were observed with the single-site activating variant, S64P (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001452.s008">Figure S8B</xref>). In general, the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HMQC spectra of activated variants reveal varying degrees of structural stabilization relative to the wild-type enzyme. We observed a correlation between increases in glucose affinity caused by individual activating GCK variants, a systematic sharpening of cross-peaks, and the appearance of a larger number of resolved cross-peaks in the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HMQC spectra in their unliganded state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001452.s008">Figure S8</xref>). These data demonstrate that activating PHHI-associated substitutions alter enzyme dynamics and promote a conformational ensemble that more closely resembles the glucose-bound state.</p>
        <p>Binding of the allosteric activator, which reduces the glucose <italic>K</italic><sub>0.5</sub> value and eliminates cooperativity, induces changes in the 2D <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HMQC spectrum similar to that produced by activating variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001452-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Well-dispersed cross-peaks originating from Ile residues in both the large and small domain are observed in the presence of the activator. The only differences between the NMR spectra of glucose-bound GCK in the absence and presence of the activator arise from residues near the activator binding site, such as I211 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001452.s009">Figure S9</xref>), suggesting local perturbations only. From these data, we conclude that allosteric activators stabilize the small domain and alter GCK dynamics. Our results also demonstrate that small-molecule-mediated GCK activation does not require prior formation of the binary GCK–glucose complex, a finding that could have important therapeutic implications.</p>

        <title>Direct Mode of Communication between the Allosteric and Active Sites: Stabilization of the α13-Helix Leads to Folding of the 151–179 Loop</title>
        <p>The 151–179 loop is disordered in unliganded wild-type GCK, as evidenced by the fact that the chemical shifts and peak intensities of I159, I163, and W167 fall within the disordered side chain region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001452.s004">Figure S4</xref>). This loop becomes structured in the unliganded α13-helix variant as shown by the 2D <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC and 2D <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HMQC spectra in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001452-g002">Figure 2E and H</xref>. Notably, the chemical shift of W167 in the unliganded α13-helix variant is identical to that observed in the wild-type GCK-glucose complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001452-g002">Figure 2G and H</xref>), indicating that the loop conformation adopted by the variant is similar to that produced upon glucose binding. The crystal structure reveals a possible mode of communication between the activator, the α13-helix, and the 151–179 loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001452-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-Kamata1">[28]</xref>. One face of the activator binding site is comprised of the α13-helix residues V452, V455, and A456, and two of these residues, V452 and A456, interact with the loop residue I159. In the presence of the activator, or when an activating substitution is introduced into the α13-helix, the interactions between I159, V452, and A456 are stabilized. In turn, this stabilization is relayed to the glucose binding site via two additional loop residues, T168 and K169, which form hydrogen bonds with the O1 and O6 atoms of bound glucose. Structural organization of either the α13-helix or the 151–179 loop can be achieved by glucose binding, activator association, or a hyperactive substitution.</p>

        <title>Our Data Reveal a Universal Mechanism of GCK Activation</title>
        <p>PHHI variants or the allosteric activator promote a population shift toward a more structured state, which involves a major reorganization of the small domain. This effect, which is evidenced by increased spectral dispersion and loss of line broadening compared to the unliganded wild-type enzyme, abrogates kinetic cooperativity. The differential glucose binding affinities of wild-type GCK and the α13-helix variant (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> = 5 mM and 50 µM, respectively) suggest that a substantial thermodynamic barrier separates the closed GCK conformation from the unliganded state. In the wild-type enzyme, this barrier is overcome by glucose binding, which triggers the disorder–order transition. In an activated variant, or in the presence of a synthetic activator, the small domain is stabilized, which decreases the free energy penalty of the conformational change and allows glucose binding energy to manifest itself in the form of a lower <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value. The differential glucose binding affinities of wild-type and activated GCK also suggest that the high-affinity conformation represents ≤1% of the total unliganded ensemble.</p>

        <title>A Refined Model for GCK Cooperativity</title>
        <p>The experimental data presented here provide direct evidence that the small domain of GCK is highly dynamic in the absence of ligand. Some evidence of GCK structural plasticity has emerged from X-ray structures determined in the presence and absence of various ligands; however, since crystal structures represent high-resolution snapshots of protein states, they neither reveal time-scale information nor how different states are dynamically related to each other. Optical spectroscopy, on the other hand, provides time-scale information at single sites without reporting on local structure. Indeed, the application of transient state fluorescence spectroscopy to GCK revealed the existence of glucose-induced structural rearrangements that span multiple time scales, but these studies failed to provide a unified, structure-based mechanism of GCK cooperativity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-Heredia1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-Larion3">[48]</xref>. Here we used all native Ile and Trp side chains to probe the structural-dynamic behavior of GCK at 20 different sites distributed throughout the protein. These data, obtained in solution under physiological conditions in the absence and presence of glucose and activator, provide temporal information for wild-type GCK and its variants with high spatial resolution. Based on this new type of information, we propose a refined model for allostery in monomeric GCK.</p>
        <p>The model that emerges from our data demonstrates that GCK cooperativity may result from dynamic structural modulations of the intrinsically disordered small domain. In the absence of ligand, the enzyme exists as an ensemble of conformations, which interconvert on a millisecond time scale that coincides with enzyme turnover (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>∼60 s<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001452-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Upon glucose association the small domain becomes ordered, as reflected in the sharpening of the NMR resonances and the increase of chemical shift dispersion of Ile residues. After formation of the GCK–glucose binary complex, ATP binds and catalysis proceeds with little additional reorganization. Following product release, ordered unliganded GCK persists until, on the millisecond time scale, the small domain undergoes an order–disorder transition, allowing access to a “time delay loop.” Under low glucose concentrations, the delay loop is operational, leading to slow turnover and kinetic cooperativity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001452-g003">Figure 3</xref>, red). Under high glucose concentrations, or when GCK is activated, the delay loop is effectively bypassed, turnover is fast, and cooperativity is eliminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001452-g003">Figure 3</xref>, green).</p>

The 2D <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HMQC cross-peaks of unliganded GCK display a broad range of line widths along the <sup>13</sup>C dimension between 10 and 115 Hz. (A) Addition of glucose narrows the line width distribution to a range of 20–60 Hz. (B) Unliganded GCK shows a heterogeneous distribution of <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HMQC cross-peak intensities, which becomes more homogeneous upon glucose addition. Labels indicate the intensities and line widths of I159 and I163 signals as they are the strongest and sharpest cross-peaks in the absence of glucose, which is consistent with their high internal mobility. The <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HMQC experiments were recorded with t<sub>1</sub>-evolution times up to 56.59 ms. The spectra were zero-filled to 8,192 data points in both dimensions and processed without apodization.</p>

The NMR samples consisted of 370, 330, 532, and 257 µM protein solution for W167F, W99F, W257F, and wild-type GCK, respectively, labeled specifically with <sup>15</sup>N at all tryptophan side chains. The spectra were uniformly scaled by factors of 1.12 (W99F), 2.04 (wild-type), and 0.69 (W257F) in order to account for the different sample concentrations relative to the W167F sample.</p>

          <p>Ile and Trp side-chain chemical shifts reflect the disordered nature of unliganded GCK. (A) The <sup>13</sup>C and the <sup>1</sup>H chemical shifts of I159 and I163 (Cδ1 and Hδ1) observed in the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HMQC spectrum of unliganded GCK are consistent with a disordered loop, as evidenced by comparison with the <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>1</sup>H chemical shifts of Ile <sup>13</sup>Cδ1-<sup>1</sup>Hδ1 spin pairs of denatured or intrinsically disordered proteins deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank or BMRB (solid red circles). The mean of the BMRB distribution of disordered Ile <sup>13</sup>Cδ1-<sup>1</sup>Hδ1 is shown as a solid green circle, with the error bars corresponding to the standard deviations along the <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>1</sup>H dimensions: &lt;δ(<sup>13</sup>C)&gt; = 12.689±0.449 ppm and &lt;δ(<sup>1</sup>H)&gt; = 0.785±0.054 ppm. The dark blue circle represents an outlier, which is &gt;11 standard deviations away from the average Ile <sup>13</sup>Cδ1 chemical shift belonging to BMRB entry 7279 and which was excluded from analysis. The small blue dots represent Ile <sup>13</sup>Cδ1-<sup>1</sup>Hδ1 chemical shifts of all BMRB entries, and their average is indicated by the cyan open circle. (B) The <sup>15</sup>Nε1 and the <sup>1</sup>Hε1 chemical shifts of the Trp167 side chain observed in the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum of unliganded GCK are also consistent with a disordered region. The solid green circle shows the mean of the BMRB distribution of disordered Trp <sup>15</sup>Nε1-<sup>1</sup>Hε1 along the <sup>15</sup>N and <sup>1</sup>H dimensions: &lt;δ(<sup>15</sup>N)&gt; = 129.459±0.118 ppm and &lt;δ(<sup>1</sup>H)&gt; = 10.087±0.016 ppm. The dark blue circle represents an outlier, which is &gt;38 standard deviations away from the average Trp <sup>1</sup>Hε1 chemical shift belonging to BMRB entry 15201 and which was excluded from analysis. The small blue dots represent Trp <sup>15</sup>Nε1-<sup>1</sup>Hε1 chemical shifts of all BMRB entries, and their average is indicated by the cyan open circle. The red solid circles represent Trp <sup>15</sup>Nε1-<sup>1</sup>Hε1 chemical shifts of denatured or intrinsically disordered proteins deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank or BMRB. (A and B) Chemical shifts for denatured or intrinsically disordered proteins were obtained from a subset of all BMRB entries marked as “unfolded.” The analysis was restricted to those entries that (i) have assigned side-chain Ile <sup>1</sup>Hδ1-<sup>13</sup>Cδ1 and Trp <sup>15</sup>Nε1-<sup>1</sup>Hε1 chemical shifts and (ii) have local secondary structure propensity scores (SSP) at the isoleucine and tryptophan sites between −0.3 and 0.3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001452-Marsh1">[60]</xref>. The second criterion, which ensures that protein regions with relatively high (&gt;30%) propensities for α13-helix or β-strand propensities are excluded from analysis, was calculated as the SSP averaged over residues (i−1, i, i+1), where i is Trp or Ile. This left three BMRB entries (15201, 15225, and 7279) for Ile <sup>1</sup>Hδ1-<sup>13</sup>Cδ1 and two entries (15201 and 15225) for Trp <sup>15</sup>Nε1-<sup>1</sup>Hε1.</p>

In unliganded GCK (A, blue spectrum) the intensity of the intrinsically disordered side-chain region is dominated by I159 and I163. Substitution of these isoleucine residues with leucine revealed the existence of residual intensity in this region attributable to some or all of the other isoleucine residues located in the small domain (A, red, spectrum). Addition of saturating glucose to the variant lacking reporters in the disordered loop region (I159LI163LGCK, B, red spectrum) decreased further the intensity of the intrinsically side chain region compared to the wild-type GCK (B, blue spectrum). The data were recorded as matrices of 1024×64 (wild-type) and 1024×350 (I159LI163L GCK) complex data points and multiplied by a squared cosine apodization function.</p>

          <p>NMR characterization of activator binding to the binary GCK-glucose complex and glucose titration to GCK. (A). Activator binding to the binary GCK–glucose complex induces only local chemical shift changes without perturbing the conformation of the binary state. 2D <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HMQC of GCK–glucose binary complex in the absence (black) and presence (red) of saturating activator. An arrow indicates a significant chemical shift change induced by activator binding. The most affected residues (I159, I404, and I211) are labeled in red and are located in close proximity to the allosteric binding site. I211 interacts directly with the activator. I159 is located within 5.8 Å from the N of the thiazole ring of the activator, and I404 is located within 9 Å from the methyl carbon of imidazole ring of the activator molecule.
