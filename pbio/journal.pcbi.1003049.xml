<abstract>
<p>Nitric oxide (NO•) is generated by the innate immune response to neutralize pathogens. NO• and its autoxidation products have an extensive biochemical reaction network that includes reactions with iron-sulfur clusters, DNA, and thiols. The fate of NO• inside a pathogen depends on a kinetic competition among its many targets, and is of critical importance to infection outcomes. Due to the complexity of the NO• biochemical network, where many intermediates are short-lived and at extremely low concentrations, several species can be measured, but stable products are non-unique, and damaged biomolecules are continually repaired or regenerated, kinetic models are required to understand and predict the outcome of NO• treatment. Here, we have constructed a comprehensive kinetic model that encompasses the broad reactivity of NO• in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. The incorporation of spontaneous and enzymatic reactions, as well as damage and repair of biomolecules, allowed for a detailed analysis of how NO• distributes in <italic>E. coli</italic> cultures. The model was informed with experimental measurements of NO• dynamics, and used to identify control parameters of the NO• distribution. Simulations predicted that NO• dioxygenase (Hmp) functions as a dominant NO• consumption pathway at O<sub>2</sub> concentrations as low as 35 µM (microaerobic), and interestingly, loses utility as the NO• delivery rate increases. We confirmed these predictions experimentally by measuring NO• dynamics in wild-type and mutant cultures at different NO• delivery rates and O<sub>2</sub> concentrations. These data suggest that the kinetics of NO• metabolism must be considered when assessing the importance of cellular components to NO• tolerance, and that models such as the one described here are necessary to rigorously investigate NO• stress in microbes. This model provides a platform to identify novel strategies to potentiate the effects of NO•, and will serve as a template from which analogous models can be generated for other organisms.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Nitric oxide (NO•) is a highly reactive metabolite used by immune cells to combat pathogens. Since the biological effects of NO• are governed by its broad reactivity, it is desirable to determine how NO• distributes among its many targets inside a cell. A quantitative understanding of this distribution and how it is controlled will facilitate the development of novel NO•-potentiating therapeutics. Here, we have constructed and experimentally validated a comprehensive kinetic model of NO• biochemistry within <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> that includes NO• autoxidation, respiratory inhibition, enzymatic detoxification, and damage and repair of biomolecules. Using this model, we investigated the control of NO• dynamics in <italic>E. coli</italic> cultures, and found that the primary aerobic detoxification system, NO• dioxygenase (Hmp), functions as a dominant NO• consumption pathway under microaerobic conditions (35 µM O<sub>2</sub>), and loses utility as the NO• delivery rate increases. We confirmed these predictions experimentally, thereby demonstrating the predictive power of the model. This model will serve as a quantitative platform to study nitrosative stress, provide a template from which models for other organisms can be generated, and facilitate the development of antimicrobials that synergize with host-derived NO•.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>NO• is an uncharged, highly diffusible, membrane-permeable metabolite, generated by mammalian NO• synthases (NOS) for use in signaling and defense <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Toledo1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Bowman1">[2]</xref>. The diversity of functions performed by NO•, from pathogen detoxification to vasodilation, reflect its broad reactivity. NO• directly reacts with iron-sulfur ([Fe-S]) clusters, superoxide (O<sub>2</sub>•<sup>−</sup>), and O<sub>2</sub>, whereas its oxidized forms (NO<sub>2</sub>•, N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) damage thiols, tyrosine residues, and DNA bases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Bowman1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Reiter1">[5]</xref>. Such widespread activity has made the biological effects of NO• difficult to predict <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Bowman1">[2]</xref>. For instance, if 1,000 NO• molecules entered a cell, what would become of them? How many would disrupt an [Fe-S] cluster to form a protein-bound dinitrosyl-iron complex (DNIC)? How many would autoxidize to form nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>•) and then react with another NO• to form nitrous anhydride (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)? How many N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> would deaminate DNA bases? These questions are representative of one unifying, fundamental question of NO• metabolism: how does NO• distribute within a cell? The answer to this question lies in understanding the kinetic competition of NO• with its many intracellular targets. However, the NO• biochemical network is complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g001">Figure 1</xref>), contains numerous short-lived intermediates at low concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Lewis1">[6]</xref>, converges to only a few stable end-products <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Lim1">[4]</xref>, and involves various damaged biomolecules that are continually digested or repaired <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Trtora1">[7]</xref>. Such complexity has necessitated the use of computational models to both interpret and predict the outcome of NO• treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Lim1">[4]</xref>.</p>

<p>A number of kinetic models have been developed to simulate NO• chemistry in biological contexts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Lancaster1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Lim1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Lewis1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Kirsch1">[17]</xref>. Many of these models have focused on mammalian systems due to the importance of NO• in human physiology. Nalwaya and Deen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Nalwaya1">[9]</xref> calculated steady-state concentration profiles of NO•, CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>•<sup>−</sup>, and peroxynitrite (ONOO<sup>−</sup>) in idealized mammalian cell cultures using a reaction–diffusion model, and explored the effect of varying the rates and locations (extracellular, mitochondrial, or cytosolic) of their generation. Their results suggested negligible spatial variation in species concentrations, and identified conditions under which the different cellular compartments serve as dominant sources or sinks. However, their model did not include the reactions of numerous intracellular metabolites that either directly react with NO•, or its autoxidation products (NO<sub>2</sub>•, N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). Lancaster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Lancaster1">[3]</xref> constructed a non-diffusive, but more extensive kinetic model to encompass the complex reaction network of NO• and its autoxidation products with glutathione (GSH) and tyrosine in mammalian systems. This model allowed for predictions regarding the relative importance of the various NO•-consuming pathways under inflammatory and non-inflammatory regimes, and highlighted the dominance of oxidative reactions. Lim <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Lim1">[4]</xref> built upon the work of Lancaster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Lancaster1">[3]</xref> by incorporating additional antioxidants, as well as a separate membrane compartment to account for partitioning of certain species in the lipid-phase. Their model was developed to be representative of inflamed tissue <italic>in vivo</italic> and used to estimate steady-state intracellular concentrations of different reactive nitrogen species (RNS), in addition to identifying their major sources and sinks in the cytosol and membrane compartments of mammalian cells. Interestingly, none of these models considered the interaction of NO• and its autoxidation products with [Fe-S] clusters, cytochromes, or DNA, and their treatment of the relevant enzymatic processes was limited to NO• dioxygenase and superoxide dismutase. Recently, Tórtora <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Trtora1">[7]</xref> measured rates of ROS- and RNS-induced damage to the mitochondrial aconitase [4Fe-4S] cluster, and incorporated the reactions into a kinetic model of aconitase inactivation in the presence of O<sub>2</sub>•<sup>−</sup> and NO•. Since their focus was specifically on the inactivation of aconitase, they did not consider much of the extensive reaction network of NO•, O<sub>2</sub>•<sup>−</sup>, and their products. Bagci <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Bagci1">[14]</xref> merged a mitochondrial apoptotic network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Bagci2">[18]</xref> with a kinetic model of NO• chemistry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Hu1">[10]</xref> and extended treatment to include formation of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>• and ONOO<sup>−</sup>, as well as their interactions with GSH, non-heme iron, and mitochondrial cytochrome <italic>c</italic>. However, their attention was primarily on the dynamics of the apoptotic response, and many RNS-related reactions and biological species that were not directly involved in apoptosis were omitted. Though previous models provide a firm foundation for modeling NO• in biological systems, none are sufficiently comprehensive to quantify the distribution of NO• among its many intracellular consumption pathways.</p>
<p>Here, we describe the construction, experimental validation, and utility of a comprehensive model of NO• metabolism in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. This model includes NO• autoxidation, enzymatic detoxification, [Fe-S] damage, thiol and tyrosine nitrosation, DNA base deamination, tyrosine nitration, and the repair steps responsible for regeneration of RNS targets. A model of NO• stress with this level of detail has not been previously recognized for any organism. Using this model, we quantitatively explored the distribution of NO• consumption in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and predicted that the utility of the major aerobic NO• detoxification system (Hmp) depends on the NO• delivery rate and extends to environments with O<sub>2</sub> concentrations as low as 35 µM (microaerobic). We went on to experimentally confirm these predictions, thereby demonstrating the utility of this model to the study of NO• metabolism. This computational model will serve as a platform to quantitatively interrogate the kinetic competition of NO• with its many targets in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and assess the influence of various parameters on its distribution.</p>

<title>Kinetic model of NO• metabolism in <italic>E. coli</italic></title>
<p>Upon diffusing into <italic>E. coli</italic>, NO• may be consumed directly through enzymatic detoxification (Hmp, NorV, NrfA), or reactions with [Fe-S] clusters, O<sub>2</sub>•<sup>−</sup>, or O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g001">Figure 1</xref>, Figures S1, S2). Several resulting nitrosative species, including NO<sub>2</sub>• and N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, can further react to deaminate DNA bases, nitrosate protein and low molecular weight thiols, and nitrate tyrosine residues. To quantify how NO• distributes within a cell, we have constructed a comprehensive kinetic model of the NO• biochemical reaction network in <italic>E. coli</italic>, where autoxidation, detoxification (Hmp, NorV, NrfA), [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] damage and repair, thiol nitrosation and denitrosation, DNA base deamination and repair, enzyme expression and degradation, tyrosine nitration, and reversible cytochrome inhibition are included (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The model consists of 179 reactions, 132 chemical and biochemical species, and 163 kinetic parameters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003049.s015">Tables S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003049.s016">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003049.s017">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003049.s022">Text S1</xref>). Of the kinetic parameters, 24 have values that are uncertain, either due to variability or unavailability in literature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003049.s018">Table S4</xref>). An overview describing the construction of the model is presented in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and methods</xref> section, whereas a more detailed description has been presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003049.s022">Text S1</xref>. Due to its scope and completeness, the model is suited to predict the distribution of NO• consumption among the available pathways in <italic>E. coli</italic>. For example, the fraction of NO• detoxified by Hmp, the amount of NO<sub>2</sub>•, N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and ONOO<sup>−</sup> formed, the quantity of [Fe-S] clusters and DNA bases damaged and repaired, the extent and duration of cytochrome inhibition, and amount of thiols nitrosated can all be calculated from model simulations. Further, the model allows parameter variation (for example, enzyme mutation/deletion) and quantification of the impact these alterations have on NO• metabolism. To substantiate the utility of the model, we first validated that the model could reproduce experimentally-measured NO• dynamics and make accurate predictions of experimental outcomes.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Experimental validation</title>
<p>We sought to validate that the model could capture NO• dynamics in <italic>E. coli</italic> cultures. Since extracellular NO• loss, including autoxidation and gas phase transport, was non-negligible, we bridged the intracellular model to the experimental system by adding an extracellular (growth media) compartment that accounted for autoxidation and gas-phase transport (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and methods</xref>). Kinetic parameters specific to the extracellular compartment (NO• delivery rate, NO• and O<sub>2</sub> gas phase mass transfer coefficients, and NO• autoxidation rate) were determined from experimental NO• and O<sub>2</sub> measurements in the absence of cells (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003049.s003">Figure S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003049.s022">Text S1</xref>). In the experimental system, exponential-phase wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> were treated with 0.5 mM dipropylenetriamine (DPTA) NONOate, and the concentration of NO• in the culture was monitored over time (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and methods</xref>). The NO• concentration peaked rapidly to 9.7 µM following delivery of DPTA, and decreased at a steady rate for ∼0.6 hours, after which the concentration dropped quickly to submicromolar levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Using a nonlinear least squares optimization algorithm, 39 uncertain parameters (24 kinetic constants and 15 species concentrations) from the model were optimized to capture the experimentally-measured NO• concentration profile (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003049.s018">Table S4</xref>). Uncertain parameters were defined as those that were absent from literature, or those whose literature values had a high degree of variability. All other parameters were either set to their literature values, or measured independently in our experimental apparatus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003049.s015">Tables S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003049.s016">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003049.s017">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003049.s022">Text S1</xref>). Given that the optimization algorithm does not guarantee identification of the globally optimal solution, 100 independent sets of random initial parameter values were used (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and methods</xref>). The optimized parameter set yielding the lowest sum of squared residuals (SSR) between the simulated and experimental [NO•] curve is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, and demonstrates the model's ability to capture NO• dynamics in a wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> culture. For comparison, we took the three most comparable NO• models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Lancaster1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Lim1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Nalwaya1">[9]</xref>, adapted them to our experimental conditions, and performed an analogous nonlinear least squares optimization in an attempt to capture the NO• dynamics of wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> cultures (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and methods</xref>). As depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003049.s004">Figure S4</xref>, none of the alternative models could accurately simulate <italic>E. coli</italic> NO• dynamics. Quantitatively, the SSRs between the experimental data and the [NO•] curves predicted by the adapted, alternative models of Lim <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Lim1">[4]</xref>, Lancaster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Lancaster1">[3]</xref>, and Nalwaya and Deen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Nalwaya1">[9]</xref> were, respectively, 200-, 200-, and 70-fold greater than that of the model presented here. These data convincingly demonstrate that the model presented here far exceeds current state-of-the-art kinetic models for simulation of microbial NO• metabolism.</p>

<p>With an ability to simulate NO• dynamics confirmed, we sought to identify which of the 39 parameters adjusted by the nonlinear optimization procedure were informed by the process, and which had a negligible influence under these conditions. We varied each parameter individually and calculated the corresponding increase in SSR, keeping all other parameters at their optimized values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The analysis revealed that the Hmp NO• binding (<italic>k</italic><sub>Hmp,NO•-on</sub>), and Hmp expression (<italic>k</italic><sub>Hmp-exp,max</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>Hmp-exp,NO•</sub>) parameters were the most influential, whereas the oxidation of NorV (<italic>k</italic><sub>NorV-O2</sub>) was of minor significance, but exhibited a greater effect than the remaining parameters, which were all negligible (less than a 5% increase in SSR) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003049.s005">Figure S5</xref>). This prompted us to identify the minimum biochemical reaction network necessary to simulate NO• dynamics in aerobic, wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> cultures (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and methods</xref>). As depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003049.s019">Table S5</xref>, the model presented here can be simplified to include 17 reactions, 18 chemical and biochemical species, and 14 kinetic parameters without exceeding an overall 5% increase in SSR. While this simplified model can capture the NO• dynamics presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, we note that it is not suitable for the calculation of additional NO• outcomes, such as the degree of [Fe-S] cluster damage or cytochrome inhibition, and it is not generally translatable to other experimental conditions, such as anaerobic environments. The comprehensive model, on the other hand, can perform such calculations and be applied under many more experimental conditions.</p>
<p>The importance of parameters governing Hmp detoxification activity suggested a dominant role for this enzyme in the consumption of NO• under aerobic conditions, a result that is consistent with previous studies of NO• sensitivity in <italic>E. coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Gardner1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Gardner2">[22]</xref>. To quantitatively investigate the contribution of Hmp to NO• consumption, we calculated the cumulative, time-dependent distribution (overall and intracellular) of NO• for wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> treated with DPTA using the optimized parameter values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g002">Figures 2C and 2D</xref>). The simulated distributions predicted that autoxidation of NO• in the media accounts for the majority of NO• removal shortly after DPTA addition, with loss to the gas phase comprising most of the remaining flux. By 45 min after delivery, the model predicted that cellular consumption of NO• had accumulated to match that of gaseous loss, and after 1 h became the primary sink. The predicted concentration of NO• dropped rapidly to submicromolar levels at 43 minutes post-dose, where it remained for the duration of the simulation, as Hmp continued to remove NO• as it was released by DPTA. The majority (78.1%) of the total NO• released by DPTA was predicted to be consumed by the cells, while autoxidation in the media and loss to the gas phase accounted for 13.6% and 8.3% of the total NO• consumption, respectively. Virtually all (99.85%) of the NO• consumed by the cells was predicted to be through Hmp detoxification, with most of the remaining 0.15% through oxidation by O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>•<sup>−</sup>. Reduction by anaerobic detoxification enzymes (NorV and NrfA) and nitrosylation of [Fe-S] clusters was predicted to account for less than 0.03% and 0.04% of the cellular NO• consumption, respectively. To provide additional experimental evidence in support of these intracellular distributions, we experimentally validated that a mutant lacking the NorV enzyme (Δ<italic>norV</italic>) consumed NO• at the same rate as wild-type under the experimental conditions tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003049.s006">Figure S6</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the importance of Hmp to the removal of NO•, we assessed the predictive power of the model by determining whether it could accurately predict NO• dynamics in a Δ<italic>hmp</italic> mutant culture. We simulated a Δ<italic>hmp</italic> mutant by fixing the Hmp expression rate to zero. All other model parameter values were left unchanged. As expected, the removal of Hmp was predicted to have a considerable effect on the cells' ability to remove NO• from the environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Although the [NO•] curve simulated for the Δ<italic>hmp</italic> culture closely matched that predicted for wild-type at early times (0 to ∼10 min) after DPTA delivery, it started to diverge rapidly as Hmp began to dominate the consumption of NO• in the wild-type culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). The model predicted that the wild-type culture would quickly consume NO• to reach a submicromolar NO• concentration by 43 min, while the concentration of NO• in the Δ<italic>hmp</italic> culture would gradually decline, requiring over 6.4 hours to achieve submicromolar levels. In contrast to wild-type cultures where it was predicted that most NO• would be converted to NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> by Hmp, the model predicted that the majority of NO• in Δ<italic>hmp</italic> cultures would be converted to NO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> through autoxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). To experimentally confirm the Δ<italic>hmp</italic> model predictions, we measured the concentration of NO• in a Δ<italic>hmp</italic> culture after treatment with 0.5 mM DPTA under identical conditions as wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In addition, we measured NO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> in the Δ<italic>hmp</italic> culture at 10 h post-dose, when it was predicted that over 99% of the donor had dissociated. The model-predicted NO• concentration curve and final NO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> concentrations were in excellent agreement with the experimental data (without further optimization of any parameters) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), validating the ability of the model to make accurate predictions regarding major perturbations to the system.</p>

<p>To further investigate NO• clearance from the Δ<italic>hmp</italic> culture, we simulated the corresponding intracellular distribution of NO• (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).

<title>Analysis of experimentally-accessible model parameters</title>
<p>After validating the model, we sought to identify parameters that control the NO• distribution in <italic>E. coli</italic> cultures. We focused on experimentally-accessible model parameters to enable experimental validation of predictions. To identify control parameters, we performed a parametric analysis (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and methods</xref>) to assess the effect of varying each parameter on the distribution of NO•. Varied parameters included enzyme concentrations or maximum expression rates, initial concentration and release rate of the NO• donor, O<sub>2</sub> concentration in the environment, and intracellular concentrations of GSH, amino acids, and energy metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003049.s020">Table S6</xref>). In addition to Hmp expression, the parametric analysis revealed NO• donor concentration and release rate, as well as O<sub>2</sub> concentration, as important parameters governing the distribution of NO• consumption. Anaerobic NO• detoxification enzymes became the dominant mode of NO• removal within <italic>E. coli</italic> at lower O<sub>2</sub> concentrations due to the loss of Hmp NO• dioxygenase activity, a decrease in the O<sub>2</sub>-mediated deactivation of NorV, and reduced repression of NrfA expression. The lower O<sub>2</sub> concentration also decreased the rate of NO• autoxidation in the media, leaving intracellular reactions and escape to the gas phase as the two primary modes of NO• removal. Although it had little impact on the total NO• distribution, removing superoxide dismutase activity resulted in a small, but noticeable increase in the fraction of intracellular NO• consumed through reaction with O<sub>2</sub>•<sup>−</sup> to form ONOO<sup>−</sup>. Interestingly, the model predicted that higher donor release rates decrease the utility of Hmp in detoxifying NO• (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). This decrease can be attributed to the higher NO• concentrations achieved with faster release rates, which in turn enhance substrate inhibition due to the binding of NO• to the Hmp active site before O<sub>2</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Gardner3">[23]</xref>.</p>

<p>To further examine the effect of donor release rate on model dynamics, we simulated delivery of NO• to cultures at an increased rate, where Hmp contribution to NO• consumption was predicted to be largely reduced. The initial concentration of donor was maintained at 0.5 mM, but the release rate was increased from 1.34×10<sup>−4</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (1.4 h half-life, DPTA) to 1.35×10<sup>−3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (8.6 min half-life), the measured rate for the NO• donor propylamine propylamine (PAPA) NONOate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003049.s007">Figure S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003049.s022">Text S1</xref>). We performed simulations for wild-type and Δ<italic>hmp</italic> cultures, and generated the corresponding NO• concentration profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). The strong influence of NO• delivery kinetics on model dynamics are readily apparent when comparing the NO• concentration profiles simulated for PAPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) with those for DPTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The faster release rate of PAPA predicted a peak NO• concentration nearly four times that of DPTA (34 µM compared to 9 µM, respectively), and a large increase in similarity between the simulated wild-type and Δ<italic>hmp</italic> [NO•] curves was observed. Although the predicted NO• concentration in the PAPA-treated wild-type culture dropped rapidly to submicromolar levels at a time similar to that of DPTA (37 min and 43 min, respectively), Δ<italic>hmp</italic> entered this regime after 1.2 h when treated with PAPA, compared to the 6.4 h predicted for DPTA. We simulated the corresponding NO• distributions for PAPA-treated cultures to examine the participation of the different pathways in NO• removal. The elevated NO• concentrations simulated for the faster-releasing PAPA greatly increased flux through various consumption pathways, where over 99% of the total NO• consumption was predicted to occur within the first hour after dose for both wild-type and Δ<italic>hmp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g005">Figures 5A and 5C</xref>, respectively). The activity of Hmp, however, was attenuated by the higher NO• concentration due to substrate inhibition (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003049.s022">Text S1</xref>), reducing its ability to participate in detoxification. When Hmp activity was restored and became the most rapid NO• removal pathway after ∼30 minutes, simulation results showed that over 90% of the total NO• had already been consumed through autoxidation and gas transfer pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). As a result, the fraction of total NO• consumed by cellular pathways in the wild-type culture was predicted to decrease by nearly 10-fold (78.1% to 8.4%) due to the increased NO• delivery rate (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g002">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g005">5A</xref>). When treating with DPTA, the NO• concentration profile and distribution simulated for the Δ<italic>hmp</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) were observed to differ greatly from those of wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), but were significantly more similar to wild-type when using PAPA as the donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g005">Figures 5A and 5C</xref>) due to the large reduction in Hmp-mediated NO• consumption predicted for the wild-type culture. The intracellular distribution simulated for wild-type treated with PAPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) was still dominated by Hmp, despite its large reduction in activity. However, the proportion of intracellular NO• consumed through pathways other than Hmp was predicted to increase by over 15-fold (0.15% to 2.6%) upon increasing the NO• delivery rate, suggesting that these other pathways maintain activity while Hmp is inhibited. Thus, the reduction in Hmp activity predicts a 15-fold increase in contribution by other intracellular pathways to the removal of NO• within the cell, including damage to biomolecules such as [Fe-S] clusters.</p>

<title>Experimental validation of the dependence of Hmp on NO•-delivery kinetics</title>
<p>To experimentally validate the prediction that the utility of Hmp decreases as the delivery rate of NO• increases, we measured and compared the ability of wild-type and Δ<italic>hmp</italic> to remove NO• from the culture when dosed with PAPA. We observed excellent agreement between model-predicted and experimentally-measured NO• concentration profiles for the addition of PAPA to wild-type and Δ<italic>hmp</italic> cultures, with no further optimization of model parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). The peak concentration of NO• was underestimated by approximately 10%, which was also observed when measuring NO• release from PAPA in media without cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003049.s007">Figure S7</xref>), suggesting that the disagreement was not associated with cellular parameters. In addition, the rate of NO• clearance by the wild-type cells was slightly overestimated. This could originate from the treatment of Hmp expression in the model, where a more extensive implementation of its governing regulatory network may improve the accuracy of the simulated transcriptional response of <italic>hmp</italic> expression to elevated levels of NO•. As predicted, the measured difference in time required to remove NO• from the culture between wild-type and Δ<italic>hmp</italic> was small for PAPA (0.6 h difference in time to reach submicromolar levels), highlighting the decreased utility of Hmp under conditions of more rapid NO• release. These results demonstrate that the model can accurately identify parameters that control the distribution of NO• in bacterial cultures, and quantify the impact of their manipulation.</p>

<p>In addition to NO• removal from the cell interior and surrounding environment, the model can be used to calculate the extent to which NO• affects various cellular targets, including [Fe-S] nitrosylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Fang1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Ren1">[26]</xref> and cytochrome inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Mason1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Yu1">[28]</xref>. Therefore, we utilized the model to evaluate the protective effect of Hmp with respect to [Fe-S] cluster damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) and cytochrome <italic>bd</italic> inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Due to the wide range of reaction rates reported for the nitrosylation of [Fe-S] clusters by NO• (<italic>k</italic><sub>NO•-[Fe-S]</sub>), the parameter value was varied across this range when predicting the extent of [Fe-S] damage. Simulated exposure of wild-type and Δ<italic>hmp E. coli</italic> to 0.5 mM DPTA predicted a 2- to 4-fold reduction in the total concentration of [Fe-S] clusters damaged as a result of Hmp activity. When simulations were repeated for PAPA, however, the total [Fe-S] damage predicted for wild-type and Δ<italic>hmp</italic> cultures differed by a maximum of 5%, in agreement with the predicted dependence of Hmp utility on NO• release rate. Furthermore, the duration of NO•-mediated cytochrome <italic>bd</italic> inhibition following DPTA treatment was predicted to greatly increase for the Δ<italic>hmp</italic> culture relative to wild-type, requiring over 9 h (compared to 0.7 h for wild-type) for the concentration of NO•-bound cytochromes to drop below 50% of the total. Treatment with PAPA resulted in more similar cytochrome inhibition between the strains, with durations of 0.6 h and 1.5 h predicted for wild-type and Δ<italic>hmp</italic>, respectively. Collectively, the results from these damage descriptors, in addition to the rate and distribution of NO• consumption, predicted a greater similarity in recovery from bacteriostasis between wild-type and Δ<italic>hmp</italic> when treated with PAPA than with DPTA. To test the prediction, we monitored the optical density (OD<sub>600</sub>) of each strain following treatment with 0.5 mM DPTA or PAPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). In agreement with the prediction, the duration of NO•-induced stasis was more similar between wild-type and Δ<italic>hmp</italic> strains when using a faster NO• donor. Growth inhibition of Δ<italic>hmp</italic> following PAPA treatment was less severe than that observed for DPTA, where cells exited stasis less than 2 h after wild-type, compared to over 10 h for DPTA.</p>

<title>Experimental validation of the microaerobic utility of Hmp</title>
<p>Hmp is considered the major aerobic enzyme responsible for NO• detoxification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Gardner1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Stevanin1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Poole1">[29]</xref>, whereas NorV is considered the major anaerobic detoxification system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Gardner2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Gardner4">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Gardner5">[31]</xref>. Surprisingly, the parametric analysis suggested that Hmp remains dominant at O<sub>2</sub> concentrations as low as 25 µM (∼14% air saturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Schmidt1">[32]</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). To experimentally confirm that this was the case, we adjusted the experimental setup by adding N<sub>2</sub>-bubbling at a rate of 1 ml/s. In the presence of wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> at an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.05, an O<sub>2</sub> concentration of 35 µM was achieved and maintained constant throughout the time course of a DPTA experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003049.s008">Figure S8</xref>). This concentration was over 5-fold less than air-saturated media (185 µM), but also above the 25 µM used in the parametric analysis. Due to the adjustment in experimental conditions, the model was similarly optimized for NO• dynamics from microaerobic wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> cultures (Material and methods), and found to capture the data very well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). We note that N<sub>2</sub>-bubbling increased fluctuations in the NO• measurements, but the increased error was minor compared to the range of NO• concentrations investigated. Using the optimized model, we predicted the effect of genetic deletions of <italic>norV</italic> and <italic>hmp</italic> on the NO• dynamics. Consistent with the previous parametric analysis, NorV was identified as a negligible consumption pathway under microaerobic conditions (35 µM O<sub>2</sub>), whereas Hmp was identified as the major NO• sink. These predictions were experimentally validated, and the results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g007">Figures 7B and 7C</xref>. These data demonstrate that the model is useful for studying sub-aerobic environmental conditions, and that the switch between Hmp-dominated and NorV-dominated NO• consumption regimes occurs at very low O<sub>2</sub> concentrations.</p>

Loss of NO• to the gas phase was predicted to largely increase for all strains (26% and 27% of the total NO• consumption for wild-type and Δ<italic>norV</italic>, respectively, and 95% for Δ<italic>hmp</italic>), due to the increased air-liquid surface area caused by the bubbling of N<sub>2</sub> through the culture, as well as the reduced rate of autoxidation. Autoxidation was predicted to have negligible NO• consumption activity compared to the cellular and gas transport pathways (0.5% of the total for wild-type and Δ<italic>norV</italic>, and 1.2% for Δ<italic>hmp</italic>), owing to the reduced O<sub>2</sub> concentration, as well as the lower peak NO• concentration (∼4.5 µM for all strains) than was achieved under aerobic, non-bubbling conditions using DPTA (∼8–10 µM). Cellular consumption of NO• was still predicted to be the greatest sink of NO• for the wild-type and Δ<italic>norV</italic> strains (accounting for 74% and 73% of the total consumption, respectively), but only a minor pathway in the Δ<italic>hmp</italic> culture (3.8%). The intracellular distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g007">Figure 7</xref>) for wild-type and Δ<italic>norV</italic> cultures were still predicted to be dominated by Hmp detoxification (both exceeding 98% of intracellular NO• consumed by Hmp), as was seen under aerobic conditions. The NO• consumed by Δ<italic>hmp</italic> cells, however, was now predicted to occur primarily through NorV reduction (93% of the intracellular NO•), compared to the 14% contribution predicted for Δ<italic>hmp</italic> in aerobic conditions. Overall, the simulation results predicted Hmp to be the primary mode of NO• consumption under O<sub>2</sub> concentrations as low as 35 µM, but suggested an increased role of NorV reduction in the event that Hmp detoxification becomes unavailable.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>NO• is a critical antimicrobial of the innate immune response whose utility originates from its ability to diffuse through cellular membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Denicola1">[33]</xref>, deactivate bacterial enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Ren1">[26]</xref>, inhibit respiration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Yu1">[28]</xref>, and react with O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>•<sup>−</sup> to yield the reactive nitrogen species, NO<sub>2</sub>•, N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and ONOO<sup>−</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Fang1">[24]</xref>. The biochemical reaction network of NO• includes both spontaneous and enzymatic reactions involving many short-lived species that decompose to several common end-products <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Lim1">[4]</xref>. Increasing the complexity of this system is the continuous degradation and repair of damaged biomolecules, which regenerates targets for NO• and its reactive intermediates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Yang1">[34]</xref>. A quantitative description of how NO• distributes among these many pathways is critical to understanding immune function and pathogenesis, as well as to designing NO•-based and NO•-synergizing therapeutics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Bryk1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Sulemankhil1">[37]</xref>. However, the complexity of the NO• reaction network renders exhaustive experimental monitoring infeasible, and interpretation of measurements difficult <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Lim1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Lewis1">[6]</xref>. To address these challenges, experimentally-informed computational models are required to explore the NO• reaction network.</p>
<p>Though several kinetic models have been developed to study the chemistry of NO• in biological systems, of which the majority are mammalian, none have had sufficient breadth and depth to address the full range of effects of NO• exposure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Toledo1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Nathan1">[38]</xref>. The model presented here is far more comprehensive than those constructed previously, incorporating the damage, modification, and repair of biomolecules, as well as enzymatic detoxification and transcriptional control. These functionalities allow focused investigation of intracellular components of the NO• network, such as [Fe-S] cluster and DNA damage, but also culture-wide prediction of the NO• distribution. We validated the utility of the model by demonstrating that it can reproduce NO• dynamics in a bacterial culture, make accurate predictions regarding large perturbations to the system, and identify parameters that control the distribution of NO• in bacterial cultures. Specifically, model simulations predicted that NO• autoxidation and Hmp-catalyzed detoxification were the primary sinks for NO• consumption in aerobic wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> cultures. Oxidation of NO• has been shown in the past to be a major contributor to the consumption of NO• under certain conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Lancaster1">[3]</xref>, and the dominant role of Hmp in aerobic detoxification is in agreement with previous studies that have demonstrated its importance in tolerating NO• stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Stevanin1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Gardner3">[23]</xref>. In addition, we used the model to (1) uncover a novel dependency of Hmp utility on the NO• delivery rate, and (2) discover that Hmp is the dominant cellular NO• detoxification system at dissolved O<sub>2</sub> concentrations as low as 35 µM (microaerobic). Both of these predictions were validated experimentally, thereby demonstrating the utility of the model for the study of NO• metabolism. Specifically, when treated with a fast-releasing NO• donor (PAPA), the consumption of NO• and recovery from bacteriostasis was far more similar between wild-type and Δ<italic>hmp E. coli</italic> than with a slower NO• donor (DPTA). This effect arises from substrate inhibition of the Hmp active site caused by high NO•/O<sub>2</sub> concentration ratios and the time required to synthesize Hmp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Gardner3">[23]</xref>. An effect of NO• delivery on its toxicity has been observed previously in a mammalian system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Wang1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Li1">[40]</xref>, where it was shown that killing of human lymphoblastoid cells (TK6 and NH32) was a function of both NO• concentration and cumulative dose. Here, we have demonstrated an influence of NO• delivery rate on the dynamics of NO• consumption and recovery in bacterial cultures, and also offered a detailed, mechanistic description of the observed dependence. In addition, we discovered that Hmp remains the major cellular detoxification system at dissolved O<sub>2</sub> concentrations as low as 35 µM. This effect originates from the strong induction of Hmp expression upon NO• exposure even under anaerobic conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Pullan1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Justino1">[42]</xref>, and the rapid O<sub>2</sub>-mediated deactivation of NorV, the alternative NO• detoxification system that has been previously identified as critical for resisting NO• stress under anaerobic conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Gardner2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Gardner5">[31]</xref>. These data demonstrate the flexibility of this method to different environmental conditions (microaerobic), and provide support for the role of Hmp as a virulence factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Karlinsey1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Bateman1">[44]</xref>, since O<sub>2</sub> concentrations at infections sites/in macrophages and neutrophils are typically hypoxic (less than 50 µM O<sub>2</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Lim1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Sitkovsky1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Wardman1">[46]</xref>). Interestingly, both NorV- and Hmp-type enzymes have been found to be virulence factors for numerous organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Friedman1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Bang1">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Sebbane1">[50]</xref>, and thus a quantitative understanding of the conditions under which each contributes to NO• clearance would be valuable for the study of their importance to virulence.</p>
<p>The work presented here demonstrates the predictive accuracy and utility of a comprehensive model of NO• metabolism in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The scope of this model allows for detailed, quantitative exploration of numerous NO• network features and environmental conditions, including future investigations of the roles of O<sub>2</sub> concentration and indirect NO• delivery, such as that observed for S-nitrosothiols <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Pullan1">[41]</xref>. Further, this model will prove useful for the optimization of NO•-synergizing and NO•-based therapeutics, which are being investigated as antibiotic alternatives for the treatment of both gram-positive and gram-negative infections, including those caused by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>E. coli</italic>, and <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Bryk1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Sulemankhil1">[37]</xref>. Such therapies include NO•-releasing nanoparticles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Friedman1">[36]</xref>, NO•-releasing dressings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Sulemankhil1">[37]</xref>, and rhodanines, which kill non-replicating mycobacteria through the potentiation of host-derived NO• <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Bryk1">[35]</xref>. Interestingly, the study by Sulemankhil and colleagues identified NO• release rate and dosage as important parameters governing the effectiveness of the examined dressings. The modeling approach presented here could provide a more quantitative understanding of how these potential therapeutics neutralize pathogens, and would prove useful for identifying methods to increase their potency through the quantitative identification of the NO• distribution pathways used by specific organisms. To achieve this potential utility, the modeling method described here must be adapted for use in organisms other than <italic>E. coli</italic>. To do this, the enzymatic reactions within the model would need to be removed, replaced, or augmented based on the systems harbored by the pathogen of interest, and uncertain parameters would need to be identified by training the model on experimental data, as performed here. In the event that an important reaction is missing from a model, stable NO• end products (such as NO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>) would be measured and both metabolic databases and the organism's genome would be mined for model additions capable of capturing the experimental data. Potential additions would then be experimentally validated by measuring <italic>in vitro</italic> kinetics of samples purified from cultures of interest. Execution of these steps will produce models of NO• metabolism in pathogens, that will mirror utility and capabilities achieved by the kinetic platform described here.</p>

<p><italic>E. coli</italic> from a frozen −80°C stock were inoculated into 1 ml of fresh LB broth and grown for 4 hours at 37°C and 250 r.p.m. 10 µl of the LB culture were used to inoculate 1 ml of MOPS minimal media (Teknova) containing 10 mM glucose. The minimal glucose culture was grown at 37°C and 250 r.p.m. overnight (16 h) and used to inoculate 20 ml fresh MOPS glucose (10 mM) in a 250 ml baffled shake flask to a final OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.01. The flask culture was grown at 37°C and 250 r.p.m. to exponential phase (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.2), at which point 4 ml was transferred to separate microcentrifuge tubes in 1 ml aliquots and centrifuged at 15,000 r.p.m. for 3 min at 37°C. To remove the culture media, 980 µl of the supernatant was removed and cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of pre-warmed (37°C) 10 mM MOPS glucose media. Samples were combined in a 15 ml Falcon tube, and returned to the shaker (37°C, 250 r.p.m.). After 5 minutes, the resuspended culture was diluted to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.03 in fresh, pre-warmed (37°C) MOPS glucose (10 mM) in a 50 ml Falcon tube with a final culture volume of 10 ml. The culture was stirred with a sterilized magnetic stirring bar, and immersed in a stirred water bath to maintain the temperature at 37°C. Growth was monitored until the OD<sub>600</sub> reached a value of 0.05 (approximately 45 minutes after diluting to OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.03), at which time the NO• donor solution (DPTA or PAPA) was added. On the day of use, the NONOate powder was dissolved in a chilled (4°C), sterile solution of 10 mM NaOH in deionized H<sub>2</sub>O, and stored on ice prior to delivery. After NONOate delivery, every half-hour (DPTA) or twenty minutes (PAPA), 75 µl aliquots were removed to measure the OD<sub>600</sub> (Synergy H1 Microplate Reader, BioTek Instruments, Inc.). The concentration of NO• in the culture was monitored continuously over the course of the experiment using an ISO-NOP NO• sensor (World Precision Instruments, Inc.). The electrode was calibrated daily, prior to use, according to the manufacturer's specifications.</p>
<p>The microaerobic NO• consumption assay was performed using the same procedure, except N<sub>2</sub> bubbling was included to reduce the dissolved O<sub>2</sub> concentration. Immediately following the dilution of cells to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.03 in the 50 ml Falcon tube, N<sub>2</sub> gas (99.998% pure) was bubbled into the culture through a sterile pipet tip at a constant flow rate of 1 ml/s.

<p>Optimization of model parameters was performed in Matlab using the <italic>lsqcurvefit</italic> function, which solves nonlinear least-squares minimization problems.

Since the nonlinearity of the minimization problem gives rise to local minima, we performed 100 independent optimizations, each initialized with a random set of parameter values (within their allowed range).</p>
<p>The parameter optimization procedure was used to determine the values of extracellular parameters specific to our experimental system: NO• donor dissociation (<italic>k</italic><sub>NONOate</sub>), transfer of NO• to the gas phase (<italic>k</italic><sub>L</sub><italic>a</italic><sub>NO•</sub>), and the rate of NO• autoxidation (<italic>k</italic><sub>NO•-O2</sub>). Cell-free growth media was treated with 0.5 mM DPTA under conditions identical to the aerobic NO• consumption assay, and the resulting NO• concentration profile and final (10 h) NO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> concentrations were measured.

<p>Of the cellular-related model parameters, 39 were classified as uncertain due to variability or unavailability in literature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003049.s018">Table S4</xref>).

<p>For the microaerobic (35 µM O<sub>2</sub>) NO• consumption assay, uncertain parameters were re-optimized for the low-O<sub>2</sub> environment due to expected changes in cellular properties and the effect of N<sub>2</sub> bubbling on gas transfer rates. We note that differences in N<sub>2</sub> bubble properties (such as bubble size and lifetime) caused by the presence of cells prevented the use of cell-free NO• measurements in determining extracellular parameters for this experimental setup. Instead, the simulated O<sub>2</sub> concentration was fixed to 35 µM based on experimental observations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003049.s008">Figure S8</xref>), and the remaining extracellular and uncertain parameters (total of 42 parameters) were simultaneously optimized to best capture the NO• concentration curve measured for wild-type cells treated with DPTA under microaerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003049.s021">Table S7</xref>). The optimal set of parameter values was able to accurately capture the experimentally-measured NO• dynamics in the microaerobic environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003049-g007">Figure 7</xref>).

The alternative models were constructed and adapted to our experimental system using the following procedure. Starting with the model presented in this study, all reactions absent in the alternative model were eliminated, except the release of NO• from a NONOate, and the NO• and O<sub>2</sub> liquid-gas transport reactions. Reactions present in the alternative model that were not included in the present model (due to the consumption or production of an unknown or nonspecific species, or the simplification of a more complex process in the present model) were added to the adapted model. For Lancaster's model, the NO• formation and disappearance reactions, as well as the disappearance of NO<sub>2</sub>• and •OH, were not included because the rates of the disappearance reactions are user-defined, and the formation of NO• is accounted for by the NONOate dissociation reaction. The model described by Nalwaya and Deen contains a simplified reaction representing the consumption of NO• by a heme- and flavin-dependent dioxygenase, analogous to Hmp detoxification in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The reaction was included in the adapted model, and the associated bimolecular rate constant was allowed to vary during parameter optimization. Additionally, the rate parameters governing ONOO<sup>−</sup> and ONOOH reactions used by Nalwaya and Deen were adjusted for a pH of 7.6, where the fraction of ONOO<sup>−</sup> in protonated form was calculated to be 12% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Nalwaya1">[9]</xref>. Although Nalwaya and Deen do not include NO• autoxidation in their model, it was incorporated into the adapted version, as autoxidation is an important effect under the aerobic experimental conditions used in this study.</p>
<p>Species concentrations in the alternative models were set to the same values or ranges used in the present model, except for a few minor differences. The concentrations of proteins and transition metal centers (M<sup>n+</sup>) in the model of Lim <italic>et al.</italic> were allowed a range of 5–8 mM and 1–500 µM, respectively. The protein concentration range was selected based on typical protein content reported for <italic>E. coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Sundararaj1">[119]</xref>, while M<sup>n+</sup> was allowed the same concentration range as [Fe-S] clusters in the present model, which assumes ∼5% of proteins contain [Fe-S] clusters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003049-Fontecave1">[120]</xref>.</p>
<p>The three adapted models were subjected to a parameter optimization procedure analogous to that used for the model presented here (see “Parameter optimization” section above), where parameters classified as uncertain were varied to minimize the SSR between the predicted and experimental [NO•] curves. Ultimately, none of the three adapted models were able to capture the dynamics of NO• measured in wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> cultures, yielding [NO•] curves with SSR values that were 200-fold (Lim <italic>et al.</italic> and Lancaster) and 70-fold (Nalwaya and Deen) greater than the SSR achieved by the present model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003049.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>

In the first tier, reactions were sequentially deleted from the original network in a random order. After each reaction deletion, the SSR between the simulated and experimentally-measured [NO•] curve for DPTA-treated wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> was calculated. If the SSR exceeded a 5% increase over the original SSR, the reaction deletion was undone. This process was repeated until no remaining reactions could be removed without exceeding the 5% increase in SSR. The entire model reduction process was repeated for a total of 100 iterations, each following a random sequence of reaction deletions. The reduced reaction network was selected as the set containing the least number of reactions. In the event of two or more minimum sets, the network yielding the lowest SSR was chosen.</p>
<p>In the second tier, the minimal reaction network was further reduced through a similar reaction deletion process, except with the inclusion of a parameter optimization step.
