<p>Par-1 regulates the Hippo signaling pathway in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> by modifying the phosphorylation status of Hippo and also by inhibiting the interaction of Hippo and Salvador.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>The evolutionarily conserved Hippo (Hpo) signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in organ size control by balancing cell proliferation and cell death. Here, we reported the identification of Par-1 as a regulator of the Hpo signaling pathway using a gain-of-function EP screen in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Overexpression of Par-1 elevated Yorkie activity, resulting in increased Hpo target gene expression and tissue overgrowth, while loss of Par-1 diminished Hpo target gene expression and reduced organ size. We demonstrated that <italic>par-1</italic> functioned downstream of <italic>fat</italic> and <italic>expanded</italic> and upstream of <italic>hpo</italic> and <italic>salvador</italic> (<italic>sav</italic>). In addition, we also found that Par-1 physically interacted with Hpo and Sav and regulated the phosphorylation of Hpo at Ser30 to restrict its activity. Par-1 also inhibited the association of Hpo and Sav, resulting in Sav dephosphorylation and destabilization. Furthermore, we provided evidence that Par-1-induced Hpo regulation is conserved in mammalian cells. Taken together, our findings identified Par-1 as a novel component of the Hpo signaling network.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>An organism's organ size is determined by cell number, the size of each cell, and the distance between cells. All of these factors are controlled by the coordination of different cell signaling pathways and other mechanisms. The Hippo signaling pathway controls organ size by restricting the number of cells that make up the organ. Malfunction of this pathway leads to abnormal overgrowth, and is involved in a large number of human diseases and cancers. We identify here a component of the Hippo pathway, Par-1, which controls tissue growth by negatively regulating the Hippo pathway. We show that overexpression or depletion of Par-1 influences tissue growth in fruit flies via Hippo signaling. Then, by genetic and biochemical experiments, we show that Par-1 interacts with Hippo, regulating the Hippo Ser30 phosphorylation status to alter Hippo activity. In addition, we found that Par-1 regulates Hippo signaling via inhibition of the Hippo-Salvador association in a kinase-dependent fashion. We predict that Par-1 is a potential oncogene and that its regulatory role in Hippo signaling could be conserved.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The control of organ size, which requires the delicate coordination of cell growth, cell proliferation, and cell death, is a fascinating biological process. The identification of the Hippo (Hpo) signaling pathway has shed some light on this biological phenomenon. The Hpo pathway has emerged as an evolutionarily conserved pathway that controls organ size during animal development. It regulates tissue growth by balancing cell proliferation and apoptosis and has also been implicated in stem cell maintenance, tissue homeostasis, and repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Halder1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Irvine1">[4]</xref>. In addition, it has been reported to play a role in cell contact-dependent growth inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Zhao2">[5]</xref>. Accumulating evidence has suggested that mutations and malfunctions of the components of the Hpo pathway result in a wide range of human cancers and diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Pan1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>The Hpo pathway can be divided into three parts: upstream regulatory inputs, core kinase cassette, and downstream transcriptional output <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Yin1">[2]</xref>. Core to the Hpo pathway is the kinase cascade, which acts sequentially to inhibit the nuclear translocation and activity of the growth-promoting transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (Yki) or Yap/TAZ (mammalian homologue of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Yki) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Huang1">[7]</xref>. The core kinase cascade of the Hpo pathway consists of four tumor suppressor proteins, including two kinases, the serine/threonine Ste20-like kinase Hpo or its mammalian homologues MST1/2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Harvey1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Wu1">[12]</xref>, and the nuclear Dbf-2-related (NDR) family kinase Warts (Wts) or its mammalian homologues LATS1/2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Xu1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Justice1">[14]</xref>, and the scaffold proteins of the kinases, Salvador (Sav) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Tapon1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-KangoSingh1">[16]</xref> and Mob as tumor suppressors (Mats) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Lai1">[17]</xref>. Hpo phosphorylates and activates Wts via the formation of a complex with Sav <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Tapon1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Oh1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Ren1">[19]</xref>. Wts functions in a complex with Mats to restrict the nuclear translocation of Yki by phosphorylating Yki at multiple sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Huang1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Lai1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Ren1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Zhang1">[20]</xref>. In the absence of suppression from the Hpo pathway, Yki associates with transcription factors, primarily Scalloped (Sd) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Zhang1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Goulev1">[22]</xref> and other factors, including Homothorax <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Peng1">[23]</xref>, Teashirt, and Mad <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Alarcon1">[24]</xref>, in the nucleus to promote proliferation and to inhibit apoptosis by inducing the expression of target genes, such as <italic>bantam</italic>, <italic>cyclinE</italic>, and <italic>diap1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Thompson1">[25]</xref>. Comparing the clear linear relationship between the core kinase cassette and the downstream transcriptional output, this pathway is regulated by multiple upstream regulatory branches, such as the Merlin-Expanded(Ex)-Kibra complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Yu1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Baumgartner1">[29]</xref>, Fat (ft) and Dachsous <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Bennett1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Silva1">[33]</xref>, Crumbs and the Lgl-Scrib-Dlg complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Grzeschik1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Robinson1">[35]</xref>, and, the most recently identified, Echinoid and Tao-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Yue1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Poon1">[38]</xref>.</p>
<p>Several recent proteome-wide phosphorylation studies, which have uncovered a large number of previously unknown phosphorylation events in Hpo signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Bodenmiller1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Zhai1">[40]</xref>, have indicated the involvement of a large number of unknown participants in the Hpo pathway. To identify novel pathway modulators, we performed a gain-of-function EP screen and identified Par-1 as a novel Hpo pathway regulator. Par-1 is a multifunctional serine/threonine kinase containing an N-terminal conserved catalytic domain, a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain adjacent to the catalytic domain, and a kinase associated domain 1 (KA1 domain) within the last 40 amino-acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Tassan1">[41]</xref>. Par-1 plays a major role in anterior/posterior (A/P) axis formation and germline determinant polarization, and it also regulates diverse cellular processes, including microtubule dynamics and neuronal polarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Huynh1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Biernat1">[47]</xref>. Although Par-1 is involved in multicellular processes, little is known regarding the function of Par-1 in disease and tumor formation. Hyper-phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein Tau by microtubule affinity regulating kinase, the homolog of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Par-1 (MARK) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Drewes1">[48]</xref>, which is activated by upstream kinases, such as LKB1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Katajisto1">[49]</xref> and Tao-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Timm1">[50]</xref>, results in microtubule depolymerization and abnormal aggregation of Tau in Alzheimer disease. Additionally, MARK4 has been reported to be involved in hepatocellular carcinogenesis and gliomagenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Kato1">[51]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Magnani1">[52]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study, we identified Par-1 as a negative regulator of the Hpo kinase complex. We found that overexpression of Par-1 drove tissue overgrowth and upregulated the expression of Hpo pathway-responsive genes. Moreover, knockdown of Par-1 blocked tissue growth and downregulated the expression of Hpo pathway-responsive genes. We demonstrated that <italic>par-1</italic> functioned downstream of <italic>ex</italic> and <italic>ft</italic> but upstream of <italic>hpo</italic> and <italic>sav</italic>. We also provided evidence that Par-1 associated with the Hpo-Sav complex and regulated the phosphorylation of Hpo at Ser30 to regulate Hpo activity. Furthermore, we found that Par-1 promoted the dissociation of Sav from the Hpo-Sav complex, eventually resulting in Sav dephosphorylation and destabilization. Thus, these results identified Par-1 as a novel regulator of the Hpo signaling pathway and supported a model by which Par-1 regulates Hpo phosphorylation and Hpo-Sav association to control organ growth.</p>

<title>Par-1 EP Lines Promote Growth via Hpo Signaling</title>
<p>To identify novel candidates of the Hpo pathway, we performed an overexpression screen in which flies carrying <italic>GMR-Gal4</italic> and <italic>UAS-Yki</italic> (referred to as <italic>GMR-Yki</italic>) were crossed with a collection of EP lines. Overexpression of <italic>UAS-Yki</italic> posterior to the morphogenetic furrow (MF) under the control of the <italic>GMR-Gal4</italic> driver (<italic>GMR-Yki</italic>) resulted in enlarged eyes (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g001">Figure 1A′ with 1A</xref>), providing a sensitive background for a genetic modifier screen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Jin1">[53]</xref>. Each EP line was crossed with <italic>GMR-Yki</italic> flies, and the F1 progeny was screened for an increase in eye size. From more than 10,000 EP lines, we screened numerous lines that enhanced the overgrowth phenotype induced by Yki overexpression. We then analyzed the UAS element insertion sites of these lines and found that the insertion sites of L[484], L[507], and F[727] were all within the 5′ UTR region of the <italic>par-1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Although these three EP lines did not display an overgrowth phenotype when driven by <italic>GMR-Gal4</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> eyes (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g001">Figure 1B with 1A</xref>, and unpublished data), these lines dramatically enhanced the <italic>GMR-Yki</italic>-induced overgrowth phenotype (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g001">Figure 1B′ with 1A′</xref>, and unpublished data). In addition, the expression of these lines driven under the wing-specific Gal4 driver <italic>MS1096</italic> produced enlarged adult wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g001">Figure 1D–1D″</xref>), indicating that the candidate genes expressed in these lines may play a role in organ size control. To determine whether the UAS element of these lines regulated <italic>par-1</italic> gene expression, real-time PCR analysis was performed for the L[484] line. The mRNA level of <italic>par-1</italic> was significantly upregulated when the L[484] line was crossed with <italic>MS1096</italic>, whereas the mRNA level of genes located proximal to <italic>par-1</italic>, <italic>mei-W68</italic>, and <italic>hpo</italic>, demonstrated a slight or no change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g001">Figure 1E</xref>), suggesting that ectopic Par-1 expression could be responsible for the tissue overgrowth phenotype that we observed.</p>

<p>To determine whether overexpression of L[484] promoted tissue growth via Hpo signaling, the L[484] line was expressed under the control of the <italic>hh-Gal4</italic> driver, which drives gene expression in the posterior compartment (P-compartment).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, in S2 cells, coexpression of Yki and Sd activated the luciferase reporter gene (<italic>3×Sd2-Luc</italic>), which was greatly promoted by Par-1, indicating that Par-1 enhanced the activity of the Sd-Yki transcriptional complex <italic>in vitro</italic>. To further determine the functional relationship between Par-1 and the Hpo pathway <italic>in vivo</italic>, Myc tagged Par-1 transgenic flies were generated. Consistent with the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g001">Figure 1A–1B′</xref>, overexpression of two copies of <italic>UAS-Myc-Par-1</italic>, using the <italic>GMR-Gal4</italic> driver (referred to as <italic>GMR/2*Myc-Par-1</italic>), resulted in rough eyes without a discernible overgrowth (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g002">Figure 2B′ with 2B</xref>), while coexpression of <italic>UAS-Myc-Par-1</italic> with <italic>GMR-Yki</italic> enhanced the overgrowth phenotype caused by <italic>GMR-Yki</italic> (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g002">Figure 2C′ with 2C</xref>). Although <italic>GMR/2*Myc-Par-1</italic> did not induce a discernible overgrowth phenotype in the eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g002">Figure 2B′</xref>), the expression of two copies of <italic>UAS-Myc-Par-1</italic>, using the <italic>MS1096</italic> driver (referred to as <italic>MS1096/2*Myc-Par-1</italic>), resulted in enlarged wings and caused a wing bending-down phenotype, which indicated an expansion of the wing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g002">Figure 2D′″</xref> and compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g002">Figure 2D′ with 2D and 2E′ with 2E</xref>).

Taken together, these results suggested that overexpression of Par-1 promoted tissue overgrowth by inhibiting Hpo pathway activity.</p>

<p>Considering that the Ser/Thr kinase activity of Par-1 was important for its function in polarity regulation, we speculated that the function of Par-1 in Hpo signaling might also be dependent on its kinase activity. To examine this hypothesis, we first constructed a kinase-dead form of Par-1 (Par-1-KD), which contained the T408A and S412A mutations. Par-1, containing these two mutations, was thought to be a kinase inactive mutant because the activation loop of the catalytic domain was disrupted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Vaccari1">[54]</xref>. This was confirmed by an <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay in which the kinase activity of Par-1-KD was completely abolished (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001620.s001">Figure S1D</xref>). Unlike the phenotype observed with the expression of two copies of the Par-1 transgenes, the expression of two copies of the Par-1-KD transgenes had no obvious effect on either eye growth or wing growth and did not dramatically enhance the overgrowth phenotype induced by Yki overexpression (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g002">Figure 2B″, 2C″ with 2B–2B′, 2C–2C′ and 2D″, 2E″ with 2D–2D′, 2E–2E′</xref>). Importantly, to exclude the possibility that the functional variation between Par-1 and Par-1-KD was due to a low expression level of Par-1-KD, we compared the overexpressed Par-1 and Par-1-KD protein levels in both the eye and wing imaginal discs using direct Western blot analysis. We found that the overexpression level of Par-1-KD was higher compared to Par-1, verifying that the functional variation did not result from a low Par-1-KD expression level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001620.s001">Figure S1E–S1F</xref>). Furthermore, Par-1-KD failed to elevate Ex and Diap1 expression in flip-out clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g002">Figure 2G–2G′ and 2I–2I′</xref>). Taken together, these observations demonstrated that overexpression of Par-1 promoted tissue overgrowth by promoting the activity of the Sd-Yki complex and upregulating the expression of Hpo pathway-responsive genes in a kinase-dependent fashion.</p>

<title>Loss of Par-1 Inhibits Tissue Growth by Downregulating Hpo Pathway Targets</title>
<p>To determine whether Par-1 is necessary for normal growth, we examined the effect of the loss-of-function of Par-1 on Hpo signaling. By expressing <italic>UAS-Par-1-RNAi</italic> under the control of <italic>eyeless-Gal4 (ey-Gal4)</italic> or <italic>MS1096</italic>, adult eye/wing sizes were reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g003">Figure 3A–3B″</xref>), suggesting that Par-1 (activity) was required for normal eye and wing development. Par-1 RNAi efficiency was also confirmed by <italic>in vivo</italic> staining, in which Par-1-RNAi transgenes were expressed under the control of <italic>hh-Gal4</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001620.s002">Figure S2B–S2B′</xref>, endogenous Par-1 protein levels were efficiently knocked down by expressing Par-1-RNAi in the P-compartment. In addition, shrinkage of the P-compartment was also observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001620.s002">Figure S2B–S2B′</xref>). To eliminate the concern regarding Par-1 RNAi off-target effects, a second line of Par-1 RNAi (Par-1-RNAi-2), which targets a different region of Par-1, was generated. Par-1-RNAi-2 also efficiently knocked down endogenous Par-1 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001620.s002">Figure S2C–S2C′</xref>) and restricted wing growth when expressed by <italic>MS1096</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001620.s002">Figure S2D–S2D′</xref>).

The representative <italic>par-1</italic> mutant clone and its twin spot were separately indicated by the white dashed line and red dashed line (C). The total area of the <italic>par-1</italic> mutant clones or their twin spots within one eye disc were calculated (C′).

<p>We further tested whether knockdown of Par-1 resulted in downregulation of Hpo pathway-responsive genes. Expression of either <italic>UAS-Par-1-RNAi</italic> or <italic>UAS-Par-1-RNAi-2</italic> by <italic>hh-Gal4</italic> resulted in diminished levels of <italic>EX-Z</italic>, DIAP1, and <italic>diap1-GFP3.5</italic> and a reduced P-compartment size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g003">Figures 3E–3E′, 3H–3H′</xref>, and S2E–S2E′, S2F–S2F″). Consistent with these results, a bantam sensor (<italic>mic32-GFP</italic>) signal was upregulated in Par-1-RNAi flip-out clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g003">Figure 3F–3F′</xref>) or wing discs expressing Par-1-RNAi-2 by <italic>hh-Gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001620.s002">Figure S2G–S2G″</xref>), suggesting a restriction of microRNA <italic>bantam</italic> expression by knockdown of Par-1. Thus, this evidence suggested that the inactivation of Par-1 resulted in abnormal growth by antagonizing the expression of Hpo-responsive genes. To further strengthen this conclusion, the expression of Hpo-responsive genes was examined in <italic>par-1<sup>w3</sup></italic> mosaic clones. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g003">Figure 3I–3I″ and 3J–3J″</xref>, in <italic>par-1</italic> null clones, the <italic>diap1</italic> transcriptional level was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g003">Figure 3I–3I″</xref>), and <italic>bantam-lacZ</italic> was decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g003">Figure 3J–3J″</xref>). Importantly, the size of the <italic>par-1</italic> null clones was significantly reduced compared to their twin spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g003">Figure 3C–3C′</xref>), indicating a proliferation disadvantage for <italic>par-1</italic> null clones. Taken together, these observations demonstrated that <italic>par-1</italic> was essential for normal growth and that perturbation of Par-1 expression resulted in growth suppression and apoptosis by stimulating the Hpo pathway.</p>

<p>Given the findings presented in the previous section, we next determined the functional relationship between Par-1 and Hpo pathway components by identifying the genetic interactions of Par-1 in the Hpo pathway. We first examined whether the function of Par-1 was dependent on the activity of the Sd-Yki transcriptional complex because this complex was the main downstream effector of the Hpo pathway. Although expression of two copies of <italic>UAS-Myc-Par-1</italic> in flip-out clones increased <italic>diap1-lacZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001620.s003">Figure S3A–S3A′</xref>), no increase in <italic>diap1-lacZ</italic> was detected when <italic>UAS-Yki-RNAi</italic> was coexpressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001620.s003">Figure S3B–S3B′</xref>). Coexpression of <italic>UAS-Sd-RNAi</italic> suppressed the overgrowth phenotype induced by Par-1 overexpression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> wings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001620.s003">Figure S3C–S3C′</xref>). In addition, the elevated levels of <italic>diap1</italic> transcription caused by Par-1 overexpression were reverted by coexpression of Sd RNAi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001620.s003">Figure S3D–S3F′</xref>). Furthermore, ectopic Yki expression reverted downregulated DIAP1 levels and the shrunken P-compartment phenotype induced by the expression of Par-1 RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g004">Figure 4A–4B′</xref>). These results indicated that <italic>par-1</italic> functioned upstream of the Sd-Yki transcription complex in the Hpo pathway. To strengthen this conclusion, the levels of phosphorylated Yki, which reflected Hpo/Wts activity, were examined. As expected, Par-1, but not Par-1-KD, reduced phosphorylated Yki levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). In addition, Par-1 also inhibited the Hpo/Wts signaling-induced Yki mobility shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g005">Figure 5I</xref>, lanes 2–5). These findings suggested that Par-1 functioned upstream of <italic>yki</italic> to affect the activity of the Sd-Yki transcription complex. We next examined the genetic epistasis between Par-1 and the upstream components of the Hpo pathway. We found that elevated DIAP1 levels and the enlarged P-compartment size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g004">Figure 4D–4D′</xref>), resulting from ex RNAi expression by <italic>hh-Gal4</italic>, were suppressed by coexpression of the Par-1 RNAi transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g004">Figure 4E–4E′</xref>), suggesting that Par-1 functioned downstream of <italic>ex</italic>. In addition, coexpression of Par-1 RNAi suppressed ex RNAi-induced wing overgrowth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001620.s003">Figure S3G–S3G′″</xref>). Furthermore, Par-1 RNAi also suppressed Ft RNAi-induced wing overgrowth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001620.s003">Figure S3H–S3H′″</xref>). These observations supported the notion that <italic>par-1</italic> functioned downstream of or in parallel to <italic>ex</italic> and <italic>ft</italic>.</p>

<p>We then determined whether Par-1 regulated the Hpo pathway via Wts, which phosphorylates Yki at Ser168 to retain Yki in the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Ren1">[19]</xref>. By generating Par-1 RNAi clones in eye discs using the mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker (MARCM) technique, we found that the size of Par-1 RNAi clones was extremely small compared to that of the control clones (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g004">Figure 4F′ with 4F</xref>), indicating adverse development of the Par-1 RNAi clones. Strikingly, we found that knockout of <italic>wts</italic> rescued the adverse developmental phenotypes of the Par-1 RNAi clones and that the size of the <italic>wts</italic> mutant clones expressing Par-1 RNAi was more comparable to that of the <italic>wts</italic> clones, rather than that of Par-1 RNAi clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g004">Figure 4G</xref> and compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g004">Figure 4F″ with 4F′″</xref>). These findings indicated that <italic>par-1</italic> functioned upstream of <italic>wts</italic>. Because Wts was activated and phosphorylated by upstream components of the Hpo pathway, we then tested whether Par-1 regulated Wts phosphorylation.

<title>Par-1 Interacts with Hpo-Sav and Regulates the Phosphorylation of Hpo at Ser30</title>
<p>Given that Par-1 functions upstream of <italic>hpo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g004">Figure 4</xref>), we speculated that Par-1 modulated the function of the Hpo-Sav complex. To test our hypothesis, we first examined whether Par-1 bound to the Hpo-Sav complex using a co-immunoprecipitation assay. As expected, full-length Par-1 interacted with both Hpo and Sav, although these associations were weak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g005">Figure 5A–5B</xref>). In addition, we also found that the HA-tagged N-terminal fragment of Par-1 (Par-1-N, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001620.s004">Figure S4A</xref>) had a strong association with both Hpo and Sav, whereas there was only a weak interaction between the Par-1 C-terminal fragment (Par-1-C, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001620.s004">Figure S4A</xref>) and Hpo/Sav had been detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g005">Figure 5A–5B</xref>). Importantly, the interaction between Par-1 and Hpo/Sav was specific because neither the full-length nor the N-terminal fragment of Par-1 co-immunoprecipitated with Merlin (unpublished data), Wts, or Mats (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001620.s004">Figure S4B</xref>). On the basis of the previous results that Par-1 functioned in a kinase-dependent manner in Hpo signaling, we performed a phosphorylation shift experiment using a phos-tag gel to determine whether Par-1 affected the phosphorylation of Hpo and Sav <italic>in vitro</italic>. The Phos-Tag is a phosphate binding compound that, when incorporated into polyacrylamide gels, results in an exaggerated mobility shift for phosphorylated proteins, which is dependent upon the degree of phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Oh1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Kinoshita1">[55]</xref>.

However, such a mobility shift was not detected for Sav when it was cotransfected with either Par-1 or Par-1-KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, compare lanes 3–4 with lane 1). To remove the effect of Hpo auto-phosphorylation, a kinase-dead form of Hpo (Hpo-KD) was also tested in the phosphorylation shift experiment. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, Par-1 also induced Hpo-KD to generate a phosphorylation mobility shift.

<p>To identify which sites on Hpo were affected by Par-1, we cotransfected Flag tagged Hpo with HA tagged Par-1 in S2 cells. Flag-Hpo protein was then immunoprecipitated and separated using SDS-PAGE and harvested for a semi-quantitative mass spectrometric (MS) analysis (details are described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). According to the MS results, we identified four potential phosphorylation sites that were affected by Par-1 expression, S30, S66, Y365, and T615. We then generated different Hpo variants by individually mutating these candidate sites and then examined how these mutations affected Par-1-induced Hpo phosphorylation. Interestingly, only Hpo (S30A) failed to generate mobility shifts in a direct Western blot analysis compared to wild-type Hpo protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001620.s005">Figure S5C</xref>), while other Hpo mutations, T615A, S66A, and Y365E, did not affect the mobility shift upon Par-1 induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001620.s005">Figure S5B–S5C</xref>). Moreover, we also found that Hpo (S30A)-KD could not be shifted by Par-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). These results suggested that Par-1 may regulate the phosphorylation of Hpo at Ser30. To verify our prediction, an antibody that specifically recognized phosphorylated Hpo at Ser30 was generated. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g005">Figures 5E and S5D</xref>, Par-1 but not Par-1-KD was able to induce Hpo phosphorylation at Ser30. To validate the phospho-Hpo S30 antibody, a phosphatase treatment was applied. Upon phosphatase treatment, the p-Hpo(S30) band was undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g005">Figure 5E</xref>, compare lane 5 with lane 2). To further test the specificity of this antibody, we transfected Hpo(S30) mutants with Par-1.

These findings indicated that Par-1 regulated the phosphorylation of Hpo at Ser30.</p>

<title>Par-1-Induced Hpo Ser30 Phosphorylation Regulates Hpo Activity</title>
<p>In recent proteome-wide phosphorylation studies using <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Zhai1">[40]</xref>, it was suggested that Hpo was phosphorylated at Ser30 <italic>in vivo</italic>, indicating an important role for the Ser30 site in the regulation of Hpo activity. To determine the biological significance of Hpo phosphorylation at Ser30 induced by Par-1, we first detected whether Ser30 phosphorylation state affects Hpo phosphorylation at Thr195, which was important for Hpo activation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g005">Figure 5G–5H</xref>, Par-1, but not Par-1-KD, significantly inhibited Hpo phosphorylation levels at Thr195, whereas this inhibitory effect was abolished when the Ser30 site was mutated. More importantly, phosphorylation at Thr195 was slightly elevated when Ser30 was mutated into an alanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g005">Figure 5G</xref>, compare lane 4 with lane 1, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g005">Figure 5H</xref>). These findings suggested that Par-1 regulated Hpo activity via antagonizing phosphorylation at the Thr195 site by regulating Ser30 phosphorylation. It has been reported that the Hpo Thr195 site is not only auto-phosphorylated but also phosphorylated by Tao-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Boggiano1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Poon1">[38]</xref>, which is a partner of Par-1 in the regulation of microtubule dynamics. Thus, we asked whether Par-1-induced phosphorylation at Ser30 also affected Tao-1-mediated phosphorylation at Thr195. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001620.s005">Figure S5F</xref>, consistent with the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g005">Figure 5G–5H</xref>, Par-1 suppressed Tao-1-mediated phosphorylation at Thr195. The antagonistic effect of Par-1 and Tao-1 on Hpo phosphorylation at Thr195 motivated the examination of the interrelationship of Par-1 and Tao-1 in the Hpo pathway. We found that Tao-1 disrupted Par-1-induced a phosphorylation mobility shift of Hpo-KD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001620.s005">Figure S5F</xref>), suggesting that the function of Par-1 in the Hpo pathway was modulated by upstream signaling.</p>
<p>Because Hpo(S30A) demonstrated a higher activity compared to the Hpo wild type, we examined whether Hpo(S30A) exerted its inhibitory effect on Yki. We found that Hpo(S30A) resulted in a dramatic Yki mobility shift, whereas the Hpo wild type resulted in a moderate phosphorylation of Yki (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g005">Figure 5I</xref>, compare lane 2 with lane 6). Furthermore, we found that co-transfection of the Hpo(S30A) mutant blocked Par-1-induced Yki dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g005">Figure 5I</xref>, compare lane 3 with lane 7), which further confirmed our conclusion that Par-1 modulated Hpo activity by regulating Hpo phosphorylation at Ser30.</p>
<p>To further investigate the role of Par-1-induced Hpo phosphorylation at Ser30 in Hpo activity regulation, we generated transgenic flies of <italic>attB-UAS-Hpo</italic> variants at the 75B1 <italic>attP</italic> locus, which ensured equal expression of different forms of the Hpo mutant. Because the flies were grown at room temperature, overexpression of Hpo under the control of <italic>GMR-Gal4</italic>, <italic>Ci-Gal4</italic>, and <italic>hh-Gal4</italic> resulted in adult lethality; therefore, we selected weak drivers, such as <italic>C765</italic>, which induced gene expression moderately in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing to compare the activity of <italic>Hpo</italic> variants. Consistent with our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, Hpo(S30A) mutants exhibited much smaller wings compared to wild-type Hpo flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g005">Figure 5J–5K</xref>), indicating that Hpo(S30A) variants demonstrated a higher activity than wild-type Hpo <italic>in vivo</italic>. To further strengthen this conclusion, we used an inducible <italic>Ci-Gal4</italic>, which was controlled by a temperature-sensitive Gal80, to drive Hpo expression in order to exclude the early lethality. Because some progeny were viable when Hpo expression was induced after pupa formation, we then compared the activity of Hpo variants by measuring the wing size of the survivors and calculated the mortality rate. We found that survivors with Hpo expression maintained a relatively normal wing size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001620.s005">Figure S5G–S5H</xref>), while survivors with Hpo(S30A) expression demonstrated much smaller wings compared to controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001620.s005">Figure S5G–S5H</xref>). Meanwhile, Hpo(S30A) flies exhibited a higher mortality rate compared to wild-type Hpo flies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001620.s005">Figure S5I</xref>). These findings suggested that the activity of Hpo(S30A) mutants was higher compared to wild-type Hpo. Taken together, on the basis of the above biochemical and <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence, we speculated that Par-1 inhibited Hpo activity via the regulation of Hpo phosphorylation at the Ser30 site.</p>

Thus, we examined whether Par-1 induced Sav destabilization, which was dependent on the phosphorylation of the Hpo Ser30 site. Interestingly, we found that the stabilization of Sav by Hpo was not affected by Par-1-induced Hpo phosphorylation at Ser30 because Hpo(S30A) mutants were still able to stabilize Sav, and this stabilization could be reversed by Par-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001620.s006">Figure S6A</xref>). In addition to the change in Sav protein levels, Par-1 also decreased the phosphorylation status of Sav, which was induced by Hpo in a kinase-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, compare lanes 5–6 with lane 2). Given that full-length Par-1 weakly interacted with both Hpo and Sav (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g005">Figure 5A–5B</xref>), we then determined whether Par-1 affected the association between Hpo and Sav. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g006">Figure 6C</xref>, Par-1, but not Par-1-KD, impaired the association of endogenous Hpo and transfected Sav, suggesting that the interaction between Hpo and Sav was disrupted by Par-1 overexpression. To mimic the disruption of the Hpo-Sav complex, we ablated <italic>sav</italic> using the MARCM system. We found that the growth defect induced by Par-1 RNAi was incapable of inhibiting <italic>sav</italic> mutant-induced clone growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001620.s006">Figure S6B–S6C</xref>) and adult eye overgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g006">Figure 6D-–6D″</xref>), suggesting that Par-1 functioned upstream of <italic>sav</italic>.

<p>On the basis of the evidence provided above, we propose a model of how Par-1 restricts the activity of Hpo pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g006">Figure 6E</xref>).

<p>An evolutionally conserved function of Par-1 in regulating microtubule dynamics has been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Tassan1">[41]</xref>.

Since MARK4 activated YAP more than MARK1, we investigated whether MARK4 affected YAP phosphorylation. Indeed, the phosphorylation levels of YAP were significantly decreased upon MARK4 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g007">Figure 7B</xref>), indicating that MARK inhibited Hpo signaling in mammals.

We found that both MARK4 and MARK1 induced mobility shifts of MST2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g007">Figures 7C and S7B</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggested that the inhibitory function of Par-1 on Hpo signaling was conserved from <italic>Drosophila</italic> to mammals. Our study suggested that Par-1 may have a procarcinogenic role because its hyperactivation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is sufficient to induce tissue overgrowth, and in mammals, Par-1 is sufficient to activate YAP.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The Hpo signaling pathway has emerged as a conserved pathway that controls tissue growth and balances tissue homeostasis via the regulation of the downstream Sd-Yki transcription complex. Despite the importance of this pathway in development and carcinogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Yin1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Pan1">6</xref>, many unknown regulators of the Hpo pathway remain to be identified. Here, we identified Par-1 as one such Hpo pathway regulator via a genetic overexpression screen using <italic>Drosophila</italic> EP lines. In this study, we demonstrated that Par-1 was essential for the restriction of Hpo signaling. We also demonstrated that overexpression of Par-1 promoted tissue growth via the inhibition of the Hpo pathway, whereas loss of Par-1 promoted Hpo signaling to suppress growth and induce apoptosis. Using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye and wing imaginal discs as well as cultured cells, we provide the first genetic and biochemical evidence for a function of Par-1 in the Hpo pathway.</p>
<p>Although the conserved function of Hpo has been well studied, the regulatory mechanism of its kinase activity is still largely obscure. Currently, the regulatory mechanism of Hpo kinase activity was believed to mainly be dependent on autophosphorylation by altering the phosphorylation status of the Thr195 site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Boggiano1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Jin1">[53]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Liu1">[57]</xref>. However, whether the uncharacterized phosphorylation events of Hpo, which have been identified in several recent proteome-wide phosphorylation studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Bodenmiller1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Zhai1">[40]</xref>, contributed to the regulation of Hpo activity is still unknown. By studying the mechanism underlying Par-1 function in Hpo signaling, we demonstrated that Par-1 induced Hpo phosphorylation at Ser30 and this lead to the regulation of Hpo kinase activity.</p>
<p>Although we have extensively studied how Par-1 regulates the Hpo pathway in this study, several unresolved questions remain. The interaction between Par-1 and Hpo/Sav may be tightly regulated because full-length Par-1 only weakly interacted with Hpo/Sav, unlike the interaction with the N-terminal fragment of Par-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001620-g005">Figure 5A–5B</xref>). However, the triggering signal for Par-1 to interact with Hpo/Sav is still unknown. It has been reported that Par-1 was activated by Tao-1 and LKB1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Katajisto1">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Timm1">[50]</xref>. In this study, we established that Par-1 antagonized Tao-1 in Hpo signaling, and interestingly, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the antagonistic relationship between Par-1 and Tao-1 in microtubule regulation has been previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Liu1">[57]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Wang1">[59]</xref>. Thus, it is unlikely that Tao-1 functions as the trigger. We then investigated whether LKB1 functioned as an activator of Par-1 in Hpo signaling by expressing the LKB1 transgene in different organs. Unlike Par-1, ectopic LKB1 expression limited both wing and eye growth (unpublished data), indicating that LKB1 was also not the trigger.</p>
<p>We have shown that Par-1 and Tao-1 exhibited opposing effects on Hpo signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001620.s005">Figure S5F</xref>). Given that Tao-1 and Par-1 were partners that regulated microtubule dynamics via the phosphorylation of Tau <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Drewes1">[48]</xref>, Tau may have a function in Hpo signaling. To investigate this hypothesis, we employed genetic and biochemical studies and found that Tau RNAi failed to suppress the expression of Hpo pathway-responsive genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001620.s008">Figure S8A–S8B</xref>). In addition, Tau did not trigger Hpo phosphorylation and Sav dissociation <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001620.s008">Figure S8C–S8D</xref>), indicating that Par-1 regulated Hpo signaling independent of Tau. Interestingly, it has been previously suggested that Par-1 did not regulate Tau activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Doerflinger1">[46]</xref>, indicating an evolutionary difference between Par-1 and Tau-1 function.</p>
<p>We have provided evidence that Par-1 regulated Hpo signaling via the phosphorylation of Hpo or the destruction of the Hpo/Sav complex. Because Par-1 is a well-known polarity regulator and polarity components, such as Crumb and Lgl, have been shown to be involved in the Hpo signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Robinson1">[35]</xref>, it is possible that Par-1 may regulate Hpo signaling via a polarity complex, or its activity might be regulated via a polarity complex. Indeed, the localization of Crumb and Patj were affected by Par-1 expression (unpublished data). Thus, further studies on polarity complexes and Hpo signaling will help elucidate this problem.</p>

<p>Par-1 fragments were amplified from the BDGP DGC Clone (number RE47050) using the PCR. The sequence of full-length Par-1 used in this study was the same as Par-1-N1S (accession number NP_001014542). which has been previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Shulman1">[43]</xref>.

<p>The EP library for the screen was a gift from Jianming Chen (Third Institute of Oceanography, State Oceanic Administration, China). <italic>Par-1<sup>w3</sup></italic> is a null allele from the St Johnston lab, and FRT/FLP-mediated mitotic recombination was used to generate mutant clones, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Zhang1">[20]</xref>.

Par-1 RNAi fly was purchased from the Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center (stock number 32410). To generate the Par-1 RNAi-2 transgenic fly, an artificial microRNA method was adopted, which was reported to efficiently silence gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001620-Ni1">[60]</xref>. Briefly, we designed two hairpin oligos that were targeted to the 1227–1247 base pair and the 1551–1571 base pair regions of Par-1-N1S (accession number NM_001014542). Next, these two hairpin oligos were ligated to create a tandem hairpin RNA.
