<abstract>
<p>The actin cytoskeleton coordinates the organization of signaling microclusters at the immune synapse (IS); however, the mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. We show here that nitric oxide (NO) generated by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) controls the coalescence of protein kinase C-θ (PKC-θ) at the central supramolecular activation cluster (c-SMAC) of the IS. eNOS translocated with the Golgi to the IS and partially colocalized with F-actin around the c-SMAC. This resulted in reduced actin polymerization and centripetal retrograde flow of β-actin and PKC-θ from the lamellipodium-like distal (d)-SMAC, promoting PKC-θ activation. Furthermore, eNOS-derived NO S-nitrosylated β-actin on Cys374 and impaired actin binding to profilin-1 (PFN1), as confirmed with the transnitrosylating agent S-nitroso-L-cysteine (Cys-NO). The importance of NO and the formation of PFN1-actin complexes on the regulation of PKC-θ was corroborated by overexpression of PFN1- and actin-binding defective mutants of β-actin (C374S) and PFN1 (H119E), respectively, which reduced the coalescence of PKC-θ at the c-SMAC. These findings unveil a novel NO-dependent mechanism by which the actin cytoskeleton controls the organization and activation of signaling microclusters at the IS.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>T cells are an essential arm of the immunity against the invasion of pathogenic agents in organisms. These specialized cells recognize foreign antigens displayed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APC) by means of the T cell receptor (TCR). Early signaling takes place in these cells through the specific clustering of TCRs, which trigger the recruitment of signaling molecules to the immune synapse (IS), a plasma membrane–associated intercellular domain important for T cell activation. In this location, several signaling molecules that include the protein kinase C-θ (PKC-θ) form microclusters that are translocated centripetally towards the center of the IS, following the retrograde movement of actin. In this study, we show that nitric oxide (NO) formed by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) regulates the translocation of PKC-θ to the IS, increasing its activation. eNOS can effectively modify β-actin by S-nitrosylation on Cys374, reducing its ability to bind profilin-1 (PFN1)—a protein required for actin polymerization—polymerize and flow from the periphery to the central region of the IS. We propose that eNOS-derived NO controls actin polymerization via S-nitrosylation of actin as one of the major driving forces for the transport of PKC-θ towards the central area of the IS, which is essential for T cell activation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Nitric oxide (NO) is a free radical that is highly reactive against transition metals in prosthetic groups, Cys, and Tyr of proteins whose activity can be regulated by nitrosylation and nitration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref002">2</xref>]. As a signaling molecule, NO exerts important regulatory functions in T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref003">3</xref>]. In mice, low levels of NO favor T helper 1 (Th1) differentiation through a cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent mechanism, whereas high levels of NO from inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) prevents Th1 and Th17 responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref005">5</xref>]. Conversely, in humans, the induction and stability of Th17 responses have been associated with iNOS-produced NO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref006">6</xref>], making evident the functional differences described for NO between the murine and human systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>In steady-state conditions, human T cell lines and primary T lymphocytes express endothelial (e)NOS, which is chiefly localized on the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC)-associated Golgi, producing NO upon T cell receptor (TCR)-triggering and providing pro-activatory signals at the immune synapse (IS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref009">9</xref>], a plasma membrane–associated intercellular compartment of adhesion and signaling found in T cells during their antigen-specific interactions with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref011">11</xref>]. The IS is organized in a central area or supramolecular activation cluster (c-SMAC) in which the signaling molecule CD3 concentrates, a ring-shaped peripheral (p)-SMAC where the β2 integrin LFA-1 clusters with talin and actin, and a lamellipodium-like distal (d)-SMAC characterized by a ring of F-actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref012">12</xref>]. Among its functions, the IS modulates T cell activation, acting as a rheostat to attenuate or sustain signaling by degradation of TCR–ligand complexes at the c-SMAC or positioning signaling microclusters at the p-SMAC, respectively. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref015">15</xref>]</p>
<p>Protein kinase C-θ (PKC-θ), a novel protein kinase C preferentially expressed in T lymphocytes, activates nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) through phosphorylation of CARD-containing MAGUK protein 1 (CARMA1) and assembly of the CARMA1–BCL10–MALT1 complex, participates in the differentiation of Th2 and Th17 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref016">16</xref>], localizes at the c-SMAC, and is involved in the translocation of the MTOC towards the IS where PKC-θ forms a ring-shaped area of signaling near the p-SMAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref018">18</xref>]. The localization and activation of PKC-θ at the IS depends on several factors, including its association with diacylglycerol (DAG) and CD28, phosphorylation on Thr538 by the MAP4K germinal center kinase-like kinase (GLK), sumoylation, and the reorganization of actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>In T cells, actin allows TCR triggering, supports receptor-mediated intercellular adhesion, maintains the association of signaling microclusters, and organizes the spatial distribution of signaling receptors, adaptors, and kinases at the IS by centripetal retrograde flow-mediated transport of microclusters towards the c-SMAC, a process achieved by actin treadmilling at the d-SMAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref025">25</xref>]. Although a large body of evidence points to the actin cytoskeleton as the main organizer of signaling molecules at the IS, besides findings based on either pharmacological agents disturbing actin dynamics or the interference on the function of the actin nucleator Arp2/3 and its regulation by nucleation-promoting elements such as WAVE2 and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref029">29</xref>], little is known about how β-actin itself takes part in the mechanisms that orchestrate the flow of signaling microclusters towards the c-SMAC.</p>
<p>We have previously shown that eNOS impairs the clustering of CD3 at the c-SMAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref008">8</xref>], suggesting that NO may regulate the organization and activation of signaling molecules at the IS. In this work, we have investigated the mechanism by which NO may exert this regulation. Focusing on PKC-θ as a c-SMAC hallmark, we show that eNOS-derived NO controls the organization and activation of PKC-θ at the IS, a result confirmed in studies using the NO donor, S-nitroso-L-cysteine (Cys-NO). In antigen-specific T cell-APC conjugates, eNOS translocated to the IS, colocalizing with F-actin, fostering actin depolymerization, and reducing actin retrograde and PKC-θ inward flow from the lamellipodium-like d-SMAC. Mechanistic insights are provided by demonstrating that NO regulates the organization of PKC-θ by S-nitrosylation of β-actin on Cys374, a posttranslational modification that, disturbing the binding of actin to PFN1, controls the organization of the actin cytoskeleton from the lamellipodium-like d-SMAC.</p>

<title>eNOS regulates the recruitment and localization of PKC-θ at the IS</title>
<p>To explore the role played by eNOS in the organization of signaling microclusters at the IS, we analyzed the localization of PKC-θ in conjugates between Raji B cells pulsed with the superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) and TCR V<sub>β</sub>3–expressing CH7C17 Jurkat T cells, stably transfected with either eNOS-green fluorescent protein (GFP) (eNOS) or its inactive cytoplasmic G2A mutant (G2A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref032">32</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g001">Fig 1</xref>).

<p>In an attempt to explore whether eNOS regulates the localization of PKC-θ from the IS, we analyzed the position of eNOS and the area and fluorescence of PKC-θ in SEB-specific T cell–APC conjugates. Data revealed that the distance of Golgi-associated eNOS to the IS inversely correlated with the area occupied by PKC-θ, a finding less easily observed in golgin-97–labeled G2A T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The regulation exerted by eNOS on the localization of PKC-θ at the IS did not seem merely attributed to plasma membrane changes since the area occupied by the IS-independent T cell marker CD7 at the T cell–APC contact site did not differ among eNOS, G2A, and parental CH7C17 T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000653.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Furthermore, fluorescence intensity from PKC-θ in the IS was higher in eNOS than in G2A T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Those results were corroborated in live eNOS T cells transfected with PKC-θ-monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>). The action exerted by eNOS on the localization of PKC-θ was also assessed in CH7C17 T cells knocked-out for endogenous eNOS through a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system, in which NO production as response to TCR triggering is severely impaired (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000653.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Although no significant differences were found among control and two eNOS knockout (KO) CH7C17 T cell clones regarding the percentage of cells bearing PKC-θ concentrated at the c-SMAC, both the amounts and area of PKC-θ at the c-SMAC were considerably lower in eNOS KO than in control CH7C17 T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g002">Fig 2A–2C</xref>). Collectively, these results strongly suggest that the recruitment and localization of PKC-θ at the IS is regulated by the compartmentalized activity of eNOS near the IS.</p>

<title>eNOS partially colocalizes with F-actin at the IS and controls TCR-triggered actin polymerization</title>
<p>A direct interaction between eNOS and F-actin has been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref033">33</xref>]. To study whether eNOS controls the localization of PKC-θ at the c-SMAC from the actin cytoskeleton, we analyzed F-actin in SEB-specific conjugates between Raji APCs and eNOS or G2A T cells. Plasma membrane–associated eNOS-GFP, but neither G2A-GFP nor Golgi-associated eNOS-GFP, codistributed with F-actin around the c-SMAC, and the levels of F-actin at the IS were lower in eNOS than in G2A T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). To avoid the interference of F-actin from APCs, the localization of eNOS and F-actin was also assessed in T cells settled on anti-CD3 Ab-coated coverslips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). No broad differences were found among the cell types studied regarding gross cell morphology and spreading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, upper right graph); however, whereas the lamellipodium of CH7C17 and G2A T cells showed a well-conformed F-actin–rich border, a less organized array of F-actin was observed in eNOS T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Of note, endogenous eNOS and eNOS-GFP partially colocalized with F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, lower right graph), suggesting that, upon TCR triggering, eNOS would be involved in the control of actin polymerization and lamellipodium organization. To test this, we analyzed the content of eNOS and β-actin in Triton X-100 (TX-100)–soluble and–insoluble/cytoskeletal fractions from CH7C17, G2A, and eNOS T cells. In steady-state conditions, G2A mainly associated with the soluble fraction. In contrast, endogenous eNOS and eNOS-GFP distributed between soluble and cytoskeletal fractions, increasing in the latter upon TCR-engagement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Interestingly, β-actin increased in cytoskeletal fractions from CH7C17 and G2A T cells stimulated with CD3 Ab, reaching lower levels in eNOS T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g003">Fig 3D</xref>)—an action dependent on eNOS-derived NO since both the interference of eNOS and its inhibition with L-NAME increased the levels of F-actin in CD3-stimulated eNOS T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g003">Fig 3E</xref>).</p>

<p>We also assessed the presence of PKC-θ in TX-100–insoluble cell fractions.

Flow cytometry analysis of phalloidin-labeled F-actin in cells stimulated for 15 min on CD3 Ab-coated surfaces showed two well-defined phases: (i) a burst of actin polymerization that reached maximum values around the first minute of stimulation, followed by (ii), a more extended low rate of depolymerization that after 15 min returned F-actin to near basal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g004">Fig 4C</xref>).

Next, by kymograph analyses, we compared the retrograde flow of mCherry-β-actin in the lamellipodium-like d-SMAC of TCR-engaged CH7C17, eNOS, and G2A T cells. β-actin moved inward slower in eNOS than in CH7C17 or G2A T cells (average rates of 0.052, 0.104, and 0.092 μm s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g004">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>). Additionally, tracking of PKC-θ-mRFP in cells stimulated on CD3 Ab showed that microclusters of PKC-θ concentrated at a central area in G2A T cells but distributed peripherally in eNOS T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g004">Fig 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000653.s022">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000653.s023">S5</xref> Movies).</p>
<p>Overall, these results indicate that eNOS controls the actin cytoskeleton at the IS, fostering early and sustained F-actin clearance at the central area but reducing the centripetal retrograde flow of actin and the inward movement of PKC-θ microclusters from the lamellipodium-like d-SMAC.</p>

<title>eNOS-derived NO regulates PKC-θ localization and activation through a cGMP-independent mechanism</title>
<p>The above results prompted us to explore the mechanisms by which eNOS controls the localization and activation of PKC-θ at the c-SMAC, focusing on soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) as one of the most sensitive NO targets in cells. Neither 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), a potent inhibitor of sGC, nor 8-bromoguanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8Br-cGMP), a cGMP analogue, exerted any significant effect on the activation of PKC-θ in eNOS T cells stimulated with CD3 Abs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Furthermore, neither the dispersed distribution of PKC-θ at the IS of eNOS T cells nor its concentrated localization at the c-SMAC of G2A T cells were significantly altered by ODQ and 8Br-cGMP, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>).

<p>Four Cys nearest to the C-terminus of β-actin: Cys 257, 272, 285, and 374, have been identified as targets of hyperoxia-induced S-nitrosylation in neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref039">39</xref>]. To study whether one or more of these Cys were S-nitrosylated in T cells as a response to TCR triggering, we performed proteomic studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). Cell extracts from eNOS T cells stimulated with SEB-pulsed Raji APCs were subjected to a nitrosothiol-specific assay similar to the biotin switch, with N-ethyl-maleimide (NEM) blocking agent but using the alkylating agent iodoacetamide (IAM) instead of HPDP-biotin to improve the fragmentation quality in mass spectrometry data from β-actin–derived peptides. We found that Cys257 was very poorly S-nitrosylated, and S-nitrosylation of Cys285 was higher, but changed slightly upon stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). Regarding Cys272, the presence of Met in the peptide distributed the ion intensity in several adducts, impeding a quantitative estimation of its S-nitrosylation. Interestingly, S-nitrosylation of Cys374 strikingly increased upon TCR engagement, reaching levels comparable to those observed upon Cys-NO treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). Similarly, S-nitrosylation on Cys374 increased in primary human T lymphoblasts stimulated with CD3 Ab, remaining below the S-nitrosylation levels observed in eNOS T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). Furthermore, biotin-switch analysis of CH7C17 and eNOS T cells expressing wild-type (WT)- or C374S-mCherry-β-actin and treated with Cys-NO or SEB-pulsed Raji APCs showed that S-nitrosylation of WT β-actin increased with respect to the C374S mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g007">Fig 7E and 7F</xref>), indicating that, even if basal S-nitrosylation of other Cys could be observed, as a response to TCR engagement eNOS-derived NO mainly S-nitrosylated β-actin on Cys374.</p>

<p>Mutation to Ser on the Cys374 of actin interferes with formation of PFN1-actin complexes in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref040">40</xref>]. Before studying whether S-nitrosylation on Cys374 also impaired the binding of β-actin to PFN1, we confirmed by coprecipitation experiments that PFN1 did not bind the C374S β-actin mutant in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g008">Fig 8A</xref>).

An important feature of profilin is its capability to bind actin-associated and scaffolding proteins through their poly-L-Pro regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref041">41</xref>]. We took advantage of that to perform pull-down experiments with poly-L-Pro-coated sepharose beads, analyzing the interaction of PFN1 with β-actin in the presence or absence of Cys-NO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). Complexes between PFN1 and WT-mCherry-β-actin increased in T cells upon CD3 stimulation and diminished by Cys-NO treatment, which partially reproduced the defective interaction of C374S β-actin with PFN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g008">Fig 8B</xref>).

Remarkably, most of the radially-arranged WT-mCherry-β-actin–containing F-actin bundles in the d-SMAC were disorganized by the addition of 50 μM Cys-NO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g009">Fig 9B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000653.s025">S7 Movie</xref>). Interestingly, whereas the mutant 3C organized in bundles of F-actin at the lamellipodium-like d-SMAC, the C374S-mCherry-β-actin mutant did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g009">Fig 9C and 9D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000653.s026">S8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000653.s027">S9</xref> Movies). To explore whether β-actin S-nitrosylation on Cys374 may regulate the localization and activation of PKC-θ by reducing actin polymerization, fractionation of TX-100 extracts from WT- and C374S T cells stimulated with CD3 Ab and treated or not with Cys-NO was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g009">Fig 9E</xref>). As a response to TCR engagement WT-mCherry-β-actin increased in the F-actin cell fraction, an effect prevented by treatment with Cys-NO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g009">Fig 9E</xref>). Remarkably, recruitment of C374S-mCherry-β-actin to the F-actin fraction was impaired and remained almost unaltered after treatment with Cys-NO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g009">Fig 9E</xref>). Moreover, WT-mCherry-β-actin incorporated into regularly spaced F-actin bundles at the lamellipodium-like d-SMAC of cells activated on CD3 Ab-coated coverslips, and those were disorganized by treatment with Cys-NO, increasing lamellar and cytoplasmic actin—a pattern of actin also observed in cells overexpressing the C374S β-actin mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g009">Fig 9F</xref>), suggesting that S-nitrosylation on Cys374 regulates PKC-θ at the IS through rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton.</p>

<p>To corroborate that the reduced binding of PFN1 to β-actin S-nitrosylated on Cys374 is important for the actin rearrangement associated with the localization of PKC-θ at the IS, we generated CH7C17 T cells stably expressing mCherry-tagged constructs of the previously characterized C374A- and C374D-β-actin mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref043">43</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000653.s009">S9A Fig</xref>).

In contrast, C374A organized in F-actin and bound to PFN1 in a manner similar to WT β-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g010">Fig 10A and 10B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000653.s009">S9B Fig</xref>). Interestingly, PKC-θ concentrated at the IS of C374A T cells and was barely disturbed by Cys-NO, whereas it was evenly dispersed in C374D T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g010">Fig 10B and 10C</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that the binding of PFN1 to β-actin is important for the localization of PKC-θ at the IS.

Overexpression of H119E increased the recruitment and area of PKC-θ at the IS, disturbing its coalescence to the c-SMAC, whereas WT PFN1 but not H119E counteracted the actions exerted by Cys-NO on the recruitment and localization of PKC-θ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000653.g010">Fig 10D–10G</xref>).</p>

<p>Collectively, these results strongly suggested that in antigen-specific T cell–APC conjugates eNOS-derived NO S-nitrosylates β-actin on Cys374, a posttranslational modification that, by altering the formation of profilin-actin complexes, controls TCR-triggered actin polymerization and retrograde flow at the IS, regulating from the lamellipodium-like d-SMAC the localization and activation of PKC-θ at the c-SMAC.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Actin depolymerizing and stabilizing agents and the functional interference of the actin nucleator complex Arp2/3 disturb the architecture of the IS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref025">25</xref>]; nevertheless, the mechanisms involved are still not fully understood, and the participation of additional factors has been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref026">26</xref>]. In this work we show that one of these factors is NO. Previous evidence indicates that NO rearranges the actin cytoskeleton in T lymphocytes and disturbs the organization of CD3 at the c-SMAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref045">45</xref>]. We have investigated herein the mechanisms underlying the impact of NO on the organization of the IS, focusing on PKC-θ as a c-SMAC hallmark whose activation depends on its proximity to the p-SMAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Our results show that, upon TCR triggering, eNOS translocates with the Golgi to the IS, interacting with F-actin and reducing actin polymerization. Although this interaction may be indirect, our findings are in agreement with previous studies in endothelial cells, which showed that eNOS interacts with cortical F-actin at the plasma membrane and with G-actin on the Golgi complex, activating the enzyme to produce NO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref046">46</xref>]. Besides the regulation of the production of NO by β-actin, a complementary process has also been demonstrated through studies carried out in leukocytes, in which exposure to NO led to the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref047">47</xref>]. Our findings are thus consistent with the association of eNOS with F-actin early during the burst of actin polymerization induced by TCR triggering and thereafter with the depolymerization of β-actin close to the IS by local production of eNOS-derived NO.</p>
<p>Experimental models of T cell activation on surfaces coated with CD3 Ab have helped to establish that the lamellipodium plays a critical role in the organization and activation of signaling microclusters in the IS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref048">48</xref>]. The lamellipodium shares structural and functional analogies with the d-SMAC, both showing similar patterns of F-actin organization and displaying extensive actin-based retrograde flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref050">50</xref>]. High-resolution 4D imaging studies of conjugates between cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and target cells have recently confirmed and extended this issue by showing that polymerization and retrograde flow of actin increased in the periphery of the IS whereas it decreased in its central area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref051">51</xref>]. Accordingly, our data show that eNOS partially colocalizes with F-actin at the lamellipodium-like d-SMAC, reducing actin polymerization and retrograde flow. Through this, eNOS-derived NO can facilitate sustained signaling by reducing from the d-SMAC the inward transit of signaling molecules associated with actin, as indicated by our TIRFM experiments in which transfection of eNOS, but not its G2A-defective mutant, retained PKC-θ out of the c-SMAC. However, besides the lateral movement of signaling microclusters, Golgi and centrosome translocation to and vesicle fusion at the IS (regulated by early actin depletion and the formation of soluble NSF attachment protein receptor [SNARE] complexes, respectively) are also important suppliers of signaling molecules to the c-SMAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref052">52</xref>]. In this regard, our complementary loss-of-function studies provide compelling evidence that eNOS favors early actin depletion and accumulation of PKC-θ at the IS; whether this may result through the regulation of vesicular traffic from the Golgi apparatus will need further research.</p>
<p>Although CD28 is not essential for the recruitment of PKC-θ to the IS, the coalescence of PKC-θ to the c-SMAC is promoted by CD28—requiring its cytoplamic tail and binding to CD80 on the APC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref053">53</xref>]—and the association of PKC-θ with the actin cytoskeleton via filamin A, a process positively regulated by PKC-θ sumoylation, and by the actin-uncapping protein Rltpr, whose L432P mutant disturbs the localization of PKC-θ but not CD28 in the IS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref054">54</xref>]; accordingly, we provide evidence that upon TCR engagement, eNOS fosters the recruitment of a fraction of PKC-θ to the actin cytoskeleton. Moreover, eNOS similarly controls the coalescence of PKC-θ and CD28 to the IS, suggesting that an Rltpr-independent mechanism may be involved. It is feasible thus that, as part of this mechanism, eNOS-derived NO interfered with the linking of the CD28–filamin A–PKC-θ complex to actin and its flow towards the c-SMAC such as it has been recently described for the desumoylation of PKC-θ, which impairs the coalescence of both PKC-θ and CD28 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref021">21</xref>]. Whether the sumoylation of PKC-θ would be also involved in the actin-mediated mechanism by which NO regulates the localization and activation of PKC-θ at the IS remains a standing question.</p>
<p>Our data also show that eNOS-synthesized NO controls the localization and activation of PKC-θ at the c-SMAC through a cGMP-independent mechanism that involves S-nitrosylation of β-actin on Cys374. Because of the accessibility of Cys374 in the flexible C-terminal region of β-actin, its sulfhydryl group is highly reactive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref055">55</xref>]. Specific labelling of Cys374 with the fluorescent probe TMR-5-maleimide renders actin non-polymerizable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref056">56</xref>]. Further, S-glutathionylation on Cys374 by NADPH oxidase–generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) disturbs actin polymerization in the lamellipodium of neutrophils, and either Cys374 mutation to Ser or S-nitrosylation impairs the formation of microfilaments in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref057">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref058">58</xref>]. Although structural constrains cannot be ruled out among the actions exerted by those modifications on actin polymerization and stability, prior studies have shown that mutation to Ser of Cys374 disturbs the binding of G-actin to profilin in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref040">40</xref>]. In cells, profilin–actin complexes prevent nucleation and spontaneous polymerization of actin at the pointed end of filaments, favoring their polymerization and treadmilling by providing monomeric actin to the barbed end of F-actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref059">59</xref>]. In this regard, our results show that profilin–actin complexes increased in T cells upon TCR triggering and that S-nitrosylation of β-actin on Cys374 disturbed its interaction with PFN1, suggesting a key role for this modification in the retrograde flow of actin that controls the localization and function of PKC-θ at the IS. We confirmed this possibility with the profilin-binding inactive mutant C374S, which hardly organized in F-actin bundles at the lamellipodium-like d-SMAC and activated but did not concentrate PKC-θ at the IS, whereas its corresponding PFN1-binding competent mutant C374A did, and was resistant to Cys-NO–induced PKC-θ dispersion.</p>
<p>A role for PFN1 in lamellipodium formation has been previously reported to be dependent on both poly-L-Pro- and actin-binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref060">60</xref>]. We have shown here that the actin-binding defective PFN1 mutant H119E disturbed the coalescence of PKC-θ at the c-SMAC and that WT PFN1 counteracted the dispersion of PKC-θ induced by Cys-NO. Our findings thus strongly suggested that, by organizing the lamellipodium-like d-SMAC, PFN1 regulated the localization of PKC-θ at the IS. Interestingly, a central role has been recently assigned to PFN1 as a master regulator of the major systems of actin polymerization in eukaryotic cells, favoring elongation of linear actin bundles by supplying profilin–actin complexes to both formins and Ena/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) but inhibiting nucleation and Arp2/3-mediated branching of actin by competing with WASP for the binding to ATP-activated G-actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref061">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref062">62</xref>]. In this regard, formin-mediated nucleation of linear actin bundles in the d-SMAC has been proposed to be of importance for the formation of lamellar actin arcs and the movement of signaling microclusters towards the c-SMAC; furthermore, a subset of actin filaments specifically organized via WASP regulates TCR-triggered distal signaling, making evident the presence of highly specialized functional actin structures in the IS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref063">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref064">64</xref>]. It is thus feasible that the defective binding between S-nitrosylated β-actin and PFN1 may regulate the organization and activation of signaling microclusters at the IS by controlling the balance between actin structures resulting from the specific activities of formins and Arp2/3.</p>
<p>A dual role for localization and activation of PKC-θ at the IS in fostering effector T cell functions but disturbing the suppressor activities of regulatory T cells has been previously proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref065">65</xref>]. Our loss-of-function studies and the actions exerted by the transnitrosylating agent Cys-NO on the localization and activation of PKC-θ at the IS of T cells are thus potentially relevant from a pathophysiological perspective. In this regard, recent interest has been given to mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and differentiated lymphoid stromal cells (e.g., fibroblastic reticular cells and lymphoid endothelial cells) as sources of iNOS-derived NO that can control T cell activation and differentiation in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref066">66</xref>]. Nevertheless, rather than producing iNOS-derived NO, human MSCs seem to exert T cell suppression through prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production and enzymatic depletion of tryptophan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref067">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref068">68</xref>]. Although important differences between mice and humans should be taken into account before assigning cell sources and functions to NO in adaptive immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref069">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref070">70</xref>], previous studies have shown that NO from mouse lymphoid stromal cells disturbs the function of Th1 but not of Th2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref071">71</xref>]. Our study shows that eNOS-derived NO provides proactivation signals in human T cells, facilitating PKC-θ and NF-kB activation, a key signaling pathway for the differentiation and function of Th2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref016">16</xref>]. Whether exogenous NO from lymphoid stromal cells and endogenous NO from eNOS might coordinately regulate PKC-θ–dependent T cell fate decisions and functions at the IS warrants further investigation.</p>

<title>CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing</title>
<p>To generate eNOS KO cell lines, CH7C17 T cells were transfected with eNOS CRISPR/Cas9 KO plasmids encoding GFP, Cas9 nuclease, and eNOS single-guide RNAs for three 20 nt sequences, targeting exon 5 (TGGCTCAGGTGTTCGATGCC) and exon 6 (CTACGCGGGCTACCGGCAGC and AGCCCGCGTAGCGCACCAGC) (sc-400127, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and sorted by flow cytometry using as a marker the fluorescence of GFP. To obtain individual clones, single cells were expanded. By western blot with eNOS-specific mAb, we identified two eNOS KO clones (KO1 and KO2) and also a control clone that expressed eNOS similarly as parental CH7C17 T cells.

<title>Immunofluorescence and confocal fluorescence microscopy</title>
<p>For the study of superantigen-specific T cell–APC conjugates, Raji APC (3 x 10<sup>5</sup>) were incubated for 20 min with 0.5 μg/ml SEB or SEE and then mixed with CH7C17 (4 x 10<sup>5</sup>) or human T lymphoblast (5 x 10<sup>5</sup>), respectively. Cells were then plated on poly-L-Lys–coated coverslips and incubated for 20 min at 37°C in humidified chambers. For studies of stimulation on activation surfaces, CH7C17 T cells (3 x 10<sup>5</sup>) were plated for 15 min onto coverslips treated with CD3 Abs. Cells were then fixed for 8 min in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature, rinsed with TBS pH 8.4, and then permeabilized for 30 s in 0.1% Triton-X100 before incubation with the corresponding Abs. eNOS was visualized by staining with a pAb, followed by anti-rabbit IgG Alexa647. The Golgi was stained with Golgin-97 mAb, followed by anti-mouse IgG Alexa488 (Life Technologies). PKC-θ was visualized by staining with a pAb, followed by anti-goat IgG Alexa488, Alexa555, or Alexa647 (Life Technologies). F-actin was stained with Phalloidin-Alexa488, -Alexa568, or -TRITC. Double immunofluorescence was performed using eNOS rabbit pAb and phalloidin-TRITC or PKC-θ goat pAb. Mounted coverslips were observed under a Zeiss LSM510 confocal laser scanning unit attached to a Zeiss Axio Imager.Z1 microscope equipped with a PL APO 63X/1.4 oil objective. Images stacks of 0.25, 0.34, or 0.40 μm were acquired with settings that in each case allowed the maximum signal detection below the saturation limits of the detectors. To assess the spatial distribution of PKC-θ in cells, the staining of PKC-θ accumulated as a major dot at the contact area of T cells with APCs was scrutinized through 15–18 confocal image sections and scored to obtain percentages of cells with PKC-θ at the c-SMAC, similarly as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000653.ref010">10</xref>]. The area and fluorescence of PKC-θ at the T-cell–APC contact site and the distance from eNOS were obtained with Leica image analysis software (Leica Microsystems) to process the image stacks acquired in the region of interest. For the study of the contact area between T and B cells, eNOS, G2A, or parental CH7C17 cells were allowed to conjugate with SEB-pulsed Raji B cells for 20 min. Cells were then fixed and labeled with anti-CD7 (Becton Dickinson) and Biotin anti-CD19 (Biolegend), subsequently stained with appropriate secondary anti-mouse (F(ab’)<sub>2</sub>) Alexa568 and Streptavidin Alexa 647, and mounted onto Prolong Gold-DAPI. Cells were studied by fluorescence confocal imaging. To analyze the distribution of CD7 and CD19 at the IS, three-dimensional reconstructions of the area were generated with the Leica software. The T cell–B cell contact surface was defined as the common area for CD7 and CD19. Area values were measured with a Matlab routine for analysis of SMACs regions from three independent experiments. Mean values from area were calculated. To analyze F-actin in phalloidin-TRITC–labeled T cell–APC conjugates, the mean fluorescence (AU) of cross-sections was drawn through a field, including the IS. To analyze F-actin and mCherry-β-actin levels in WT- and C374S-mCherry-β-actin T cells plated onto CD3 Ab-coated coverslips, we identify the region occupied by F-actin at representative lamellipodium-like d-SMACs of WT-mCherry-β-actin T cells using a median filter (with a kernel size of 20) and consecutively a thresholding on the resulting image. We identified in this way an internal and external area and calculated the average difference of the external minus internal radius. Then, in the three lower z-stack images, we identified just the external border and we shrank it in a way that the average difference of the radius was the mean value from WT-mCherry-β-actin T cells. We calculated F-actin and mCherry mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) per area inside and outside the region corresponding to the lamellipodium-like d-SMAC. This analysis was performed using a user-customized routine, written in Python, that uses image analysis and numerical calculus packages plus the packages for the graphical user interface.</p>
<p>For colocalization analysis of F-actin and eNOS, the nuclear region was excluded and a median filter applied to the raw images. To obtain the Manders colocalization coefficient, the JACoP plugin from ImageJ (NIH, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/" xlink:type="simple">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>) was applied to filtered images.</p>

<p>For time-lapse confocal fluorescence microscopy studies, T cells in phenol red-free RPMI-1640 medium containing 20 mM HEPES and 2% FBS or in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) with 25 mM HEPES and 2% FBS were allowed to interact with SEB-pulsed Raji APC (1:1 cell ratio) on LabTec II chambers (Nalge Nunc International) or slides coated with FN (50 μg/ml) in Attofluor chambers (Invitrogen), maintained at 37°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere, and observed under a confocal laser–scanning unit (TCS SP5; Leica) attached to an inverted epifluorescence microscope (DMI6000; Leica) fitted with an HCX PL APO 63X/1.40–0.6 oil objective. Fluorescence and differential interference contrast (DIC) frames were obtained simultaneously at 15 s, 30 s, or 45 s intervals. At least six confocal sections were necessary to capture the entire fluorescent signal. For F-actin and NO detection at the IS, CRISPR/Cas9 cells were transfected with LifeAct-EGFP and 24 h posttransfection were preloaded with the DAR-4M-AM probe (30 min, 37°C, 0.5 μM), extensively washed with complete medium, and resuspended in imaging medium. Stacks of 27–29 sections for fluorescence and bright field images were acquired at intervals of 17.54 s to 25 s. 3D analysis and maximal projections of the T cell–APC conjugates were generated to obtain a Z stack projection and the corresponding movies. Images were processed with accompanying confocal software (LCS; Leica), IMARIS, or WCIF ImageJ.

<p>CH7C17, eNOS, and G2A T cells transfected with speckle mCherry-β-actin or pMSCV-PKC-θ-TagRFP-T were allowed to settle onto CD3 Ab-coated glass-bottomed microwell dishes (No 1.5, Mattek). Recording was initiated immediately after cell addition, and visualization was performed with an Andor-DU8285 VP-4094 camera coupled to a Leica AM TIRF MC M, mounted on a Leica DMI 6000B microscope. Images were acquired with a HCX PL APO 100.0x1.46 OIL objective and processed with the confocal software LCS (Leica). For β-actin speckle tracking and flow calculation and for PKCθ-mRFP recording, penetrance was 90 nm for 561 nm laser channel with the same objective angle (25 ms time exposure), and frames were taken every 260–500 ms. Synchronization was performed through the Leica software. Speed measures were obtained through the calculation of slopes from position versus time displacements, using a customized routine from Matlab software. To estimate the velocity of the speckles diffusing toward the center of the cell, we visualized the sum of the intensity time series. On these images the tracks of the diffusing speckles are emphasized, favoring the selection of a segment to identify the pixels explored by the speckle during its diffusion. A section of the whole stack is used to define a region of interest (ROI) around the wake of the speckle. We threshold this ROI and perform a linear fitting of the points. The velocity of the speckle is calculated from the slope given by the linear fit. The final slope represented for each cell corresponds to the mean from 16 different measurements out of the analysis of four sections depicted on the projections of the movie frames from the cells studied. ImageJ software (NIH) was used to analyze the corresponding movies.</p>
