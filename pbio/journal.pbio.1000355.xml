<p>We found that spadin, a natural peptide derived from sortilin, blocks the mouse TREK-1 channel and might be an efficient and fast-acting antidepressant.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>Current antidepressant treatments are inadequate for many individuals, and when they are effective, they require several weeks of administration before a therapeutic effect can be observed. Improving the treatment of depression is challenging. Recently, the two-pore domain potassium channel TREK-1 has been identified as a new target in depression, and its antagonists might become effective antidepressants. In mice, deletion of the TREK-1 gene results in a depression-resistant phenotype that mimics antidepressant treatments. Here, we validate in mice the antidepressant effects of spadin, a secreted peptide derived from the propeptide generated by the maturation of the neurotensin receptor 3 (NTSR3/Sortilin) and acting through TREK-1 inhibition. NTSR3/Sortilin interacted with the TREK-1 channel, as shown by immunoprecipitation of TREK-1 and NTSR3/Sortilin from COS-7 cells and cortical neurons co-expressing both proteins. TREK-1 and NTSR3/Sortilin were colocalized in mouse cortical neurons. Spadin bound specifically to TREK-1 with an affinity of 10 nM. Electrophysiological studies showed that spadin efficiently blocked the TREK-1 activity in COS-7 cells, cultured hippocampal pyramidal neurons, and CA3 hippocampal neurons in brain slices. Spadin also induced in vivo an increase of the 5-HT neuron firing rate in the Dorsal Raphe Nucleus. In five behavioral tests predicting an antidepressant response, spadin-treated mice showed a resistance to depression as found in TREK-1 deficient mice. More importantly, an intravenous 4-d treatment with spadin not only induced a strong antidepressant effect but also enhanced hippocampal phosphorylation of CREB protein and neurogenesis, considered to be key markers of antidepressant action after chronic treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. This work also shows the development of a reliable method for dosing the propeptide in serum of mice by using AlphaScreen technology. These findings point out spadin as a putative antidepressant of new generation with a rapid onset of action. Spadin can be regarded as the first natural antidepressant peptide identified. It corresponds to a new concept to address the treatment of depression.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Depression is the most common of psychiatric illnesses, with prevalence estimates ranging from 5% to 20% within the general population. The design of effective treatments for this disorder is a challenging process, and the use of antidepressants has an overall low clinical efficacy as full remission only occurs in one-third of the patients. Moreover, the time between initial treatment and beneficial effects is relatively protracted. These limitations confirm the need to find new biological targets and drugs for the treatment of depression. We recently identified a conserved mouse potassium channel protein called TREK-1 (KCNK2) as a new target for treating depression. Here, we demonstrate that spadin, a natural peptide derived from a propeptide released in blood, is able to block the TREK-1 channel activity and has an antidepressant effect in mouse models of depression. We showed that spadin is an efficient antidepressant in mice that acts much faster (4 d versus several weeks) than fluoxetine, the most commonly used antidepressant. Our results with spadin in mice highlight the potential for novel and more efficacious treatments for depression in humans.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recently, mouse models of depression have highlighted the putative role of the TREK-1 channel in the mechanisms of action of antidepressants. Deletion of the TREK-1 gene (also called <italic>kcnk2</italic>) results in a depression-resistant phenotype that mimics treatment with antidepressants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Heurteaux1">[1]</xref>. TREK-1-deficient mice (<italic>kcnk2</italic><sup>−/−</sup>) display an increased efficiency of 5-HT neurotransmission, a blunted corticosterone response to stress and an increased neurogenesis induced by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The involvement of the TREK-1 protein in mood regulation may be related to its two following specific properties: TREK-1 (1) is directly inhibited by SSRIs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Heurteaux1">[1]</xref> and by activated protein kinases A and C and (2) is potentially linked to G-protein–coupled receptors like the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Chemin1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Lesage1">[3]</xref>, suggesting that this channel may participate in a 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor-dependent negative feedback loop. More interestingly, the Star*D study has identified an association between the existence of four genetic variants (SNPs) in the TREK-1 locus and resistance to multiple antidepressant classes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Perlis1">[4]</xref>. All these findings indicate that (1) genetic variations in TREK-1 may identify individuals at risk for depression treatment resistance and (2) a search of selective blockers of TREK-1, hitherto not available, might potentially lead to a new generation of antidepressants.</p>
<p>Growing evidence indicates that trafficking and addressing as well as functional properties of native ion channels depend on their lipidic and proteic environments. K<sup>+</sup> channels are known to interact with partner proteins that are crucial for their regulation. To date, the only identified partner proteins of TREK-1 channels are the A-kinase anchoring protein AKAP150 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Sandoz1">[5]</xref> and the microtubule-associated protein Mtap2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Sandoz2">[6]</xref> that enhance TREK-1 channel surface expression and current densities. As a consequence of both its role in the sorting of membrane proteins and of a cerebral localization similar to that of TREK-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Hervieu1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Sarret1">[8]</xref>, we investigated the possible role of the neurotensin (NT) receptor 3 (NTSR3, also called gp95/sortilin) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Mazella1">[9]</xref> in the regulation of the channel function. NTSR3/Sortilin is a 95–100-kDa type-1 membrane protein, consisting of a large luminal domain, a single transmembrane segment, and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. A large part of NTSR3/Sortilin is localized at the level of the Golgi apparatus where the protein triggers intracellular functions of trafficking. Indeed, the C-terminus of NTSR3/Sortilin interacts with the VHS domain of the sorting protein GGA2 (Golgi-localizing, g-adaptin ear homology domain, ADP-ribosylation factor-binding protein) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Nielsen1">[10]</xref>. This interaction confers to NTSR3/Sortilin the property to sort SAP (sphingolipid activator proteins) to lyzosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Lefrancois1">[11]</xref>. Depending on its cellular location, NTSR3/Sortilin may also act as a receptor or a co-receptor and binds NT, the precursor of the Nerve Growth Factor (proNGF), the receptor-associated protein (RAP), the lipoprotein lipase, and the propeptide released from its precursor form. For example, this receptor is essential to proNGF induction of neuronal cell death via a complex formed with the p75<sup>NTR</sup> within the cell membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Nykjaer1">[12]</xref>. In the rat brain, NTSR3/Sortilin as well as TREK-1 are highly expressed in cerebral structures involved in the pathophysiology of depression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Krishnan1">[13]</xref>, such as prefrontal and cingulate cortice, amygdala, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, dorsal raphe, and hypothalamus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Hervieu1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Sarret1">[8]</xref>. NTSR3/Sortilin is synthesized as a proform (prosortilin) that, in late Golgi compartments, is converted to the functional ligand-binding receptor by cleavage and release of a 44 residue N-terminal propeptide (Gln<sup>1</sup>-Arg<sup>44</sup>, propeptide) by furin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-MunckPetersen1">[14]</xref>. Propeptide binds to the mature receptor with a high affinity (Kd∼5 nM). Structure-function relationship studies have identified that the peptide Gln<sup>1</sup>-Arg<sup>28</sup> was as efficient on the binding activity as the entire propeptide Gln<sup>1</sup>-Arg<sup>44</sup>, whereas the affinity of the peptide Gln<sup>1</sup>-Arg<sup>16</sup> was very low <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Westergaard1">[15]</xref>. Therefore, we designed the peptide spadin by conserving the sequence 17–28 in which we added the sequence 12–16 (APLRP) in order to maintain conformational stress. This partial propeptide (Ala<sup>12</sup>-Arg<sup>28</sup>) was tested for its potential effects on TREK-1 channel regulation and for its validation as an antidepressant drug in five behavioral models of depression.</p>

<title>NTSR3/Sortilin and Spadin Interact with the TREK-1 Channel</title>
<p>In an attempt to detect a physical and functional interaction between the NT receptor and the potassium channel, we first performed an immunoprecipitation of TREK-1 and NTSR3/Sortilin. Experiments were performed on either mouse cortical neurons or COS-7 cells co-expressing both proteins. Each antibody immunoprecipitated the tested partner, <italic>i.e.</italic> NTSR3/Sortilin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Sarret1">[8]</xref> precipitated with the TREK-1 antiserum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g001">Figure 1A</xref> left panel) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Maingret1">[16]</xref> and TREK-1 with the anti-NTSR3/Sortilin antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g001">Figure 1A</xref> right panel), in both COS-7 cells and cortical neurons. We also demonstrated that both endogenous proteins were colocalized in mouse cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Then, we investigated the influence of NTSR3/Sortilin expression on the sorting of TREK-1 to the plasma membranes. The expression of TREK-1 within the plasma membranes, measured either by preparing purified plasma membranes or by using cell surface biotinylation, was enhanced (by a factor 3 and 6, respectively) when COS-7 cells were cotransfected with NTSR3/Sortilin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), confirming the interaction between the two proteins, at least during the channel sorting. This interaction between TREK-1 and NTSR3/Sortilin led us to examine whether NT and/or the partial NTSR3/Sortilin propeptide (i.e. spadin) were able to act on TREK-1 channel activity. We first characterized the affinity of spadin on C13NJ, a microglial cell line expressing only NTSR3/Sortilin as a receptor for NT, and devoid of TREK-1 (unpublished data). Similarly to NT, spadin bound to NTSR3/Sortilin by displacing the binding of <sup>125</sup>I-NT with an affinity of 8 nM, identical to that previously found with the full length propeptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Martin1">[17]</xref>. Since NT plays a role on C13NJ migration in a wound-healing assay and that the full length propeptide antagonizes this effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Martin1">[17]</xref>, we tested in the same assay the spadin effect on NT-induced cell migration. In serum free medium containing 10 nM NT, the number of cells that migrated corresponded to 35.1%±2.3% of the number of migrating cells in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). In absence of stimulation, only 4%±1% of cells migrated. The 10 nM NT-induced cell migration was totally abolished in the presence of 1 µM spadin and remained to the basal level (6.2%±1.3%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000355.s001">Figure S1</xref>). This result confirms that spadin displays identical binding and functional properties as those of the full length propeptide. Then, we performed competition experiments between <sup>125</sup>I-labelled spadin and unlabelled spadin, NT or the N-terminal fragment of the full length propeptide Gln1-Arg16 on membrane homogenates from COS-7 cells transfected or not with TREK-1. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g001">Figure 1E</xref> shows that spadin bound specifically to TREK-1 with an affinity of about 10 nM. This binding was selective since NT was unable to displace the binding of <sup>125</sup>I-spadin and the N-terminal fragment Gln1-Arg16 bound to TREK-1 with a very low affinity (1 µM) close to that reported with NTSR3/sortilin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g001">Figure 1E</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Westergaard1">[15]</xref>. The weak effect of the N-terminal fragment Gln1-Arg16 was confirmed by electrophysiological recordings on TREK-1 transfected COS-7 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000355.s002">Figure S2</xref>). We also performed association kinetics of <sup>125</sup>I-labelled spadin on whole COS-7 cells expressing TREK-1 at 37°C. The radioactivity associated with cells reached a plateau within 30 min. Removal of surface-bound radioactivity by acid-NaCl wash revealed that about 80% of total <sup>125</sup>I-labelled spadin bound at this time was intracellular, indicating that spadin was internalized with TREK-1 following interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). These data strongly suggest that NTSR3/Sortilin constitutes a sorting partner of the TREK-1 channel. We hypothesized that when both proteins reach the plasma membrane, the propeptide, which is cleaved in the Golgi apparatus, can be released. Then, it may bind to NTSR3/Sortilin and/or to TREK-1 for tuning the channel activity, by blocking a part of the expressed channels, and by promoting their internalization. However, for such a mechanism to be functionally effective under in vivo physiological conditions, the propeptide has to be released into the blood circulation. To validate this possibility, we therefore developed the Alpha Screen (Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogenous Assay) technology for dosing the propeptide or spadin in serum samples from mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Taouji1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Mills1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Caruso1">[20]</xref>. This method is a bead-based non-radioactive and homogenous proximity assay used to measure the interaction between biological binding partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g002">Figure 2A–B</xref>). The principle of this technology relies on the use of a Donor bead and an Acceptor bead that generate a light signal when brought into proximity (&lt;200 nm). Upon laser excitation at 680 nm, the Donor beads, containing a photosensitizer, will generate short-lived singlet oxygen that can diffuse only a short distance before returning to the ground state. The Acceptor beads, containing chemiluminescers and fluorophores, will emit an amplified light signal measurable at 600 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Using this approach, we calculated seric propeptide concentrations of 5 groups of 6 littermate mice. Interestingly, the mean concentration values of the 5 groups were very close to each other, with a value of about 10 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g002">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000355.s003">S3</xref>). These data clearly indicated that the propeptide is released into the blood circulation. On this basis, we next investigated its effects, and by extension those of spadin as well, on TREK-1 channel activity.</p>

<p>(A) Immunoprecipitation of NTSR3/Sortilin with anti-TREK-1 antibodies (IP α-TREK-1) or of TREK-1 with anti-NTSR3/Sortilin antibodies (IP α-Sort) from transfected COS-7 cells or mouse cortical neurons. Immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to Western blots and revealed using anti-sortilin (WB: α-Sort) or anti-TREK-1 (WB: α-TREK-1). (B) Double immunofluorescence labeling of TREK-1 (Green) and NTSR3/Sortilin (Red) in mouse cortical neurons. Nuclei were labeled using Dapi (Blue) and co-localized proteins were visualized using merge images (arrows); scale bar, 10 µm. (C) Influence of NTSR3/Sortilin on the expression of TREK-1 at the plasma membranes. COS-7 cells were transfected with TREK-1 in the absence or in the presence of NTSR3/Sortilin. Crude homogenates, purified plasma membrane proteins, or cell surface biotinylated proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis and revealed using anti-TREK-1 antibodies. (D) Competition between <sup>125</sup>I-NT and unlabeled Spadin (closed circles) or NT (open circles) for binding to C13NJ cell homogenates. Each point represents the mean of duplicate determinations from 3 independent experiments. (E) Competition between <sup>125</sup>I-Spadin and unlabeled Spadin (closed circles), NT (open circles) or N-terminal fragment Gln1-Arg 16 (Nterm1-16, open triangles) for binding to TREK-1 transfected COS-7 cell homogenates. Each point represents the mean of duplicate determinations from 2 to 5 independent experiments. Note that non-transfected COS-7 cells were totally devoid of <sup>125</sup>I-Spadin binding.

<title>AlphaScreen assays.</title>
<p>(A) Principles of AlphaScreen technology. Donor and acceptor microbeads can be coated with target-specific antibody, proteins, or secondary reagents (streptavidin, glutathione, nickel). A signal is produced when the AlphaScreen acceptor, A, and donor, D, beads are brought into proximity by a molecular interaction occurring between the binding partners captured on the beads. Laser excitation at 680 nm causes ambient oxygen to be converted to the singlet state by photosynthesizers on the donor bead. These react with chemiluminescent agents on the Acceptor bead only when the latter is in close proximity, emitting light at 520–620 nm. Here, we illustrate a competition protocol between seric propeptide, PE, and interacting donor beads, D, coupled-biotinylated spadin (b-spadin) with antibodies anti-propeptide (anti-PE) coupled on acceptor beads, A. (B) An example of competition curve obtained with one group (n° 1) of 6 mice (1.1 to 1.6) among 5 different groups (other curves are presented in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000355.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

<title>Effects of Spadin on the TREK-1 Channel Activity</title>
<p>As previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Patel1">[21]</xref>, TREK-1 basal channel activity was strongly and reversibly activated by arachidonic acid (aa, 10 µM), which induced a typical TREK-1 background current, characterized by outward rectification reversed at the predicted value for E<sub>K+</sub>. Using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique on TREK-1 transfected COS cells, we first assessed the ability of the full length peptide to inhibit the TREK-1 channel activity. COS-7 cells were chosen because they weakly express the NTSR3/Sortilin receptor (unpublished data). Indeed, 500 nM of propeptide was able to block 41%±5% (n = 4) of the aa stimulated TREK-1 current measured at 0 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Then, we tested spadin in the same experimental conditions. As expected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Westergaard1">[15]</xref>, we found that spadin displayed a better affinity than the propeptide, since 100 nM of spadin were able to block 63%±12% (n = 16) of the TREK-1 current stimulated by aa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). A spadin dose-response experiment indicated an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 70.7 nM at 0 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>

<p>In order to confirm the action of spadin on TREK-1, by using brain slices we directly recorded hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells, a cellular network that endogenously expresses both TREK-1 and NTSR3/Sortilin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Hervieu1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Sarret1">[8]</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g003">Figure 3D</xref> depicts the currents obtained following a ramp of potential in a CA3 neuron in the presence of a cocktail of K+ blockers that have no effect on TREK-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Patel1">[21]</xref>. In 12 out of 28 recorded neurons, arachidonic acid increased the amplitude of the remaining current by 23.3%±4.8% (n = 12). Spadin blocked 90.8%±6.0% (n = 12) of this effect. Interestingly, the peptide alone inhibited 14.9%±5.6% (n = 8) of the current recorded in the presence of potassium blockers (unpublished data), as did fluoxetine (13.0%±3.8%, n = 5) (unpublished data). Even if an effect of spadin on cationic channels cannot be totally excluded, the inhibitory effect of spadin on arachidonic acid-induced current in CA3 neurons from wild-type mice was totally absent in the same experimental conditions in the <italic>kcnk2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). This result clearly demonstrates that the current blocked by spadin is supported by TREK-1 channel.

<title>Effect of Spadin on the Dorsal Raphe Nucleus (DRN) 5-HT Neurotransmission</title>
<p>Since we have previously demonstrated that the deletion of the TREK-1 gene results in an increase of the 5-HT neuron firing rate in the DRN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Heurteaux1">[1]</xref>, we tested the effect of spadin on the same neurons. We performed unitary extracellular recordings of these 5-HT neurons in anesthetized animals (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000355.s007">Text S1</xref>). We constituted two groups of mice, which received via an i.p. injection either spadin (10<sup>−5</sup> M in a 100 µl bolus) or its vehicle (distilled water). Starting 30 min after the injection, 3 to 4 successive descents were performed along the DRN, for a total of 4–8 cells recorded per animal (examples are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g003">Figure 3G</xref>). For each neuron, the discharge was monitored during 60 s. In vehicle-injected mice, we found a value of 1.26±0.27 Hz, whereas after administration of spadin, the mean firing rate of DRN 5-HT neurons was significantly elevated up to 3.1±0.7 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g003">Figure 3H</xref>) (one-way ANOVA, F(<sub>1,36</sub>) = 4.4, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05), corresponding to a +146% increase. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g003">Figure 3G</xref> (right panel), several neurons found in spadin-injected mice discharged at up to 3, 5, or even 6 Hz, whereas most of the frequencies found in the saline group were in a normal range (1–1.7 Hz) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g003">Figure 3G</xref> left panel). The average 5-HT neuron firing activity in spadin-treated animals was almost identical to that observed in <italic>kcnk2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g003">Figure 3H</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Heurteaux1">[1]</xref>.

<p>Taken together, these results indicate that TREK-1 and NTSR3/Sortilin are not only associated within the plasma membrane but that spadin interacts directly with TREK-1 to functionally inhibit its activity.

<title>Acute, Subchronic, and Chronic Spadin Treatments Induce Antidepressant Effects</title>
<p>We used five behavioral tests predicting an antidepressant response (FST, TST, CMST, LH, and NSF) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000355.s007">Text S1</xref>) similar to these used in our previous work on the depression-resistant phenotype of TREK-1 deficient mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Heurteaux1">[1]</xref>. Spadin efficacy was first assessed in the Forced Swimming Test (FST) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Porsolt1">[22]</xref>, which is a highly reliable predictor for antidepressant potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Krishnan1">[13]</xref>. Spadin was administered 30 min before the test by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.), intravenous (i.v.), or intraperitoneal (i.p.) route at doses of 10<sup>−4</sup> to 10<sup>−8</sup> M. Its effects were compared to the behavior observed in <italic>kcnk2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice and in wild-type mice treated with the efficient SSRI fluoxetine (i.p., 3 mg/kg). When placed in an inescapable cylinder of water, spadin-treated mice exhibited reduced floating or immobility times in the three modes of injection with respect to their saline-treated counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The immobility is interpreted as “a state of despair,” in that the animal is believed to have lost its motivation for escape-oriented behaviors. The dose-responses of spadin showed that the highest reduced immobility times (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) were observed at the dose of 10<sup>−7</sup> M in i.c.v. (66.8%), 10<sup>−6</sup> M in <italic>i.v.</italic> (62.9%), and 10<sup>−5</sup> M in i.p. (55.30%) administration. The magnitude of the antidepressant behavior was similar to that observed in fluoxetine-treated wild-type and saline-injected <italic>kcnk2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. Then, we determined the effect of an acute i.v. spadin administration (10<sup>−6</sup> M) in the Tail Suspension Test (TST, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), which is often used to predict antidepressant efficacy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Steru1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Nestler1">[24]</xref>, and in the test of Conditioned Suppression of Motility (CMST, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), sensitive to antidepressants but not to anxiolytic drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Kameyama1">[25]</xref>. In the TST, injection of spadin in wild-type mice 30 min before the test significantly reduced immobility times when compared to saline-treated wild-type mice (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). The antidepressant effect was not statistically different to that observed in fluoxetine-injected mice or <italic>kcnk2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mutants (<italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). In the CMST, shocked mice treated with saline displayed a marked suppression of motility (CS, conditioned suppression; 9.1% of the saline non-shocked group) when they were returned to the cage in which they had previously received electric shocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Similarly to what was observed in saline-treated <italic>kcnk2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, the administration of spadin (i.v., 10<sup>−6</sup> M) significantly reduced (by 84.4%) the CS of motility without increasing motility in the corresponding non-shocked group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). In these three tests (FST, TST, and CMST), the injection of spadin in <italic>kcnk2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000355.s007">Text S1</xref>) did not induce any change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g004">Figure 4A–C</xref>), indicating that there was no additional effects of spadin in the absence of the TREK-1 channel. The subsequent experiments were therefore performed only in wild-type mice. We subjected mice to the Learned Helplessness test (LH, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g004">Figure 4D–E</xref>), validated as a sensitive model of depression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Krishnan1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Caldarone1">[26]</xref>.

However, an acute spadin treatment (i.v., 10<sup>−6</sup> M) provoked significant reduced escape latencies after training (25.4%) compared to saline-treated mice, demonstrating a strong antidepressant effect. Because changes in the motor activity induced by the different drugs used could influence the results, the motor behavior was measured following i.p. treatments. Neither spadin nor fluoxetine had any effect on mouse locomotion analyzed in short- or long-time after the drug injection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000355.s006">Figure S6</xref>).</p>

<p>Current antidepressants are clinically effective only after several weeks of administration.

The existence of this presynaptic effect is believed to be responsible for the 2 to 6 wk delay before the onset of the antidepressant's therapeutic action, as this period corresponds to the time required for 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptors to desensitize <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Blier1">[28]</xref>. Based on these observations, it has been proposed that a direct facilitation of 5-HT firing rate in the DRN should be a requirement for a faster onset of antidepressant action <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Blier2">[29]</xref>. Interestingly, we observed an increase in the firing activity of DRN 5-HT neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g003">Figure 3G</xref>). Obviously, such results raise the possibility that spadin could exert a rapid onset of action. Hence, we tested the potential antidepressant effect of spadin administered during 4 d (subchronic treatment) using both the FST and TST tests. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g005">Figure 5A–B</xref>, a 4-d treatment with spadin (i.v., 10<sup>−6</sup>M) significantly reduced the time spent immobile by 43.2% in FST (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) and by 28.1% in TST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). In contrast, as previously observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Cryan1">[30]</xref>, subchronic fluoxetine treatment had no effect when compared with saline (<italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05).

This result shows that the antidepressant effect of spadin reached a maximal level after 4 d and maintained the same potency following long-term administration (15 d).

<p>Stress and anxiety disorders lead to profound suffering and disability, which contributes to the development of depression in humans and plays a role in the severity and the recurrence of the disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Sheline1">[32]</xref>. The connection between stress, anxiety, and depression is often associated with elevated cortisol levels in depressed patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Holsboer1">[33]</xref>. We have previously demonstrated that the deletion of the TREK-1 gene results in a hypoactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, known to be involved in the control of stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Heurteaux1">[1]</xref>.

<title>Effect of Spadin on stress and anxiety behaviors.</title>
<p>(A) Decreased stress-induced serum levels of corticosterone in mice treated with spadin. We compared serum corticosterone concentrations (ng/ml) sampled in the morning in mice acutely treated with spadin (i.v, 10<sup>−6</sup> M), saline or fluoxetine (i.p., 3 mg/kg) 30 min after a 10 min tube restraint (n = 10 per group). Data are expressed as increase of the ratio corticosterone levels 30 min after stress over basal corticosterone levels 30 min before restraint (one-way ANOVA, F<sub>2,27</sub> = 18.30, *<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, **<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01 versus saline-treated mice). (B) Effect of spadin (i.p, 10<sup>−5</sup> M) and diazepam (i.p., 0.5 mg/kg) on time spent in the open arms (s) of the elevated plus-maze (n = 10 per group, one-way ANOVA, F<sub>2,27</sub> = 8.75, **<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001 versus saline-treated mice). (C) Effect of spadin (i.p., 10<sup>−5</sup> M) and diazepam (i.p., 0.5 mg/kg) on the total number of entries in the aversive white side in the light/dark transition test (n = 10 per group, one-way ANOVA, F<sub>2,53</sub> = 7.65, ***<italic>p</italic> = 0.001 versus saline-treated mice). (D) Influence of spadin (i.p., 10<sup>−5</sup> M) and diazepam (i.p., 0.5 mg/kg) on mouse performance in the staircase test. Data are presented as the ratio of number of rearings over the number of ascended steps (n = 10 per group, one-way ANOVA, F<sub>2,44</sub> = 4.86, *<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 versus saline-treated mice). In the three tests, mice were injected with either spadin or diazepam 30 min before the test. In all graphs, bars indicate SEM.</p>

<p>Thereafter, to study whether spadin affects anxiety-related behaviors, we investigated its anxiolytic profile in the three mouse models of anxiety (elevated plus-maze, light-dark exploration, staircase) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000355.s007">Text S1</xref>) that are the most commonly used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Cryan2">[35]</xref>. Their most important feature resides in the predictive validity to detect anxiolytic potential. Avoidance behaviors are reduced by treatments with clinically efficacious anxiolytics, mainly by the benzodiazepine agonist class, including diazepam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Rodgers1">[36]</xref>. In the elevated plus-maze test, compared to diazepam (i.p., 0.5 mg/kg), which significantly reduced the time spent into the aversive open arms of the test apparatus (*<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05), spadin (i.p., 10<sup>−5</sup>M) had no effect (<italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05) versus saline-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Similarly, in the light/dark exploration test, spadin-treated mice did not make more transitions from the dark to the light compartment than did mice treated with saline (<italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05). In contrast, diazepam significantly induced an increase in the number of light/dark transitions (*<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). The staircase paradigm combines step-climbing, which serves as an index of exploratory and locomotor activity, and rearing, which serves as an indicator of anxiety. Exposure to diazepam induced a significant reduction in both rearing and step ascending behaviors, leading to a decrease of the rearing/step numbers ratio (**<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). In contrast, spadin had no effect as compared to saline-treated mice (<italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05). Together, these results demonstrate that spadin has no anxiolytic activity, when compared with the well-known diazepam.</p>
<p>Since spadin exerted efficient effects after i.p. or i.v. administration, we evaluated its ability to pass through the blood-brain barrier. <sup>125</sup>I-labelled spadin (1 nmol of spadin plus 2×10<sup>6</sup> cpm <sup>125</sup>I-spadin) was i.v. injected and animals were sacrificed 30 min following injection. The brains were rapidly removed and homogenized. The radioactivity recovered in the brain was acid-extracted, quantified, and analyzed by HPLC. These experiments indicated that 1/1,000 of spadin was recovered in the brain after i.v. injection (unpublished data). Identical amounts of spadin were recovered in the brain after i.p. injection under the same experimental conditions. The concentration of spadin recovered into the brain was estimated to stand around 10 nM, a concentration that corresponds to the affinity of spadin for TREK-1 and sufficient to be active on TREK-1 channel activity. This value was also in the same range of the IC<sub>50</sub> determined by electrophysiological measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>

<title>Effects of a 4-d Treatment with Spadin on CREB-Phosphorylation and Hippocampal Neurogenesis</title>
<p>SSRIs and tricyclics are known to enhance neurogenesis in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus, but only after 2 or 3 wk of a chronic treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Santarelli1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Malberg1">[37]</xref>. The concomitant increases of both the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and hippocampal neurogenesis in response to chronic antidepressant treatment, but not to non-antidepressant psychotic drugs, strongly suggest that CREB regulates hippocampal neurogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Krishnan1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Carlezon1">[38]</xref>. We tested therefore whether spadin was able to induce an increase in hippocampal neurogenesis and a faster activation of CREB. We analyzed the neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the mouse hippocampus, by counting the number of progenitor cells that incorporate the DNA synthesis marker 5-bromo-2′deoxyuridine (BrdU) and that are differentiated into mature neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Santarelli1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Malberg1">[37]</xref>. Interestingly, in the SGZ, a 4-d treatment with spadin (i.p. 10<sup>−5</sup>M) significantly increased by 2-fold the number of BrdU-positive cells with respect to saline conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g007">Figure 7A–B</xref>). The neurogenic effect of spadin was maintained after a long-term administration (15 d, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). In contrast, a 4-d regimen with fluoxetine had no effect on neurogenesis, but fluoxetine induced a significant increase in the number of BrdU-positive cells when it was administered during 15 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Dual labeling of BrdU and doublecortin (DCX), a specific marker of neuronal precursors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-CouillardDespres1">[39]</xref>, revealed that 85.2% of BrdU-labeled cells expressed DCX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g007">Figure 7A</xref> right bottom panel, 7B). No colocalization of BrdU-positive cells with the astroglial marker GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g007">Figure 7A</xref> left bottom panel).</p>

<p>The next step was to determine whether the enhanced adult spadin-induced neurogenesis was related to an increased hippocampal activation of CREB, as measured by its phosphorylation into pCREB. Compared with saline-treated mice, a 4-d treatment with spadin (i.p., 10<sup>−5</sup>M) induced a large increase of pCREB labeling, restricted to the specific SGZ region of mouse hippocampal tissue sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). The counting of pCREB<sup>+</sup> cells revealed that the spadin administration during 4 d significantly led to a 2-fold increase in the number of pCREB-labeled neurons when compared with the saline group (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g007">Figure 7E</xref>). Western blot analysis, which showed an immunoreactive band at 46 kDA corresponding to the phosphorylated active form of CREB, confirmed that a 4-d treatment with spadin (i.p.,10<sup>−5</sup> M) stimulated the hippocampal phosphorylation of CREB, whereas the amount of total CREB remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g007">Figure 7F</xref>). Quantification of blots indicated a significant 4-fold stimulation of pCREB within the hippocampus extracts. To examine the relationship between pCREB and neurogenesis, expression of pCREB in newborn cells, visualized by DXC labeling, was examined by immunofluorescence. Double labeling for pCREB and DCX demonstrated a colocalization of pCREB expression in several precursor neurons in the presence of spadin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g007">Figure 7G</xref>). These data pointed out that spadin induced a specific and rapid onset of neurogenesis and CREB activation in adult brain mice.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study identifies spadin as the first peptidic antagonist of the TREK-1 channel and illustrates its potent antidepressant properties by using biochemical, electrophysiological, and behavioral approaches. Spadin is a partial peptide derived from the propeptide released from the precursor form of NTSR3/Sortilin. Here, we show for the first time that the propeptide is present into blood circulation and is able to inhibit currents mediated by the TREK-1 channel. Due to higher affinity and for a better efficacy, this study was mainly focused on the use of spadin. Using TREK-1 deficient mice and animal models of depression, our laboratory has recently identified the TREK-1 channel as a new target for depression and its blockers as potential antidepressant drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Heurteaux1">[1]</xref>. With the identification of spadin as an antagonist of TREK-1, this work validates the TREK-1 channel as a good target for the development of drugs for the treatment of depression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Heurteaux1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Gordon1">[40]</xref>. In humans, the Star*D study has reported the functional role of this particular potassium channel in mood regulation and in resistance to antidepressant treatments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Perlis1">[4]</xref>, strengthening the idea that TREK-1 represents an attractive pharmacological target for the development of new types of antidepressant drugs.</p>
<p>This is of high relevance since depression is a devastating illness that affects ∼17% of the population at some point in life, resulting in major social and economic consequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Kessler1">[41]</xref>. Designing effective treatments for this serious disorder is challenging, in part because unraveling the exact changes that lead to this psychiatric disorder is particularly difficult. In addition to the inherent complexity of the disease itself, it is not clear how antidepressant drugs work. Most antidepressants increase levels of the monoamine serotonin (5-HT) and/or noradrenaline (NA), suggesting that biochemical imbalances within the 5-HT/NA systems may underlie the pathogenesis of this disorder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Martin1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Haddjeri1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-CouillardDespres1">[39]</xref>. To date, the mainstay of antidepressant treatments is constituted by SSRIs, which inhibit the 5-HT reuptake pump. Although antidepressant treatments significantly improve the therapeutic outlook for depressed patients, there are still too many patients who do not respond to initial treatments. In the case of response, side effects are often observed, as well as a delay in the onset of therapeutic efficiency and/or a partial rather than a full remission. Spadin, which is a natural peptide, may alleviate these problems and become a strong candidate to develop new efficient and fast-acting antidepressant treatments. The first result of this work is the identification of the NTSR3/Sortilin receptor as a novel TREK-1 partner protein. It interacts physically and functionally with TREK-1 to modify its cell surface expression. NTSR3/Sortilin is a member of the Vps10p-domain receptor family, which is expressed in several tissues, including the brain. The interaction between NTSR3/Sortilin and the N-terminal portion of the precursor form of the NGF (pro-NGF) and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (pro-BDNF) represents a key event in the process that controls neurotrophins-mediated cell survival and death in developing neuronal tissue and post-traumatic neuronal apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Hermey1">[42]</xref>. NTSR3/Sortilin is involved in the sorting of BDNF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Chen1">[43]</xref>. In regard to depression (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Altar1">[44]</xref>), it is well known that exogenous delivery of neurotrophic factors, such as BDNF and/or neurotrophin 3 (NT-3) promotes the function, sprouting, and regrowth of 5-HT neurons in the rat brain. Infusions of BDNF into the DRN produced an antidepressant effect, as evaluated by several learned helplessness paradigms. Environmental stressors induce depression and decrease BDNF mRNA, whereas antidepressants increase BDNF mRNA in the brain via 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and β-adrenoreceptor subtypes. Since we observed an activation of 5-HT neurons by spadin, it would be important to measure the influence of spadin both on protein and mRNA levels of BDNF in order to determine whether its action is correlated with the modulation of neurotrophin pathways. NTSR3/Sortilin and spadin interact with the TREK-1 channel as shown by immunoprecipitation of TREK-1 and NTSR3/Sortilin from COS-7 cells co-expressing both proteins. TREK-1 and NTSR3/Sortilin are also colocalized in mouse cortical neurons.</p>
<p>This work identifies a new function for spadin as a peptidic antagonist of the TREK-1 channel. Until now, the full propeptide (1–44) which contains the active spadin was known to display two principal functions: (1) It binds the mature form of NTSR3/Sortilin, hindering ligands to access the binding site of the receptor, and (2) it antagonizes the effects of NT on microglial cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Mazella1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-MunckPetersen1">[14]</xref>. To our knowledge, the propeptide has no additional protein target. Here, we determined that spadin, but not its N-terminal fragment Gln1-Arg16, displays identical binding and activity properties as those of the full propeptide on the NT system. Spadin binds specifically to TREK-1 with an affinity of 10 nM. Electrophysiological studies show that spadin efficiently blocks the TREK-1 activity in COS-7 cells, cultured pyramidal neurons, as well as CA3 hippocampal neurons in brain slices of wild-type mice and not in <italic>kcnk2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, suggesting a specific effect of spadin on the TREK-1 channel.</p>
<p>Finally, our data point out spadin as the first peptidic and fast-acting antidepressant. Considering the blocking effect of spadin on TREK-1 channels, we have analyzed in vivo its potential antidepressant effects. In behavioral tests (FST, TST, and CMST), predicting an antidepressant response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Nestler1">[24]</xref>, spadin-treated mice show a resistance to depression as do <italic>kcnk2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Heurteaux1">[1]</xref>. This antidepressant phenotype is even more marked in the LH and NSF tests, which are considered as classical “rodent models of depression” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Krishnan1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Santarelli1">[31]</xref>. The antidepressant effect of spadin is not specific to mice since it has also been observed in rats using the FST test and in vivo 5-HT neuron firing recordings. More importantly, our results indicate that molecular, biochemical, and behavioral changes, that have previously been specifically linked to long-term chronic treatment with SSRIs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Lucas1">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Lucas2">[46]</xref>, are already present as soon as 4 d when using i.v. spadin administration. The fast-acting antidepressant potential of spadin, observed in vivo in FST and TST tests, is further confirmed by its ability to activate CREB function and neurogenesis in the adult mouse hippocampus after a subchronic treatment. It is now well stated that antidepressants share the common property to positively modulate cellular growth and plasticity in mood-related brain areas. Indeed, CREB activity and neurogenesis are considered as specific markers of antidepressant action <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Nibuya1">[47]</xref> but have never been observed before 2 wk of treatment when using classical antidepressants such as SSRIs. By binding to cAMP response element (CRE) sites, CREB mediates transcriptional responses to elevated levels of cAMP. CRE-mediated gene transcription is upregulated after chronic antidepressant treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Thome1">[48]</xref>. CREB upregulation activates downstream targets such as the brain-derived growth factor (BDNF) after antidepressant treatment by binding to CRE elements located in the promoter region of the BDNF gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Nibuya2">[49]</xref>. Here, we show that a 4-d chronic treatment with spadin is able to enhance the pCREB/CREB ratio and consequently increases cell division and proliferation in the SGZ. In addition, the therapeutic potential of spadin appears to be specific of depression, in that it is unable to affect anxiety-related behaviors. This is in good agreement with the fact that TREK-1 deficient mice do not show an anxiety-resistant phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Heurteaux1">[1]</xref>. In contrast, both spadin and the deletion of the TREK-1 channel induce an hypoactivity of the HPA axis when animals are exposed to stress.</p>
<p>As described in <italic>kcnk2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Heurteaux1">[1]</xref>, spadin leads to an in vivo increase in efficacy of 5-HT neurotransmission as evidenced by an increased firing activity of DRN 5-HT neurons. Even if the involvement of other aminergic systems in the pathophysiology of depression is certainly non-negligible, it remains that the facilitation of central 5-HT transmission constitutes the common property of all the antidepressant strategies, which have proved their efficiency. From a mechanical point of view, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptor stimulation reduces DRN 5-HT neuronal firing and, consequently, 5-HT neurotransmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Blier1">[28]</xref>. Inhibition of adenylate cyclase and activation of G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channels (GIRK) are involved in this negative feedback <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Gordon1">[40]</xref>. The decrease in cAMP concentration (as a result of reduced adenylate cyclase activity) in 5-HT neurons is also thought to induce TREK-1 opening because of a consequent reduction of phosphorylation of Ser333 by PKA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Maingret1">[16]</xref>. According to this model, spadin would induce a depolarization by closing TREK-1 channels and, as described for TREK-1 deficient mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Gordon1">[40]</xref>, would therefore reduce the negative feedback on 5-HT neurons, resulting in increased 5-HT neurotransmission and in turn in antidepressant-like effects. Direct inhibition of TREK-1 by spadin may also contribute to enhanced 5-HT neuron excitability. Because (1) sortilin is the partner protein of the TREK-1 channel and (2) both proteins are colocalized in 5-HT-enriched areas known to be involved in the pathophysiology of depression such as the prefrontal and cingulate cortice, amygdala, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, dorsal raphe, and hypothalamus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-Krishnan1">[13]</xref>, one may infer that spadin acts predominantly through a modulation of the brain 5-HT circuitry. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that it can also involve other neurotransmission systems. Whatever the effector pathways though, the fact that spadin has no effects on <italic>kcnk2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice indicates that its action is first and foremost mediated by a modulation of TREK-1 channels.</p>
<p>Our results show that spadin induces an 80% internalization of these channels. We propose a model of regulation of TREK-1 expression and regulation by NTSR3/Sortilin receptor and spadin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g008">Figure 8</xref>). In physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g008">Figure 8A</xref>), TREK-1 and NTSR3/Sortilin would associate in the TGN vesicle, where spadin is hydrolyzed by furin. When TGN vesicles merge to the plasma membrane, spadin would be released (as suggested in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000355-MunckPetersen1">[14]</xref> and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g002">Figure 2B–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000355.s003">Figure S3</xref>) and would bind either NTSR3/Sortilin, TREK-1 channel, or both. This would lead to the internalization of the TREK-1/Sortilin complex in early endosome and subsequently to its degradation. In the presence of an excess of spadin given by administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g008">Figure 8B</xref>), the rate of internalized complexes would be increased, resulting in a total disappearance of TREK-1 channels at the surface membrane. This prediction is supported by the fact that 80% of the <sup>125</sup>I-spadin bound on the TREK-1 transfected COS-7 cells are insensitive to an acid-NaCl wash (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000355-g001">Figure 1F</xref>), indicating that the complex spadin-TREK-1 is already internalized. The consequent loss of TREK-1 channel activity would lead to an antidepressant phenotype, as observed in TREK-1 deficient mice. However, overall the inhibitory action of spadin on TREK-1 function is likely the consequence of both its ability to induce channel internalization and its direct effect on the channel current.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Spadin can be considered as a natural endogenous antidepressant and constitutes the first peptide identified as an antidepressant with a rapid onset of action. Due to these peculiar properties, spadin brings a new concept to address the treatment of depression. To date, spadin is also the first blocker of TREK-1 channel identified, which not only is of relevance in the field of depression but also constitutes a useful tool to further understand the role of TREK-1 channels in other neurological pathologies. Finally, this work shows the development of a reliable method for dosing the propeptide and spadin by using AlphaScreen technology. The last point is crucial to use in the future spadin as a marker of depression by dosing spadin in the serum of depressed patients, and to help for setting clinical preventive protocols. Detecting and preventing the depression certainly could decrease the economic burden of this disease, which is estimated to be $44 billion per year in the United States.</p>

<title>Drugs and Chemicals</title>
<p>The propeptide named spadin, with the following amino acid sequence, Y-APLPRWSGPIGVSWGLR (GenBank NM_019972 for mouse), and the N-terminal fragment QDRLDAPPPPAAPLPR were synthetized by Gencust (France). The stock solution was dissolved in distilled water at a concentration of 10<sup>−3</sup> M, and spadin solution was then diluted in NaCl 0.9% to reach the different treatment concentrations. The i.c.v. injection was performed under isoflurane anesthesia. Mice were anesthetized by inhalation of 2% isoflurane mixed with 30% oxygen and 70% nitrous oxide. Spadin (5 µl) was stereotaxically administered 30 min prior to the behavioral test by an injection needle that was lowered bilaterally into the lateral ventricle of the mouse positioned on a stereotaxic frame, by using the coordinates referred from Paxinos and Flanklin (related to bregma: AP: −0.46 mm, ML: 1.25 mm, and DV: −2.25 mm). The injection needle was connected to a Hamilton syringe (10 µl) positioned in a micropump and delivered the drug solution at a rate of 1 µl/min for 5 min. Fluoxetine (TEVA Santé, France) and diazepam, diluted in NaCl 0.9%, were used at the concentration of 3 mg and 0.5 mg per kg body weight, respectively, in i.p. administration. BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich, St Quentin Fallavier, France) was diluted in Tris-buffered saline (0.1 M in NaCl 0.9%, pH:7.6). All other chemicals were from Sigma (St Quentin Fallavier, France).

Spadin-treated rats had a shorter time of immobility comparable to those obtained in fluoxetine-treated animals (one-way ANOVA, F<sub>2, 26</sub> = 16.66, ***<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, **<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01 versus saline-treated rats).</p>

<p><bold>Mouse locomotion activity.</bold> To determine whether spadin induced a change in locomotor activity, mice (n = 8 per group) were injected with the saline solution or spadin (10<sup>−5</sup>M in 100 µl bolus, i.p.) 30 min before starting the test session. Locomotor activity was monitored individually for 24 h using an infrared photobeam activity monitoring system (Imetronic, Pessac, France), which measured consecutive horizontal beam breaks. Testing was in transparent plastic cages (43×2 0×20 cm<sup>3</sup>) with fresh bedding in a grid of 8 cm horizontal infrared beams. Locomotor activity was defined as breaking of consecutive photobeams. Mice were given 1 h habituation session before being treated with spadin or saline. Movements were recorded and totalized for each 5 min period during the first hour and then by 10 min time sections for the next 23 h. Six periods were pooled to obtain data for 1 h of time. Different movements were monitored: the coming-and-going between the back and the front of the cage, climbing, and other movements in the back or the front of the cage. Data are the mean value of 8 animals per condition, bars represent SEM. Mice were kept under standard laboratory conditions: 12∶12 light-dark cycle with free access to food and water during the experiment. There was no significant difference in locomotor activity between spadin- and saline-treated mice within 1 or 24 h after the drug injection.</p>
