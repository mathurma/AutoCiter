<abstract>
<p>DEAD-box helicase proteins accelerate folding and rearrangements of highly structured RNAs and RNA–protein complexes (RNPs) in many essential cellular processes. Although DEAD-box proteins have been shown to use ATP to unwind short RNA helices, it is not known how they disrupt RNA tertiary structure. Here, we use single molecule fluorescence to show that the DEAD-box protein CYT-19 disrupts tertiary structure in a group I intron using a helix capture mechanism. CYT-19 binds to a helix within the structured RNA only after the helix spontaneously loses its tertiary contacts, and then CYT-19 uses ATP to unwind the helix, liberating the product strands. Ded1, a multifunctional yeast DEAD-box protein, gives analogous results with small but reproducible differences that may reflect its <italic>in vivo</italic> roles. The requirement for spontaneous dynamics likely targets DEAD-box proteins toward less stable RNA structures, which are likely to experience greater dynamic fluctuations, and provides a satisfying explanation for previous correlations between RNA stability and CYT-19 unfolding efficiency. Biologically, the ability to sense RNA stability probably biases DEAD-box proteins to act preferentially on less stable misfolded structures and thereby to promote native folding while minimizing spurious interactions with stable, natively folded RNAs. In addition, this straightforward mechanism for RNA remodeling does not require any specific structural environment of the helicase core and is likely to be relevant for DEAD-box proteins that promote RNA rearrangements of RNP complexes including the spliceosome and ribosome.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>In addition to carrying genetic information from DNA to protein, RNAs function in many essential cellular processes. This often requires the RNA to form a specific three-dimensional structure, and some functions require cycling between multiple structures. However, RNAs have a strong propensity to become trapped in nonfunctional, misfolded structures. Due to the intrinsic stability of local structure for RNA, these misfolded species can be long-lived and therefore accumulate. ATP-dependent RNA chaperone proteins called DEAD-box proteins are known to promote native RNA folding by disrupting misfolded structures. Although these proteins can unwind short RNA helices, the mechanism by which they act upon higher order tertiary contacts is unknown. Our current work shows that DEAD-box proteins capture transiently exposed RNA helices, preventing any tertiary contacts from reforming and potentially destabilizing the global RNA architecture. Helix unwinding by the DEAD-box protein then allows the product RNA strands to form new contacts. This helix capture mechanism for manipulation of RNA tertiary structure does not require a specific binding motif or structural environment and may be general for DEAD-box helicase proteins that act on structured RNAs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Structured RNAs are involved in many essential biological processes such as pre-mRNA splicing, regulation of gene expression, protein synthesis, and maintenance of chromosome ends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Will1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Egan1">[5]</xref>. These functions require the RNAs to fold into specific structures and, for some, to transition between functional conformations. However, RNAs have a strong propensity for misfolding, and because RNA structure is inherently stable, even at the local level, resolution of misfolded RNAs or rearrangements of structured RNAs can be slow on the biological timescale. These properties suggest a general requirement for RNA folding chaperones <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Herschlag1">[6]</xref>, and diverse proteins have been shown to possess ATP-dependent or ATP-independent RNA chaperone activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Rajkowitsch1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Russell1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>DEAD-box proteins are superfamily 2 RNA helicases that can function as RNA chaperones to promote the formation and remodeling of functional RNAs and RNPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Henn1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Linder1">[10]</xref> and are linked to essentially all RNA metabolic processes in all three branches of life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Linder1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Russell2">[12]</xref>. They use a conserved helicase core of two RecA-like domains to perform a broad range of activities including protein displacement from RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Fairman1">[13]</xref>, RNA structure formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Yang1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Karunatilaka1">[15]</xref>, and their hallmark activity, ATP-dependent unwinding of short RNA helices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Linder1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Rogers1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Tijerina1">[17]</xref>, including those within structured RNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Tijerina1">[17]</xref>. However, in addition to the helical segments that constitute RNA secondary structure, structured RNAs typically include tertiary contacts that must be disrupted during many remodeling processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Russell3">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Shcherbakova1">[21]</xref>. Although it has been proposed that regulated binding to single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) might be sufficient to accelerate disruption of tertiary contacts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Jarmoskaite1">[22]</xref>, such disruptions have not been demonstrated for any DEAD-box protein, leaving the mechanisms of these RNA remodeling reactions unclear.</p>
<p>CYT-19, a DEAD-box protein found in the mitochondria of <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>, functions as a general RNA chaperone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Mohr1">[23]</xref>, facilitating correct folding of diverse group I intron RNAs by accelerating unfolding of misfolded intermediates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Tijerina1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Sinan1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Bhaskaran1">[24]</xref>. Here, we probe how CYT-19 promotes unfolding of structured intermediates by monitoring changes in the secondary and tertiary structure of the P1 helix within the <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> group I intron ribozyme, which has been extensively studied as an isolated tertiary folding event within a globally folded RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Bartley1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Narlikar1">[26]</xref>. The P1 helix forms by base pairing of the ribozyme with an oligonucleotide substrate that mimics the 5′ splice site. This helix docks into tertiary contacts with the ribozyme core, principally through hydrogen bonds between 2′-OH groups within the helix and nucleotides within the core <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Narlikar2">[27]</xref>. CYT-19 can unwind the P1 helix, and previous results have shown that the unwinding efficiency depends on the docking stability of the P1 helix, suggesting that unwinding requires loss of the tertiary contacts prior to or during unwinding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Tijerina1">[17]</xref>. However, it was unclear how CYT-19 accomplished the RNA tertiary unfolding and whether it resulted from a known or a novel activity.</p>
<p>To dissect this multistep remodeling process, we used a single molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) approach to observe CYT-19 disruption of the 11-bp P1 helix. We directly monitored changes in both tertiary structure and secondary structure, allowing us to independently resolve and quantify the effects of CYT-19 on each step. Thus, we generated a detailed view of the process by which a DEAD-box protein can promote local unfolding of a structured RNA with disruption of tertiary and secondary contacts. Our results lead to a simple physical model that explains previous results, suggests a general mechanism for directing DEAD-box proteins to misfolded RNA intermediates, and is likely to be used broadly by DEAD-box proteins that remodel structured RNAs.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To measure secondary and tertiary transitions of the P1 helix, we used a smFRET system that was designed previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Bartley1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Solomatin1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Zhuang1">[29]</xref>. The ribozyme was extended from its 3′ end and annealed to a complementary oligonucleotide that was immobilized on a microsope slide by a biotin/streptavidin linkage for visualization using total internal reflection (TIR) microscopy (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001981.s010">Table S3</xref>). Cy3 and Cy5 dyes were positioned such that docked P1 gives efficient energy transfer from Cy3 to Cy5 and a correspondingly high FRET value (∼0.9), whereas undocked P1 gives a greatly reduced FRET value (∼0.2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001981-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Bartley1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Solomatin1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Zhuang1">[29]</xref>. Loss of secondary structure in P1—that is, unwinding of the helix—is detected as a loss of all fluorescence, because the Cy3-labeled strand is released into solution. A loss of fluorescence can also reflect Cy3 photobleaching, which was measured separately and subtracted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001981.s001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001981.s015">Text S1</xref>, “P1 Unwinding Monitored Using Single Molecule Fluorescence and Determination of P1 Docking and Undocking Kinetics”).</p>

<title>CYT-19 Does Not Accelerate Loss of Tertiary Contacts Between the P1 Helix and the Ribozyme Core</title>
<p>In the absence of CYT-19, P1 was predominantly docked in most molecules but underwent cycles of undocking and redocking, as observed previously under similar conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Bartley1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Solomatin1">[28]</xref>. Docking and undocking rate constants were determined from the lifetimes of the P1 helix in the undocked and docked state, respectively, giving a docking rate constant of 120 min<sup>−1</sup> and an undocking rate constant of 20 min<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001981-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, top trace, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001981-g001">Figure 1C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001981.s002">Figure S2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001981.s008">Table S1</xref>). Spontaneous unwinding of the P1 helix, as measured by a loss of Cy3 fluorescence beyond the rate expected for photobleaching, was not detectable. However, addition of CYT-19 and ATP led to robust unwinding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001981-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, second trace, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001981.s003">Figure S3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001981.s008">Table S1</xref>). We found that P1 unwinding occurred primarily from the low FRET state (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001981.s015">Text S1</xref>, “P1 Unwinding Monitored Using Single Molecule Fluorescence”). Thus, the CYT-19–mediated remodeling process occurs in two steps, with tertiary undocking preceding helix unwinding. Strikingly, the rate of P1 undocking was not increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001981-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), even with CYT-19 concentrations that approached saturation (see below) and gave substantial increases in the overall unwinding rate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001981.s003">Figure S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001981.s008">Table S1</xref>). Thus, CYT-19 apparently “waits” for spontaneous loss of the tertiary contacts and then interacts with the undocked P1 helix to unwind it.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>CYT-19 Captures the Undocked P1 Helix, Preventing Redocking</title>
<p>Although CYT-19 does not actively disrupt the P1 docking contact, we found that it increased the lifetime of the P1 helix in the undocked state. In the presence of CYT-19, a substantial fraction of undocked events had long lifetimes, resulting in a slow phase with an observed rate constant for redocking of 20 min<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001981-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Other undocked events were followed by rapid redocking with the intrinsic docking rate constant (120 min<sup>−1</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001981-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), presumably because CYT-19 was not bound or was not positioned to interact with the P1 helix. Supporting a contribution from incomplete binding, the fraction of undocked events with long lifetimes increased with CYT-19 concentration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001981.s008">Table S1</xref>), and additional experiments indicated that CYT-19 was approaching saturation at these concentrations but not fully saturated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001981.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
<p>For the long-lived undocked complexes, we observed a competition between alternative fates. For undocked events that were not truncated by the termination of data collection, the P1 helix was either unwound, resulting in a loss of fluorescence (56% of events), or it redocked into the ribozyme core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001981-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, middle traces, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001981.s004">Figure S4</xref>). We calculated unwinding and docking rate constants from the lifetime distributions of these complexes and the probabilities of the alternative outcomes, and we found that CYT-19 slows P1 docking by ∼20-fold to 5.2±2.1 min<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001981.s008">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001981.s009">S2</xref>, and see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001981.s015">Text S1</xref>, “Determination of P1 Docking and Undocking Kinetics”).</p>
<p>We considered the possibility that CYT-19 might be able to accelerate tertiary unfolding of a helix that forms tertiary contacts less strongly. Thus, we tested two versions of the P1 helix that include specific 2′-methoxy groups shown previously to weaken docking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Bartley1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Narlikar1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Strobel1">[30]</xref>. Although these substitutions increased the rate of undocking in the absence of CYT-19, as expected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Bartley1">[25]</xref>, CYT-19 did not accelerate undocking of the helices (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001981.s005">Figure S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001981.s008">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001981.s010">S3</xref>). Further, CYT-19 retained the ability to capture these helices when they undocked spontaneously, giving decreased rates of redocking that were comparable to that of the standard P1 helix (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001981.s005">Figure S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001981.s008">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001981.s010">S3</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, the results indicate that CYT-19 interferes with P1 docking by binding and capturing the P1 helix after it undocks spontaneously. This “helix capture” mechanism allows CYT-19 to destabilize tertiary docking of the P1 helix, shifting the equilibrium toward the undocked state, without actively disrupting the tertiary contacts.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>ATP Is Not Required for P1 Helix Capture by CYT-19</title>
<p>To probe the role of ATP in CYT-19–mediated destabilization of P1 tertiary docking, we monitored P1 docking behavior with ATP analogs and in the absence of nucleotide. We found that upon replacing ATP with the ATP analog AMP–PNP, ADP, or in the absence of nucleotide, CYT-19 does not unwind the P1 helix significantly, but it retains the ability to block tertiary docking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001981-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, bottom trace, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001981-g001">Figure 1E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001981.s008">Table S1</xref>). With AMP–PNP, the redocking rate is the same within error as with ATP, whereas the rate is modestly increased with ADP or in the absence of nucleotide (2–3-fold, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001981.s008">Table S1</xref>). Overall, the lack of a requirement for nucleotide binding suggests that helix capture by CYT-19 does not require closure of the two RecA-like domains of the helicase core <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Theissen1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Sengoku1">[33]</xref> and may result primarily from interactions of the helix with domain 2 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Mallam1">[34]</xref>.</p>

<title>Helix Unwinding Can Be Limited by the Rate of Tertiary Contact Disruption</title>
<p>When CYT-19 interacts with the 11-bp P1 helix, helix unwinding is partially rate limiting for the overall disruption process, as indicated by the substantial fraction of long-lived undocking events that result in P1 redocking rather than unwinding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001981.s009">Table S2</xref>). Most helical segments in structured RNAs are shorter than 11 bp and correspondingly less stable, such that unwinding of these helices may be fast enough that the overall process is fully rate limited by the intrinsic loss of the tertiary contacts. We tested this idea using a ribozyme construct with a shorter P1 helix of 6 bp, which also displayed extended undocked lifetimes in the presence of CYT-19 and AMP–PNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001981-g002">Figure 2A–C</xref>). This helix was indeed unwound much faster by CYT-19 in the presence of ATP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Tijerina1">[17]</xref>, which precluded generating robust statistics with smFRET (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001981.s011">Table S4</xref>). Therefore, we used rapid quench-flow techniques to measure the maximum rate constant for the overall process of P1 unwinding by CYT-19 (<italic>k</italic><sub>max</sub>, which includes loss of tertiary structure and secondary structure). When binding of CYT-19 is saturated, the 6-bp P1 helix was unwound with a <italic>k</italic><sub>max</sub> of ∼6 min<sup>−1</sup>, which is comparable to the intrinsic undocking rate constant for this helix, suggesting rate-limiting undocking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001981-g002">Figure 2C–D</xref>). As expected from the model, the <italic>k</italic><sub>max</sub> value increased when docking was weakened and decreased when docking was strengthened (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001981-g002">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001981.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Thus, unwinding of a short helix is indeed rate limited by loss of the tertiary interactions, and this tertiary disruption is not accelerated by CYT-19.</p>

<title>CYT-19 Can Remain Associated with the Ribozyme for Multiple Cycles of Helix Capture</title>
<p>We next used the CYT-19–dependent destabilization of P1 docking to monitor the lifetime of the DEAD-box protein interaction with the ribozyme, testing whether CYT-19 remains associated with the ribozyme after it releases the P1 helix. We were particularly interested in this question because previous work suggested that CYT-19 can form two distinct interactions with RNA simultaneously: one interaction through the helicase core and a second interaction through a highly basic and unstructured “tail” of 50 amino acids (the C-tail) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Grohman1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Mallam2">[36]</xref>. Thus, it would be possible that an interaction of the C-tail with the ribozyme could persist when the P1 helix is released from the helicase core of CYT-19.</p>
<p>To measure CYT-19 dissociation, we added CYT-19 and AMP–PNP to immobilized ribozyme, and then we washed CYT-19 out of the sample channel so that its dissociation from the ribozyme would be irreversible. We then monitored the FRET values of ribozyme molecules for which the P1 helix was undocked at the start of the observation period following the washout (i.e., those with a low FRET value of ∼0.2). From this collection of molecules, we plotted the average FRET value as a function of time. We interpreted the data in the context of the predictions from two models. In the first model, dissociation of the helicase core from P1 results in dissociation of CYT-19 from the ribozyme. This model predicts that the average FRET value would increase back to the value of 0.85, which reflects the “intrinsic” docking equilibrium of the ribozyme, with a rate constant of ∼5.2 min<sup>−1</sup>, the redocking rate constant for the P1 helix after being captured by CYT-19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001981-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In the second model, when P1 is released from the helicase core and redocks into the ribozyme core, CYT-19 can remain bound, presumably through its C-tail, so that it can capture P1 when it undocks again. This model would predict a time dependence consisting of at least two exponential phases. An initial increase would reflect the re-equilibration of P1 docking, with CYT-19 remaining bound, and would thus have a rate constant corresponding to the sum of the docking and undocking rate constants with bound CYT-19 (∼23 min<sup>−1</sup>). This phase would be followed by one or more slower phases reflecting CYT-19 dissociation, which would ultimately allow the docking equilibrium to return to its intrinsic state as above.</p>
<p>As predicted by both models, the average FRET value of these molecules increased over time, ultimately returning to a value that reflects the intrinsic P1 docking equilibrium. In strong support of the second model described above, the initial increase in FRET in the presence of CYT-19 occurred with a rate constant of ∼30 min<sup>−1</sup>, which we infer reflects the re-equilibration of P1 docking, whereas CYT-19 remains bound to the ribozyme. A subsequent increase in the average FRET value gave a rate constant of 0.43 min<sup>−1</sup>. This slow phase was not present in a control reaction lacking CYT-19, which gave a single rate constant that reflects rapid P1 redocking (∼130 min<sup>−1</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001981-g003">Figure 3</xref>, black). Thus, the slower increase in average FRET value most likely reflects dissociation of CYT-19 from the ribozyme. A very slow third phase was also observed, which most likely reflects slow re-equilibration of ribozyme molecules that form alternative states that dock P1 weakly (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001981.s002">Figure S2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Solomatin1">[28]</xref>. In the absence of CYT-19, we did not collect data at the long observation times necessary to measure this phase, but we infer that it was present because the observed endpoint was lower than the expected value (0.73 versus 0.85 expected; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001981-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, the key conclusion is that CYT-19 can remain bound to the ribozyme after releasing the captured P1 helix. The continued binding, which is most likely mediated through the C-tail of CYT-19, is expected to allow CYT-19 to participate in multiple cycles of helix capture and unwinding, with the helicase core likely remaining poised to capture P1 or other helical elements as they become exposed by transient fluctuations.</p>

<title>CYT-19 dissociation from the ribozyme.</title>
<p>Following a CYT-19 washout in the continued presence of 2 mM AMP–PNP, the average FRET value was followed for ribozyme molecules that started this observation period with the P1 helix undocked (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001981.s013">Data S1</xref>). The time evolution of the average FRET value for these molecules (red, 62 molecules) was fit by three phases with rate constants and relative amplitudes of 30 min<sup>−1</sup> (0.36), 0.43 min<sup>−1</sup> (0.29), and 0.01 min<sup>−1</sup> (0.35). We infer that the rate constant of 0.43 min<sup>−1</sup> reflects CYT-19 dissociation because this phase was not observed in the absence of CYT-19. The initial fast phase reflects P1 docking re-equilibration with bound CYT-19 and is predicted from the model, and the slowest phase most likely reflects the slow conversion of ribozyme molecules that initially give poor docking or are misfolded (see Results, “CYT-19 Can Remain Associated with the Ribozyme for Multiple Cycles of Helix Capture”). In the absence of CYT-19 (black, 64 molecules), re-equilibration of P1 docking gave a single observed phase of 130 min<sup>−1</sup> (inset). The endpoint is lower (0.73) than expected (0.85, indicated by dashed line), most likely reflecting molecules that dock P1 poorly as above.</p>

<title>The DEAD-Box Protein Ded1 Also Uses a Helix Capture Mechanism</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although DEAD-box proteins have previously been shown to promote conformational transitions of highly structured RNAs, which can require extensive disruption of tertiary interactions, it was not known how they disrupt RNA tertiary structure. Here, we used single molecule fluorescence to dissect an RNA unfolding process into discrete steps involving losses of tertiary and secondary structure. Together, our results suggest a straightforward mechanism by which DEAD-box helicase proteins can disrupt RNA tertiary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001981-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Even if the protein is pre-associated with the RNA, the helicase core does not actively disrupt tertiary contacts. Instead, it captures RNA helices that become exposed transiently by spontaneous fluctuations. For CYT-19, this helix capture process does not require ATP and may result from RNA binding by just one of the two RecA-like core domains, as closure of the two domains typically requires a bound nucleotide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Theissen1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Sengoku1">[33]</xref>. Supporting this idea, domain 2 of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> DEAD-box protein Mss116 can bind double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in the absence of an adenosine nucleotide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Mallam1">[34]</xref>. Ultimately, closure of the domains and consequent unwinding of the RNA helix permits the ssRNA product strands to form new contacts, allowing refolding to a functional structure or exchange between structures.</p>

<p>DEAD-box proteins (orange) associate with structured RNAs nonspecifically (left), which can result in the helicase core being positioned to interact with transiently exposed helices (center).

<p>This helix capture process is reminiscent of a mechanism described for some processive helicases, termed “passive unwinding,” in which the helicase does not actively disrupt base pairs but instead captures the nucleotides from the terminal base pair upon spontaneous fraying, preventing the base pair from reforming. Processive unwinding can be achieved by this mechanism if the helicase protein repetitively captures the frayed end of the helix while it tracks directionally along one of the strands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Betterton1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Manosas1">[43]</xref>. As each frayed base pair is successively captured, the loss of base stacking is expected to weaken the adjacent base pair, accelerating its fraying and therefore accelerating unwinding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Manosas1">[43]</xref>. In a conceptually analogous manner, when a DEAD-box protein captures a helix from a structured RNA, it will not only destabilize tertiary structure by preventing reformation of tertiary contacts by the captured helix, but it will also weaken additional tertiary contacts within the folded RNA if they form cooperatively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Sattin1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Shi1">[46]</xref>. Thus, despite its passive nature, this helix capture mechanism is expected to accelerate the kinetics of large-scale tertiary unfolding of structured RNAs.</p>
<p>This mechanism for unfolding RNA tertiary structure is likely to be used broadly by DEAD-box proteins that function to promote RNA folding, as it relies on their inherent abilities to bind dsRNA and induce ATP-dependent helix unwinding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Mallam1">[34]</xref>, and does not depend on any specific protein binding site or structural context. Previous work showed that CYT-19 can unfold the <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> ribozyme with an efficiency that depends on the overall stability of the RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Bhaskaran1">[24]</xref>, and helix capture provides a physical model for this result. Less stable structures are expected to undergo more frequent dynamic fluctuations, allowing for more frequent capture events and therefore more efficient unfolding. Thus, this mechanism allows DEAD-box proteins to sense RNA stability, leading to preferential action on less stable misfolded intermediates, regardless of specific structural features in the misfolded RNAs, while minimizing activity upon stable, natively folded RNA. Consistent with this view, CYT-19 is activated for ATPase activity to a lower extent by the natively folded wild-type <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> ribozyme than by less stable mutants, suggesting fewer productive interactions with the more stable structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Jarmoskaite2">[47]</xref>. A corollary of the model is that groups of cellular RNAs that lack stable tertiary structure, such as mRNAs, are potentially subject to unfolding by DEAD-box proteins. Indeed, recent work has shown that cellular mRNAs are continually remodeled, such that they are less structured on average than they are under standard <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Rouskin1">[48]</xref>. Furthermore, this remodeling requires ATP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Rouskin1">[48]</xref>, highlighting the roles of RNA helicase proteins as general manipulators of RNA structure <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>To test whether the helix capture mechanism is used by DEAD-box proteins beyond CYT-19, we monitored P1 helix unwinding by the multifunctional yeast protein Ded1. Ded1 is implicated in many processes that involve remodeling of mRNAs and mRNPs, including mRNA splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Jamieson1">[49]</xref>, transcription initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Chuang1">[50]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Hilliker1">[54]</xref> and repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Beckham1">[53]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Hilliker1">[54]</xref>, ribosome scanning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Berthelot1">[55]</xref>, RNA interference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Raponi1">[56]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Ulvila1">[57]</xref>, and RNA storage and decay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Beckham1">[53]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Hilliker1">[54]</xref>. Our findings that Ded1 does not accelerate P1 undocking and that it slows P1 redocking show that, like CYT-19, Ded1 captures the P1 helix after it loses tertiary contacts spontaneously, thus relying on the same general mechanism for RNA tertiary structure disruption. There are also two notable differences between the proteins. Most strikingly, helix capture by Ded1 requires nucleotide binding, whereas helix capture by CYT-19 does not. One possibility is that helix capture by Ded1 involves closure of the two core domains, in which case the capture event may occur concomitantly with local strand separation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Mallam1">[34]</xref>. However, any strand separation must be insufficient to give complete unwinding of the P1 helix, because we observe the completion of unwinding as a second, slower step that results in dissociation of the Cy3-labeled oligonucleotide. Alternatively, the nucleotide requirement may reflect a difference in the RNA binding and unwinding modes of Ded1. Unlike CYT-19, which is thought to use its C-tail as a tether for interaction with structured RNA, Ded1 is thought to function as a multimer, with one or more Ded1 monomers interacting with RNA structures or ssRNA extensions to localize an additional Ded1 monomer that performs helix unwinding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Jankowsky1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Jarmoskaite1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Yang3">[41]</xref>. Importantly, the Ded1 that binds the extension and serves as the landing site most likely associates through its helicase core in a nucleotide-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Jankowsky1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Jarmoskaite1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Yang3">[41]</xref>. Thus, the nucleotide requirement for helix capture may arise not from the Ded1 molecule that interacts directly with P1 but instead from a molecule that binds elsewhere on the ribozyme and recruits the Ded1 protein that binds P1.</p>
<p>A second difference is that Ded1 has a lower helix capture efficiency than CYT-19, even at protein concentrations that appear to be saturating. It is possible that when the helicase core of Ded1 binds a dsRNA, it forms an initial encounter complex that frequently dissociates and is not detected by our method. It is notable that the <italic>in vivo</italic> substrates of Ded1 tend to be less structured than the group I intron substrates encountered by CYT-19 and therefore may not require a robust helix capture efficiency. An alternative explanation is that Ded1 is preferentially positioned on the ribozyme in our single molecule experiments, most likely by additional interactions with a second Ded1 monomer as described above, and this positioning is suboptimal for capturing P1 when it undocks transiently (but close enough to block other Ded1 monomers from solution). In this case, the low capture efficiency may not be a general property of Ded1. Indeed, Ded1 is comparable to CYT-19 in its ability to promote folding transitions of group I introns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-DelCampo2">[58]</xref> and at least as active as CYT-19 for overall unwinding of isolated RNA helices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Tijerina1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-DelCampo2">[58]</xref> and of the P1 helix within the context of the ribozyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Tijerina1">[17]</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001981.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Although further studies focused on Ded1 will be required to determine the origins of the specific behaviors of Ded1, the work here demonstrates that Ded1 can disrupt RNA tertiary structure using a helix capture mechanism.</p>
<p>In addition to DEAD-box proteins that function as general RNA chaperones, the helix capture mechanism may also be important for DEAD-box proteins that function more specifically in processes such as assembly of the ribosome and spliceosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Shajani1">[59]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Koodathingal1">[61]</xref>. In these processes, capture and unwinding of dynamic helices would be expected to promote conformational transitions, whereas formation of a stable, folded surface would indicate that an RNA folding or protein assembly step has proceeded correctly. Thus, this helix capture mechanism is likely to be used widely by DEAD-box proteins, ranging from those that function as general RNA chaperones to those that promote specific RNA structural transitions in complex biological processes.</p>

<title>TIR Fluorescence (TIRF) Microscope</title>
<p>A diode-pumped solid-state green laser (532 nm; CrystaLaser GCL-100-M) and a red laser (637 nm; Coherent, maximum power 50 mW) were directed through a prism at an angle that allows TIR at the surface of the sample channel, which was constructed from a glass cover slip adhered to a quartz slide with double-sided tape. The surfaces of both the cover slip and slide were passivated with a mixture of mPEG and biotin-PEG, allowing for ribozyme immobilization while preventing protein adsorption to the slide surface (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001981.s016">Text S2</xref> for description of slide preparation). Images were collected using a 60× water-immersion Olympus UPlanApo objective (numerical aperture, 1.2), filtered through a 550-nm long-pass filter (Chroma Technology) to remove scattered excitation light, separated into “green” and “red” images using dichroic mirrors, and focused onto the two halves of a microchannel plate intensified charge-multiplying charge-coupled device (CCD) (I-Penta<italic>MAX</italic>, Princeton Instruments, Roper Scientific, Inc.).</p>

<title>Single Molecule Fluorescence Data Acquisition</title>
<p>The ribozyme was annealed to biotinylated, Cy5-labeled tether (≥10∶1 molar ratio of ribozyme to tether) in 50 mM Na-MOPS (pH 7.0) with 200 mM NaCl by heating at 95°C for 1 min before cooling at 0.1°C/s to 50°C. The ribozyme was then folded to its native conformation by adding MgCl<sub>2</sub> to a final concentration of 10 mM and incubating the solution at 50°C for 30 min. Cy3-labeled substrate oligonucleotides were then added to the prefolded ribozyme at approximately 7-fold excess and incubated for 5 min at 25°C in ribozyme buffer (50 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>). The ribozyme-substrate-tether complex was then diluted to 10–25 pM in ribozyme buffer and immobilized onto PEG slides via a biotin-streptavidin linkage (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001981.s016">Text S2</xref> for description of slide preparation).</p>
<p>To measure P1 docking and unwinding, various concentrations of CYT-19 or Ded1 protein were diluted in CYT-19 buffer solution (50 mM Na-MOPS, pH 7.0, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 mM KCl, 5% glycerol). For some experiments, ATP or another nucleotide (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001981.s008">Table S1</xref>) was added to a final concentration of 2 mM. The solution was then flowed through the sample channel along with an oxygen scavenging system (OSS) of 1 mM Trolox [(±)-6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2-carboxylic acid, Aldrich,&gt;97%], 500 mM glucose, 0.1 mg/ml glucose oxidase, and 0.06 mg/ml catalase. Images of the dye-labeled molecules within the sample channel were collected in 40-ms or 100-ms frames for 10–30 s (fully intensified at ∼1,000 V).</p>
<p>To measure CYT-19 dissociation, slide-immobilized ribozyme was incubated with near-saturating concentrations of CYT-19 (1–2 µM) along with 2 mM AMP–PNP for at least 2 min at 25°C. The sample channel was then washed with a solution of CYT-19 buffer, AMP–PNP, and OSS to remove the protein from solution, preventing CYT-19 from rebinding. After a dead time of ∼30 s, data recordings were acquired at 2-s frames for 5–10 s (to reduce dye photobleaching) every 30 s over a period of 30 min. Molecules that were present in the low FRET state at the start of data collection were selected to bias the analysis towards protein-bound ribozymes. This is because the fraction of ribozyme molecules that are undocked at given time is low in the absence of CYT-19, whereas a fraction of the protein-bound molecules would be expected to persist in the undocked state during the dead time of 30 s. Fluorescence signals were collected under green laser excitation and then under red laser excitation for colocalization of Cy3 with Cy5. The average signal-to-noise ratio was ∼5, with green laser intensity averaging ∼15 mW (measured near the laser aperture).</p>

<p>From the CYT-19–bound undocked state, the P1 helix can redock into tertiary contacts with the ribozyme core or be unwound by CYT-19. To determine whether these alternative fates arise from a kinetic competition from the same population of undocked molecules or whether they are different populations that are predetermined to undergo one fate or the other, we separately analyzed the lifetimes of P1 undocking events that led to redocking or to unwinding. The corresponding rate constants for events that led to redocking (black, 22 min<sup>−1</sup>) and unwinding (blue, 20 min<sup>−1</sup>) are comparable to each other and to <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> when all of the undocked complexes are considered together (20 min<sup>−1</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001981-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).

<p>CYT-19–mediated unwinding of the 6-bp P1 helix is rate limited by spontaneous undocking of P1. To verify that the observed correlation between the maximum P1 unwinding rate and the undocking rate is due to P1 docking stability, ensemble experiments were performed with the native <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> ribozyme and its long-lived misfolded conformer, which does not stably dock the P1 helix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001981-Zhuang1">[29]</xref>.
