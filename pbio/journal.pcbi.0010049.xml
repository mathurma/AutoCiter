					larger superfamily of homologous kinases that phosphorylate a variety of
					substrates and play important roles in all three superkingdoms of life. We used
					a carefully constructed structural alignment of selected kinases as the basis
					for a study of the structural evolution of the protein kinase–like
					superfamily. The comparison of structures revealed a “universal
					core” domain consisting only of regions required for ATP binding and
					the phosphotransfer reaction. Remarkably, even within the universal core some
					kinase structures display notable changes, while still retaining essential
					activity. Hence, the protein kinase–like superfamily has undergone
					substantial structural and sequence revision over long evolutionary timescales.
					We constructed a phylogenetic tree for the superfamily using a novel approach
					that allowed for the combination of sequence and structure information into a
					unified quantitative analysis. When considered against the backdrop of species
					distribution and other metrics, our tree provides a compelling scenario for the
					development of the various kinase families from a shared common ancestor. We
					propose that most of the so-called “atypical kinases” are
					not intermittently derived from protein kinases, but rather diverged early in
					evolution to form a distinct phyletic group. Within the atypical kinases, the
					aminoglycoside and choline kinase families appear to share the closest
					relationship. These two families in turn appear to be the most closely related
					to the protein kinase family. In addition, our analysis suggests that the
					actin-fragmin kinase, an atypical protein kinase, is more closely related to the
					phosphoinositide-3 kinase family than to the protein kinase family. The two most
					divergent families, α-kinases and phosphatidylinositol phosphate
					kinases (PIPKs), appear to have distinct evolutionary histories. While the PIPKs
					probably have an evolutionary relationship with the rest of the kinase
					superfamily, the relationship appears to be very distant (and perhaps indirect).
					Conversely, the α-kinases appear to be an exception to the scenario of
					early divergence for the atypical kinases: they apparently arose relatively
					recently in eukaryotes. We present possible scenarios for the derivation of the
					α-kinases from an extant kinase fold.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Most proteins have distinct three-dimensional structures that determine much
						of their functional capability. Proteins that are related usually have
						similar structures, owing to their shared genetic heritage and (often)
						similar function. Hence, one can speak of “families” of
						proteins that at one time all shared a common ancestor gene, but have
						diverged over eons of evolution into distinct forms with similar but altered
						sequences. In some cases, this sequence divergence can occur to the point
						that the structures of the proteins actually begin to change, forming
						“superfamilies” of distantly related proteins.
						Traditionally, events in protein evolution are investigated through the
						construction of evolutionary trees based on similarity between protein
						sequences. However, at the superfamily level sequence similarity weakens to
						the point that building accurate trees becomes much more problematic. This
						work attempts to address this problem by integrating structural similarity
						information into the analysis. Because protein structure changes much more
						slowly than sequence, structural similarity provides powerful signals about
						the relationships between proteins. When this new form of tree is considered
						alongside other evolutionary information, the authors are able to provide a
						supportable history for much of the evolution of the important protein
						kinase–like superfamily.</p></sec></abstract><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Citation:</meta-name><meta-value>Scheeff ED, Bourne PE (2005) Structural evolution of the protein

				sequence, and functional features that strongly suggest they are all derived from
				the same common ancestor protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b01">1</xref>]. However, because protein sequences
				are highly degenerate, protein superfamily relationships are often not detectable
				from sequence information alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b02">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b03">3</xref>]. Protein superfamily relationships often have become apparent
				when structures of proteins were solved experimentally, only to reveal surprising
				structural similarities with known structures (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b04">4</xref>]). Hence, structural information
				provides the gateway through which superfamily-level relationships may be studied.
				The Structural Classification Of Proteins (SCOP) database classifies proteins
				hierarchically, based on a tiered class, fold, superfamily, and family system
					[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b01">1</xref>]. The
				superfamilies within the SCOP database are divided up into distinct families of more
				closely related proteins. Protein families usually display clear sequence similarity
				and highly similar structures. Hence the “protein landscape”
				contains families of closely related proteins that share distant common ancestry
				with other families, forming superfamilies.</p><p>The Ser/Thr and Tyr protein kinases are a family of proteins that act as important
				arbiters of signal transduction in eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b05">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b07">7</xref>], and many prokaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b08">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b11">11</xref>]. With the determination of the first
				protein kinase structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b12">12</xref>], it became possible to place the distinctive protein kinase
				catalytic core motif into a structural context. The determination of additional
				kinase structures enforced the notion that the basic fold of the protein kinase
				catalytic core was structurally well conserved, and had been reused across long
				evolutionary timescales in a largely intact form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b13">13</xref>].</p><p>The protein kinases exert control over their protein targets by covalent modification
				of a Ser, Thr, or Tyr residue with the γ-phosphate group cleaved from ATP.
				All of the typical protein kinases (TPKs) share a common catalytic core consisting
				of a small, mostly β-sheet, N-terminal subdomain and a larger, mostly
				α-helical, C-terminal subdomain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b13">13</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The ATP binding pocket sits in a cleft
				between these two subdomains, which can rotate into “open” and
				“closed” conformations depending on ATP binding and the
				activation state of the molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b16">16</xref>]. The residues involved in the
				phosphotransfer reaction sit at the outside edge of the ATP binding region and are
				highly conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b17">17</xref>].</p><fig id="pcbi-0010049-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010049.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Two Views of the Structure of PKA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b70">70</xref>]</title><p>The structure consists of two subdomains: a small, primarily β-sheet
						N-terminal subdomain, and a larger, primarily helical C-terminal subdomain.
						ATP and metal ions are bound in the cleft between the two subdomains. The
						small left-side view depicts PKA in the “standard”
						orientation used by the authors when the structure was initially solved
							[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b12">12</xref>], and in many subsequent publications. The larger view
						on the right side depicts PKA in an “open-book” format
						that makes structural features in the two subdomains easier to compare
						between families. The open-book view is achieved by rotating the standard
						view 90° about the vertical axis, then splitting the two subdomains
						at the linker region and rotating each 90° in opposite directions
						about the horizontal axis. Helical secondary structures (both
						α-helices and 3–10 helices) are depicted as cylinders,
						and β-strands are depicted as arrows. Elements are labeled
						according to the standard conventions for PKA. Some secondary structure
						(particularly 3–10 helices) is not labeled in the standard PKA
						convention, and so is unlabeled here. One structure (Helix 1) was named by
						us (see text). Underlined labels belong to helical structures;
						non-underlined labels belong to β-strands. Secondary structure
						elements are colored according to their conservation status in the overall
						superfamily as follows: yellow, elements are part of the
						“universal core” seen in all kinases in the superfamily;
						orange, elements are present in more than two, but not all, of the kinases
						in the superfamily; purple, elements seen only in this family, but inserted
						within in the portion of the chain forming the universal core; blue,
						elements seen only in this family, and connected to the N- or C-terminal
						ends of the universal core. A bound pseudosubstrate inhibitor (PKI) is
						present in the structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b12">12</xref>], and depicted in gray. This
						inhibitor likely describes the binding location of actual substrates of PKA.
						The bound ATP molecule is rendered as a ball-and-stick model, while the
						bound Mg ions are rendered as gray spheres. The ATP and Mg ions are
						duplicated in mirror image and shown interacting with both the N- and C-
						terminal subdomains in the open-book rendering. The most critical and highly
						conserved residues in PKA (and the broader superfamily) are shown as
						ball-and-stick models in green, and labeled according to the standard PKA
						numbering scheme. In addition, the glycine-rich loop is also depicted in
						green, though individual glycine residues are not shown. The loop that forms
						the linker region between the subdomains is depicted in red. Other loops
						within the universal core are shown in white, except for loops linking
						purple regions (which are shown in purple), and loops outside of the
						universal core (shown in blue). Key loops described extensively in the text
						are labeled. For increased clarity, residues 300–350 have been
						removed from the C-terminus of PKA. This loop region is unique to PKA, and
						would have been colored blue if present in the figure. Molecular renderings
						in this figure were created with MOLSCRIPT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b90">90</xref>].</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010049.g001" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>With the acceleration in the rate of deposition to the Protein Data Bank (PDB)

					[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b23">23</xref>]. This

				α-kinase family, a small but important kinase family that has no
				detectable sequence similarity to the TPKs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b27">27</xref>]. The α-kinases are so named
				because they appear to phosphorylate residues within α-helices
					[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b28">28</xref>], as
				opposed to the loop-type regions targeted by the TPKs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b29">29</xref>]. ChaK has a
				relatively similar N-terminal subdomain to that of the TPKs, but its C-terminal
				domain is extensively modified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b20">20</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) phosphorylate various forms of
				phosphatidylinositol (PI) at the 3-hydroxyl position. The available PI3K structure
					[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b21">21</xref>] is
				that of PI3Kγ, a “class IB” PI3K that preferentially
				phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
				[PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>], creating phosphatidylinositol
				3,4,5-trisphosphate [PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b30">30</xref>].
				PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> is an important second messenger that activates a variety of
				pathways in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b31">31</xref>]. Relative to the TPKs, PI3K has a somewhat
				“flat-faced” architecture, with a more open active-site region
					(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This structure
				allows it (in concert with accessory domains) to interact directly with the plasma
				membrane and phosphorylate PI in situ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b21">21</xref>].</p><p>Actin-fragmin kinase (AFK) is a Thr protein kinase that has been isolated from the

				in only this one organism. It phosphorylates actin when it is bound to the protein
				fragmin, helping to render control over actin polymerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b32">32</xref>]. Though this enzyme
				is clearly homologous to the TPKs, it has a modified N-terminal subdomain and an
				extensively modified C-terminal subdomain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The modifications in the C-terminal
				domain produce a flattened substrate binding region that allows for binding to the
				target actin molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b22">22</xref>].</p><p>Type IIβ phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (PIPKIIβ)
				phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PI5P) at the 4-hydroxyl position to
				generate PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is an important second messenger
				in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b33">33</xref>],
				and can be further phosphorylated by PI3K as described above. The enzyme forms a
				homodimer that displays a highly flat-faced architecture with large patches of
				positively charged residues. This structure appears to allow PIPKIIβ to
				interact directly with the cell membrane, phosphorylating PI5P in situ
					[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b19">19</xref>].
				PIPKIIβ is a structurally divergent enzyme that is not actually within the
				protein kinase–like superfamily as defined by SCOP. PIPKIIβ has
				almost no sequence similarity, and weak structural similarity, to the protein
				kinase–like superfamily. For this reason, it is in a different fold
				grouping in the SCOP hierarchy (d.143.1, as opposed to d.144.1). However, a careful
				study has linked this structure to the protein kinase–like superfamily
				through comparative structure analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b34">34</xref>]. Cheek et al. have provided a
				comprehensive classification for all kinases, including the many superfamilies
				without any evolutionary relationship to the protein kinase–like
				superfamily (when the term “kinase” is used in this work, it
				refers specifically to members of the protein kinase–like superfamily)
					[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b36">36</xref>]. Unlike SCOP, they
				have placed the PIPK family within the same fold group as the kinase superfamily.
				Also, PIPKIIβ appears to share a similar catalytic mechanism to that of the
				kinases. Therefore, it is considered in this work, as an example of an
				evolutionarily ambiguous structural relationship.</p><p>We sought to use the structures of these AKs and the TPKs to determine a true
				“essential” kinase fold that is seen in all members of the
				kinase superfamily, as well as shared structural characteristics between the various
				families. We encoded these structural characteristics into a phylogenetic character
				matrix. We then combined this information with a structure-based sequence alignment
				in a unified Bayesian phylogenetic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b38">38</xref>]. Such an approach has been used previously for sequence data
				combined with morphological data, to determine relationships between species
					[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b39">39</xref>].
				Also, discrete structural and sequence motif characters have been used previously to
				study fold-level relationships between protein structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b40">40</xref>]. However, to our
				knowledge, our study is the first in which the nuanced information available in a
				full-length sequence alignment is combined with structural characters in a unified
				analysis. Use of these two complementary sources of data allowed us to make rational
				phylogenetic predictions with high confidence, despite the very low sequence
				similarity inherent in superfamily-level comparisons. The results provide
				considerable insight into the development of the various kinases in the superfamily
				from a common ancestor. In addition, our approach offers a new and broadly
				applicable approach to the study of protein superfamily evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Selection of a Representative Kinase Structure Set</title><p>The large number of kinase structures available necessitated the selection of a

					(see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref> for details of
					our selection criteria). The resulting set of structures constituted 25 TPKs and
					the six AKs described in the introduction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010049-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Structural Alignment and Analysis of the Superfamily</title><p>Creation of a highly accurate alignment using sequence information alone is

					order to provide an overview of the structural and sequence features of the
					superfamily, we created an alignment of the structures based on their structural
					features. Although automated structure alignment methods are available
						[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b43">43</xref>],
					their accuracy is limited, and the ideal alignment of structures is often
					ambiguous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b45">45</xref>]. Therefore, to
					ensure a highly accurate alignment the structures were aligned manually, using
					an automated multiple structure alignment as a starting point (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of the aligned structures and sequences produced several key themes.
					First, the kinases all share a universal conserved core section, which roughly
					describes the region constituting the ATP binding pocket and locations of
					residues involved in the phosphotransfer reaction. Second, the conserved region,
					while mostly maintained in terms of its overall secondary structures, is often
					modified substantially in terms of the spatial placement of the structural
					elements. Third, the kinases generally have distinctive structural elements
					joined to both the N- and C-terminal ends of the universal core region. In
					addition, many also have substantial insertions that occur within conserved
					structural elements in the universal core region. In most cases, these
					structural insertions have absolutely no spatial similarity between families,
					though there are intriguing exceptions. Fourth, though the sequence similarity
					between families is very low, a small group of residues shows remarkable
					conservation across the entirety of the superfamily. Many of these residues have
					been previously recognized as highly important for proper activity in the TPKs
						[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b17">17</xref>]. Hence, it
					appears that the all of the kinases utilize a similar mechanism for
					phosphotransfer. The overall impression that emerges is one of a superfamily
					that has assiduously retained its basic function, but simultaneously has been
					heavily modified over the course of evolution to phosphorylate a variety of
					targets, interact with a range of partner proteins, and respond to different
					regulatory mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Phylogenetic Analysis of the Kinase Superfamily</title><p>Traditionally, molecular phylogenies are constructed as trees based on sequence
					similarity, coupled to an underlying theory of sequence evolution
						[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b46">46</xref>].
					The extreme sequence divergence seen in the kinase superfamily (and in
					superfamilies in general) makes such determinations problematic. Therefore, in
					order to postulate an evolutionary history for the kinase superfamily, we
					constructed a phylogenetic tree using a Bayesian method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b39">39</xref>] to integrate the sequence and

					The sequence alignment presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g301">Figure 3</xref> was used as the input alignment. Because this sequence

					characteristics into a character matrix allowed for much of the structural
					information from our comparative analysis to be quantitatively evaluated in

					course of evolution, it is possible to determine the likely relationships
					between proteins through comparative structure analysis. Structures that have
					similar features are likely to share a closer evolutionary relationship,
					especially if the features are uncommon in protein structures in general
						[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b49">49</xref>]. Based on our structural
					alignment, we undertook a careful comparative analysis of the structures in the
					superfamily to isolate distinctive structural characters seen in only one or
					more structures in the superfamily, but not all.</p><p>The majority of characters collected were in the universal core of the kinases,
					as this is the most conserved portion between the different families in the
					superfamily. This region represents a functional “cassette”
					responsible for the essential kinase functions of ATP binding and
					phosphotransfer. Almost all sequence and structure changes within this cassette
					during evolution would be expected to be deleterious to proper kinase function.
					Hence, in the most parsimonious scenario, any successful changes in the region
					would likely occur only once, and then be reused by progeny kinases. Therefore,
					similarities (and differences) seen within the universal core are expected to be
					more significant than similarities in other parts of the structures.</p><p>In addition, characters were collected for structures outside of the universal
					core shared by only a subset of the superfamily. Since these sorts of structures
					are further from the functional core, they can be expected to change more
					quickly than those within the core. Therefore, to be included, these sorts of
					structures had to be substantial and distinctive, as opposed to the more subtle
					structural differences accepted in the core. Finally, a subset of characters
					specific only to the TPKs was collected. Because there is more than one
					structure available for this family, this information was used to help improve
					the phylogenetic analysis within the highly diverse TPK family.</p><p>Since sequence motif information is inherently present in the sequence alignment
					(and this was included in the analysis), the presence/absence of particular
					sequence motifs was generally not included in the character matrix. However,
					specific modifications involving sequence that had special structural or
					functional implications were included, since in many cases the critical
					importance of these changes is not sufficiently expressed within the sequence
					data.</p><p>We provide a brief summary of each of the characters included in the analysis,
					and their importance to the structure and function of the enzymes. For the sake
					of economy, when secondary structural elements that form the universal core are
					named generically, we use the conventions used for protein kinase A (PKA)
						[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b12">12</xref>]
					(and many other TPKs) and use uppercase to denote this standardized nomenclature
					(e.g., “Helix C”). When elements from specific structures
					are discussed, the corresponding element names for these structures (where
					different from those for PKA) are provided in lowercase. Conversion of this
					scheme to that used for the other kinase families is available in the labeling
					of elements in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g001">Figures 1</xref> and
						<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g002">2</xref>. Similarly, the
					residue numbers for generic residue positions are based on the residues and
					numbers for PKA. In cases where a residue number is provided that is specific to
					a structure, it is followed by the residue number for the comparable residue in
					PKA in parentheses (e.g., “Q1767(L172)”). Comparable
					residues for any other structure in the set may then be retrieved from the
					alignment provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g301">Figure

					order.</p><sec id="s2d1"><title>1: Ion pair analogous to K72-E91 in PKA.</title><p>In all of the kinases, a very highly conserved lysine (K72) or arginine
						residue is present in Strand 3, facing the binding pocket. In most of the
						structures with bound ATP, K72 interacts with the α and β
						phosphates of the ATP molecule, helping to stabilize them in the proper
						conformation for phosphotransfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b15">15</xref>]. The position of K72 is
						stabilized by the formation of an ion pair with a glutamic acid residue
						(E91) in Helix C. By linking Helix C to Strand 3, the Lys-Glu ion pair also
						helps to stabilize the overall fold of the N-terminal subdomain. Some of the
						AKs have conservative substitutions at either of these positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g301">Figure 3</xref>). In others, such
						as PI3K [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b21">21</xref>] and ChaK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b20">20</xref>], the negatively charged
						residue at E91 may play a diminished role, or form an ion pair with K72 only
						when the kinase is in an active conformation. Such conformational shifts are
						seen in the TPKs, wherein the K72-E91 ion pair is broken by movement of
						Helix C when the kinase is in an inactive state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b50">50</xref>]. The one distinctive
						exception is seen in PIPKIIβ, which retains K72 but lacks a clear
						replacement for E91. D156(H87) in PIPKIIβ may fulfill the role of
						E91 in PKA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b19">19</xref>], but unlike the other kinases, a negative charge has
						been completely removed from position E91 in PIPKIIβ.</p></sec><sec id="s2d2"><title>2: α-Helix B.</title><p>Between Strand 3 and Helix C, most of the kinases have a short loop
						structure. However, the AGC group of TPKs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010049-t001">Table 1</xref>) and the aurora-2 kinase
							[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b51">51</xref>] share the distinctive α-Helix B at this
						location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g301">Figure 3</xref>).
						This helix is not seen in any of the other TPKs. Remarkably, however, it is
						seen in ChaK, where it is the same length, though it is shifted spatially
						from what is seen in the AGC kinase PKA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g001">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g301">3</xref>). Hence, the conservation of Helix B in
						ChaK is surprising, particularly given its distinctive structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2d3"><title>3: Kink in α-Helix C.</title><p>In PIPKIIβ, helix 4 (Helix C) contains a distinctive kink not seen
						in any of the other kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This kink requires some reorganization of the ATP
						binding pocket and allows for interaction of the N-terminal subunit with the
						highly modified shape of the C-terminal subunit (see characters below). The
						kink also appears to play a role in the lack of a K72-E91 ion pair
						(character 1) in this structure, because it places the region of the helix
						where the required Glu residue would reside far from K150(K72).</p></sec><sec id="s2d4"><title>4: Kink in Strand 4.</title><p>Most kinases in the superfamily have a distinctive kink near the beginning of
						Strand 4. This kink modifies the placement and architecture of much of the
						hydrophobic pocket formed by Strand 4, Helix C, and Helix E. ChaK, PI3K, and
						AFK are the exceptions, and contain a straightened (and/or shortened) Strand
						4 (strand 9 in ChaK; strand 6 in PI3K), which changes the architecture in
						this region of the core. This change results in the requirement for a gap
						within the Strand 4 region when aligning these structures with others in the
						superfamily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g002">Figures 2</xref>
						and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g301">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2d5"><title>5: Helical structure in the area of α-Helix D.</title><p>Helix D appears just after the linker region in the TPKs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In most of the
						AKs, helical structures are present in this region, though they are not
						always superposable, and some are 3–10 helices rather than
						α-helices. However, ChaK is distinctive in that it completely
						lacks this element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g002">Figure
						2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2d6"><title>6: Orientation of α-Helix E.</title><p>Helix E stabilizes the ATP binding pocket through its interactions with
						Strands 7 and 8. In most of the kinases, it is oriented at approximately
						45° to these elements, but in PIPKIIβ, helix 6(Helix E) is
						approximately parallel to them, a major reorganization of the supporting
						structure of the catalytic core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2d7"><title>7: Key conserved histidine at H158.</title><p>Helix E (helix D in CKA-2; helix 4 in APH(3′)-IIIa) also contains a
						conserved histidine residue, H158, which is shared only between the TPKs and
						the APH and CK families. Remarkably however, H158 is not conserved in the
						tyrosine kinase group within the TPKs. H158 forms a hydrogen bond with D220
						and in so doing, participates in a hydrogen-bond network that links together
						Helices E, F, and the crossing loops in the catalytic region of these
						kinases (see below and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g005">Figure
						5</xref>). Hence, in the conservation of this interaction, the APH and CK
						families display a closer relationship to the Ser/Thr TPKs than do the
						tyrosine kinases (it should be noted that H158, while conserved in APHs, is
						less conserved than it is in the Ser/Thr TPKs and CKs, and may be of
						somewhat reduced importance in this family).</p><fig id="pcbi-0010049-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010049.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Shared Hydrogen-Bonding Networks between Distantly Related

						helices, linked by a short loop containing a small helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In both

						hydrogen-bond networks that stabilize the architecture of the active site.
						There are distinctive similarities in these networks that suggest relatively
						close evolutionary relationships between some families. The TPKs, CKA-2, and
						APH(3′)-IIIa all share an H-bond network centered around a highly
						conserved His or Tyr residue at position Y164, which usually forms a
						hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl of position T183, just after the
						end of Strand 8 (strand 11 in CKA-2). This interaction is significant,
						because D184 is highly conserved, and interacts with a magnesium atom in the
						active site that is important for ATP interaction and the phosphotransfer
						reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b13">13</xref>]. In addition, this region is the area in which a
						“crossing loops” structure is formed, where the
						catalytic loop and the loop between Strands 8 and 9 cross. This type of
						motif is unusual in protein structures, and is one of the hallmarks of the
						kinase superfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b34">34</xref>]. The Y164-T183 hydrogen bond is also a part of a larger
						conserved H-bond network shared by the APH, CK, and TPK families. This
						network includes H158 in Helix E (character 7) and D220 in Helix F (helix G
						in CKA-2; helix 5 in APH(3′)-IIIa), and essentially ties together
						the catalytic region in these kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>In AFK and PI3K, the H-bond to the backbone of position T183 is instead made
						by an arginine residue at position L167 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g301">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g005">5</xref>). This Arg residue effectively
						replaces, from a location three positions down the chain, the function of
						Y164. Thus, these two structures share a distinctive interaction at the
						center of their catalytic regions that replaces a conserved interaction seen
						in many of the other kinases. Further, these two kinases both lack the
						extended H-bond network seen in the three families above.</p><p>ChaK and PIPKIIβ do not have any of the H-bonding patterns seen in

						Strand 7 the backbone in most of the kinases adopts a structure commonly
						called the “catalytic loop.” In most structures
						containing the element, this “loop” actually consists
						partly of a short 3–10 helix. Two structures, PIPKIIβ and

						linear connection between D166 and Strand 7 (strand 10 in PIPKIIβ;

						conserved asparagine residue, N171. This important residue is responsible
						for interaction with a magnesium ion, which in turn interacts with the
						phosphate groups of ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b13">13</xref>]. It also participates in the
						H-bond network discussed above (see “Structure underlying the

						divergence in compensation for the lack of N171. In ChaK, the next position
						down the chain, Q1767(L172) is the highly similar residue glutamine.
						Remarkably, the longer side-chain of this glutamine is angled such that the
						amide group is in a similar location in space to the amide group of N171 in
						the other structures. Conversely, in PIPKIIβ there is no obvious
						compensation for the loss of N171, and since ATP is not present in this
						structure it is unclear how PIPKIIβ interacts with ATP without
						N171. Hence, ChaK is more similar to the rest of the kinases in this area of
						the structures, and this is reflected in our matrix (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010049-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2d13"><title>13: Similar direct hydrophobic link between catalytic region and Helix E.</title><p>In the structures of the TPKs, APH(3′)-IIIa, and CKA-2, conserved
						hydrophobic residues (L167 and L172) flank the 3–10 helix and face
						into the hydrophobic core. They interact directly with each other, as well
						as a conserved hydrophobic residue at I150 in Helix E (helix D in CKA-2;
						helix 4 in APH(3′)-IIIa). Though many other kinase families have
						conserved hydrophobic residues at these positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g301">Figure 3</xref>) and have a clear hydrophobic
						pocket, this distinctive link is specific to the TPK, APH, and CK families.
						These interactions are important because they form a direct link between the
						Catalytic Loop and Helix E, stabilizing the conformation of the Catalytic
						Loop.</p></sec><sec id="s2d14"><title>14: Nature of structure linking Strand 9 and Helix F.</title><p>The region immediately following Strand 9 is termed the “Activation
						Loop” in the TPKs, because many TPKs are regulated by
						phosphorylation of residues in this loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b54">54</xref>]. All of the TPKs in our set
						have a substantial activation loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g301">Figure 3</xref>). The loop immediately following
						the Activation Loop is often termed the “P+1
						loop” in the TPKs, because it interacts with residues in the
						substrate protein chain one position (and beyond) from the actual residue
						targeted for phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b29">29</xref>]. The P+1 loop is
						followed by the distinctive APE (or similar) motif in most TPKs. Beginning
						at P207 in the motif there is a conserved helix, which we term Helix 1 to
						avoid conflict with the standard TPK naming scheme. The last residue in the
						APE motif, E208, is highly conserved within the TPKs. It forms an ion pair
						with an arginine residue, R280, further down the chain. R280 is located in a
						loop between Helices H and I. Hence, the effect of the ion pair is to hold
						the C-terminal subdomain together. This ion pair is retained in all TPKs
						except the CK1 group (see character 17). However, in terms of overall
						architecture, all the TPKs have a similar structure in the Helix 1 region
						(and the rest of the C-terminal subunit).</p><p>None of the AKs share a similar structure to TPKs in the Activation Loop
						region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Most
						structures have a markedly shortened loop relative to that seen for the
						activation/P+1 loops in the TPKs, and the structures are distinct
						in most families (accurate analysis of the Activation Loop regions of many
						of the AKs is difficult because they are not resolved in the experimental
						structures). The exceptions are CKA-2 and APH(3′)-IIIa, which
						share a distinctive short and highly twisted β-sheet in the
						Activation Loop region formed by Strands 6 and 9 (strands 9 and 12 in CKA-2;
							<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This
						structure allows for an extremely short “Activation
						Loop,” the shortest within the superfamily.</p></sec><sec id="s2d15"><title>15: Positioning of Helix F.</title><p>Helix F, which follows the various loop structures, constitutes the last
						region of structural similarity shared by all of the kinases, though the
						similarity in this region drops off rapidly. It could be argued that in some
						cases, this helix superposes so poorly between superfamily structures that
						it should not be considered part of the “universal
						core.” However, it is present with an approximately similar
						orientation in all structures, and in most cases seems to have a similar
						role: stabilization of the backbone of the Catalytic Loop. However, the
						manner in which this stabilization is achieved is highly variable.</p><p>An exception to this variability is seen between the TPKs,
						APH(3′)-IIIa, and CKA-2. In these three families, Helix F (helix G
						in CKA-2; helix 5 in APH(3′)-IIIa) is maintained in a highly
						similar orientation and is readily superposable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g002">2</xref>). More significantly, the families
						share an aspartate residue, D220, that is highly conserved in the three
						families. This residue forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone amides of Y164
						and R165 and (with the exception of the tyrosine kinases; see character 7
						above) the side-chain of H158. Hence, a network of residues and contacts
						that is responsible for the specific geometry of the most conserved regions
						of the kinase fold has been carefully conserved in these three kinase
						families.</p><p>Though Helix F can be superposed relatively well between the TPK, APH, and CK
						families, it is much more variable in the four remaining families, and is
						only weakly superposable. The large helical insertion into the Activation
						Loop of AFK pushes helix 8 (Helix F) into an angled position, such that it
						tilts away from the catalytic loop. The space opened by this translocation
						is filled by the insertion seen in the middle of the catalytic loop in this
						structure (character 11 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In PI3K, helix 7 (Helix F) is shortened such that a
						loop region interacts with much of the catalytic loop, partly replacing the
						role of Helix F in other structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In ChaK, helix E (Helix F) is
						shortened and tilted away from the catalytic loop to the point that it
						appears to play no direct role in stabilizing this element. PIPKIIβ
						has a structure that is more similar to what is seen in Helix F in the TPKs,
						except that the orientation of helix 8 (Helix F) relative to strands 10 and
						12 (Strands 7 and 8) is nearly parallel, rather than an approximate
						45° angle as seen in the TPKs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2d16"><title>16: Structural similarities in C-terminal subunit, following the
						universal core.</title><p>Though Helix F represents the end of the universal core shared by all kinases
						in the superfamily, many of the kinases have additional structure beyond
						this point, and there are shared substructures between some families that
						argue for a closer evolutionary relationship. All of the TPKs share
						superposable Helices G, H, and I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g301">3</xref>). However, none of the other kinase
						families contain these structures.</p><p>APH(3′)-IIIa and CKA-2 share two superposable helices in their
						C-terminal subunits along with a very similar overall topology. CKA-2
						follows helix G (Helix F) with a small β-sheet and a small helix,
						which APH(3′)-IIIa lacks. However, the helix that follows is
						superposable between the structures. After this helix, CKA-2 has an
						additional two helices, while APH(3′)-IIIa has an irregular loop
						structure. However, the overall path of the chain is identical between the
						two structures, and they share another superposable helix in the likely
						substrate binding region. The chain of APH(3′)-IIIa terminates at
						the end of this helix, while CKA-2 adds an additional two helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>AFK and PI3K have differing structures in the area of Helix F (helix 8 in
						AFK; helix 7 in PI3K). However, immediately following this region the two
						structures share a set of similar helical elements. The first of these
						helices interacts with Helix E (helix 6 in both AFK and PI3K), and
						superposes well between the two structures. The second and third of these
						helices superpose only weakly. However, they are in approximately similar
						orientations, and together with the first helix form a motif that is
						distinct within the superfamily. After the third helix, PI3K has two
						additional helices, which are not seen in AFK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>The C-terminal subdomain structure of ChaK is completely novel, and not
						shared by any other kinase in the superfamily. Remarkably, a zinc finger

						major elements together [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b20">20</xref>]. The zinc coordination links
						helices D and E (Helices E and F) and the final terminal helix, which each
						provide one of the coordinating histidine or cysteine residues. The final
						coordinating cysteine is provided by the loop linking helix E and the final
						helix.</p><p>The C-terminal subdomain of PIPKIIβ contains essentially no
						additional structure beyond helix 8 (Helix F).</p></sec><sec id="s2d17"><title>17: Ion pair analogous to E208-R280 in PKA (TPKs only).</title><p>In CK1, the APE sequence in Helix 1 (described above) is replaced with the
						motif SIN (which is conserved within the CK1 group). This motif essentially
						fills the roles of APE in the first two positions, but at position
						N188(E208), an asparagine residue replaces the glutamate seen in other TPKs,
						and hence no ion pair is formed. CK1 also does not contain a positively
						charged residue that correlates to R208 in the other TPKs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g301">Figure 3</xref>). However, it
						substitutes a new ion pair that the other TPKs lack. Residue E202(W222) from
						Helix F forms an ion pair with residue R261(L273) from Helix H. Thus, the
						linkage between different regions of the C-terminal subdomain is essentially
						retained, albeit with a pair of residues that are novel with respect to the
						rest of the TPKs. The substitution of APE with SIN (and a different ion
						pairing) may have implications for the evolution of CK1 relative to the
						other TPKs, given the strict conservation of the E208-R280 ion pair in these
						structures. However, the overall structure of the C-terminal subdomain of
						CK1 is still very similar to that for the other TPKs.</p></sec><sec id="s2d18"><title>18: Extensive helical insertions between Helix G and Helix H (TPKs only).</title><p>The CMGC group of TPKs contains distinctive helical insertions between Helix

						sequence and structural features.</title><p>Against the backdrop of the AKs, the TPKs can be seen to be a remarkably
						well-conserved family of enzymes, given their high level of duplication and
						broad distribution within the three superkingdoms of life (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010049-t003">Table 3</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b06">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b08">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b60">60</xref>]. It would appear that the TPK
						core structure, once arrived at, has required little modification in order
						to switch to many different protein substrates. The TPKs share not only a
						highly similar core cassette but also a large amount of distinctive
						substrate binding and stabilizing structure in their C-terminal regions. In
						addition, they contain numerous sequence motifs that are extremely well
						conserved, even though some (such as APE) appear to play a primarily
						structural role that would seem to be replaceable with other sequences and
						structures. Consistent with these observations, the TPKs form a relatively
						tight cluster in our phylogenetic tree, with clear subsections representing
						the Ser/Thr kinases and Tyr kinases, and the TKL group as an intermediate
						between the two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g004">Figure
						4</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, our tree also places the one bacterial TPK structure
						available, PknB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b61">61</xref>], in its own distinct group near the center of the tree,
						in the middle of the radiation of the TPKs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g004">Figure 4</xref>). This location is consistent
						with a scenario in which an ancestor of the TPKs arose before the radiation
						of the three superkingdoms of life, with the other TPKs in our tree
						developing separately in eukaryotes. Leonard et al. have conducted an
						in-depth sequence-based study that placed the PknB kinase within the
						“Pkn2” group of kinases in bacteria, and noted that of
						the prokaryotic kinases, the Pkn2 group is the most closely related to the
						TPKs seen in eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b08">8</xref>]. Pkn2 kinases are not seen in
						archaea, and Leonard et al. suggested that this indicates that the Pkn2
						group was horizontally transferred into bacteria from eukaryotes shortly
						after the divergence of the three superkingdoms of life. Thus, some of the
						eukaryotic-like TPKs seen in bacteria could be the result of an early
						horizontal transfer event. Our tree would also be consistent with this
						scenario. It should be noted that any scenario for the development of TPKs
						in bacteria must place them into the bacterial lineage very early in
						evolution, given their very broad distribution in this superkingdom

						had the benefit of a potentially more accurate sequence alignment, as well
						as the inclusion of structural features, we sought to compare our results
						with theirs. The two trees display a high level of agreement, though some
						differences are evident. Interestingly, where our tree differs
						substantially, we are often able to offer structural arguments suggesting
						that our tree is more likely to be correct.</p><p>In terms of the overall tree architecture of the various TPK groups, our tree
						is nearly identical to that by Manning et al<italic>.</italic>, with the
						exception that their tree places the STE group kinases closer to the TKL and
						TK groups than the CK1 group. Our tree places the CK1 group closer to TKL/TK
						than STE, with a very high posterior probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g004">Figure 4</xref>). As noted above, the TK, TKL,
						and CK1 groups share a similar Helix I structure that is changed in all
						other eukaryotic TPKs in our set (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010049-t002">Table 2</xref>, character 20, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g301">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>We also classify two specific kinases differently than Manning et
						al<italic>.</italic> The first, CK2, is classified by Manning et
						al<italic>.</italic> as “other” and placed near the root
						of the CMGC group on their tree. Our tree instead places CK2 well within the
						CMGC group, with a high posterior probability on the major branch separating
						the group from the rest of the TPKs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g004">Figure 4</xref>). As described above, CK2 also
						contains the distinctive helical insertions between Helices G and H,
						insertions otherwise only seen within members of the CMGC group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010049-t002">Table 2</xref>, character 18).
						Finally, our conventional tree also places CK2 well within the CMGC group,
						with a reasonably strong bootstrap value for the major branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g006">Figure 6</xref>). We submit that
						CK2 should be considered fully a member of the CMGC group. The other kinase
						for which our classification differs is cell cycle checkpoint kinase (Chk1).
						Manning et al<italic>.</italic> classify this kinase as a member of the CAMK
						group, placing it near the root of the group. Our tree classifies this
						kinase as “other,” and the separated CAMK group has a
						very high posterior probability on its main branch, indicating that the rest
						of the CAMK group is very sequence distinct from Chk1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Our conventional tree also
						separates Chk1 from the CAMK group, with a strong bootstrap value separating
						the CAMK group from Chk1 and the rest of the TPK family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g006">Figure 6</xref>). However, in
						this case there is no direct structural argument for the placement of Chk1
						in or out of the CAMK group. Therefore, we remove Chk1 from the CAMK group
						for purposes of our analysis, but do not necessarily argue for its
						reclassification.</p></sec><sec id="s2f2"><title>The TPK that forms the closest link with the AKs is difficult to
						determine.</title><p>The AKs form a distinct phyletic group (see below), but the TPK that
						constitutes the closest link to the AKs is difficult to verify with a high
						degree of certainty. Our tree places Chk1 in this position, with a moderate
						posterior probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g004">Figure
						4</xref>). Chk1 does seem to potentially be a good candidate, as it is
						widely distributed in eukaryotes, and is a key player in the critical (and
						presumably ancient) cellular response to DNA damage, as well as cell cycle
						control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b63">63</xref>].</p><p>However, there is no compelling structural evidence linking Chk1 to the AKs.
						Only two of our structural characters show partial representation in both
						the TPKs and AKs, thus providing structural information as to possible
						TPK/AK links (characters 2 and 7; see above and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010049-t002">Table 2</xref>). These two characters do not
						directly link Chk1 to the AKs. Chk1 also does not show any tendency toward
						lower RMSD values when aligned to the AKs, relative to other TPKs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010049-t004">Table 4</xref>). Hence, the
						linking of Chk1 to the AKs is done primarily through sequence, which can be
						unreliable at this level of divergence.</p><p>Given this level of doubt in the analysis, it is not surprising that our
						conventional tree instead presents CK1 as being the closest link (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Bootstrap
						support is very weak for the link, but as with Chk1, CK1 does have some
						characteristics that make it attractive as the link to the AKs. CK1 is the
						only kinase to replace the APE motif with a SIN motif, and in the process
						lose the distinctive E208-R280 ion pair seen in other TPKs (see above). As
						the AKs obviously lack this ion pair as well, CK1 could be seen as a more
						“primitive” kinase. Given the very broad distribution of
						the CK1 group in eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b06">6</xref>], the ion pair switch appears
						likely to have occurred shortly after the separation of eukaryotes into a
						distinct superkingdom. CK1 also has a variety of other sequence
						peculiarities that cause it to be placed in a unique location on our
						phylogenetic trees, intermediate between the Ser/Thr kinases and Tyr kinases
							(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g006">6</xref>). Hence, CK1 likely
						represents an ancient group of TPKs.</p><p>However, we are not aware of any confirmed case of a CK1-like kinase in
						prokaryotes, indicating that CK1-like kinases are limited to eukaryotes.
						BLAST searches by us against all bacterial genomes revealed that the 50
						highest scoring hits (BLAST E-values from 2 ×
						10<sup>−14</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>−8</sup>)
						maintained the usual APE motif seen in the rest of the TPKs (or similar
						motifs seen in the TPKs, such as SPE). Further, the changes seen in CK1 are
						relatively minor compared with differences between the TPKs and the AKs, and
						our structural analysis did not indicate any direct evidence that the CK1
						group should be considered closely linked to the AKs. Though CK1 is missing
						the APE motif, it still has a P+1 loop and Helix 1 structure that
						are very similar to the other TPKs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g301">Figure 3</xref>). CK1 also does not align to the
						AKs with lower RMSD or more aligned positions, relative to the other TPKs
							(<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010049-t004">Table 4</xref>).</p><p>The examples of Chk1 and CK1 illustrate the difficulty in determining the
						specific TPK that constitutes the closest link to the AKs. Though Chk1
						appears to be the strongest candidate at this time for the closest link to
						the AKs, we believe that such links will remain speculative in the absence
						of new kinase structures that might provide additional insights.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>The AKs Form a Distinct Group</title><p>There is strong evidence that the AKs form a separate phyletic group, and that
					this group has an ancient origin, probably evolving as early as the TPKs. This
					is in contrast to an alternate scenario where the TPKs developed first and then
					the AKs arose via intermittent divergence from various TPKs. An ancient origin
					for the AKs is supported by our tree, which separates the AKs from the TPKs
					completely, with a very high posterior probability on the separating branch
						(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Three of the
					families, the PI3Ks, CKs, and APHs, are broadly distributed in eukaryotes and
					seen in many bacteria, similar to the pattern seen in the TPKs (two AK families,
					the PIPKs and α-kinases, are not so broadly distributed and have a
					more puzzling origin; see next section). This is the opposite pattern from what
					would be expected if these AKs had diverged intermittently, in which case they
					would appear in only a subset of organisms. These three AK families traverse the
					entirety of the AK portion of the tree, helping to establish its ancient origin.
					Further, as mentioned in the previous section, only two of our structural
					characters indicated that specific AK families might have closer relationships
					with specific TPK groups. In other words, most of the AKs do not appear to
					simply represent different modifications of extant TPK structures.</p><p>Within the AKs, the CKs and APHs can be most closely linked with the TPKs. These
					three families share distinctive structure and sequence motifs within their core
					cassettes that stabilize the geometry of the catalytic residues and the crossing
					loops (see structure analysis above, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010049-t002">Table 2</xref>). Also, it has been shown that
					APH(3′)-IIIa has some protein kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b64">64</xref>], providing a
					functional link between the APHs and TPKs.</p><p>As stated previously, CKA-2 and APH(3′)-IIIa also share a remarkable
					amount of additional structure within their C-terminal subdomains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This structure is
					seen in two different sections of the protein chain, extensive in length,
					superposable, and not seen in any other member of the superfamily. These
					observations argue compellingly that the CK and APH families are relatively
					closely related, and the most closely related within the superfamily.
					Accordingly, our phylogenetic tree places APH(3′)-IIIa and CKA-2 close
					together, though with considerable evolutionary distance after their split
						(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g004">Figure 4</xref>). It would
					appear that choline and APHs shared a similar common ancestor. This common
					ancestor, in turn, shared a relatively close common ancestor with the TPKs.
					Whether the common ancestor looked more like a TPK or the APHs/CKs is unknown.</p><p>The TPK/APH/CK cluster can be linked to PI3K and AFK partly by establishing a
					major evolutionary split in the superfamily based on the structure of the core
					cassette. Most of the families within the superfamily have a short
					3–10 helix (or a loop in nearly this conformation) in the middle of
					their catalytic loop regions. In all of these structures, the third position of
					this 3–10 helix contains a highly conserved asparagine residue, N171,
					which is responsible for binding a metal ion. In addition, this 3–10
					helix is nearly immediately preceded by the most highly conserved reside in the
					superfamily, D166 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g301">Figure
					3</xref>). Given the critical importance of this region of the kinases,
					modifications would be expected to be extremely rare. Indeed, this motif is
					highly resistant to alteration, as a broad assortment of kinases in the
					superfamily, despite large changes in substrate and supporting structures, have
					carefully retained it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g001">Figures
					1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g002">2</xref>). AFK does
					contain an insertion between D166 and N171, demonstrating that such insertions
					can occur. However, the insertion in AFK changes the orientation of these
					residues very little, indicating that in this one case the insertion was
					acceptable precisely because it did <italic>not</italic> change the essential
					structure of the catalytic loop. However, ChaK and PIPKIIβ lack this
					element, instead using an approximately linear chain structure (with
					compensation in ChaK for the loss of N171, and no obvious compensation in
					PIPKIIβ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g002">Figures 2</xref>
					and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g301">3</xref>). Thus, it seems
					reasonable that AFK and PI3K should be grouped relatively closely to the
					TPK/APH/CK cluster, despite more extensive structural divergence between these
					structures.</p><p>Though AFK is a protein kinase, and can be linked to the TPK/APH/CK cluster, it
					appears to be more closely related to PI3K than to the TPKs. Though the
					structural evidence for this linkage is weaker than that linking together the
					TPK/APH/CK cluster, it remains persuasive. First, though PI3K and AFK share a
					similar crossing loop structure to that seen in the TPK/APH/CK cluster, the
					specific residue motifs are changed. Instead of using a histidine or tyrosine
					residue at Y164 to form a hydrogen bond with the backbone of T183 in the other
					loop, AFK and PI3K both use an arginine residue at L167 to form this interaction
						(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g005">Figure 5</xref>). This
					interaction is shared by only these two structures. In addition, AFK and PI3K do
					not conserve an aspartate residue at D220 (seen in all other kinases containing
					the 3–10 helix motif in their catalytic loop) and the larger network
					of interactions that are seen in conjunction with this residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>If structures outside of the conserved core are considered, AFK and PI3K have
					three similar helices in their C-terminal subdomains, one of which is highly
					superposable. The other two are weakly superposable, but not seen in any other
					structures in the superfamily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The net effect of the overall structure of both AFK and
					PI3K is that the enzyme is flat-faced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b22">22</xref>]. As AFK is seen in only one
					species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010049-t003">Table 3</xref>), and
					PI3K is seen in many, a scenario in which PI3K and AFK evolved from a common
					ancestor might require that AFK evolve from a kinase similar to PI3K. Such a
					scenario is quite plausible, as even present-day PI3K has some protein kinase

					change their substrate specificity relatively easily over long evolutionary

					that the PI3K catalytic domain can be readily modified to phosphorylate protein
					targets exclusively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b68">68</xref>]. However, as with PI3K, these kinases do not share obvious
					sequence similarity with AFK. AFK may thus represent an alternate modification
					of a lipid kinase to become a pure protein kinase. Alternately, both AFK and
					PI3K may have independently converged upon the observed structural similarities
					as a result of the requirement to be flat-faced. However, our phylogenetic tree
					also shows AFK and PI3K to share a common ancestor, with relatively high
					posterior probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g004">Figure

					the Rest of the Superfamily and from Each Other</title><p>Though ChaK and PIPKIIβ can be distinguished from other kinases in the
					superfamily based on their lack of a 3–10 helix in their catalytic
					loops, this does not mean they have any clear similarity to each other that
					would suggest a close evolutionary link. Indeed, these two kinases do not share
					any distinctive structure or sequence motifs, and appear no more similar to each
					other than to the 3–10 helix containing group. RMSD values and number
					of aligned positions between the two structures are no better than those for
					comparison of ChaK and PIPKIIβ with the rest of the superfamily (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010049-t004">Table 4</xref>). Both kinases share
					an approximately linear catalytic region, but the way in which this structure is
					achieved is quite different. ChaK has short strands 13 and 14 (Strands 7 and 8),
					coupled to a novel structure of strands 12 and 15 (Strands 6 and 9) that avoids
					the use of a crossing loops in the C-terminal subdomain. PIPKIIβ uses
					elongated strands 10 and 12 (Strands 7 and 8), lacks Strands 6 and 9, and has
					crossing loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Though SCOP does not place PIPKIIβ in the same superfamily as the other
					kinases, a comparative study has linked this structure to the protein
					kinase–like superfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b34">34</xref>]. Our analysis does not suggest
					any reason to doubt this linkage, but it does indicate that PIPKIIβ is
					the most divergent kinase in our set. For example, PIPKIIβ displays
					substantial changes in ion pair patterns and orientation of secondary structural
					elements (see analysis above and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010049-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Since ChaK and PIPKIIβ are highly dissimilar, it follows that that they
					should not be considered close relatives. Both ChaK and PIPKIIβ have
					been suggested to provide possible links between the protein
					kinase–like superfamily and two other superfamilies containing mostly
					metabolic enzymes: the SAICAR synthase and ATP-grasp superfamilies
						[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b34">34</xref>]. In the case of
					PIPKIIβ, our analysis does not contradict this possibility.
					PIPKIIβ is extremely structurally distant from the rest of the
					superfamily (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010049-t004">Table 4</xref>), and
					conserves only the most minimal set of residues related to ATP binding and
					catalysis, as well as a few hydrophobic residues that form shared hydrophobic
					cores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g301">Figure 3</xref>). We
					attempted to place PIPKIIβ on our phylogenetic tree, both in an effort
					to illuminate its origins, and provide a possible outgroup for the tree.
					Remarkably, the tree places the origin of the PIPKs in the middle of the AKs.
					This region could be a likely “origin” point for the
					kinases, where an ancestral kinase diverged to form the AKs, as well as the TPKs
						(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, the
					phylogenetic tree results are consistent with a very distant relationship
					between PIPKs and the rest of the kinase superfamily. However, given the weak
					structural evidence for the location of PIPKs on the tree, this link should be
					considered speculative (while PIPKIIβ has many distinct structural
					features, most do not provide informative characters in our matrix for purposes
					of placing branches). Consideration of species distribution of the PIPKs
					indicates that they appear to be restricted to the eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010049-t003">Table 3</xref>). This observation
					suggests that PIPKs are a more recent arrival into the arsenal of kinases,
					perhaps developed by eukaryotes in response to a heightened requirement for more
					complex signaling networks. However, if the PIPKs are a relatively recent
					invention, this precludes a role for them as a direct link between the SAICAR
					synthase and/or ATP-grasp folds and protein kinase–like superfamily.
					However, it does not preclude the possibility that the PIPKs and the kinase
					superfamily share a very distant common ancestor (which was not necessarily
					functionally a kinase). The PIPKs share notable structural similarity with the
					SAICAR synthetase family, leading them to be grouped within this superfamily in
					the SCOP database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b01">1</xref>]. We speculate that the PIPKs may have become kinases through
					derivation from an ancient non-kinase fold, perhaps a protein similar to SAICAR
					synthetase. Hence, they may have become kinases through a process of
					“convergent divergence” with the rest of the kinase
					superfamily. In such a scenario, the PIPKs would have converged upon the same
					kinase activity that had already been discovered much earlier by their distant
					relatives in the rest of the kinase superfamily.</p><p>Though ChaK has also been suggested as a possible link between the kinase
					superfamily and the ATP-grasp superfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b20">20</xref>], our results, as well as the work
					of others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b27">27</xref>], cast considerable doubt upon this hypothesis.
					Consideration of the species distribution of α-kinases indicates that
					they are only narrowly distributed in eukaryotes, appearing primarily in
					metazoans, and completely absent from green plants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010049-t003">Table 3</xref>). This data suggests that the
					α-kinases appeared relatively recently in evolution, and thus they are
					precluded from being a direct link between two ancient and widely distributed
					superfamilies. Presumably, the α-kinases were derived from an extant
					kinase. However, determining the closest relative to the α-kinases is
					difficult because of the extremely divergent sequence and structure of ChaK.</p><p>Our Bayesian tree places ChaK well within the AKs, closest to PI3K and AFK.
					Though the posterior probability is relatively low for the branch separating
					these three families, it is high for the branch separating the three families
					and the PIPKs from the rest of the superfamily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g004">Figure 4</xref>). This would suggest that the
					closest known structural relative to the α-kinases may be the PI3K
					family (since AFK apparently evolved recently and is narrowly distributed, it is
					precluded as a possible source protein for the derivation of the
					α-kinases). PI3K and ChaK do share a distinctive straightened Strand 4
					(strand 6 in PI3K; strand 9 in ChaK, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010049-t002">Table 2</xref>), but otherwise they do not have any
					clear structural similarity that would argue for a link. RMSD values for
					superpositions between these two proteins are unremarkable relative to the rest
					of the superfamily (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010049-t004">Table
					4</xref>).</p><p>Our conventional tree provides a completely contradictory scenario, but there are
					reasons to consider it as another plausible possibility. Not only does ChaK
					appear to radiate from the TPKs, it appears to radiate specifically from the AGC
					group, with rapid mutational events placing it at a great eventual distance from
					this group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g006">Figure 6</xref>).
					Though bootstrap support for this origin for ChaK is weak, it is surprisingly
					strong compared with many other branches, especially given the extreme
					rearrangements in this structure. Remarkably, searches against the PDB with
					combinatorial extension (CE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b69">69</xref>] reveal that the strongest
					structural matches to ChaK are several PKA structures, members of the AGC group
					of TPKs (strongest match: PDB ID: 1CDK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b70">70</xref>], CE Z-score = 4.1, CE
					RMSD = 4.1Å). By contrast, PI3K does not display such close
					structural similarity to ChaK (CE Z-score = 3.5, CE RMSD =
					4.6Å). Further supporting an AGC group origin for ChaK is the presence
					of α-Helix B, a structure that is a distinctive feature of the AGC
					kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g001">Figures
						1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g301">3</xref> and
						<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010049-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>We speculate that the α-kinases were developed to provide a novel
					signaling capacity useful to more complex eukaryotic organisms. Given the rapid
					divergence of the α-kinase family from the rest of the kinase
					superfamily, and the high level of sequence similarity within the
					α-kinase family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b27">27</xref>], we suggest that the most likely scenario for the
					creation of the α-kinase family is a single catastrophic genetic
					event. This event could have perhaps taken the form of deletion of much of the
					C-terminal end of an extant kinase gene, or fusion of a kinase gene with another
					gene. While such an event would usually not lead to a functional kinase, this
					mutation would have produced a kinase that had the novel capability to
					phosphorylate α-helices.</p><p>If the α-kinases were derived from a TPK, it is possible that they
					contain a zinc finger because this was the way that a functional fold was
					“rescued” after severe modification of the c-terminal
					subdomain. It is intriguing that the zinc coordination site in the
					α-kinases is partly formed by a histidine residue, H1751(F154) in
					helix D (Helix E) of ChaK. Though H1751 does not structurally align with the
					conserved H158 seen in the AGC kinases (it is one turn up the helix from H158;
						<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g301">Figure 3</xref>), it is
					possible that the presence of a highly conserved histidine in this region of the
					structure provided part of the initial zinc coordination site in the first
					α-kinase. Afterward, the location of the helix may have shifted in the
					α-kinase structure, or the histidine could have been replaced in a
					point mutation by H1751. Apparently, the first α-kinase underwent a
					period of rapid sequence change, perhaps to optimize its stability and function.
					Regardless of the source protein, this process would have led to its distinctive
					structure and great sequence distance from the TPKs and other AKs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g002">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g004">4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010049-g006">6</xref>)</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The kinase superfamily provides an interesting example of the types of changes

					first to perform an in-depth study of protein structure evolution
						[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b71">71</xref>].
					They described a gradual evolutionary drift of sequence and structure in the
					globins, but with careful maintenance of the heme binding pocket essential to
					function.</p><p>The changes seen in the kinases are more severe at both the structure and
					sequence level. It would appear that a major driving force for these large
					structural changes is the diversity of substrates that kinases from the
					superfamily must recognize and phosphorylate. Kinase superfamily members
					phosphorylate an amazing array of targets, from small molecules such as choline
					(CK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b23">23</xref>],
					to loop-type regions of proteins (the TPKs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b29">29</xref>], to α-helices
					(α-kinases) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b28">28</xref>], to membrane-bound phosphoinositides (the lipid kinases)

					changes between families, particularly in the C-terminal subunit, allow for such
					interactions to take place. In other cases, structural changes have allowed the
					kinases in the superfamily to partner with accessory domains important to
					activity and/or regulation (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b21">21</xref>]).</p><p>The kinases have been adapted for so many purposes that, in the end, all they
					have in common is the essential kinase function, and the fold required to carry
					it out. The large structural shifts seen outside of this region have obliterated
					sequence similarity outside of the universal core. Even within the core, notable
					structure and sequence changes have occurred, considering the direct role of
					this region in the essential function of these enzymes. However, where changes
					occur to the core that would affect function of the enzyme, there is generally
					clear compensation for the lost structures and residues, such that function is
					retained. This sort of plasticity has been previously noted in larger-scale
					studies of protein evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b72">72</xref>]. The net effect of these sorts of
					changes is a very low degree of sequence similarity at the superfamily level,
					even within the core. With such weak sequence similarity between superfamily
					members, it will not be surprising if other proteins join the superfamily once
					their structures are solved. A number of divergent kinases have already been
					identified for which structures are not yet available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b36">36</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we have sought to provide a framework for understanding the
					development of the kinase superfamily from a common ancestor. By incorporating
					structural information into our phylogenetic analysis, we have been able to
					provide a coherent scenario for the evolution of the kinases, with strong
					support for most of our predictions. Though some areas of kinase structural
					evolution are still in doubt, we believe the framework provided here will be
					valuable as structures for more members of the superfamily become available. We
					expect that many of these structures will be able to provide additional insights
					into the structural evolution of this rich and expanding superfamily.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Construction of the representative set of kinase structures.</title><p>We utilized the classification scheme provided by the SCOP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b73">73</xref>] and ASTRAL
						[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b74">74</xref>]
					resources (version 1.65) as a guideline for structure selection. To produce a
					representative set from the SCOP/ASTRAL domains, the sequences for all

					kinase–like”) were clustered via the single-linkage method
					using BLASTCLUST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b75">75</xref>], such that no structure in any cluster could be aligned to
					a structure in any other cluster with sequence identity ≥ 45%.
					A single structure was then chosen from each cluster as the structural
					representative for that group. The choice of a 45% identity cutoff
					was based on the observation that sequences can be aligned with high accuracy
					above ~40% identity based on sequence information alone
						[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b76">76</xref>]. Hence, alignments between

					of structural information, while structure-based alignment
					<italic>within</italic> a cluster would be unlikely to surpass the accuracy
					achievable with standard sequence alignment techniques. In addition, this
					filtration ensured that all structures included in the alignment would be
					evolutionarily divergent, and thus provide interesting information about
					structural and sequence conservation in the superfamily.</p><p>Representative structures were manually selected from each sequence cluster based
					on the following cascading tests: (1) Structures were favored if they were bound
					to ATP or an ATP analog, or if (for TPKs) they were in a
					“closed” conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b16">16</xref>]. Structures bound to ATP (or
					“closed”) were more informative because their ATP
					interactions could be studied, they tended to have fully resolved loop regions,
					and they were easier to align and compare. (2) Higher-resolution structures were
					favored. (3) Structures with wild-type sequences were favored over structures
					with experimental sequence mutations.</p><p>As discussed in the Introduction, the structure of PIPKIIβ was also
					added to the set of structures, even though it is not a member of the same SCOP
					fold group as the other kinases (d.143.1, as opposed to d.144.1). New kinases
					are constantly being added to the PDB; this representative set was kept
					unchanged for the duration of the study to maintain the tractability of the
					dataset.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Structural alignment of kinase representatives.</title><p>The representative kinase structures were first aligned using a variant of the CE
					method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b69">69</xref>] modified to provide progressive multiple alignments of
					protein structures. Using this alignment as a starting point, the alignment was
					then completely overhauled manually, starting at the N-termini of the proteins
					and following the structural trace through to the C-termini. No regions were
					ignored or skipped (i.e., even loops were carefully considered and aligned). The
					alignment was constructed with the primary aim of maximizing the aligned
					positions between structures, provided that there was a rational basis for the
					alignment. This meant, for example, that secondary structural elements could be
					aligned even if they diverged spatially upon rigid body superposition. We also
					sometimes used transitive alignments to align portions of structures. This meant
					that when two elements were distant spatially between a pair of structures, a
					third structure was considered that provided a “bridge”
					between the first and second structures. The element could be aligned to the
					bridge structure for both structures, providing a rational alignment between an
					otherwise difficult-to-align structural pair. At all times, the alignment was
					guided by direct visual inspection of the structures, using the CE alignment
					viewing software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b77">77</xref>] and other structure viewers as appropriate. In addition,
					sequence and structure alignments previously published by kinase experts were
					used as a guideline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b17">17</xref>].
					Finally, many of the initial publications reporting the structures in the
					representative set provided alignments to other kinases (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010049-t001">Table 1</xref> for citations).
					These alignments were also considered where appropriate. Structures were aligned
					with the goal of providing an optimal alignment between each structure and all
					other structures in the set, as opposed to one or two other structures (e.g.,
					the closest relative of the structure in question). This process was
					painstaking, but yielded an extremely high-quality alignment of the protein
					kinase–like superfamily that considered both structural and functional
					features. It should be noted that aligning structures with the goal of creating
					an optimal <italic>multiple</italic> alignment will, in many cases, produce
					slightly suboptimal alignments between any given pair of structures (this occurs
					because often there must be a “compromise” when pairwise
					alignments of shared structures are not consistent with each other). In
					practice, this is an issue only in ambiguous regions; the key highly conserved
					regions can be aligned optimally throughout the superfamily. However, our bias
					toward maximal alignment of positions and the issue of pairwise suboptimality
					resulted in relatively high RMSD values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010049-t004">Table 4</xref>). Alignments of equivalent segments
					with an automated method such as CE will often produce lower RMSD, but with
					fewer aligned positions. However, automated methods such as CE must limit their
					alignments of ambiguous regions to avoid alignment errors. When creating manual
					alignments, this limitation is removed. We believe the alignment to be of
					sufficient quality to serve as a “gold standard” for
					studying the kinases (and for benchmarking protein structure alignment methods
					as well). The alignment is available in several formats for download from

					provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0010049-sg001">Figures S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0010049-sg002">S2</xref>, and demonstrate that each of the two
					methods alone was unable to produce a resolved tree.</p><p>Trees produced in PHYLIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b87">87</xref>] used only the sequence alignment data (derived from the
					structure alignment), and did not consider the structural characters. The
					alignment was first subjected to bootstrapping via the SEQBOOT program (with
					default settings), producing 1,000 replicates. Sequence distances were then
					estimated for each replicate in the program PROTDIST. Since tests with MrBayes
					indicated that the BLOSUM-based model provided the best fit to the alignment
					data, distances between sequences were estimated using the PMB model of residue
					substitution, which is based on the BLOSUM matrices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b88">88</xref>]. Substitution
					rates were modeled as following a gamma distribution, with α
					= 2.15 (the correct value for α was estimated using a
					preliminary run of MrBayes with the BLOSUM priors). Trees were constructed for
					each bootstrap replicate using the Fitch-Margoliash method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010049-b46">46</xref>] in the program
					FITCH. Finally, a single consensus tree was built from the resulting trees in
					the program CONSENSE, using the default “majority rule
					(extended)” mode (this method places branches in the final tree when
					they are seen in &gt; 50% of the input trees; it then places
					branches with lower representation if they are consistent with the current
					branches, using cascading selection for highest bootstrap values). Branch
					lengths were estimated for the resulting tree using the original alignment to
					determine distances in PROTDIST. These branch lengths were then applied to the
					consensus tree using FITCH. A copy of the input alignment and instructions for
					replication of the results is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sdsc.edu/pb/kinases" xlink:type="simple">http://www.sdsc.edu/pb/kinases</ext-link>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0010049-sg001" mimetype="image/tiff" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010049.sg001" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Phylogenetic Tree Made with MrBayes, Using Only the Structure-Based
