      <abstract>
        <p>The unicellular eukaryote <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> has seven mating types. Cells can mate only when they recognize cells of a different mating type as non-self. As a ciliate, <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> separates its germline and soma into two nuclei. During growth the somatic nucleus is responsible for all gene transcription while the germline nucleus remains silent. During mating, a new somatic nucleus is differentiated from a germline nucleus and mating type is decided by a stochastic process. We report here that the somatic mating type locus contains a pair of genes arranged head-to-head. Each gene encodes a mating type-specific segment and a transmembrane domain that is shared by all mating types. Somatic gene knockouts showed both genes are required for efficient non-self recognition and successful mating, as assessed by pair formation and progeny production. The germline mating type locus consists of a tandem array of incomplete gene pairs representing each potential mating type. During mating, a complete new gene pair is assembled at the somatic mating type locus; the incomplete genes of one gene pair are completed by joining to gene segments at each end of germline array. All other germline gene pairs are deleted in the process. These programmed DNA rearrangements make this a fascinating system of mating type determination.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p><italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> is a single-celled organism with seven sexes. After two cells of different sexes mate, the progeny cells can be of any one of the seven sexes. In this article we show how this sex decision is made. Every cell has two genomes, each contained within a separate nucleus. The germline genome is analogous to that in our ovaries or testes, containing all the genetic information for the sexual progeny; the somatic or working genome controls the operation of the cell (including its sex). We show that the germline genome contains a tandem array of similarly organized but incomplete gene pairs, one for each sex. Sex is chosen after fertilization when a new somatic genome is generated by rearrangement of a copy of the germline genome. One complete sex gene pair is assembled when the cell joins DNA segments at opposite ends of the array to each end of one incomplete gene pair; this gene pair is thus completed and becomes fully functional, while the remaining sex gene pairs are excised and lost. The process involves programmed, site-specific genome rearrangements, and the physically independent rearrangements that occur at opposite ends of the selected gene pair happen with high reliability and precision.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Unicellular eukaryotes reproduce asexually, but most also have a sexual stage to their life cycle that increases genotypic variability. Sexual partners are usually morphologically indistinguishable and mating types, as part of a self/non-self recognition system, foster outbreeding. Mating types were first discovered by Sonneborn in the ciliate <italic>Paramecium aurelia</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-Sonneborn1">[1]</xref>. This discovery initiated the field of microbial genetics, as mating types were subsequently found in bacteria and a diversity of microbial eukaryotes. The number of mating types and the mechanisms of mating type determination vary widely among unicellular eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-Lee1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-Meyer1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>T. thermophila</italic> is a ciliate that segregates germline and somatic functions into two nuclei with distinct genome structures: the diploid micronucleus (germline) and the polyploid macronucleus (somatic). Starvation induces mating (conjugation) between two cells of different mating types. During conjugation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001518.s001">Figure S1</xref>) the parental somatic nucleus is destroyed while new somatic and germline nuclei are differentiated from a zygote nucleus. This differentiation includes extensive site-specific genome rearrangements, including fragmentation of the germline chromosomes, de novo telomere addition, and deletion of thousands of internal eliminated sequences (IESs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-Karrer1">[7]</xref>. Mating type is also determined at this stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-Nanney1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The <italic>T. thermophila</italic> germline <italic>mat</italic> locus was first described by Nanney et al. in 1953 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-Nanney2">[9]</xref> and remains the only locus known to control mating type specificity in this organism. These authors reported that the <italic>mat</italic> locus determines a spectrum of seven mating types (I–VII), one of which is stochastically and irreversibly expressed in each new somatic nucleus. Extensive field collections have revealed no additional mating types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-Doerder1">[10]</xref>. Two classes of germline <italic>mat</italic> alleles are known <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-Doerder1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-Arslanyolu1">[13]</xref>. The <italic>mat-1-</italic>like alleles encode mating types I, II, III, V, and VI, while <italic>mat-2</italic>-like alleles encode mating types II, III, IV, V, VI, and VII <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-Nanney2">[9]</xref>. All the strains used in this work are homozygous for the <italic>mat-2</italic> allele of inbred strain B. Alternative DNA deletions, rather than epigenetic gene silencing, were proposed to be responsible for mating type determination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-Orias1">[14]</xref>. The work reported here, made possible by the molecular identification of the mating type genes, has revealed a type of programmed DNA rearrangement in the somatic nucleus that assembles a gene pair of one mating type and deletes the rest.</p>

        <title>Identification of the <italic>mat</italic> Genes</title>
        <p>The genetically mapped <italic>mat</italic> locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-Eisen1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-Lynch1">[17]</xref> was assigned to a roughly 300-kb segment of a somatic chromosome sequence assembly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001518.s002">Figure S2</xref>). As cells must be starved to mate, we assumed that a candidate mating type gene would be expressed in a mating type-specific manner during starvation and not expressed during growth. In a previous whole-transcriptome RNA-seq study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-Xiong1">[18]</xref>, mRNA was prepared and sequenced from starved SB4217 (mating type V or mt V) cells as well as from starved and growing SB4220 (mt VI) cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001518.s005">Table S1</xref>). To identify mating type candidate genes, we mapped the RNA-seq reads to the 300-kb segment of the mt VI somatic reference genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-Eisen1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-Coyne1">[19]</xref>. Two adjacent genes in this region showed mating type-specific expression in starved cells and no expression during growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001518-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) making them good mating type gene candidates. We named these genes <italic>MTA</italic> and <italic>MTB</italic>. A transcript for each gene was assembled primarily from reads that mapped to the mt VI reference genome. Reads from mt VI covered both genes except for one small gap in <italic>MTA</italic>, which was filled in by cDNA sequencing (unpublished data). Northern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001518-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001518.s003">S3</xref>) confirmed a single transcript for each mt VI gene. Only the terminal exons of <italic>MTA</italic> and <italic>MTB</italic> could be assembled from the mt V reads that mapped to the mt VI reference genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001518-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). In addition, a partial transcript was assembled de novo from the mt V RNA-seq reads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001518.s012">Text S1</xref>). Two thirds of this partial transcript has 99.9% identity with the terminal exon of mt VI <italic>MTA</italic> gene but the remainder is absent from the mt VI somatic reference genome and could encode a mating type-specific segment.</p>

        <p>If the <italic>MTA</italic> and <italic>MTB</italic> genes determine mating type, they may also be essential for mating. This was addressed by removing the entire somatic gene pair of mt VI (SB210) by homologous gene replacement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001518.s004">Figure S4A and S4B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-Mochizuki1">[23]</xref>. The gene pair knockout (MT–) abolished the cell's ability to pair or produce progeny when mixed with starved wild-type (wt) cells of a different mating type or with cells of the same mating type. Identical results were obtained with three independent knockout strains. In contrast, control assays of mating between two wt strains of different mating types showed high levels of pair formation and produced abundant (&gt;85%) progeny.</p>
        <p>Each gene of the mt VI gene pair was deleted independently to investigate the functional relationship between the two genes. For both single knockouts, RT-PCR showed that removal of one gene did not abolish expression of the remaining gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001518.s004">Figure S4C</xref>). Three independent <italic>MTB</italic> knockouts (<italic>MTB</italic>–) gave the same results as the gene pair knockout. No progeny were produced when <italic>MTB</italic>– cells were mixed with wt cells of a different mating type. The <italic>MTA</italic> knockout (<italic>MTA</italic>–) retained mating specificity but very little mating competence. It paired extremely poorly and rarely produced progeny (0.16% on average) when mated with wt cells of a different mating type. No pairs or progeny were detected when it was mated to cells of the same (mt VI) mating type. Identical results were obtained with three independent knockout clones.</p>

        <title>The Germline Genome Contains a Tandem Array of Incomplete Mating Type Gene Pairs</title>
        <p>To determine whether other mating types express genes containing the TM exons shared by mts V and VI, we isolated RNA from starved, mature strains of each mating type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001518.s005">Table S1</xref>). Northern blot analysis revealed that cells of every mating type have <italic>MTA–</italic> and <italic>MTB</italic>-like transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001518-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001518.s003">S3</xref>). The length of the transcripts is similar to the lengths of the RNA-seq assembled transcripts, 4.8 kb for <italic>MTA6</italic> (mt VI <italic>MTA</italic>) and 5.7 kb for <italic>MTB6</italic> (mt VI <italic>MTB</italic>). These results, in combination with the RNA-seq results, support the hypothesis that all mating types have <italic>MTA</italic> and <italic>MTB</italic> genes consisting of two segments: one encoding a highly conserved TM segment found in all mating types and the other encoding a larger mating type-specific segment.</p>
        <p>To identify the genes of the germline <italic>mat</italic> locus, we used the mt VI <italic>MTA6</italic> and <italic>MTB6</italic> gene pair sequence as query in a BLAST search of the SB210 germline genome sequence (<italic>Tetrahymena</italic> Comparative Sequencing Project, Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.broadinstitute.org/</ext-link>). Multiple matching discontiguous segments were observed over a 91-kb region of the germline. The mating type-specific segments of <italic>MTA6</italic> and <italic>MTB6</italic> matched once in the middle of this region. Additional matches were due to the conserved TM exons of <italic>MTA6</italic> and <italic>MTB6</italic>, each of which matched six times within this region. This led us to identify five additional gene pairs containing sequences homologous to those of the TM exons of <italic>MTA6</italic> on the left and <italic>MTB6</italic> on the right. The genes are arranged in a tandem array of six similarly oriented gene pairs, the number of mating types encoded by the <italic>mat-2</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001518-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Sequence immediately flanking the <italic>mat</italic> locus is identical in the germline and somatic genomes. Before carrying out detailed analysis of the <italic>mat</italic> locus, we filled all sequence gaps in this region and corrected sequence errors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001518.s006">Tables S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001518.s007">S3</xref>). In the finished sequence we found that each gene pair consists of an <italic>MTA</italic>- and an <italic>MTB</italic>-like gene. These are composed of a unique mating type-specific segment, and a terminal TM exon segment that is highly conserved among the <italic>MTA</italic> (or <italic>MTB</italic>) genes. The germline <italic>mat</italic> locus lacks a complete gene pair. The <italic>mat</italic> locus array begins and ends with the only complete genes within the array, later shown to be <italic>MTA2</italic> and <italic>MTB3</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001518-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The TM exons of all the other mating type genes are truncated, indicated by the use of lower case “tm” (for example, <italic>MTA</italic>-tm or tm). Assembly of a somatic mating type gene pair requires joining of mating type-specific segments to the full-length copies of the <italic>MTA2–</italic> and <italic>MTB3-</italic>TM exons located at the ends of the array.</p>

Only the terminal genes (<italic>MTA2</italic> and <italic>MTB3</italic>) have full length versions of their TM exons. The mating type-specific, somatic-destined segment for each mating type gene pair, which includes the 5′ <italic>MTA</italic> and <italic>MTB</italic> segments and the intervening upstream spacer region (putative promoter), is shown as a single thick colored bar. Between the TM exon segments of adjacent gene pairs, there is a small amount of germline-limited sequence (GLS; black). Several IESs are located within the mating type-specific segments (also black). Excluding IES sequence, the mating type-specific segments are of comparable size: II, 8,673 bp; V, 9,132 bp; VI, 9,352 bp; IV, 8,450 bp; VII, 8,277 bp; and III, 8,384 bp.

        <p>Using the above information, the somatic <italic>mat</italic> locus of each mating type was sequenced from mature mating type strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001518.s005">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001518.s007">S3</xref>) derived from a mating between strains SB210 mt VI and SB1969 mt II. The entire germline <italic>mat</italic> locus from SB1969 mt II was sequenced and found to be identical to that of SB210 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001518.s007">Table S3</xref>). In the mature mating type strains every somatic gene pair has full-length <italic>MTA–</italic> and <italic>MTB</italic>-TM exons joined to a mating type-specific segment, an arrangement identical to that of the somatic mt VI gene pair. The TM exons of the other mating types revealed several single nucleotide polymorphisms when compared to the mt VI gene pair (see below), but otherwise are identical.</p>
        <p>The mating type genes represent two gene families. Predicted proteins within the MTA family are of similar size (1423–1494 aa). Clustal Omega alignment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-Sievers1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-Goujon1">[25]</xref> of the six predicted MTA proteins reveals their TM exons share 99.6% amino acid identity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001518.s013">Text S2A</xref>). Mating type-specific regions were compared by means of all-by-all pairwise alignments of every MTA mating type-specific amino acid sequence using BLASTP. On average, the alignments covered 98% (range 92%–100%) of the sequences, and showed 42% (range 38%–47%) sequence identity and 60% (range 58%–65%) sequence similarity (identical and conservative substitutions); expected values ranged from 1E-162 to less than 1E-200. Predicted proteins within the MTB family are also of similar size (1,733–1,749 aa). Clustal Omega alignment of the six MTB proteins shows their TM exons share 99.4% amino acid identity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001518.s013">Text S2B</xref>). Analogous pairwise alignments of every MTB mating type-specific amino acid sequence on average covered 99% (range 97%–100%) of the sequences, and showed 43% (range 41%–46%) sequence identity and 62% (range 60%–64%) sequence similarity; expected values were all less than 1E-200. The two protein families were compared by all-by-all BLASTP alignments of MTA versus MTB predicted amino acid sequences; in every case, the only significant match (expected value around 1E-08) was restricted to a ∼80 amino-acid cysteine-rich segment containing furin-like repeats, starting about 50 amino acids into the TM exon-encoded sequence. Clustal Omega alignment of the furin-like repeats within the 12 TM exons is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001518.s014">Text S3</xref>. Cysteines at 12 positions and other amino acids at 14 positions are absolutely conserved among the furin-like repeats of the 12 TM exons. The function of cysteine rich, furin-like repeat domains is not known, but they are found in some endoproteases and cell surface receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-MarchlerBauer1">[26]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The mating type-specific segments of the germline gene pairs differ in size by up to 8.5 kb. This variation is due to the presence of IESs, germline-specific sequences that interrupt a contiguous region of somatic-destined sequence, within the array. By comparing somatic sequences to the germline genome sequence, we identified six IESs, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001518-g003">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001518.s008">Table S4</xref>). Each was confirmed by cloning and sequencing PCR products from the germline and somatic nuclei (unpublished data). The IESs lie within introns in mating type-specific segments or in an intergenic region; they range in size from 299 to 5,989 bp. No other differences were found between the germline and somatic sequences in the mating type-specific segments. Additional germline-limited sequence separates adjacent mating type gene pairs in the germline array (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001518.s008">Table S4</xref>).</p>

        <p>During differentiation of a new somatic nucleus a pair of intact <italic>MTA</italic> and <italic>MTB</italic> genes must be assembled from the germline genes. One possibility is that joining occurs between the ends of the mating type-specific segment and the start of the <italic>MTA2</italic> and <italic>MTB3</italic> full-length TM exons. If this were the case, all the progeny would have full-length TM exons identical to those of the <italic>MTA2</italic> and <italic>MTB3</italic> germline genes. Alternatively, joining could occur at internal locations within the germline TM exons. In this case, the somatic TM exons would contain novel combinations of the unique polymorphic nucleotides found in the germline tm segments.

These data confirm that many if not all of the joining events occur within the TM exon rather than exclusively between the TM exon and the mating type-specific segment. The frequency of novel nucleotides (not present in the germline) is less than one in 50,000 sequenced base pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001518-g006">Figure 6</xref> legend), showing that the joining events are highly precise.</p>

PCR template switching is excluded as a spurious source of recombination in these results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001518.s020">Text S9</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our findings suggest that mating type determination in <italic>T. thermophila</italic> involves a remarkable type of programmed genome rearrangement. We have identified a pair of mating type genes that are arranged head-to-head. Each mating type is characterized by a similarly organized pair of somatic genes and each gene of the pair encodes a TM domain shared by all mating types. Starvation is required for mating and induces transcription of both genes. Both genes are required for wt levels of pair formation and progeny production. The germline genome contains an array of incomplete gene pairs, one for each mating type. During development of the somatic nucleus in progeny cells, the germline array undergoes rearrangement to assemble one complete gene pair and delete all others in the somatic chromosome. Thus, mating type determination occurs by deletion rather than by an epigenetic gene silencing mechanism. These findings account for the irreversibility of mating type determination. The mating type locus can be thought of as a multi-state developmental switch where the switch is stochastically and permanently set to one state in the somatic genome.</p>
      <p>The removal of either or both genes caused a significant inhibition of pairing between cells of different mating types, suggesting the <italic>MTA</italic> and <italic>MTB</italic> genes are both fundamental for recognition of cells of a different mating type (allorecognition). This inhibition of pairing suggests that the gene products may be functioning cooperatively for allorecognition. In addition to allorecognition, the gene products could be distinguishing self to prevent homotypic pairing. If this were the case, homotypic pairing would be observed in the absence of one or both genes. This does not appear to be a function of the <italic>MTA</italic> and <italic>MTB</italic> genes because pairing between starved cells of the same mating type was not observed in our knockouts.</p>
      <p>At least two events are required to assemble a complete somatic mating type gene pair from the <italic>mat</italic> germline array (see model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001518-g007">Figure 7</xref>). At the left end of the gene pair, the <italic>MTA</italic>-tm segment must be joined to the single copy, full-length <italic>MTA</italic>2-TM exon located at the far left end of the array. At the right end of the same gene pair, the <italic>MTB</italic>-tm segment must join to the single copy, full-length <italic>MTB</italic>3-TM exon located at the far right end of the array. The breakage and rejoining mechanism is highly precise. Since both joining events occur within translated exons segments, without this precision mating competence could be lost. Possible mechanisms include homologous recombination and precise nonhomologous end joining. The mechanism will become clearer once we experimentally determine which of the observed recombination events are essential to mating type determination and which are unrelated to this process. Regardless of the mechanism, an interesting question is how joining at opposite ends is coordinated to result in the assembly of a somatic gene pair. A stochastically selected germline gene pair may be epigenetically marked, its two ends cut, and full length TM exons joined coordinately. Alternatively, each end could be processed independently resulting in the deletion of one or more gene pairs from either end, until only one complete gene pair remains. Additional knowledge of the mechanism will be needed to understand how mating type frequencies are influenced by environmental conditions, such as temperature and nutritional state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-Orias2">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-Nanney6">[31]</xref>.</p>

          <title>Model proposing that homologous recombination assembles a single mating type gene pair during somatic differentiation.</title>
          <p>In this model, intramolecular recombination events are initiated at both ends of the germline array; subsequent resolution results in removal of intervening gene pairs by looping out and joining of a gene pair to the full length TM exons at the ends of the array. Any number of gene pairs could be excised in a single recombination event; since the chromosomal product regenerates the recombination substrate, recombination steps can be reiterated until a single, complete gene pair remains, at which point the process has to stop. Sequestering or disabling the ability of side products to recombine again would minimize unproductive reversal of the process. Recombination events need not always involve a full length TM exon; two internal tm exons could also be involved at intermediate steps. The recombination process is labeled “homologous recombination” for simplicity, but identical results could be obtained by highly precise non-homologous end-joining. Side products containing a discrete number of gene pairs, shown here as circular, could also be linear depending on the details of the recombination and repair mechanism. A related DNA rearrangement model of <italic>T. thermophila</italic> mating type determination, also involving recombination and alternative deletion in a tandem array of germline mating type genes was proposed previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-Orias1">[14]</xref>. The key conceptual difference is that in the original model a unique segment was somatically attached at one end of an individual mating type gene, instead of attaching unique segments at both ends of a mating type gene pair, as reported here.</p>

      <p>In addition to the single, simple recombination events associated with mating type determination, we have observed secondary recombination events in somatic TM exons, especially <italic>MTB</italic> TM exons. These events are particularly frequent in the <italic>MTB</italic> TM exons of mature cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001518.s011">Table S7</xref>). As explained in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001518.s020">Text S9</xref>, artifacts of PCR template-switching are excluded in these results. Since the majority of joined TM exons from 24-h exconjugants show no evidence of secondary recombination, these events are probably unrelated to mating type determination. Presumably they chiefly reflect recombination between multiple somatic chromosome copies carrying independently differentiated TM exons prior to the purification brought about by assortment during vegetative multiplication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001518.s001">Figure S1</xref>). A number of recombination events, most simply interpreted as gene conversions, have also been detected among <italic>MTB</italic> exon haplotypes. We believe that these <italic>MTB</italic> gene conversions are also due to the secondary recombination described above and are unrelated to <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> mating type determination, in part because gene conversions are found in only a small minority of the sequenced TM exons in 24-h exconjugants. In addition, gene conversion per se cannot result in the loss of intervening mating type gene pairs. Gene conversion is responsible for mating type switching in yeast, but no intervening DNA is lost in yeast mating type switching <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-Haber1">[32]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Programmed somatic DNA rearrangements are well known among the ciliates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-Prescott1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-Coyne2">[34]</xref>. In <italic>T. thermophila</italic>, approximately 6,000 IESs in the germline genome are excised during differentiation of a new somatic nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-Chalker1">[35]</xref>. The deletions that join TM exons to mating type-specific segments differ in several important ways. IES excision is imprecise; precision is not required, as nearly all IES are found in intergenic regions or within introns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-Fass1">[36]</xref>. In contrast, the deletions involved in mating type determination are highly precise and occur within the coding segment of the TM exon. Furthermore, IES excision is maternally controlled; only sequences absent from the parental somatic genome are targeted for elimination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-Chalker2">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-Coyne3">[38]</xref>. Mating type, on the other hand, is stochastically inherited; determination of mating type in each progeny cell occurs autonomously during the differentiation of the new somatic nucleus. Mating type-specific sequences absent from the parental somatic nucleus escape deletion by the IES excision mechanism and are retained in progeny somatic nuclei. Finally, preliminary experiments (unpublished data) indicate that mating type determination occurs several hours after excision of IES within the <italic>mat</italic> locus. All these considerations lead us to conclude that these two processes, which occur in the differentiating somatic nucleus, proceed by different mechanisms. In mating type determination, DNA breakage and rejoining occurs physically independently and precisely at both ends of one gene pair. This leads to the assembly of one complete gene pair and the excision of the other germline gene pairs from the somatic chromosome. To our knowledge, this type of programmed genome rearrangement is novel, at least in ciliate molecular biology.</p>
      <p>The modular organization of the <italic>T. thermophila</italic> germline <italic>mat</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001518-g003">Figure 3</xref>) in combination with rare unequal meiotic crossing-over between homologous <italic>germline</italic> TM/tm domains could facilitate rapid evolutionary change in the number of available mating types. This hypothesis is consistent with the existence of two <italic>T. thermophila</italic> germline <italic>mat</italic> allele classes specifying different numbers of mating types (five for <italic>mat-1</italic> and six for <italic>mat-2</italic>). <italic>mat-1</italic>-like alleles carry mt I but are missing mts IV and VII. <italic>mat-2</italic>-like alleles are the opposite, carrying mts IV and VII in adjoining gene pairs while missing mt I. Using somatic genome sequence data we assigned a mating type to the sequenced strains of two other <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> species by virtue of their similarities to <italic>T. thermophila</italic> mating types. This suggests that a similar mating type system is conserved in multiple <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> species. If so, the mechanism proposed above could also explain the finding that the number of mating types described in species of the genus <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> is dynamic, ranging from 3 to 9 (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-Phadke1">[39]</xref>). Using the strong sequence conservation observed at the TM exons, it may be possible to isolate and sequence mating type genes from many species of the genus <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> to investigate the evolution of their mating type system.</p>
      <p><italic>T. thermophila</italic> is a model organism for eukaryotic biology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-Eisen1">[15]</xref>. Future research of this mating type system should advance our knowledge in several areas of biology. The biochemical functions of the <italic>MTA</italic> and <italic>MTB</italic> gene products are of interest for understanding the principle of self/non-self discrimination. The study of genomic rearrangements employed for mating type determination can inform mechanisms of genome dynamics in other systems.</p>

In addition to evidence generated as above, we included predictions made by GeneZilla trained on the <italic>T. borealis</italic> genome and we used AAT to compare the six <italic>T. thermophila mat</italic> genes to each other.</p>

        <title>Identification of Mating Type Gene Pair Homologs in Other <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> Species</title>
        <p>The SB210-derived sequence of the entire mt VI gene pair was aligned by BLASTN and TBLASTN to the Broad Institute assemblies of the somatic genomes of <italic>T. malaccensis</italic>, <italic>T. elliotti</italic>, and <italic>T. borealis</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/Tetrahymena/MultiHome.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/Tetrahymena/MultiHome.html</ext-link>). The same sequence was aligned to the <italic>T. pyriformis</italic> strain GL somatic genome sequence (W. Miao, unpublished data). These matches allowed us to delineate mating type gene pair homologs in the sequenced strains of all four species. Since the strongest matches were to the TM exons at the 3′ end of each mating type gene, the first in-frame stop codon after the end of the matching segment was tentatively defined as the 3′ end of the gene. The entire four gene pair sequences were then extracted and subjected to phylogenetic analysis in conjunction with the somatic gene pair sequences of <italic>T. thermophila</italic> strains of every mating type (SB1969, mt II; SB4218, mt V; SB210, mt VI; SB4214, mt IV; SB4223, mt VII; and SB4218, mt III). The entire gene pair sequences were aligned with ClustalW. Phylogenetic analysis was done with Maximum Likelihood, implemented in RAxML 7.2.8, Model = GTR+Gamma, 100 bootstrap replicates.</p>

        <title>Sequencing of TM Exons from Newly Differentiated Somatic Nuclei</title>
        <p>The TM exons of somatic mating type genes were PCR amplified from progeny cells before the newly differentiated somatic nucleus has undergone its first division (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001518.s001">Figure S1</xref>, stage 3). Two independent matings were necessary to avoid amplifying parental somatic TM exons from cells in the culture that failed to mate. Exons of mt IV, mt V, and VII were obtained from the DNA of progeny from a SB210 VI mating SB1969 II. Exons of mt II, mt III, and mt VI were obtained from DNA of progeny from a SB4216 IV mating SB4224 VII.</p>
        <p>PCR primers were designed to amplify mating type-specific segments whose truncated tm had been joined to a full-length TM exon generating the complete somatic gene. Unlike the other mating type genes, the <italic>MTA2</italic> and <italic>MTB3</italic> genes have a full-length TM exon in the germline as well as in the somatic nucleus. The somatic and germline products for these two genes can be distinguished from each other by IESs, which are only present in the germline (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001518.s008">Table S4</xref>). In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001518.s006">Table S2</xref> primers for <italic>MTA</italic>-TM amplification begin with an A while those for <italic>MTB</italic>-TM amplification start with a B.</p>
        <p>For PCR amplification of the <italic>MTA</italic>-TMs from the somatic nucleus, the primers and size of resulting PCR products are as follows: <italic>MTA2</italic>-TM: Two rounds of PCR, first round to amplify a product specific to the somatic nucleus - Primers A2, A1, Germline 10.9 kb Somatic 5.7 kb. The 5.7-kb product was gel purified with the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen), and used for a second round of PCR to amplify a smaller TM exon product using primers A3, A4, Germline, and Somatic 1 kb; <italic>MTA3</italic>-TM: Primers A5, A6 Germline 81.4 kb Somatic 2.6 kb; <italic>MTA4</italic>-TM: Primers A7, A8 Germline 52.5 kb Somatic 1.99 kb; <italic>MTA5</italic>-TM: Primers A9, A10 Germline 21.5 kb Somatic 1.38 kb; <italic>MTA6</italic>-TM: Primers A9, A11 Germline 36.5 kb Somatic 1.38 kb; <italic>MTA7</italic>-TM: Primers A9, A12 Germline 63.4 kb Somatic 1.22 kb.</p>
        <p>For PCR amplification of the <italic>MTB</italic>-TMs from the somatic nucleus, the primers and size of resulting PCR products are as follows: <italic>MTB2</italic>-TM: Primers B1, B2 Germline 74.7 kb Somatic 1.73 kb; <italic>MTB3</italic>-TM: Two rounds of PCR, first round to amplify a product specific to the somatic nucleus – Primers B3, B4 Germline 16.9 kb Somatic 11 kb. The 11-kb product was gel purified with the Qiagen QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit, and used for a second round of PCR to amplify a smaller TM exon product using primers B5, B4 Germline, and Somatic 3.0 kb; <italic>MTB4</italic>-TM: Primers B6, B2 Germline 30 kb Somatic 1.8 kb; <italic>MTB5</italic>-TM: Primers B7, B2 Germline 58.1 kb Somatic 1.7 kb; <italic>MTB6</italic>-TM: Primers B8, B2 Germline 42.9 kb Somatic 1.8 kb; <italic>MTB7</italic>-TM: Primers B9, B2 Germline 16.8 kb Somatic 1.7 kb.</p>

          <p><bold>Events of the </bold><bold><italic>T. thermophila</italic></bold><bold> life cycle related to mating type determination.</bold> (1) Starved cells of different mating types (II and VI are shown as an example) have paired to initiate conjugation. (2) Cross-fertilization. A diploid fertilization nucleus has been formed by fusion of a haploid gametic nucleus from each parent cell. The fertilization nucleus will undergo two rounds of mitosis, generating four genetically identical diploid nuclei which differentiate into two polyploid somatic nuclei and two diploid germline nuclei. Before separation of conjugants, the parental somatic nucleus and one germline nucleus will be degraded. (3) Separation of conjugants. Each differentiating somatic nucleus has eight to 16 copies of every somatic chromosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-Yin1">[55]</xref>. Roman numerals represent chromosomes encoding the indicated mating type, only two copies are shown. Mating type is determined randomly, as shown. After nutrients are restored, the somatic nuclei will undergo additional chromosome endoreduplication and cell division will distribute the newly differentiated somatic nuclei, one to each daughter cell. (4) Vegetative phase. The thin arrow indicates the newly differentiated somatic nucleus being followed; it contains ∼45 somatic chromosome copies (four shown) encoding mt-IV or mt-V. The somatic nucleus divides amitotically (random distribution of chromosome copies). (5) The cell has undergone over 100 fissions. Successive amitotic divisions of the somatic nucleus have resulted in phenotypic assortants (all somatic chromosome copies carry the same allele) that are either mt-V (shown) or mt-IV (not shown); these cells are mature and express a single mating type.

Two additional polymorphisms are tightly linked to the <italic>mat</italic> locus (“4711 indel” and “4711 MaeI SNP,” this work). Both map to the left of PM08 and were identified using sequence data from inbred strain C3 SB3543 (Trace archive at NCBI, database <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> C3 sb3543-WGS). When the somatic genome was sequenced, the PM08 polymorphism was mapped, by sequence alignment, to 111-kb scaffold 8254606 (top diagram, Somatic) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001518-Eisen1">[15]</xref>. This scaffold represents only a fraction of the entire somatic chromosome.
