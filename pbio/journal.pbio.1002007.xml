<p>Because of fast recovery from synaptic depression and fast-initiated action potentials, neuronal information transfer can have a substantially higher bandwidth in human neocortical circuits than in those of rodents.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Neuronal firing, synaptic transmission, and its plasticity form the building blocks for processing and storage of information in the brain. It is unknown whether adult human synapses are more efficient in transferring information between neurons than rodent synapses. To test this, we recorded from connected pairs of pyramidal neurons in acute brain slices of adult human and mouse temporal cortex and probed the dynamical properties of use-dependent plasticity. We found that human synaptic connections were purely depressing and that they recovered three to four times more swiftly from depression than synapses in rodent neocortex. Thereby, during realistic spike trains, the temporal resolution of synaptic information exchange in human synapses substantially surpasses that in mice. Using information theory, we calculate that information transfer between human pyramidal neurons exceeds that of mouse pyramidal neurons by four to nine times, well into the beta and gamma frequency range. In addition, we found that human principal cells tracked fine temporal features, conveyed in received synaptic inputs, at a wider bandwidth than for rodents. Action potential firing probability was reliably phase-locked to input transients up to 1,000 cycles/s because of a steep onset of action potentials in human pyramidal neurons during spike trains, unlike in rodent neurons. Our data show that, in contrast to the widely held views of limited information transfer in rodent depressing synapses, fast recovering synapses of human neurons can actually transfer substantial amounts of information during spike trains. In addition, human pyramidal neurons are equipped to encode high synaptic information content. Thus, adult human cortical microcircuits relay information at a wider bandwidth than rodent microcircuits.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Our ability to think, memorize information, and act appropriately depends on circuits of connected neurons in the brain. In these circuits, neurons pass information to each other using electric pulses (action potentials) that cause the release of chemical neurotransmitters, which alter the membrane electric potential of receiving neurons. Based on the inputs neurons receive, they decide whether to transmit action potentials to other neurons in the circuit to pass on information. During sequences of repeated information transfer, synaptic connections between two neurons temporarily become weaker by synaptic depression. Our knowledge of neuronal information transfer is based on rodent neurons. The properties of synaptic information transfer and synaptic depression in humans are not known. Here, we show that adult human neurons can transfer information with up to ten times higher rates than mouse neurons, because of a three to four times faster recovery from depression. Furthermore, we found that human neurons can respond faster to synaptic inputs, owing to faster initiation of action potentials. Human neurons can thereby reliably encode high input frequencies in their output. Thus, neuronal information transfer can have a substantially higher bandwidth in human neocortical circuits than in rodent brains.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Human cognitive abilities clearly stand out from those of other mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Shettleworth1">[1]</xref>. Evolutionary development of brain size, encephalization, neocortical thickening, and specialization of cortical circuits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Rakic1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-DeFelipe1">[3]</xref> most likely underlie the superior human mental capacity, but other factors may contribute as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Varki1">[4]</xref>. Cognitive functions rely on appropriate relay and filtering of information and on efficient communication between brain areas. Ultimately, neuronal firing and synaptic transmission between neurons form the building blocks for coding, processing, and storage of information in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Salinas1">[5]</xref>. Synapses in particular are fundamental computational units <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Shepherd1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Abbott1">[8]</xref>, and the increased complexity of synaptic protein networks was recently put forward as a potential correlate of mammalian cognitive ability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Ryan1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Nithianantharajah1">[11]</xref>. Given the vast number of synapses in the brain, in the order of a trillion per cubic centimeter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Drachman1">[12]</xref>, even a slight increase in efficacy of synaptic information processing could potentially translate into a substantial elevation of the brain's overall computational performance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Rieke1">[13]</xref>. Whether human synapses are more efficient in transferring information between neurons is not known and has not been tested directly.</p>
<p>Here, we addressed this question and studied the properties of signal transfer at unitary synaptic connections between pyramidal neurons of adult human and mouse neocortex. We then applied an information theory approach to calculate synaptic transfer performance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Fuhrmann1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Fuhrmann2">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Borst1">[15]</xref>. We focused on the short-term dynamics of transmission, as synapses are not passive conveyers of information. Instead, they display prominent use-dependent plasticity, which has important roles in information processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Abbott1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Klug1">[16]</xref>. Following chemical signal transduction at a single synapse, postsynaptic signals appear as selectively filtered versions of the train of action potentials (APs) that the presynaptic neuron generates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Tsodyks1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Abbott2">[18]</xref>. Amplitudes of successive postsynaptic potentials are in fact transiently and reversibly attenuated or amplified by the context of previous pre- and postsynaptic activation. Whether or not a postsynaptic neuron fires in response to an individual presynaptic AP thus depends on the instantaneous AP frequency, on the short-term dynamical properties of each synapse, and on the previous history <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Abbott1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Tsodyks1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Zucker1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Markram1">[20]</xref>. We found that human cortical synapses recover faster from depression than rodent cortical synapses, resulting in a substantially higher information transfer rate than in rodent synapses. In addition, we directly observed that human pyramidal neurons are equipped to encode such a high information content synaptic transmission in their output, unlike rodent pyramidal neurons, by their dynamical excitability properties.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>In the rodent brain, unitary connections between neocortical pyramidal neurons show frequency-dependent short-term synaptic depression, in response to a sequence of APs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Tsodyks1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-TestaSilva1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Markram2">[22]</xref>. To test whether excitatory connections between adult human neocortical pyramidal neurons show short-term plasticity, and whether this quantitatively resembles that in mouse neocortex, we made whole-cell recordings from synaptically connected layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of non-pathological samples of cortex from adult human patients (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002007-g001">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002007.s007">Tables S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002007.s008">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002007.s009">S3</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-TestaSilva2">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Verhoog1">[24]</xref> and mouse neocortex (medial prefrontal cortex of young mice of 12–36 days old, and temporal association cortex of adult mice of 8–11 weeks old). Human monosynaptic connections showed no facilitation but only frequency-dependent depression, whose occurrence resembled that of mouse synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002007-g001">Figure 1A–1D</xref>). The amount of depression during a 30 Hz presynaptic AP train did not differ between human and mouse synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002007-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) (ratio last/first excitatory postsynaptic potential [EPSP]; mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM]: 0.38±0.03 human, 0.44±0.05 for young mouse synapses, and 0.30±0.04 for adult mouse synapses) (<italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05). However, at 0.5 seconds following the end of the AP train, the amplitude of human EPSPs had recovered to the level of the first EPSP in the train (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002007-g001">Figure 1B and 1E</xref>; ratio recovery/first EPSP 1.01±0.07 [500 ms between recovery and first, <italic>n</italic> = 6, green filled diamonds]); whereas mouse EPSPs were still significantly depressed (young 0.67±0.03; adult 0.72±0.06, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). Moving the ninth AP closer in time to the AP train in the recordings from human unitary connections showed that already after 0.3 seconds the amplitude of the human EPSP had nearly recovered to the level of the first EPSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002007-g001">Figure 1E</xref>; ratio recovery/first EPSP 0.92±0.04; circles).</p>

<p>To gain a full quantitative comparison of mouse and human short-term synaptic depression and recovery, we used the mathematical minimal description of activity-dependent short-term synaptic plasticity first proposed by Tsodyks and Markram <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Tsodyks1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Loebel1">[25]</xref>, and extracted best-fit model parameters for each recording (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). Two out of five fitted parameters were similar between mouse and human synapses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002007.s001">Figure S1A and S1C</xref>). Those parameters that differed between human and mouse unitary synapses included a higher “U,” which reflects the probability of synaptic release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002007-g002">Figure 2A</xref>; 0.45±0.03 in human versus 0.25±0.02 and 0.29±0.03 in young and adult mice, respectively; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001 and <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05), and the cell membrane time constant, as calculated directly from the experimental traces and by the Tsodyks-Markram model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002007.s001">Figure S1C and S1D</xref>). It is relevant to mention that the membrane time constant directly measured from experimental traces and the one calculated by the model differ slightly in definition. The model-driven observable, as extracted by the Tsodyks-Markram model, is obtained by fitting a set of two passive differential equations to the decay of the last EPSP, and for the sole instrumental aim of compensating the passive temporal summation of the successive EPSPs. Its link to the membrane biophysical properties is only indirect, its estimate confidence lower, and it has been included for the purpose of completeness. By far, the largest difference between adult mouse and human synapses was a shorter first-order kinetic time constant, which reflects the recovery from short-term synaptic depression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002007-g002">Figure 2B</xref>; 144±13 ms in human versus 536±40 ms and 483±91 ms in young and adult mice, respectively; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). These data indicate that human synapses recover at least three times faster from use-dependent synaptic depression. Similarly fast time constants of recovery have only been reported for facilitating synapses in the ferret prefrontal cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Wang1">[26]</xref>. Instead, purely depressing synapses in ferret neocortex also have long time constants of recovery of 500 ms up to 900 ms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Wang1">[26]</xref>, similar to those in mouse and rat neocortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Tsodyks1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Markram2">[22]</xref>. Furthermore, the time constant of recovery from synaptic depression in adult human synapses (average age 45±11 years) did not change with age during adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002007-g002">Figure 2C</xref>; Pearson's correlation coefficient rho = −0.36, <italic>p</italic> = 0.1).</p>

<p>A 3-fold faster recovery from frequency-dependent depression of synaptic connections is likely to affect information transfer between two connected neurons, when repeatedly activated during spike trains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Abbott1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Klug1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Klyachko1">[27]</xref>.

We therefore tested whether fast recovery from depression would improve information transfer between two neurons during irregular AP trains with variable firing frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002007-g003">Figure 3</xref>). In synaptically connected pairs of pyramidal neurons in mouse neocortex, repeated firing of the presynaptic neuron resulted in a marked reduction of the amplitude resolution by which individual EPSPs could be discerned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002007-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Consequently, some presynaptic APs resulted in very weak postsynaptic voltage changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002007-g003">Figure 3A and 3C</xref>). In contrast, in connected pairs of human cortical pyramidal neurons, all presynaptic APs led to corresponding EPSPs during repeated firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002007-g003">Figure 3B and 3C</xref>), and each EPSP peak amplitude remained well defined during the AP train. Plotting the relative EPSP amplitude at the same AP in the train for mouse and human synapses shows that the peak amplitude of human EPSPs remains better resolved throughout the AP train than mouse EPSPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002007-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Using the mathematical model and the best-fit parameters, obtained from the short EPSP trains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002007-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>), we simulated the response to the irregular synaptic transmission with the exact same AP sequence as applied in the actual recordings: the reduction of synaptic resolution observed in the mouse experiments was replicated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002007-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>). With a faster time constant of recovery (144 ms instead of 500 ms), the simulated postsynaptic response resembled the human unitary synaptic responses, whose peak amplitude resolution was maintained throughout the AP train (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002007-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

(G,H) Combining the quantal release model of synaptic transmission with the Tsodyks-Markram description, the transfer properties of short-term depressing synapses can be quantified by information theory. Over a broad range of firing frequencies, the mutual information, calculated between peak EPSP amplitudes and presynaptic interspike intervals, reveals a peak at an optimal firing frequency (G); Dividing the mutual information by the firing frequency, the information rate was plotted (H).

<p>Synapses with faster recovery from depression respond more reliably to presynaptic APs during trains of activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002007-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>), and they may also have a larger dynamic range when signaling abrupt variations in presynaptic firing rate. To investigate this, we tested in model simulations whether fast recovering synapses show larger responses to sudden changes in the frequency of presynaptic AP trains. We simulated 1,500 identical, independent excitatory synaptic afferents impinging on the same postsynaptic neuron, which was modeled as a passive membrane compartment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Abbott2">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Tsodyks2">[30]</xref>. These virtual synapses were activated asynchronously by independent homogenous point processes to engage short-term synaptic plasticity. Subsequently the average activation frequency was step-changed as in a burst, to test how well synapses would detect and respond to phasic presynaptic activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Tsodyks2">[30]</xref>. Synapses with fast recovery from depression indeed conferred a higher dynamic range of synaptic transmission, as well as an increased sensitivity to small changes in presynaptic network activity time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002007-g003">Figure 3D–3F</xref>). As we swept through different intra- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002007-g003">Figure 3E</xref>) and inter-burst frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002007-g003">Figure 3F</xref>), the faster recovery from depression always provided the postsynaptic neurons with a larger sensitivity to their synaptic inputs. These results indicate that synapses that recover faster from depression, as we observed in human neocortical synapses, are equipped to relay fine variations in the instantaneous firing frequency, more reliably than synapses that slowly recover.</p>
<p>As synapses that recover quickly from depression operate with an increased bandwidth during repeated activation, they may be able to relay more information than synapses that slowly recover from depression. To test this, we numerically calculated the mutual information between the amplitude of the postsynaptic membrane potentials and the length of the inter-spike intervals of a train of corresponding presynaptic APs. Using the mathematical model and the best-fit parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002007-g002">Figure 2</xref>), the Shannon's formalism of information theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Shannon1">[31]</xref> applied to depressing synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Fuhrmann1">[7]</xref> provided a quantitative measure for the information transfer through a synapse (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). We found that synapses that recover quickly from depression convey approximately four times more information at peak levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002007-g003">Figure 3G</xref>). The average presynaptic firing frequency, corresponding to the optimal information transfer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Fuhrmann1">[7]</xref>, was higher in quickly recovering synapses (9.1 Hz) compared with slowly recovering synapses (4.5 Hz). Quickly recovering synapses were consequently able to sustain larger information transfer rates at higher firing frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002007-g003">Figure 3H</xref>), and information transfer rate saturated less prominently at higher frequencies than for slowly recovering synapses. These findings suggest that human neocortical depressing synapses that show fast recovery from depression may relay more information than depressing neocortical synapses found in the mouse brain.</p>
<p>Adult human neocortical neurons receive thousands of excitatory synapses, with estimates for adult layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons as high as 30,000, about twice as many as rodent layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-BenavidesPiccione1">[32]</xref>. When each of these synapses operates with high resolution at high bandwidth and maintains reliability during bursts of activity, as our findings suggest, the question arises whether human pyramidal neurons can actually encode fast-varying temporal inputs in the AP train. To test whether human pyramidal neurons can precisely time their AP firing to rapidly changing inputs, we measured the temporal modulation of the neuronal output firing probability of human pyramidal neurons, during somatic injection of sinusoidal currents in whole-cell recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002007-g004">Figure 4</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Kndgen1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Ilin1">[35]</xref>. Neurons simultaneously received an additional, randomly fluctuating, current component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002007-g004">Figure 4A</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Material and Methods</xref>) that induced an irregular firing regime with low average rate (13.3±1.6 Hz, CV<sub>ISI</sub> = 1.06±0.02, <italic>n</italic> = 13 human and 11.9±0.6 Hz, CV<sub>ISI</sub> = 0.8±0.02, <italic>n</italic> = 14 adult mouse neurons). While the fluctuating component <italic>per se</italic> resulted in a uniform probability of AP firing in time, the superimposed weak amplitude small sinusoidal currents modulated in time the instantaneous firing probability, with the same period of the input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002007-g004">Figure 4B–4D</xref>). Under these conditions, the timing of AP firing in human neurons was more strongly modulated both by large and small input periods, going up to 1,000 cycles/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002007-g004">Figure 4E</xref>), indicating that human neurons could encode finer and rapidly changing temporal features of their input into AP timing.</p>

<p>The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002007-g004">Figure 4E</xref> represent typical band-pass behavior for both human (<italic>n</italic> = 13) and murine cells (<italic>n</italic> = 14), where the continuous black and grey lines represent an equivalent passive analogue electronic filter. The pass band of human neurons was shifted to higher Fourier frequencies (low frequency “pole” and “zero” cut-off located at 52 and 82 Hz, respectively, compared to 9 and 20 Hz for mouse cells) showing a higher level of selectivity (high frequency “pole” cut-off located at 524 and 565 Hz in humans and rodents, respectively). Additionally, the multiplicity but not the location of the high Fourier frequency pole differed between human and mouse cells: a value of 2 for the latter group implies that the negative slope of the Fourier transfer function, above a cut-off frequency of ∼500 Hz, is larger in mouse than in human neurons. This transfer function for adult temporal cortex mouse neurons is consistent with what was previously found for layer 5 pyramidal cells of the primary somatosensory cortex of juvenile rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Shannon1">[31]</xref>. Taken together, these results suggest that human neurons are more selectively tuned for high Fourier frequency components of their inputs and that their attenuation while relaying very fast signals, with Fourier components beyond 500 cycles/s, decays significantly less rapidly than in adult mouse cells.</p>
<p>From theoretical considerations it was predicted that tracking of fast input frequencies by neurons depends on the rate of onset of APs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Ilin1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-FourcaudTrocm1">[36]</xref>. We tested whether human neocortical pyramidal neurons have substantially faster AP onset kinetics than mouse pyramidal neurons. Single APs of human (26–47 years, <italic>n</italic> = 23 neurons) and adult mouse (10–11 weeks, <italic>n</italic> = 12 neurons) temporal cortex pyramidal neurons had similar waveform and duration, but different kinetic features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002007-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). However, APs fired in trains with varying instantaneous frequencies showed strong differences between human and mouse pyramidal neurons. In particular, the rising phase of APs fired by mouse neurons slowed down more with increasing firing frequency than APs generated by human neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002007-g005">Figures 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002007.s004">S4E, and S4F</xref>; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005). At higher firing frequencies the threshold for AP generation was elevated in mouse pyramidal neurons compared to human neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002007-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). Importantly, at instantaneous firing frequencies of 1 to 30 Hz, mouse APs had reduced onset rapidity compared to APs fired by human pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002007-g005">Figure 5D and 5F</xref>, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005 for all frequencies). A recent study reported that in order for neurons to track fast varying inputs, with Fourier components up to 1,000 cycles/s, the AP onset rapidity needed to be above 30 mV/ms per mV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Ilin1">[35]</xref>. APs fired by human pyramidal neurons had mean onset rapidity values above 32 mV/ms per mV for all firing frequencies tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002007-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). These results show that APs generated by human neurons have a sufficiently fast onset to account for the ability of these neurons to track very fast inputs, with Fourier components up to 1,000 cycles/s.</p>

<p>Our findings show that synaptic communication between human neocortical pyramidal neurons has higher bandwidth due to fast recovery from depression and that these neurons are equipped to track fast input Fourier components and encode these into timing of their spikes. Transfer of information between neurons through chemical synaptic transmission is elementary to cognition, and processes of short-term plasticity at these synapses encode information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Klug1">[16]</xref>. Studies on rodent excitatory cortical synapses show that short-term facilitation of synaptic strength may optimize information transfer in particular during spike bursts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Klyachko1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Rotman1">[37]</xref>. Based on findings in the rodent brain, it is assumed that purely depressing synapses may be better suited to transmit information for single spikes or short bursts rather than for trains of APs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Klug1">[16]</xref>. In contrast to these observations, we show here that purely depressing synapses in the human brain can actually transfer substantial amounts of information during spike trains, because recovery from depression is fast. We find that information transfer at depressing synapses with fast recovery is optimal at alpha band frequencies (8–12 Hz), and information transfer rate increases well into the beta and gamma band frequency range, suggesting that these synapses can be involved in active cortical computation, during cognition. This may unveil a fundamental difference with purely depressing synapses that slowly recover from depression in the neocortex of mice and other laboratory animals, which we find to have optimal frequencies of information transfer in the lower theta band range with no increase in information transfer rate at higher frequencies. These synapses may be better suited for a different range of cortical processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Hasselmo1">[38]</xref>.</p>
<p>In our study, we did not include polysynaptic events that have been described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Molnr1">[39]</xref>, and we restricted our attention to monosynaptic connections between pyramidal cells from L2/3 in the anterior medial temporal cortex, where polysynaptic events did not seem to play a prominent role. In rodent synapses, the amount and speed of short-term synaptic depression and its recovery are dependent on temperature as well as divalent ion concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Dittman1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Klyachko2">[41]</xref>. It is at present unknown to what extent synaptic depression and recovery in human synapses depend on temperature and divalent ion concentrations. Combined with a lack of information on the actual calcium and magnesium concentrations and temperature at synapses in the brain of awake behaving mice and humans, it is not feasible to predict what the speed of recovery from depression in mouse and human cortical synapses will be in the intact brain during behavior. Nevertheless, we show here that under defined experimental conditions in which temperature and extracellular divalent ion concentrations are controlled, human and mouse temporal cortex synapses show marked differences in the speed of recovery from synaptic depression. This suggests that differences in protein complexity of synaptic protein networks between mouse and human synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Bays1">[10]</xref> may translate into different functional properties of short-term synaptic plasticity.</p>
<p>Postsynaptically, the outcome of short-term synaptic plasticity processes is translated into AP firing to relay information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Rieke1">[13]</xref>. The brain not only keeps track of the number of spikes occurring in large windows of time, but spike timing can have meaning down to millisecond precision <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Nemenman1">[42]</xref>. Spike timing with a temporal resolution smaller than the time scales of sensory and motor signals, even at sub-millisecond levels, can encode significant amounts of visual information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Nemenman1">[42]</xref>. Cortical pyramidal neurons time their AP firing in relation to the timing of synaptic input <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-vanAerde1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Mann1">[44]</xref>. However, populations of rodent pyramidal neurons fail to time their spiking based on rapidly varying inputs components that change faster than 200–300 cycles/s. This may suggest that, during ongoing synaptic membrane potential fluctuations, rodent neurons do not regularly encode and transmit downstream information with sub-millisecond precision. We find that populations of human pyramidal neurons can regularly time AP firing with sub-millisecond precision and that these APs maintain rapid onset kinetics, which can account for such precision of spike timing. Rapid onset kinetics of somatic APs are predicted by Hodgkin-Huxley-based models for AP generation when the spatially extended morphology of neurons and AP propagation from the axon initial segment to the soma are taken into account <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Yu1">[45]</xref>. The observed fast onset rapidity of APs in adult human neurons can indeed partly be explained by human pyramidal neuron morphology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Eyal1">[46]</xref>. In particular, the electrical load imposed by the large dendritic tree of adult human layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons compared to adult rodent pyramidal neurons on the axon initial segment induces a larger onset rapidity of the AP and higher frequency tracking capabilities. In conclusion, our data show that elementary circuits in the human neocortex of connected pyramidal neurons that underlie cognition can operate at a substantially higher bandwidth and temporal resolution for information encoding than rodent neurons in response to the high information content synaptic transmission they receive.</p>

As during preparation of human brain slices, slices were allowed to recover for 30 minutes at 34°C followed by 30 minutes at room temperature in the same solution used for recording. Slices of adult mice were allowed to recover for 15 minutes at 34°C in the same solution used for slicing and then transferred to a chamber containing the same solution used for recording, at room temperature.</p>

<p>Neocortical slices were visualized using either infrared differential interference contrast (IR-DIC) microscopy or Hoffman modulation contrast.

<title>Novelty-Detection in Presynaptic Firing Rate by a Population of Synaptic Afferents</title>
<p>A passive R-C circuit was mathematically defined to mimic temporal integration of postsynaptic responses in a point-neuron with membrane time-constant of 10 msec. Then, 1,500 identical synaptic afferents impinging on this neuron were activated, each by an independent realization of an identical Poisson point-process. The mean frequency of this random process was step-changed from f<sub>1</sub> to f<sub>2</sub>, after several seconds of simulation lifetime. Each individual model synapse relayed the occurrence of a presynaptic AP in a use-dependent manner, according to the Tsodyks-Markram model described above. Without losing any generality, simulated postsynaptic responses were expressed and plotted in arbitrary units, normalizing voltage responses to the product of the (unspecified) neuronal input resistance and maximal synaptic efficacy A.</p>

<title>Quantifying Temporal Information Transfer at a Single Synapse</title>
<p>As an alternative to the Tsodyks-Markram model, we considered its non-deterministic formulation, which combines the classical quantal model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Allen1">[51]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-delCASTILLO1">[52]</xref> with use-dependent short-term depression as in Fuhrmann and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Fuhrmann1">[7]</xref>. We considered <italic>n</italic> = 5 release sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Verhoog1">[24]</xref> and the average quantal content A/N, with A being the maximal synaptic efficacy of the deterministic Tsodyks-Markram model. The last choice implies that on the average of many repeated trials, the non-deterministic model responses quantitatively correspond to the predictions of the Tsodyks-Markram deterministic formulation. The coefficient of variation of the quantal content was set to 0.4, choosing its standard deviation as 0.4 A/N. The coefficient of variation's value was taken from an example in the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Fuhrmann1">[7]</xref> and its numerical value scales proportionally the mutual information calculations and thus does not affect our conclusions. To demonstrate the previous statement we explored different values of CV of the simulated quantal content (i.e., 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002007.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The parameter has, therefore, no qualitative effect, but only a scaling effect. As opposed to a classic quantal model, the probability of release is non-stationary, and it is computed as the product between the fixed probability that a release site contains a vesicle (U) and the probability P<sub>v</sub>(t) that a vesicle is available at a given time t. In the lack of any presynaptic AP, P<sub>v</sub>(t) recovers exponentially to 1 with a recovery time-constant τ, while immediately after an AP this probability is decreased by a proportional amount, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002007.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This model allows one to apply information theoretical methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Borst1">[15]</xref>, extended to probabilistic synaptic transmission, and lead to quantify mutual information between the set of postsynaptic responses to a train of presynaptic spikes, and the corresponding set of interspike intervals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Fuhrmann1">[7]</xref>.

<p>Several average presynaptic firing frequencies were considered (0.01–100 Hz). For each average frequency, a realization of a Poisson point-process was generated to simulate the time of occurrence of 10,000 presynaptic spikes fired at such an average frequency. The marginal probability density of the postsynaptic amplitudes was estimated, and the corresponding conditional probability density, given the instantaneous probability of release, derived under the same assumptions of Fuhrmann and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Fuhrmann1">[7]</xref>.

Bridge balance was adjusted manually and pipette capacitance was compensated for. Recordings were excluded if bridge balance exceeded 12 MOhm. For analysis, all APs with instantaneous firing frequencies up to 30 Hz were pooled and binned for all recordings from a cell. Traces with resting membrane potentials above −60 mV and APs where the linear fit to obtain onset rapidity had R∧2 values &lt;0.95 were excluded from analysis. The various AP parameters were calculated for each AP in a train, as follows: the AP threshold was defined as the membrane potential at the point that the velocity of the AP exceeded 10 mV/ms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002007-Naundorf1">[55]</xref>. The AP peak voltage was determined as the absolute membrane potential measured at the peak of the AP waveform. The AP amplitude was calculated as the difference in membrane potential between the AP threshold and the AP peak voltage. Maximum rate of rise was defined as the maximum dV/dt value reached during the AP (calculated between adjacent points). Onset rapidity was defined as the slope of a linear fit to the AP phase plot (dV/dt versus V, with unit 1/ms) at dV/dt = 30 mV/ms.</p>
<p>The first AP in a train was considered a single AP. For all APs that followed, the instantaneous AP firing frequency was calculated as: 1/(time since previous spike). For subsequent analysis, APs with instantaneous firing frequencies up to 30 Hz were binned in frequency bins of 5 Hz. For each neuron, the mean value of a given AP parameter in a frequency bin was then obtained by averaging over all APs falling in that frequency bin. AP amplitude adaptation was calculated by dividing the mean amplitude of APs in a frequency bin by the mean amplitude of single APs. Maximum rate of rise adaptation was calculated by dividing the mean maximum rate of rise of APs in a frequency bin by the mean maximum rate of rise of single APs. Threshold variance was calculated as the standard deviation of AP thresholds for all APs within a frequency bin.

<p>The surgeon obtained tissue samples from human temporal cortex in variable forms, in a patient-dependent manner. We could reliably determine the location of the pia and the white matter to adjust the slice angle to maintain the apical dendritic tree within the slice, but had less control of the slicing orientation on the coronal/sagittal axis and relative to individual gyri (unlike in mouse brain, where landmarks such as midline or corpus callosum help in positioning the sample). Given these factors, we have not conducted a systematic analysis of connection probability between mouse and man to provide reliable estimates and comparisons of synaptic connectivity ratios between species.
