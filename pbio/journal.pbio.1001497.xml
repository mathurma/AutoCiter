        <p>Ecological selection on an adaptive allele causes a tightly linked hybrid incompatibility factor to rapidly hitchhike to high frequency in a population of the wildflower <italic>Mimulus guttatus</italic>.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Most species are superbly and intricately adapted to the environments in which they live. Adaptive evolution by natural selection is the primary force shaping biological diversity. Differences between closely related species in ecologically selected characters such as habitat preference, reproductive timing, courtship behavior, or pollinator attraction may prevent interbreeding in nature, causing reproductive isolation. But does ecological adaptation cause reproductive incompatibilities such as hybrid sterility or lethality? Although several genes causing hybrid incompatibilities have been identified, there is intense debate over whether the genes that contribute to ecological adaptations also cause hybrid incompatibilities. Thirty years ago, a genetic study of local adaptation to copper mine soils in the wildflower <italic>Mimulus guttatus</italic> identified a locus that appeared to cause copper tolerance and hybrid lethality in crosses to other populations. But do copper tolerance and hybrid lethality have the same molecular genetic basis? Here we show, using high-resolution genome mapping, that copper tolerance and hybrid lethality are not caused by the same gene but are in fact separately controlled by two tightly linked loci. We further show that selection on the copper tolerance locus indirectly caused the hybrid incompatibility allele to go to high frequency in the copper mine population because of hitchhiking. Our results provide a new twist on Darwin's original supposition that hybrid incompatibilities evolve as an incidental by-product of ordinary adaptation to the environment.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Adaptive evolution by natural selection is the primary force generating biological diversity. A critical question is whether the evolution of hybrid incompatibility, which is essential for the maintenance of species diversity, is caused by adaptive evolution. In this article, we investigate one of the most widely cited examples of ecological divergence driving the evolution of reproductive incompatibility, the strong association between hybrid lethality and copper tolerance in a copper mine population of the wildflower <italic>Mimulus guttatus</italic>. Hybrid lethality and tolerance of high levels of copper co-segregate as a single Mendelian locus. While copper tolerance and hybrid lethality are nearly universal in the mine population at Copperopolis, California, they are absent from adjacent off-mine populations, suggesting that reproductive isolation evolved rapidly as a pleiotropic by-product of recent adaptation to the mine environment. We find that copper tolerance and hybrid lethality are controlled by distinct loci, in tight genetic linkage. We also demonstrate that this genomic region has experienced strong recent selection and conclude that ecological selection for copper tolerance indirectly caused the neighboring hybrid lethality allele to hitchhike to high frequency. To our knowledge, this is the first case to demonstrate that reproductive isolation factors can evolve as an incidental by-product of adaptation to novel environments through genetic hitchhiking.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Adaptation to local environmental conditions by natural selection is the primary cause of evolutionary change in natural populations. Ecological adaptation can cause reproductive isolation when selection acts on traits that influence the likelihood of intermating in nature, such as habitat preference, reproductive timing, courtship behavior, or pollinator attraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-McKinnon1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Schluter1">[2]</xref>. However, it is controversial whether adaptation to local environmental conditions promotes the development of reproductive incompatibilities such as hybrid sterility or lethality. As Darwin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Darwin1">[3]</xref> first discussed, reproductive incompatibility should not evolve directly via natural selection (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Coyne1">[4]</xref>) and would only arise as an incidental by-product of interspecific divergence. Darwin realized that reproductive isolation could evolve if it is not expressed as lineages diverge, perhaps due to populations inhabiting geographically distinct regions, and it would only manifest in cases in which these populations hybridized subsequent to divergence. Classic models of the evolution of hybrid incompatibility, independently developed by Bateson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Bateson1">[5]</xref>, Dobzhansky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Dobzhansky1">[6]</xref>, and Muller <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Muller1">[7]</xref> (BDM), predict that alleles at different loci may accumulate within distinct lineages, and although they may be neutral or adaptive in an ancestral population, they will produce deleterious interactions when brought together by hybridization. This model is now thoroughly supported by genetic mapping studies of hybrid incompatibility loci. The role of natural selection in driving the evolution of incompatibility alleles continues to be an area of rich investigation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Coyne2">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Maheshwari1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Selection may drive the evolution of BDM incompatibility alleles in a variety of ways. With the molecular genetic dissection of multiple hybrid incompatibility systems, researchers have determined that many of the underlying loci have experienced rapid evolutionary divergence consistent with natural selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Presgraves1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Maheshwari1">[10]</xref>, but there is little evidence of what may be causing this rapid divergence. Evidence for the traditional view that hybrid incompatibility evolves as a by-product of adaptation to divergent environments is supported by only a few lab-based experimental evolution studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Dettman1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Anderson1">[13]</xref>. Of the hybrid incompatibility genes identified in natural populations, it seems unlikely they function in classical ecological adaptation. Instead researchers have speculated that these incompatibilities evolved due to intragenomic conflict <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Tao1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Tao2">[15]</xref>. For example, the incompatibility <italic>Overdrive</italic> locus causes both segregation distortion and hybrid male sterility in <italic>Drosophila psuedoobscura</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Phadnis1">[16]</xref>. Ultimately, it is considerably difficult to determine the evolutionary forces acting upon hybrid incompatibility alleles during the process of divergence because these studies focus on species reproductively isolated for thousands of generations.</p>
      <p>In this study, we investigate whether recent adaptation to a copper mine habitat by the wild flower <italic>Mimulus guttatus</italic> caused the evolution of hybrid incompatibility. Extreme soil environments, either naturally occurring or created anthropogenically, characterized by low nutrient and high heavy-metal concentrations, impose strong selection on plant communities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Antonovics1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Macnair1">[18]</xref>. <italic>M. guttatus</italic> has colonized multiple mine sites in the Sierra Nevada foothills region of central California, the largest of which is located at the Keystone Union mine complex in the town of Copperopolis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Allen1">[19]</xref>. A survey of tolerance to high copper concentration in plants from Copperopolis and adjacent off-mine populations suggests this phenotype is under strong selection in the mine habitat. Copper tolerance is nearly fixed in the mine population (99.77%, <italic>N</italic> = 2,796) and segregating at very low frequency in a sample of 15 off-mine populations located with 40 km of Copperopolis (8.7%, <italic>N</italic> = 1,440) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Macnair2">[20]</xref>. An investigation into the genetic basis of this trait initiated over 30 years ago identified a locus that appeared to cause both copper tolerance and hybrid lethality in crosses to other off-mine populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Macnair3">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Macnair4">[22]</xref>. Copper tolerance is controlled by a dominant allele at a single Mendelian locus, when measured as a threshold character in lab-based root growth assays. Crosses between tolerant lines from a recombinant backcross population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001497.s001">Figure S1</xref>) and the off-mine population, Cerig-y-drudion, Wales, United Kingdom (hereafter referred to as <italic>Cerig</italic>), yielded various levels of F1 hybrid lethality, whereas crosses between nontolerant lines from the same recombinant backcross population always produced viable offspring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Macnair4">[22]</xref>. Additional crosses demonstrated there is a single incompatibility locus in the Copperopolis population and that variation in F1 hybrid lethality is caused by multiple loci segregating in the <italic>Cerig</italic> population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Macnair4">[22]</xref>. <italic>Cerig</italic> was used in the initial crosses by M. R. Macnair and continues to be a focal population in this study, because it was the first population identified to produce inviable hybrid offspring in crosses with Copperopolis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Macnair4">[22]</xref>. Subsequent experiments have demonstrated that the <italic>Cerig</italic> hybrid lethality factors are geographically widespread and segregate in three California populations. In contrast, the Copperopolis lethality factor is geographically restricted; no incompatible plants were identified in test crosses with plants from 15 other populations (<italic>N</italic> = 10 plants/population) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Christie1">[23]</xref>. The lethality factor is at high frequency in the Copperopolis population; 16 Copperopolis genotypes (five of which are from this study, see details below) have been tested and all of them produce lethal offspring when crossed to <italic>Cerig</italic> tester lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Macnair4">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Christie1">[23]</xref>. Hybrid lethality in this system is consistent with the BDM model and was not observed to be genetically de-coupled from the copper tolerance phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Macnair4">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Christie2">[24]</xref>. One attractive hypothesis is that they are controlled by the same locus and F1 hybrid lethality evolved as a pleiotropic by-product of the locally adaptive copper tolerance. An alternative hypothesis is that the two phenotypes are not pleiotropic and are instead controlled by two distinct loci in tight genetic linkage.</p>
      <p>The physiological manifestation of BDM hybrid incompatibility in this system reveals possible genetic mechanism for inviability, while maintaining support for both the pleiotropy and linkage hypotheses. Hybrid lethality manifests in F1 plants as tissue yellowing and death in the early stages of development and prevents the plants from reaching reproductive maturity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Macnair4">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Christie2">[24]</xref>. This lethality is similar to the hybrid necrosis phenotype known for many years in the plant agriculture literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Langford1">[25]</xref>. Recently, it has been demonstrated that hybrid necrosis is an autoimmune-like response due to negative interactions between divergent pathogen-resistance proteins, often involving nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeats (NB-LRRs) and their interacting partners <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Krger1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Bomblies1">[27]</xref>. Although there is no support for NB-LRR's dual function in disease resistance and trafficking of heavy-metal ions, this could be the case for their partner proteins. NB-LRR protein–protein interactions are difficult to examine, and most partners remain unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Martin1">[28]</xref>. Additionally, there is strong evidence of pleiotropy between disease resistance and heavy metal tolerance from an independent class of pathogen-resistance proteins, defensins, which contribute to enhanced zinc tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis halleri</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Mirouze1">[29]</xref>. It remains to be determined whether selection on the copper tolerance allele in <italic>M. guttatus</italic> resulted in the near fixation of a hybrid incompatibility factor because these phenotypes are the result of pleiotropy at a single locus.</p>
      <p>The primary aim of this study is to investigate the genetic basis of the copper tolerance and hybrid necrosis phenotypes to determine whether they are pleiotropic or controlled by distinct genes in tight genetic linkage. We also use population genetic approaches to infer the nature of natural selection acting on this copper tolerance and hybrid necrosis genomic region.</p>

        <title>Genetic Mapping</title>
        <p>To determine whether copper tolerance and hybrid lethality are controlled by the same locus, we conducted a high-resolution genetic mapping experiment. Our mapping approach focused on first identifying the location of copper tolerance locus because, of the two phenotypes, it is easier to measure, and then screen a subset of plants with recombination events near the tolerance locus for hybrid inviability. In order to genetically map these phenotypes with high resolution, we used a near isogenic line (NIL) created through recurrent backcrossing of a Copperopolis by <italic>Cerig35</italic> F1 (this line is compatible with Copperopolis) to lines derived from Stinson Beach, California. For seven generations, only tolerant plants were selected to be backcrossed to Stinson Beach (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001497.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The Stinson Beach population is nontolerant and lacks any intrinsic incompatibilities with Copperopolis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Christie1">[23]</xref>. We used multiple outbred Stinson Beach lines to avoid the development of inbreeding depression in our backcross lines. Each backcross generation segregated tolerant and nontolerant progeny in equal ratio, in accordance with predictions for a single, dominant tolerance locus. We created our mapping population by crossing a single tolerant (BC<sub>7T</sub>) and a single nontolerant (BC<sub>7NT</sub>) line to produce F1<sub>BC7</sub> progeny (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001497.s001">Figure S1</xref>). We set about identifying the introgressed tolerance region in the NIL lines (BC<sub>7T</sub>, BC<sub>7NT</sub>) by screening 541 genetic markers distributed across the genome (mimulusevolution.org). We identified 42 markers that were homozygous in the BC<sub>7NT</sub> line and heterozygous in the BC<sub>7T</sub> line, possibly indicating a region of introgression from the tolerant parent. To establish which heterozygous markers are linked to the copper tolerance locus, we tested for an association between phenotype and genotype in 80 F1<sub>BC7</sub> lines. We measured copper tolerance in the F1<sub>BC7</sub> plants as a threshold character in accordance with previously published hydroponic methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Macnair2">[20]</xref>. We found the genotypes of one marker, <italic>MgSTS242</italic>, located on linkage group (LG) 9, were very tightly correlated with tolerance phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001497-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We henceforth refer to this copper tolerance locus as <italic>Tol1</italic>.</p>

        <p>To fine map the genomic position of <italic>Tol1</italic>, we created a mapping population of 4,340 F1<sub>BC7</sub> plants, phenotyped each plant for copper tolerance, and genotyped each plant with the <italic>MgSTS242</italic> marker. Initially, we identified 83 recombinant plants, however we repeatedly phenotyped and genotyped these lines and we were able to confirm 36 true recombinant plants, indicating that this marker is 0.83 cM from the <italic>Tol1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001497-g002">Figure 2</xref>). To fine map <italic>Tol1</italic>, we designed additional genetic markers near <italic>MgSTS242</italic> using the currently unpublished <italic>M. guttatus</italic> genome assembly (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phytozome.net" xlink:type="simple">www.phytozome.net</ext-link>). This assembly is not contiguous on the scale of chromosomes; the genome is instead composed of many, relatively small, genomic scaffolds that do not assemble into large chromosome-length blocks. The assembly in the <italic>Tol1</italic> genomic region is particularly poor because this is a highly repetitive pericentromic region of LG 9 and none of the scaffolds that map to this region in the reference are longer than 1 MB. We attempted to determine the location of 10 target scaffolds relative to <italic>MgSTS242</italic> and <italic>Tol1</italic> by designing multiple new markers per scaffold and screening them in our recombinant lines. We identified three scaffolds that are in tight linkage to <italic>Tol1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001497-g002">Figure 2</xref>). We determined that a marker on scaffold 84 is in tightest association with <italic>Tol1</italic>; we found 14 plants have a recombination event between <italic>Sc84_37kb</italic> and <italic>Tol1</italic>, indicating this marker is located within 0.32 cM of the tolerance locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001497-g002">Figure 2</xref>). We identified three additional scaffolds that map to this region (97c, 157, and 238), but they do not reside within the <italic>Sc84_37kb</italic>–<italic>Tol1</italic> interval (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001497.s010">Text S1</xref>). We have not included these scaffolds in our map because we have a limited amount of genetic material and we could not test all 36 recombinants. We attempted to identify a flanking marker for <italic>Tol1</italic> by designing markers in the 3′ end of scaffold 63b, which is predicted to be adjacent to the 5′ end of scaffold 84 (unpublished data, Uffe Hellsten, Joint Genome Institute, Walnut Creek, CA). However, we found no evidence of linkage between our markers and the tolerant phenotype, likely indicating that scaffold 63b is outside of the NIL introgression region or there are errors in the reference genome assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001497-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001497.s010">Text S1</xref>). We observed the same pattern of no linkage between <italic>Tol1</italic> and markers located in two additional scaffolds (460 and 925) that are predicted to be located in this region in the reference genome assembly.</p>

        <p>Our F1<sub>BC7</sub>×<italic>Cerig10</italic> crosses produced a bimodal distribution of hybrid inviability. The majority of crosses with nontolerant lines produced 5%–15% inviable progeny, whereas the majority of crosses with tolerant lines produced 45%–62% inviable progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001497-g003">Figure 3C and 3D</xref>). We identified two plants, 25_E01 and 25_E11, with recombinant phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001497-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Hybrid inviability of nontolerant line 25_E01 is significantly elevated compared to all nontolerant control lines (Wilcoxon test, <italic>z</italic> = 2.46, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.014; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001497.s007">Table S1</xref>) except 46_B12, which had only two replicate measurements (Wilcoxon test, <italic>z</italic> = 1.84, <italic>p</italic> = 0.065; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001497.s007">Table S1</xref>). Hybrid inviability of tolerant line 25_E11 is significantly lower than the two tolerant control lines (Wilcoxon test, <italic>z</italic> = 2.46, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.014; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001497.s007">Table S1</xref>). This establishes that copper tolerance and hybrid inviability are controlled by two distinct, but tightly linked, loci and that hybrid necrosis is not a pleiotropic by-product of copper tolerance. We henceforth refer to the hybrid inviability locus as <italic>Nec1</italic>.</p>
        <p>To map the genomic location of <italic>Nec1</italic>, we compared the <italic>Tol1</italic> genotyping information for these lines to our lethality data and determined that <italic>Nec1</italic> maps to scaffold 84. To fine map <italic>Nec1</italic>, we designed markers in this region and genotyped plants with informative recombination events. We found that the incompatibility locus maps to an intergenic region between 283 kb and 293 kb on scaffold 84 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001497-g004">Figure 4</xref>). This region in the <italic>M. guttatus</italic> genome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phytozome.net" xlink:type="simple">www.phytozome.net</ext-link>) contains a single <italic>Gypsy3</italic> transposable element (TE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001497-g004">Figure 4</xref>). We are prevented from continuing to narrow this region, despite identifying three lines (26_C07, 25_E01, and 48_B01) with recombination events within this locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001497-g004">Figure 4</xref>) because of the repetitive nature of this element. We attempted to sequence across this genomic interval using long-range PCR, but these attempts were unsuccessful. Our long-range PCR may have failed because repetitive DNA in this TE element or because this genomic interval is much larger in the Copperopolis genome compared to the reference genome.</p>

        <p><italic>Nec1</italic> maps to an intergenic region containing a <italic>Gypsy3</italic> TE. Unregulated TE replication can cause hybrid sterility in <italic>Drosophila</italic>; in this system, hybrid sterility manifests in crosses in a single direction because hybrids lack the maternally inherited TE replication-suppression mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Bingham1">[30]</xref>. It is unlikely that this is the cause of inviability in our system because significant levels of hybrid lethality occur in both crossing directions, although it is higher when <italic>Cerig</italic> is the paternal parent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001497.s008">Table S2</xref>). Instead, the functional changes at <italic>Nec1</italic> likely result from altered gene expression or gene function.</p>
        <p>The Copperopolis allele at <italic>Nec1</italic> may cause hybrid lethality by altering the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory expression of a gene within this region, and the functional gene may flank our mapped interval or reside even further away along the chromosome. The nearest gene, MGV1A004323M, resides 5 kb from <italic>Nec1</italic> and encodes a glycosyltransferase metabolic enzyme (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phytozome.net" xlink:type="simple">www.phytozome.net</ext-link>). This protein has greatest homology to <italic>A. thaliana</italic> gene AT3G18170, which attaches glyosyl groups to N-linked glycan molecules critical for construction of plant cell membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Keegstra1">[31]</xref>. The second flanking gene, MGV1A026627M, is located 41 kb from <italic>Nec1</italic> and encodes a Jumonji-C histone demethylation protein. The Jumonji-C proteins are part of the histone demethylase family, whose function reverses the epigenetic silencing of transposons and genes in eukaryotic genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Zhou1">[32]</xref>. Neither of these genes, nor is any gene within 100 kb of Nec1, is a known participant in plant disease-resistance pathway. Alternatively, <italic>Nec1</italic> may involve another gene that is absent from the reference genome. This gene may have undergone recent functional or expression changes to cause negative interactions with a member of the plant disease-resistance pathway, producing the hybrid necrosis phenotype. This hypothesis is especially attractive because the NB-LRRs often exhibit large variation in copy number within species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-McHale1">[33]</xref>. Although additional work is required to distinguish between the possible mechanisms of <italic>Nec1</italic> function, our results clearly demonstrate that hybrid inviability did not evolve as a pleiotropic by-product of the evolution of copper tolerance. What evolutionary force caused the lethality allele at <italic>Nec1</italic> to go to high frequency in the Copperopolis population?</p>

        <title>Selection Driving the Evolution of Hybrid Incompatibility</title>
        <p>The hybrid lethality phenotype reached high frequency in the Copperopolis population because of genetic drift or natural selection. Genetic drift may have been the primary evolutionary mechanism causing the lethality allele at <italic>Nec1</italic> to rise to high frequency if the initial population of mine colonists experienced a bottleneck event. This scenario would cause a genome-wide reduction in genetic variation in the mine population relative to neighboring off-mine populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Charlesworth1">[34]</xref>. Alternatively, the hybrid lethality allele at <italic>Nec1</italic> may have been directly selected because this allele confers some fitness advantage in the mine habitat. A variant of the selection hypothesis is that the lethality allele at <italic>Nec1</italic> may have hitchhiked to high frequency because of selection on the tightly linked <italic>Tol1</italic> locus. In this case, the tolerance and incompatibility alleles would have resided on the same haplotype in the founders of the mine population. Selection on this genomic region would leave a molecular genetic signature of reduced genetic variation in the mine population and increased genetic differentiation between mine and off-mine populations in this genomic region, compared to the rest of the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-MaynardSmith1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Barton1">[38]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Studies that attempt to identify these molecular signatures of selection in natural populations have been used to identify putatively selected loci in many different systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Storz1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Nosil2">[44]</xref>. The power of population genetic studies to detect signatures of selection can be diminished by multiple interdependent processes: selection on standing genetic variation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Hermisson1">[45]</xref>, population structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Excoffier1">[46]</xref>, and time since a selective sweep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Charlesworth1">[34]</xref>. These studies can most readily identify a molecular signature of selection in the classic case of a hard sweep, in which strong selection on a new mutation causes a single haplotype to rapidly go to fixation and tightly linked alleles hitchhike to high frequency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Charlesworth1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Barton1">[38]</xref>. However, if this mutation is segregating in the ancestral population and has recombined onto multiple haplotypes prior to selection, hitchhiking of tightly linked alleles is reduced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Hermisson1">[45]</xref>. This event, termed a “soft sweep,” will not decrease genetic variation or increase population differentiation at linked alleles to the same degree as a hard sweep. The number of generations since a selected allele goes to high frequency affects the molecular signature of selection because each generation there is new opportunity for mutation, migration, and recombination to add genetic variation to the derived population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Charlesworth1">[34]</xref>. The young age of the mine habitat (150 y) suggests that if a sweep occurred, the molecular signature of this event would still be apparent. The mine and off-mine populations are in close geographic proximity, and there is opportunity for gene flow, suggesting there will be little effect of population structure. Gene flow will increase the amount of shared genetic variation at selectively neutral sites in the genome, but strong selection in the mine environment could maintain the original haplotype (or haplotypes) containing the tolerance allele in the face of gene flow.</p>
        <p>In order to evaluate the selection hypothesis, we compared genetic variation at markers linked to <italic>Tol1</italic> and markers randomly distributed throughout the genome. We sampled individual plants, collected as seed from unique maternal families in 2005 and 2007, from the mine population at Copperopolis (<italic>N</italic> = 108) and from two off-mine populations: O'Byrnes Ferry Road (<italic>N</italic> = 33), located 2 km from Copperopolis, and Hunt Road (<italic>N</italic> = 39), located 9 km from Copperopolis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001497.s003">Figure S3</xref>). The geographic proximity of these populations and recent divergence of the mine population, a maximum of 150 generations, suggests any signal of selection will not be lost in a haze of population structure. Furthermore, this population sampling is designed to explicitly test for an effect of habitat-mediated selection on a single genomic region with known phenotypic effect, <italic>Tol1</italic>/<italic>Nec1</italic> loci, and not a genome-wide analysis. Lastly, this design will not be confounded by the effect of hybrid inviability because these off-mine populations lack the incompatible allele found in the <italic>Cerig</italic> population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Christie1">[23]</xref>.</p>
        <p>We measured genetic variation of eight loci in the <italic>Tol1</italic> fine mapped region (<italic>Tol1<sub>Link</sub></italic>) and 11 unlinked loci (<italic>Tol1<sub>UnLink</sub></italic>) for the Copperopolis and two off-mine populations. The <italic>Tol1<sub>UnLink</sub></italic> markers serve as a control to estimate the average level of genetic variation and population differentiation. We used co-dominant DNA fragment length polymorphism markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Wu1">[47]</xref> to estimate the within-population genetic variation, which we report as number of alleles (<italic>N<sub>a</sub></italic>) and expected heterozygosity (<italic>H<sub>e</sub></italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Excoffier2">[48]</xref>. We report both values, but these are often correlated when using fragment length markers. We calculated genetic differentiation between populations as <italic>F<sub>st</sub></italic> for two marker classes: <italic>Tol1<sub>Link</sub></italic> and <italic>Tol1<sub>UnLink</sub></italic> using <italic>Fdist</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Beaumont1">[36]</xref> implemented in the program LOSITAN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Antao1">[49]</xref>. To evaluate whether <italic>F<sub>st</sub></italic> is significantly elevated in the <italic>Tol1</italic> fine mapped region, we compared the observed levels of <italic>F<sub>st</sub></italic> at the <italic>Tol1<sub>Link</sub></italic> markers to a null distribution of <italic>F<sub>st</sub></italic> generated from coalescence simulations of population divergence using the <italic>Tol1<sub>UnLink</sub></italic> dataset in the program LOSITAN. Our hypothesis is that <italic>F<sub>st</sub></italic> for the <italic>Tol1<sub>Link</sub></italic> markers will be significantly higher than the <italic>Tol1<sub>UnLink</sub></italic> markers. The coalescence simulations assume two populations and use Wright's symmetrical Island Model of migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Wright1">[50]</xref> to calculate the probability that two randomly chosen chromosomes in a population have a most recent common ancestor within that population without an intervening migration or mutation event <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Beaumont1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Antao1">[49]</xref>. This model also assumes that the two populations are at equilibrium with constant effective population size. Our populations likely violate this assumption because the mine population was only recently established. However, Beaumont and Nichols found that a recent colonization event had no significant effect on their estimates of the <italic>F<sub>st</sub></italic> distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Beaumont1">[36]</xref>.</p>
        <p>We observe low <italic>F<sub>st</sub></italic> for all <italic>Tol1<sub>UnLink</sub></italic> markers, and for all but a single marker, there is no significant differentiation for the three pairwise population comparisons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001497.s009">Table S3</xref>). Using the <italic>Tol1<sub>UnLink</sub></italic> dataset, we also estimate the relatedness between the three populations using the program STRUCTURE version 2.3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Pritchard1">[51]</xref>. In this analysis, the two off-mine populations cluster more tightly with each other than with Copperopolis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001497.s004">Figure S4</xref>); thus, we combined the two off-mine populations into a single sample for subsequent analyses.</p>
        <p>We found mine and off-mine populations have no difference in <italic>N<sub>a</sub></italic> and only slightly reduced <italic>H<sub>e</sub></italic> for the <italic>Tol1<sub>UnLink</sub></italic> markers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001497-t001">Table 1</xref>). This suggests that the mine population did not undergo a dramatic population bottleneck during colonization, or if it did, this signal has been erased by ongoing gene flow. Conversely, we find that <italic>N<sub>a</sub></italic> and <italic>H<sub>e</sub></italic> of the <italic>Tol1<sub>Link</sub></italic> markers is sharply reduced in the Copperopolis population compared to the off-mine population, and this pattern is strongest at the four markers in tightest linkage to <italic>Tol1</italic> and <italic>Nec1</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001497-t001">Table 1</xref>). We found that the four markers that are most tightly linked to <italic>Tol1</italic> and <italic>Nec1</italic> have significantly elevated <italic>F<sub>st</sub></italic> when compared to the <italic>Tol1<sub>UnLink</sub></italic> distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001497-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001497.s005">S5</xref>). <italic>F<sub>st</sub></italic> values varied between the four markers; the markers with the two highest values are <italic>Sc84_364kb</italic> (<italic>F<sub>st</sub></italic> = 0.546) and <italic>Sc84_37kb</italic> (<italic>F<sub>st</sub></italic> = 0.317) are in tightest linkage to the <italic>Nec1</italic> and <italic>Tol1</italic> loci, respectively. These data support the two predictions arising from the selection hypothesis: low genetic variation within Copperopolis and high differentiation between populations at markers linked to the tolerance and hybrid lethality loci.</p>

        <title>Genetic Dissection of Copper Tolerance and Hybrid Inviability</title>
        <p>We demonstrate that copper tolerance is not pleiotropic with hybrid inviability. Instead, both phenotypes are controlled by distinct loci that are in tight genetic linkage. We genetically mapped the copper tolerance locus to a highly repetitive pericentromeric genomic region. The large amount of repetitive DNA and relatively rare euchromatic sequence has inhibited the assembly large genomic scaffolds in this region of <italic>M. guttatus</italic> reference genome (unpublished data, Uffe Hellsten, Joint Genome Institute, Walnut Creek, CA). Our attempts to fine map the <italic>Tol1</italic> locus to a genomic scaffold, or even identify a flanking marker, have been stymied by the complex nature of this genomic region despite our large mapping population. In contrast, we were able to fine map the hybrid lethality locus to a 10 kb intergenic region with a contiguous genomic scaffold. The Copperopolis allele at <italic>Nec1</italic> may cause hybrid lethality by altering the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory expression of a neighboring gene, or this region in the Copperopolis genome may harbor genes that are missing in the reference <italic>M. guttatus</italic> genome. We attempted to amplify the 10 kb region from the Copperopolis genome using long-range PCR, but these attempts were unsuccessful. The failed PCR attempts may be caused by repetitive DNA within the gypsy-3 TE or because this region may be expanded or rearranged in the Copperopolis genome compared to our reference.</p>
        <p>We observed a large amount of variance between independent replicates of the high-lethality lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001497-g003">Figures 3C, 3D</xref>, and S2). This variance is likely caused by two factors—segregating variation at multiple incompatibility loci in our tester line, <italic>Cerig10</italic>, and variation in temperature in the greenhouses in which the F1<sub>BC7</sub>×<italic>Cerig10</italic> offspring were grown. There are multiple incompatibility loci segregating within the <italic>Cerig</italic> population that interact with the Copperopolis allele at the locus we have now identified as <italic>Nec1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Macnair4">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Christie1">[23]</xref>. Our tester line, <italic>Cerig10</italic>, was chosen because it gave the highest level of incompatibility, but it may be heterozygous at some incompatibility loci, inflating variation in hybrid lethality. An additional source of variation may be the temperature at which the offspring were grown; research on hybrid necrosis in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> has demonstrated that this phenotype manifests at 16°C but is absent at 23°C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Bomblies1">[27]</xref>. Our plants were grown under controlled greenhouse conditions, but daily or seasonal temperature fluctuations may have exceeded the capability of the greenhouse to maintain constant temperature.</p>

        <title>Selection for Copper Tolerances Drives Evolution of Hybrid Incompatibility</title>
        <p>We find strong support for the hypothesis that adaptation to the mine habitat imposed selection on the <italic>Nec1</italic>/<italic>Tol1</italic> genomic region in the Copperopolis population. The high level of genetic variation in the <italic>Tol1<sub>UnLink</sub></italic> dataset in the Copperopolis population argues against a dramatic bottleneck event during mine colonization. The four markers in tight linkage to <italic>Tol1</italic> and <italic>Nec1</italic> have reduced <italic>N<sub>a</sub></italic> and <italic>H<sub>e</sub></italic> in the mine population, as well as significantly elevated <italic>F<sub>st</sub></italic>. We interpret these data as evidence of a sweep at <italic>Tol1</italic>, driven by selection for copper tolerance, causing the <italic>Nec1</italic> BDM incompatibility allele to hitchhike to high frequency in the mine population. This model predicts that the marker in tightest linkage to <italic>Tol1</italic>, <italic>Sc84_37kb</italic>, would have the highest <italic>F<sub>st</sub></italic> and sharpest reduction in <italic>H<sub>e</sub></italic>. Contrary to this prediction, we found that marker <italic>Sc84_364kb</italic>, the marker nearest <italic>Nec1</italic>, has the highest <italic>F<sub>st</sub></italic> and sharpest reduction in <italic>H<sub>e</sub></italic>. This finding suggests that adaptation to the mine environment was more complex than the classic hard selective sweep at <italic>Tol1</italic>. Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the incompatibility allele at <italic>Nec1</italic> has also experienced selection in the mine population, the physiological effect of the tolerance allele and the biogeographic distribution of copper tolerant plants, which are nearly fixed in multiple mine populations and are segregating at 8.3% of neighboring off-mine populations, is strong evidence that copper tolerance is under selection in the mine habitat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Macnair3">[21]</xref>. Because the lethality allele at <italic>Nec1</italic> has only been found in a single, very recently derived population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Christie1">[23]</xref> and has no discernible phenotypic effect beyond causing hybrid lethality, it is less likely this allele is experiencing selection in the mine environment.</p>
        <p>We suggest multiple factors that may explain why the patterns of <italic>H<sub>e</sub></italic> and <italic>F<sub>st</sub></italic> we observe do not conform to the predictions of a classic hard selective sweep. Variation in the mutation rate between markers <italic>Sc84_37kb</italic> and <italic>Sc84_364kb</italic> may explain the differences in <italic>H<sub>e</sub></italic> and <italic>F<sub>st</sub></italic>. Additionally, we note that we have been unable to fine map the precise location of <italic>Tol1</italic> because this is a highly repetitive pericentromeric region and the <italic>Sc84_367kb</italic> marker may actually be closer to <italic>Tol1</italic> in the Copperopolis genome than its position in the reference genome suggests. Finally, we suggest that the tolerance allele at <italic>Tol1</italic> may not have experienced a hard selective sweep. If the tolerance allele was segregating at low frequency in the ancestral population and experienced a soft selective sweep, tightly linked sites would be affected differently depending on the amount of genetic variation at these sites in the ancestral population and the level of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the selected allele and tightly linked sites when selection first acted upon this population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Hermisson1">[45]</xref>. Tolerant plants are segregating at 8.3% in off-mine populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Christie1">[23]</xref>, and although we are unable to determine whether this is caused by segregating ancestral variation or recent migration from mine to off-mine populations, it indicates that the tolerant allele may predate the development of the copper mines and recently rose to near fixation via a soft selective sweep. We investigate whether a soft sweep at <italic>Tol1</italic> could have caused the lethality allele at <italic>Nec1</italic> to hitchhike to high frequency using a quantitative model of genetic hitchhiking.</p>
        <p>To simulate hitchhiking on tightly linked sites following a hard or soft selective sweep, we use the two-locus model of genetic hitchhiking described by Maynard Smith and Haigh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-MaynardSmith1">[35]</xref> and Barton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Barton1">[38]</xref>. In the classic model of a hard selective sweep, the beneficial allele resides on a single haplotype and the selected and linked alleles are initially in complete LD. Because copper mining was initiated in the 1860s, we focused on strong selection situations that would cause a beneficial allele to become nearly fixed within 150 generations. We model the effects of hitchhiking on neutral allele segregating at low frequency (5%) in the ancestral population because the hybrid lethality allele has not been found in neighboring off-mine populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Christie1">[23]</xref>. Additional details of our hitchhiking model are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001497.s010">Text S1</xref>. Consistent with previous findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Barton1">[38]</xref>, we find that during a hard selective sweep, tightly linked alleles within 0.5 cM hitchhike to high frequency in the derived population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001497.s006">Figure S6A, S6D</xref>, and S6G). We next model the soft sweep scenario, in which the selected allele is segregating at low frequency (5% and 10%) in the ancestral population. We find that a soft selective sweep can cause sites within 0.5 cM of the beneficial allele to hitchhike to high frequency for a wide range of parameter values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001497.s006">Figure S6B, S6C, S6E, S6F, S6H</xref>, and S6I). The primary determinant of hitchhiking effects is the initial level of LD between the selected and neutral alleles. In the hard sweep model, LD is 1, however this parameter can vary when the focal beneficial mutation and a tightly linked allele are segregating in the ancestral population. We find that when we set initial levels of LD to high levels (0.8–1.0), a tightly linked allele within 0.5 cM can hitchhike to high frequency in the derived population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001497.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Overall, these findings demonstrate that for this situation, in which a <italic>M. guttatus</italic> population has rapidly adapted to the copper mine environment, a soft or hard selective sweep can produce large hitchhiking effects on tightly linked sites that happen to be in strong LD in the ancestral population. Although this hitchhiking model makes assumptions that are likely violated in natural populations—deterministic selection on an allele, bi-allelic loci, and constant population size—it provides a useful quantitative framework to describe the effects of genetic hitchhiking on loci in tight genetic linkage.</p>
        <p>The variation we observe in of <italic>H<sub>e</sub></italic> and <italic>F<sub>st</sub></italic> between <italic>Tol1<sub>Link</sub></italic> markers suggests that adaptation in the mine environment may have occurred in a manner more complex than the classic hard sweep model. A soft selective sweep may not uniformly reduce genetic variation or increase genetic differentiation at tightly linked sites if there were differences in the amount of ancestral genetic variation at these sites or variation in the levels of LD between the selected allele and linked sites in the ancestral population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Hermisson1">[45]</xref>. In a soft sweep, the primary determinant of the strength of hitchhiking effects is the initial level of LD between the selected allele and tightly linked alleles. Unfortunately, the extent of LD in the ancestral population for this pericentromeric region is not known. Although we cannot conclusively state whether there was a hard or soft sweep at the <italic>Tol1</italic>/<italic>Nec1</italic> region, we do find strong evidence of selection on this region in the mine population, and the results of our hitchhiking simulations of a hard or soft sweep are consistent with the hypothesis that selection at <italic>Tol1</italic> caused the hybrid lethality allele at <italic>Nec1</italic> to hitchhike to high frequency in mine population.</p>
        <p>In summary, we have determined that the copper tolerance and hybrid inviability phenotypes are controlled by two distinct, tightly linked loci. Hybrid inviability is not a pleiotropic by-product of adaptation to the mine environment, as originally proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Macnair4">[22]</xref>. We find that <italic>Tol1</italic> maps to a highly repetitive, unassembled region of the <italic>M. guttatus</italic> genome, whereas <italic>Nec1</italic> maps to a 10 kb region containing a single TE. Furthermore, we demonstrate that there has been strong positive selection on the <italic>Nec1/Tol1</italic> genomic region. We interpret these data as evidence that the <italic>Nec1</italic> lethality allele rose to high frequency because of genetic drift induced by selection on the tightly linked <italic>Tol1</italic>. We demonstrate that natural selection on one locus can cause a tightly linked hybrid lethality allele to hitchhike to high frequency, providing empirical evidence for a new twist on Darwin's hypothesis that reproductive isolation can evolve as an incidental by-product of adaptation to novel environments.</p>

Tolerance was measured repeatedly (2–6 times) for every putative recombinant line, although a few lines did perish in the greenhouse before they could be re-tested. To score hybrid lethality, we grew 60 seedlings from a focal cross and scored the number of plants with majority yellow or necrotic tissue after 3 wk of growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Macnair4">[22]</xref>. Hybrid lethality was scored in multiple (2–8) growouts per line from 2008–2009.</p>

        <title>Genetic Dissection of Tol1 and Nec1</title>
        <p>Genetic mapping of <italic>Tol1</italic> and <italic>Nec1</italic> was conducted at Duke University using tissue samples shipped from University of Exeter. Genomic DNA was extracted from plant tissue using a modified hexadecyl trimethyl-ammonium bromide chloroform extraction protocol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Kelly1">[52]</xref>. Most of the genetic markers used in this analysis are DNA fragment-length polymorphism markers analyzed using capillary electrophoresis on an ABI 3730×l DNA Analyzer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Hall1">[53]</xref>. These genetic markers score variation in PCR fragment length created by insertion-deletions. For most markers, primers reside in conserved exon sequence and amplify intron sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001497-Wu1">[47]</xref>. The size of the amplified fragments was scored automatically by the program GENEMARKER (SoftGenetics, 2005, State College, PA) and was confirmed by eye. For additional fine-mapping markers, we used di-deoxy sequencing of PCR products to identify SNPs distinguishing Copperopolis and Stinson Beach alleles (Markers: <italic>Sc84_180kb</italic>, <italic>234kb</italic>, <italic>252kb</italic>, <italic>277kb</italic>, <italic>281kb</italic>, <italic>283kb</italic>, <italic>293kb</italic>, <italic>297kb</italic>; <italic>Sc86_144kb</italic>, <italic>400kb</italic>; <italic>Sc341_99kb</italic>). SNPs were scored manually using Sequencher (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, MI). To be sure of genotypes for markers defining the <italic>Nec1</italic> locus, Sc84_283kb, 293kb, and 297kb, we ran 2–3 independent reactions for each genetic line.</p>
