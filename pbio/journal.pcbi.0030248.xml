Analysis of gene expression measurement experiments using the predicted protein abundance levels yields new insights that are not readily discernable when clustering the corresponding mRNA expression levels. Comparing protein abundance levels across poor and rich media, we find a general trend for homeostatic regulation where transcription and translation change in a reciprocal manner. This phenomenon is more prominent near origins of replications. Our analysis shows that in parallel to the adaptation occurring at the tRNA level via the codon bias, proteins do undergo a complementary adaptation at the amino acid level to further increase their abundance.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>DNA microarrays measuring gene expression levels have been a mainstay of systems biology research, but since proteins are more direct mediators of cellular processes, protein abundance levels are likely to be a better indicator of the cellular state. However, as proteomic measurements are still lagging behind gene expression measurements, there has been considerable effort in recent years to study the correlations between gene expression (and a plethora of protein characteristics) and protein abundance. Addressing this challenge, the current study is one of the first to introduce a predictor for protein abundance levels that is tested and validated on unseen data using all currently available large-scale proteomic data. The utility of this predictor is shown via a comprehensive set of tests and applications, including improved functional coherency of complexes and interacting proteins, better fit with gene phenotypic data, cross-species prediction of protein abundance, and most importantly, the reinterpretation of existing gene expression microarray data. Finally, our revisit and analysis of the existing large-scale proteomic data reveals new key insights concerning the regulation of translation efficiency and its evolution. Overall, a solid protein abundance prediction tool is invaluable for advancing our understanding of cellular processes; this study presents a further step in this direction.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement> TT was supported by the Edmond J.

Since proteins are the direct mediators of cellular processes, the abundance level of each protein is likely to be a better indicator of the cellular state than its corresponding mRNA expression level. However, genome-wide technologies to detect protein abundance are still lagging behind those that measure mRNA, and only few studies that measure protein abundance on a large scale are currently available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b006">6</xref>].</p><p>The relationship between mRNA and protein abundance levels has been studied by several groups. Genes with similar mRNA levels may have very different protein abundance levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b007">7</xref>]. Yet, the correlation between protein and mRNA abundance after a log-transform was shown to be quite high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b008">8</xref>]. A more recent study, combining three technologies for measuring mRNA expression, has yielded correlation levels of about 0.7 with protein abundance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b009">9</xref>]. Several studies have aimed at correlating protein abundance to various other features of proteins, such as their codon bias, molecular weight, stop codon identity, and more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b011">11</xref>] These investigations and other previous proteomic studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b014">14</xref>] were usually based on small- to medium-scale measurements.</p><p>The current study revisits these issues and presents a comprehensive investigation of the relationship between factors that influence protein abundance and the associated protein levels. We begin by constructing a predictor for protein abundance levels, which, in contrast to previous studies, is tested and validated on unseen data (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). To this end, we rely on two large-scale protein abundance datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b005">5</xref>]. Overall, to our knowledge this is the first time that the whole body of data currently available is collated and analyzed to this aim, and we obtain a predictor with a correlation of 0.76 with experimentally determined abundance levels. Applying the resulting predictor to pertaining mRNA expression data testifies to its utility. Our analysis provides new key insights concerning the regulation of translation efficiency and its evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Genome-wide studies have measured mRNA and protein levels in the yeast <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content> growing either in rich medium (yeast extract, peptone, and dextrose [YEPD]) or on poor, defined medium (synthetic dextrose [SD]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b005">5</xref>]. When protein abundance is compared to the corresponding mRNA levels in a given medium, the translation efficiency (TE), i.e., the ratio between protein abundance and mRNA levels, exhibits a large variability among genes (spanning across six orders of magnitude; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030248-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030248-g001">1</xref>B). However, when the TEs of a given protein are compared across the two different growth conditions, notably very little variation is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030248-g001">Figure 1</xref>C): the ratios between the TEs of most proteins in the two conditions are close to 1, with &gt;90% of the proteins showing a ratio between 0.5 and 2. This observation, albeit currently limited to the two types of media for which genome-wide data are available, suggests that the efficiency of translation per mRNA molecule of many genes may be largely invariable under different conditions. This fairly constant TE of yeast genes has motivated us to create a large-scale predictor of protein abundance, with the aim of studying its utility for inferring protein abundance levels across different conditions.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030248-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030248.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Distribution of TE and RTE in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content></title><p>(A) Top: <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> genes sorted by their TE (log scale) in YEPD (rich) medium.

To improve the prediction accuracy, we examined the potential utility of combining 32 additional protein attributes into a multivariable linear predictor, some of which have been previously shown to have predictive value (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030248-st001">Table S1</xref>). A greedy feature selection algorithm identified two useful protein attributes, while the inclusion of all other features resulted in a marginal and insignificant improvement in the performance of the linear, mRNA-based predictor. Performing the prediction by a support vector machine (SVM) using a variety of nonlinear kernels did not improve the results (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).</p><p>The two protein features yielding a significant improvement in prediction accuracy were the tRNA adaptation index (tAI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b017">17</xref>], and the evolutionary rate (ER) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b019">19</xref>]. tAI is based on the synonymous codon usage bias and gene copy number of different tRNAs and is related to the codon adaptation index (CAI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b017">17</xref>].

These two features have been shown previously to be correlated with protein abundance levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b020">20</xref>].

Adding evolutionary rate values increases the correlation to 0.63. The incremental improvement of consecutively adding these two features to the basic linear regression protein abundance predictor is statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030248-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).</p><fig id="pcbi-0030248-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030248.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Performances of the Linear Predictor of (log) Protein Abundance</title><p>(A) The accuracy of various linear predictors of (log) protein abundance, measured by the Spearman rank correlation coefficient over a held-out test set, using a single data source of protein abundance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b002">2</xref>] and mRNA levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b015">15</xref>].

Thus, in the (yet rare) cases where several independent measurements of mRNA and protein levels at the same conditions are available, they can be used to reduce potential individual measurement biases by pooling them together [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b009">9</xref>] (the correlation between two proteomic datasets generated by two different techniques and in different labs are between <italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = 0.6 and <italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = 0.8; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030248-se001">Text S1</xref>). We thus averaged mRNA and protein abundance results obtained with different technologies (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> for the description of the pertaining datasets used to this end). This results in a further notable improvement of prediction accuracy (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = 0.76; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030248-g002">Figure 2</xref>), suggesting that a considerable fraction of the variability in the datasets is due to experimental measurement errors (the improvement of the correlations observed upon averaging can also be due to the blurring of the effects of different posttranscriptional regulation processes taking place in the different conditions in which the measurements were done [temperature, strains, media, technique], but since we averaged over relatively similar conditions, we expect this effect to be relatively minor). In the following investigations reported in this paper, multiple independent measurements at the same conditions were not available, and the results reported are hence without pooling and averaging the data.</p><p>Examining the performance of our YEPD-trained predictor on a new unseen dataset of 238 genes whose protein abundance levels were measured under very different conditions (exposure to pheromone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b013">13</xref>]) resulted in a high correlation of <italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = 0.69. The correlation between mRNA levels solely and protein abundance levels was 0.62, in comparison. The standard deviation of 1,000 cross-validation runs of the predictor was 0.016, and the improvement compared to mRNA-based prediction was significant, with <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−16</sup>. Further information on the predictors' performance on specific Gene Ontology (GO) annotation gene sets is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030248-st002">Table S2</xref>. This table also shows that the predictor improves the prediction of protein abundance levels (compared to mRNA levels) in 92% of the GO annotation categories. Our predictor obtains higher correlations with protein abundance levels than using mRNA alone across numerous ranges of protein abundance; however, this correlation is not statistically significant in the lowest protein abundance range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030248-g002">Figure 2</xref>C).</p><p>Using our multivariate linear predictor, expression of genes whose products are members of the same complex (according to SGD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b021">21</xref>]) exhibits significantly higher coherency than when calculated from their corresponding mRNA levels. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030248-t001">Table 1</xref> displays the pertaining Spearman rank correlation coefficients for pairs of genes that are part of the same complex. For the cases of experimentally determined and predicted protein abundance levels, we also computed the partial correlations after controlling for the effect of mRNA expression levels (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). A similar, but weaker trend is also observed when examining the abundance coherency of protein pairs that exhibit a protein–protein interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030248-se002">Text S2</xref>). These results indicate that our prediction approach is likely to be more appropriate for proteins in large macromolecular complexes than for proteins involved in signaling and transcriptional control, since the latter are heavily posttranslationally modified. This notion is further supported by noting that in the highest protein abundance bin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030248-g002">Figure 2</xref>C), there are 26 genes that are related to the “Ribosome” GO category, providing a hyper-geometric enrichment of <italic>p</italic> &lt; 4.2 × 10<sup>−4</sup>.</p><table-wrap content-type="2col" id="pcbi-0030248-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030248.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficients and Partial Spearman Correlations between mRNA, Protein Abundance, and Predicted Protein Abundance Levels in YEPD and SD for Gene Pairs That Are Part of the Same Complex</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030248.t001" xlink:type="simple"/><!-- <table frame="hsides" rules="none"><colgroup><col id="tb1col1" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col2" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col3" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col4" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col5" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left"><hr/>Description</td><td><hr/>Correlation</td><td><hr/><italic>p</italic>-Value</td><td><hr/>Partial Correlation</td><td><hr/><italic>p</italic>-Value</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>YEPD, mRNA level</td><td>0.1378</td><td>6.31 &times; 10<sup>&minus;10</sup></td><td>&mdash;</td><td>&mdash;</td></tr><tr><td>YEPD, protein abundance</td><td>0.1908</td><td>&lt;10<sup>&minus;16</sup></td><td>0.1296</td><td>1.2 &times; 10<sup>&minus;8</sup></td></tr><tr><td>YEPD, predicted protein abundance</td><td>0.1897</td><td>&lt;10<sup>&minus;16</sup></td><td>0.1</td><td>4.5 &times; 10<sup>&minus;5</sup></td></tr><tr><td>SD, mRNA level</td><td>0.0863</td><td>5.5 &times; 10<sup>&minus;4</sup></td><td>&mdash;</td><td>&mdash;</td></tr><tr><td>SD, protein abundance</td><td>0.1758</td><td>1.4 &times; 10<sup>&minus;12</sup></td><td>0.1321</td><td>3.8 &times; 10<sup>&minus;7</sup></td></tr><tr><td>SD, predicted protein abundance</td><td>0.1487</td><td>2.3 &times; 10<sup>&minus;9</sup></td><td>0.0957</td><td>3.6 &times; 10<sup>&minus;4</sup></td></tr></tbody></table> --><!-- <table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><p>Measuring the coherency of expression levels of proteins that are part of the same complex or are interacting neighbors in the protein network.

It included 12 different conditions (six under low-shear and six controls) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b022">22</xref>]. To analyze this dataset, we clustered and bi-clustered the genes in the microarray data in accordance with the mRNA expression patterns, in a conventional manner. In parallel, we used our predictor to generate predicted protein abundance levels from the expression levels, and repeated the clustering and bi-clustering process on the resulting protein abundance data. We then compared the resulting cluster sets with respect to their functional enrichment in GO annotations (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). We performed a similar analysis on a gene expression dataset consisting of 36 timepoints taken from yeast cells growing in continuous, nutrient-limited conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b023">23</xref>] (the first dataset includes gene expression measurements of a system that is close to equilibrium, while the second includes gene expression measurements of a system in a transient state; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030248-se004">Text S4</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030248-t002">Table 2</xref> shows that the use of the predicted protein abundance values in these datasets results in a significant increase in the percentage of clusters that exhibit enrichment for specific GO terms (for comparison, random predictors significantly deteriorate the clustering enrichment scores; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030248-se005">Text S5</xref>). In the case of Sheehan's data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b022">22</xref>], the protein abundance predictor improved both the separation and the homogeneity. In the case of Tu's data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b023">23</xref>], the homogeneity improved while the separation score deteriorated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030248-t002">Table 2</xref>). A closer analysis provides evidence for the advantage of using the predictor: in the first dataset, a new bi-cluster is detected (cluster 4) in the protein abundance analysis that does not appear in the mRNA level analysis. This bi-cluster spans over 11 of the 12 conditions and is enriched with many GO annotations (mainly related to metabolism; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030248-st004">Table S4</xref>). Similarly, in the second dataset, cluster 7 in the predicted protein abundance analysis is a novel group that does not appear when analyzing mRNA levels. This cluster shows a striking periodic expression that coincides with the respiratory bursts observed under continuous nutrient-limited conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b023">23</xref>]. Thus, using predicted protein abundance levels, a simple conventional clustering method suffices to reveal novel central clusters that were not apparent in the original study at the mRNA expression level. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030248-st003">Tables S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030248-st004">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030248-st005">S5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030248-st006">S6</xref> provide a detailed analysis (list of clusters, bi-clusters, and GO enrichments) for the two datasets.</p><table-wrap content-type="2col" id="pcbi-0030248-t002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030248.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>The Percentage of GO-Enriched Clusters and the Percentage of GO-Enriched Bi-Clusters Obtained by Analyzing mRNA Levels or Predicted Protein Abundance Levels in Two Gene Expression Datasets, and the Total Homogeneity and Separation Scores for the Clustering Results</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030248.t002" xlink:type="simple"/><!-- <table frame="hsides" rules="none"><colgroup><col id="tb2col1" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb2col2" align="char" charoff="0" char="."/><col id="tb2col3" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb2col4" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb2col5" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left"><hr/>Dataset</td><td><hr/>Percentage Enriched Clusters</td><td><hr/>Homogeneity</td><td><hr/>Separation</td><td><hr/>Percentage Enriched Bi-Clusters</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Sheehan et al. &lsqb;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b022">22</xref>&rsqb; mRNA</td><td>57</td><td>0.77</td><td>&minus;0.58</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Sheehan et al. &lsqb;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b022">22</xref>&rsqb; predicted protein abundance</td><td>85</td><td>0.78</td><td>&minus;0.6</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Tu et al. &lsqb;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b023">23</xref>&rsqb; mRNA</td><td>85</td><td>0.68</td><td>&minus;0.28</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Tu et al. &lsqb;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b023">23</xref>&rsqb;predicted protein abundance</td><td>100</td><td>0.71</td><td>&minus;0.23</td><td>100</td></tr></tbody></table> --><!-- --></table-wrap><p>We used our protein abundance predictor to reanalyze the intriguing results reported by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b024">24</xref>], showing that only a very small fraction of the genes whose expression is significantly elevated under a specific condition actually cause a significant decrease in fitness when deleted. Overall, we find that the fraction of expressed genes that lead to a significant reduction in fitness when deleted is 2-fold to 3-fold higher than the corresponding fraction reported using mRNA levels (e.g., 2.9% versus 0.76% in the case of yeast cells responding to 1.5 M sorbitol, and 13.2% versus 6.4% in the case of 1 M NaCl). Although the absolute fraction of genes accounted for still remains small, the relative increase observed by using the predictor is substantial.</p><p>Finally, we tested our predictor's ability to correctly estimate protein abundance levels from mRNA expression data in a different organism, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe.</italic> To this end, we used mRNA and protein data from a recent genome-wide study that reported a Spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0.61 between the two measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b025">25</xref>]. Focusing on a subset of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. pombe</named-content> genes that have an ortholog in <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> the Spearman rank correlation of the predicted protein levels with actual protein abundance measurements was 0.675. Notably, for the same subset of genes, the Spearman rank correlation between the protein abundance and mRNA levels of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. pombe</named-content> was only 0.629 (and the rank correlation between the mRNA levels of the two organisms was 0.48). These results are quite remarkable, since the predictor used to predict protein abundance in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. pombe</named-content> was based on the ER and tAI values of the corresponding orthologs in <italic>S. cerevisiae.</italic></p><p>Like previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b026">26</xref>], we have also found a significant correlation between the abundance of a particular protein and the frequency of certain amino acids composing it, the most prominent being alanine and valine (positive correlation), and serine and aspargine (negative correlation; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030248-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). This observation has been previously attributed to the different values of the tAI (or the CAI) of these amino acids, which can modulate translation efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b017">17</xref>]. However, we find that even after controlling for the effect of their different tAIs, the frequency of these amino acids remains significantly correlated with protein abundance, and their frequency at abundant proteins remains highly significant (see partial correlations reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030248-g003">Figure 3</xref>, and similar results after controlling for CAI in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030248-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). The Spearman rank correlation of amino acid frequencies and protein abundance remains significant even after additionally controlling for the effect of mRNA expression levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030248-st007">Table S7</xref>). This finding suggests that in parallel to the adaptation occurring at the tRNA level via the codon bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b028">28</xref>], proteins do undergo a complementary adaptation at the amino acid level via amino acid substitution to further increase their protein abundance. The small, neutral, and nonpolar amino acid alanine is probably ideally suited for this putative substitute role, given its known neutral effect on protein stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b029">29</xref>]. Both alanine and valine are present at relatively high concentrations within the yeast cell, and their corresponding acyl-tRNA synthases are also expressed at high levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030248-st008">Table S8</xref>), aiding in their efficient incorporation during transcription (however, adding frequencies of amino acids to our predictor did not improve its performance significantly; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030248-se006">Text S6</xref>).</p><fig id="pcbi-0030248-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030248.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Partial Correlations between the Frequencies of Amino Acids Composing a Protein and Its Abundance Level (after Controlling for the Effect of tAI)</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030248.g003" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>The recent direct measurement of absolute protein levels under two distinct growth conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b005">5</xref>] enabled us to compare the ratio between the translation efficiency observed in cells grown on poor medium versus the one observed in rich medium, i.e., the relative TE (RTE; (<italic>p</italic>/<italic>m</italic>)<italic><sub>SD</sub></italic>/(<italic>p</italic>/<italic>m</italic>)<italic><sub>YEPD</sub></italic>). There is a significant negative correlation (−0.213; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−50</sup>) between the RTE and the change in transcription levels between the two growth conditions. Even when focusing only on genes that change their protein abundance between the two conditions in a considerable manner (protein abundance ratio &gt; 1.4 or &lt; 1/1.4), the resulting negative correlation remains significant (<italic>r</italic> = −0.08; <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). This may suggest that there is a global homeostasis between transcription and translation, with a tendency to increase translation when transcription decreases, and vice versa. The average RTE is 1.091 (about half the genes, 1,072 out of 2,204, have RTE &gt; 1). Since the relative decrease of the ribosomal protein abundance (<italic>p<sub>SD</sub></italic>/<italic>p<sub>YEPD</sub></italic> = 0.88) is higher than the total relative decrease of mRNA levels (<italic>m<sub>SD</sub></italic>/<italic>m<sub>YEPD</sub></italic> = 0.98), the number of ribosomes per mRNA is lower in SD. Thus, the findings of average RTE &gt; 1 are probably due to lower protein degradation rates or other causes of higher translation rates in SD, rather than increased ribosomes per mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030248-sg003">Figure S3</xref> depicts the mean RTE levels of different GO annotation groups; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030248-se007">Text S7</xref> displays the variance in protein abundance levels in the two growth conditions).</p><p>While the large majority of the genes have RTE levels ranging between 0.5 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030248-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), two sets have extreme RTE values, one with RTE &gt; 2.5 (48 genes), and the other with RTE &lt; 0.45 (65 genes; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030248-st009">Tables S9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030248-st010">S10</xref>). The distribution of mRNA and protein abundance levels of genes within each of these groups is similar to that of the rest of the genes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030248-sg004">Figure S4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030248-sg004">S4</xref>B), and extreme ratios of protein abundance or mRNA levels do not necessarily imply extreme RTE values (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030248-sg004">Figure S4</xref>C). Interestingly, our predictor obtains more significant improvement in the correlations with actual protein abundance levels on genes with extreme RTEs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030248-sg004">Figure S4</xref>D). In contrast to the inverse (homeostatic) relation observed in general, the set with extremely high RTE also exhibits extremely high <italic>m<sub>SD</sub></italic>/<italic>m<sub>YEPD</sub></italic> ratios (an average mRNA ratio of 5.35, 14 times the general average). This indicates that the extreme RTE values reflect the fact that the cell is making a concerted effort to maintain their protein abundance levels at the extreme levels needed. By the same token, the mean mRNA ratio for the set with extremely low RTE is 0.36, somewhat below the total average.</p><p>The group of genes exhibiting extremely high RTE levels is enriched for mitochondrial genes (21/48 are mitochondrial genes; chi-square <italic>p</italic> = 10<sup>−16</sup>), with many of these genes being related to mitochondrial biosynthesis and metabolism. Thus, the increase in the level of mitochondrial proteins, reflecting the need for higher-yield energy production in poor growth conditions, is achieved mainly by boosting translation efficiency. Interestingly, the high RTE group is also enriched with genes that map very close to origins of replication (autonomously replicating sequence [ARS]), including four genes abutting at the origin of replication (out of a total of 24 genes with a similar location in the yeast genome, providing a chi-square <italic>p</italic> = 1.1 × 10<sup>−6</sup>), and twice the expected number of genes located within 1 kbp from an ARS (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030248-g004">Figure 4</xref>). A possible explanation for this intriguing connection is that the replication machinery, when binding to origins of replication, attenuates transcription, either by steric hindrance or by competition for DNA binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b030">30</xref>]. This interference is then compensated in turn by higher translation efficiency and a more flexible regulation of translation, as reflected by its high RTE levels. Indeed, the average <italic>m<sub>SD</sub></italic> /<italic>m<sub>YEPD</sub></italic> ratios of genes that have extremely high RTE and that are less than 1 kb from an ARS is only 0.8. One putative mechanism that may underlie this intriguing phenomenon is that certain proteins that participate in replication and transcription (e.g., Rap1 and Abs1) could be incorporated into the mRNA, exported from the nucleus, and differentially affect the rate of translation at the ribosome. Similar mechanisms have been suggested for the activity of proteins such as Yra1, Sub2, and the THO complex, which affect transcription, splicing efficiency, and nuclear export [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b031">31</xref>].</p><fig id="pcbi-0030248-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030248.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>The Distribution of Genes with High RTEs at Different Distances from Origins of Replication</title><p>The distribution of genes with high RTE (RTE &gt; 2.5), and distribution of all genes at different distances from origins of replication.

Combining several protein features yields a predictor of protein abundance that can serve as a useful tool for analyzing gene expression measurements. Our results indicate that highly expressed proteins undergo adaptation at the amino acid level, and that proximity to an origin of replication enhances the efficiency of translation.</p><p>Translation efficiency is determined by invariant, condition-independent factors such as the amino acid and codon composition of the protein and the availability of the different tRNAs. It is also modulated by dynamic factors such as ribosome occupancy and ribosome density (determining the total number of ribosomes per mRNA), which are dependent on environmental clues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b010">10</xref>]. Assuming that TE is constant to a first approximation for most genes (as its levels across poor and rich media testifies), this study has focused on the first group of factors, and has shown the utility of such a predictor in interpreting biological data. We anticipate that as information gradually accumulates concerning the second group of factors, more accurate protein abundance predictors will emerge that can incorporate information on posttranscriptional regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b034">34</xref>]. Recent work has suggested that transcription factors and signaling genes tend to be posttranscriptionally regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b032">32</xref>]. Indeed, a large proportion of the genes with extreme RTE levels belong to these two categories (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030248-st009">Tables S9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030248-st010">S13</xref>). However, not all genes regulated at the posttranscriptional level exhibit extreme RTE values: a recent genome-wide study in yeast has identified 16 genes with extreme TE levels, presumably regulated posttranscriptionally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b009">9</xref>]. Examination of the RTE levels of these genes reveals that only one has extreme RTE levels (<italic>MET6,</italic> with RTE = 0.47); the rest have RTE levels between 0.93 and 1.38 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030248-st013">Table S13</xref>). Finally, protein degradation and turnover are obviously important modulators of protein abundance, and should be considered in future predictors as pertaining reliable data accumulates. That said, it is interesting and encouraging to see how far one can go in predicting protein abundance levels even without this information.</p><p>An important corollary of our work is that gene expression results obtained with DNA microarray technology may in some cases be misleading. For example, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030248-st011">Tables S11</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030248-st012">S12</xref> include a subset of genes that exhibit inversely correlated regulatory trends at the transcription versus the translation level. An increase in mRNA expression levels of a particular gene does not necessarily mean a higher level of its protein. The corresponding protein abundance could not be differentially expressed or could even be differentially expressed but in the opposite direction. As <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030248-st011">Tables S11</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030248-st012">S12</xref> include about 5% of the yeast genes, this type of error may be nonnegligible at times. Our predictor cannot solve this problem; its solution will probably require much larger biological datasets than those currently available.</p><p>We demonstrated that our predictor (which is based on <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content>) can be used to successfully predict protein abundance levels in a different organism (<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. pombe</named-content>), which has an evolutionary distance of 350–1,000 million y from <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b035">35</xref>]. It will be interesting to examine the effect that evolutionary distance may have on determining the “transferability” of protein predictors across species. However, answers to this question will need to wait until protein abundance data of additional organisms becomes available.</p><p>Building on the existing large-scale protein abundance data, this study has shown that a predictor of protein abundance levels can improve the interpretation of gene expression measurements and provide new insights into the regulation and evolution of protein translation.

The second dataset includes the 36 samples from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b023">23</xref>]. Clustering and bi-clustering was performed by using the Expander program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b040">40</xref>]. We used CLICK for clustering and SAMBA for bi-clustering.

For each of the two cases (mRNA levels and predicted protein abundance), we used five measurements of expression levels and four measurements of fitness. We focused on the set of genes for which we had all the predictor's features. In the case of fitness profiling, a gene was considered “significant” if it had significant value (as defined in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030248-b024">24</xref>]) in at least one of the four fitness measurements.
