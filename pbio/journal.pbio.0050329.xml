        <p>Transcription factors act in concert to induce lineage commitment towards Th1, Th2, or T regulatory (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells, and their counter-regulatory mechanisms were shown to be critical for polarization between Th1 and Th2 phenotypes. FOXP3 is an essential transcription factor for natural, thymus-derived (nT<sub>reg</sub>) and inducible T<sub>reg</sub> (iT<sub>reg</sub>) commitment; however, the mechanisms regulating its expression are as yet unknown. We describe a mechanism controlling iT<sub>reg</sub> polarization, which is overruled by the Th2 differentiation pathway. We demonstrated that interleukin 4 (IL-4) present at the time of T cell priming inhibits FOXP3. This inhibitory mechanism was also confirmed in Th2 cells and in T cells of transgenic mice overexpressing GATA-3 in T cells, which are shown to be deficient in transforming growth factor (TGF)-β–mediated FOXP3 induction. This inhibition is mediated by direct binding of GATA3 to the FOXP3 promoter, which represses its transactivation process. Therefore, this study provides a new understanding of tolerance development, controlled by a type 2 immune response. IL-4 treatment in mice reduces iT<sub>reg</sub> cell frequency, highlighting that therapeutic approaches that target IL-4 or GATA3 might provide new preventive strategies facilitating tolerance induction particularly in Th2-mediated diseases, such as allergy.</p>

          <p>Specific immune responses against foreign or autologous antigens are driven by specialized epitope-specific T cells, whose numbers expand upon recognition of antigen found on professional antigen-presenting cells. The subsequent maturation process involves the differentiation of certain T cell phenotypes such as pro-inflammatory cells (Th1, Th2, Th17) or regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells, which serve to keep the immune response in check. The current study focuses on the role of two key transcription factors—FOXP3 and GATA3—in controlling the commitment of these cells. We demonstrate that the Th2 cytokine IL-4 inhibits the induction of FOXP3 and thus inhibits the generation of inducible T<sub>reg</sub> cells. We show that IL-4–induced GATA3 mediates FOXP3 inhibition by directly binding to a GATA element in the FOXP3 promoter. We hypothesize that therapeutic agents aimed at neutralizing IL-4 could be a novel strategy to facilitate inducible T<sub>reg</sub> cell generation and thus promotion of tolerance in allergies and other Th2-dominated diseases.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Effective immune responses are characterized by T cell activation, which directs adaptive and innate immune responses to kill pathogens efficiently. Dependent on the pathogen, T cells differentiate into different subtypes, such as Th1 or Th2 cells, which are most efficient in defeating microbial or parasitic invaders respectively. A hallmark of Th1 and Th2 differentiation pathways is the exclusiveness of the individual phenotype leading to either Th1 or Th2, but not to mixed populations. The exclusiveness of this mechanism is provided by a polarization process, where Th2 differentiation inhibits Th1 commitment and vice versa. Specifically interleukin 4 (IL-4)–induced STAT6 and GATA3 inhibit differentiation into Th1 cells in the early phase of commitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b002">2</xref>]. GATA3 is sufficient to induce a Th2 phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b003">3</xref>] and acts not only through the induction of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, the Th2 cytokines, but also through the inhibition of Th1 cell-specific factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b003">3</xref>]. Recently, it was shown that T-bet directly modulates GATA3 function, suggesting that transcription factors compete in the early differentiation phase of T cells, potentially integrating environmental signals to finally imprint the T cell phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b005">5</xref>]. A GATA3-dominated immune response has been shown to be essential in airway hyperresonsiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b006">6</xref>] and IL-4–dominated responses can break antigen-specific immune tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b007">7</xref>]. Overexpression of a dominant negative form of GATA3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b008">8</xref>] or treatment with antisense-mediated GATA3 blockade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b009">9</xref>] decreased the severity of the allergic airway hyper-responsiveness.</p>
      <p>The discovery of regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells highlights another phenotype of T cells, which is essential for tolerance against self-antigens. Naturally occurring, thymus-derived T<sub>reg</sub> (nT<sub>reg</sub>) cells are generated in the thymus and are assumed to protect against the activity of autoreactive T cells in the periphery. These cells express the forkhead transcription factor FOXP3 and constitutively express CD25 on their surface, but they lack expression of Th1 or Th2 cytokines. Particularly interesting are those T<sub>reg</sub> cells that are generated in the periphery and thus are potential targets for therapeutic interventions. These induced T<sub>reg</sub> (iT<sub>reg</sub>) cells were reported to express FOXP3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b010">10</xref>]. The exact mechanisms of iT<sub>reg</sub> generation are unclear, but T cell receptor (TCR) triggering has been shown to induce FOXP3 expression and suppressive cells in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b012">12</xref>], however the phenotype appears to be of transient nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b014">14</xref>]. TGF-β has been demonstrated to be important for the persistent induction of these cells in vitro and in vivo, since animals lacking the TGF-βRII on T cells have fewer peripherally iT<sub>reg</sub> cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b015">15</xref>] and suffer from a T cell–dependent multiorgan inflammatory disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b016">16</xref>]. Although the effect of TGF-β on natural and inducible T<sub>reg</sub> cell induction has been demonstrated repeatedly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b017">17</xref>], its molecular mechanisms remain to be identified.</p>
      <p>The current study provides evidence that GATA3 and FOXP3 play a competitive role in iT<sub>reg</sub> cell commitment as T-bet and GATA3 for Th1 and Th2 differentiation, respectively. We show that GATA3 inhibits FOXP3 induction and that IL-4 limits FOXP3 expression in a GATA3-mediated way, both in vitro and in vivo. We also show that GATA3 directly binds to the FOXP3 promoter and thereby prevents the induction of this gene, demonstrating that Th2 differentiation overrules iT<sub>reg</sub> induction.</p>

        <title>FOXP3 Induction in T Cell Subsets</title>
        <p>It is assumed that FOXP3 expression can be induced in nonregulatory T cells, which is an important step in iT<sub>reg</sub> cell differentiation. However, it is not known if all CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells have the same capacity to express FOXP3. To investigate whether FOXP3 can be expressed by any T cell subset or if expression is restricted to a distinct lineage, FOXP3 mRNA expression was analyzed in freshly isolated T cells such as CD25-depleted CD4<sup>+</sup> cells, CD45RA<sup>+</sup> naive or CD45RO<sup>+</sup> memory T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), as well as T cells driven in vitro toward Th1, Th2, or iT<sub>reg</sub> phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g001">Figure 1</xref>B; phenotype on <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050329-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). The CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>–</sup>, CD45RA<sup>+</sup>, CD45RO<sup>+</sup>, and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD45RO<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>–</sup> were able to significantly induce FOXP3 mRNA up to 30-fold upon TCR activation and addition of TGF-β. Th1 cells showed only a 10-fold increase. In contrast, Th2 cells stimulated under the same conditions did not increase FOXP3 expression. The in vitro generated iT<sub>reg</sub> cells were unable to further up-regulate FOXP3, which was already at high levels under the resting conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, right panel).</p>

        <p>Th2 cells are known to produce IL-4 upon activation, which may interact with TGF-β signaling and thus prevent FOXP3 induction. However, the neutralization of IL-4 with a blocking IL-4 antibody did not rescue FOXP3 expression in the differentiated Th2 cells (unpublished data). These data demonstrated that Th2 cells have a limited capacity to express FOXP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). The inability of Th2 cells to express FOXP3 was also documented at the single-cell level, confirming that Th2 cells lack FOXP3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Only iT<sub>reg</sub> cells expressed FOXP3 in resting conditions. Interestingly, we observed that resting iT<sub>reg</sub> cells express FOXP3 but show low CD25 surface expression. Repeated exposure to TGF-β did not further increase the FOXP3 expression in the iT<sub>reg</sub> lineage but transiently induced FOXP3 expression in Th1 cells. Naturally occurring Th2 cells such as CRTH2<sup>+</sup> T cells, T cells isolated according to their IL-4 secretion, or an IL-4–producing T cell clone (BR8) were also lacking FOXP3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Furthermore TGF-β–mediated FOXP3 induction failed in these cells in contrast to the naive T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Because IL-4 is the key Th2 cytokine, the expression of IL-4 and FOXP3 in freshly isolated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). IL-4–expressing cells were most abundant among CD45RO<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>–</sup> cells, which did not co-express FOXP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, left panel). In contrast, CD45RO<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> cells abundantly expressed FOXP3, while lacking IL-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, right panel). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g003">Figure 3</xref>B, the frequency of the IL-4<sup>+</sup> cells was always below 1% in the FOXP3<sup>+</sup> cells close to the background. The IL-4<sup>+</sup> cells were confined to the FOXP3<sup>–</sup> cells, as shown for the CD45RO<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>–</sup>, CD45RO<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>, and CD45RO<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+high</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). In addition, neither the Th2 clone (BR8) nor CRTH2 cells significantly expressed FOXP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). Cells enriched for their IL-4 secretion using the magnetic cell isolation technology contained some FOXP3-expressing cells, but importantly, the expression did not overlap. Taken together, these data indicate that FOXP3 was not expressed by Th2 cells and was not inducible in those cells.</p>

        <title>FOXP3 and GATA3 Kinetics in Differentiating Cells</title>
        <p>The limited capacity of differentiated effector cells to induce FOXP3 expression suggests that iT<sub>reg</sub> induction has to occur before effector T cell differentiation occurs. Therefore, we analyzed the expression of FOXP3 and GATA3 during the differentiation of naive CD4 T cells into Th0 (neutral, anti-IL-4, anti-IFN-γ, and anti IL-12), Th2, and iT<sub>reg</sub> phenotypes. After initiation of the differentiation process, FOXP3 and GATA3 showed a similar expression kinetic within the first 3 d, which are considered to be critical in T cell commitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b018">18</xref>]. Under Th2 differentiation conditions, FOXP3 mRNA expression increased only marginally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g004">Figure 4</xref>A, left panel). Thus, although GATA3 and FOXP3 showed similar kinetics, their expression polarizes at the end of the differentiation process when cells were cultured towards Th2 or iT<sub>reg</sub> cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g004">4</xref>B). Interestingly, the Th0 cells were expressing more FOXP3 than the Th2 cells, but expressed low levels of GATA3; however, the protein expression slightly differed from mRNA expression, suggesting also posttranslational regulation and degradation as potential additional mechanisms in the differentiation process. The phenotype of iT<sub>reg</sub> cells included an anergic phenotype upon anti-CD3 re-stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050329-sg001">Figure S1</xref>A), CD103, CTLA-4, GITR, and PD-1 surface expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050329-sg001">Figure S1</xref>B). On the single-cell level, it can be seen that cells progress through a transition phase, where GATA3 and FOXP3 expression coexist to some degree in the same cells, which is resolved in iT<sub>reg</sub> cells after 7 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Taken together, these data demonstrated that Th2 cells have lost their capacity to express FOXP3 and showed that Th2 and iT<sub>reg</sub> cells arise from two different differentiation pathways.</p>

        <title>IL-4 Inhibits TGF-β-Mediated iT<sub>reg</sub> Commitment</title>
        <p>IL-4 induces differentiation of naive T cells, upon antigen encounter, into the Th2 cell lineage. We therefore asked whether IL-4 is able to inhibit TGF-β induction of FOXP3 during the priming of naive T cells. Human CD4<sup>+</sup>CD45RA<sup>+</sup> T cells were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3/CD28 in the presence of TGF-β and/or IL-4 and harvested after 5 d. IL-4 efficiently repressed the TGF-β–mediated induction of FOXP3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g005">Figure 5</xref>A) in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). Low levels of GATA3 were induced also in the absence of IL-4, as it was previously observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b003">3</xref>]. However, at low concentration, IL-4 was able to marginally induce FOXP3 expression. Of note, GATA3 was also induced in the presence of TGF-β at high IL-4 concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g005">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g005">5</xref>B). The IL-4–mediated prevention of FOXP3 expression was not caused by interferences of the receptor signaling, because the phosphorylation of SMAD2 or STAT6 was not affected by the addition of IL-4 and/or TGF-β, which demonstrates that IL-4 as well as TGF-β signaling were functional under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). Increasing amounts of IL-4 increase intracellular GATA3, whereas FOXP3 decreased, which is consistent with the mRNA analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). Furthermore, injection of IL-4 into wild-type B6 mice decreased the inducible or natural T<sub>reg</sub> number in vivo. A distinction of the T<sub>reg</sub> subsets is not possible, because recently activated iT<sub>reg</sub> cells also express surface CD25. We used complexes of recombinant mouse IL-4 (rmIL-4) plus anti-IL-4 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which have been shown to dramatically increase the potency of the cytokine in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b019">19</xref>]. In these mice, the percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> and FOXP3<sup>+</sup> T cells dramatically decreased when the antibody-cytokine immune complexes were injected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050329-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Upon administration of rmIL-4 plus anti-IL-4 mAb complexes, the total number of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cell, as well as the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells diminished by half (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050329-sg002">Figure S2</xref>G and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050329-sg002">S2</xref>H), confirming that the lower percentage was not due to an increase in the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>–</sup> cells, but a real decrease of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells. In conclusion, IL-4 negatively regulates the natural or inducible T<sub>reg</sub> cell turnover not only in vitro but also in vivo. To study the effects of IL-4 on already-existing human natural or inducible T<sub>reg</sub> cells, we exposed sorted CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells (nT<sub>reg</sub> cells) to IL-4 and analyzed FOXP3 expression and suppressive capacity. In already-existing T<sub>reg</sub> cells, IL-4 failed to inhibit FOXP3 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050329-sg003">Figure S3</xref>A), and the suppressive capacity was not altered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050329-sg003">Figure S3</xref>C). Similarly pre-existing iT<sub>reg</sub> cells did not decrease FOXP3 expression upon IL-4 exposure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050329-sg003">Figure S3</xref>B).</p>

        <title>The Role of TGF-β in T Cell Differentiation</title>
        <p>Although TGF-β–reduced CD25, IL-4 expression, and CD25 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g006">Figure 6</xref>B), IL-4 significantly inhibited TGF-β–mediated induction of FOXP3 in naive T cells driven toward FOXP3<sup>+</sup> T cells, as shown by FACS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). It is known that IL-4 is a potent growth factor and may therefore favor the proliferation of FOXP3<sup>–</sup> cells and thus decrease the relative percentage of FOXP3<sup>+</sup> cells. However, analysis of cell division kinetics by CFSE-labeling demonstrated that IL-4 did not differentially promote cell growth of FOXP3<sup>+</sup> over that of FOXP3<sup>–</sup>. In fact both populations showed similarly enhanced proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). Furthermore the TGF-β–mediated induction of FOXP3 expression was not caused by overgrowth of a CD25<sup>–</sup>FOXP3<sup>+</sup> minority, since the number of FOXP3<sup>+</sup> cells was low/absent in the purified CD4<sup>+</sup>CD45RA<sup>+</sup> T cells (between 0% and 1%), and the FOXP3<sup>+</sup> cells were not confined to the highly divided cells.

In line with the previous findings, the IL-4–producing cells and the FOXP3 expressing cells are nonoverlapping populations. Since FOXP3 is known to act as a repressor of cytokine expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b020">20</xref>], we therefore analyzed GATA3 and FOXP3 expression. The expression kinetic of naive T cells exposed to IL-4 and TGF-β demonstrated that GATA3 and FOXP3 are initially found in separate populations (day 2), but transiently co-express both factors (days 4–8), before establishing separate populations at the end of the differentiation process (day 10; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g006">Figure 6</xref>C), suggesting that GATA3 inhibits the development of iT<sub>reg</sub> cells by repressing FOXP3.</p>
        <p>These results showed that IL-4 acts in vitro as an inhibitor of FOXP3 expression, without interfering with TGF-β signaling, probably acting at the level of transcription factors, and possibly by a GATA3-dependent mechanism.</p>

        <title>GATA3 Is a Negative Regulator of FOXP3 Expression</title>
        <p>FOXP3 expression decreased once GATA3 expression is high; therefore, we hypothesized a potential role for GATA3 in repressing FOXP3. Besides GATA3′s well-known positive effect on gene regulation, GATA3′s repressive capabilities were previously shown to restrict Th1 commitment by inhibiting STAT4 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b021">21</xref>], and therefore GATA3 prevents differentiation into Th1 cells. To investigate whether GATA3 can directly inhibit FOXP3 induction, we transduced GATA3 or a truncated GATA3 lacking the DNA-binding domain in human primary CD4<sup>+</sup>CD45RA<sup>+</sup> T cells using a TAT-fused, recombinantly expressed GATA3. After transduction, the cells were activated with soluble anti-CD3/CD28 in the presence or absence of TGF-β. TAT-GATA3 was successfully transduced in a homogeneous and dose-dependent manner into human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g007">Figure 7</xref>A, upper panel). TAT-GATA3 reduced FOXP3 expression in a dose-dependent manner, whereas a DNA-binding domain truncated version (TAT-ΔDBD-GATA3) did not affect FOXP3 expression as compared with expression in untransduced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). In addition, we analyzed the inhibitory effect of GATA3 on FOXP3 in transgenic DO11.10 mice, constitutively overexpressing GATA3 under the control of the CD2 locus control region (DO11.10xCD2-GATA3). The thymic selection into the CD4 lineage is largely intact in DO11.10xCD2-GATA3 (RW Hendriks, unpublished data). These mice develop lymphomas at an older age, but signs of autoimmune disease were not described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b022">22</xref>].

The naive CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>–</sup> cells were Foxp3<sup>–</sup> (unpublished data). As described for the human cells, TGF-β dramatically up-regulated Foxp3 in the DO11.10 littermate control mice. In contrast, cells from the CD2-GATA3xDO11.10 mice showed dramatically reduced Foxp3 expression when activated with TGF-β and OVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g007">Figure 7</xref>B).

        <title>GATA3 Represses the FOXP3 Promoter</title>
        <p>To investigate the molecular mechanism of GATA3-mediated repression of human FOXP3, the human FOXP3 promoter was studied and a palindromic binding site for GATA3 was discovered. The GATA-binding site is located 303 bp upstream from the transcription start site (TSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b024">24</xref>]. This site is highly conserved between humans, mice, and rats (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050329-sg004">Figure S4</xref>) and may therefore play an important role in FOXP3 regulation. The functional relevance of this site was studied using a FOXP3-promoter construct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b024">24</xref>]. We transfected human primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, in vitro differentiated Th2 cells, and Jurkat cells (Jurkat cells are known to constitutively express GATA3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b026">26</xref>]), and we measured FOXP3 promoter activity. The promoter was not active in the GATA3-expressing cell line Jurkat or in the in vitro-differentiated Th2 cells, whereas the construct was active in the CD4 cells, which express a lower amount of GATA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g008">Figure 8</xref>A). Overexpression of GATA3 in naive T cells diminished luciferase activity of the FOXP3 promoter compared with the control vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g008">Figure 8</xref>B). To further address the function of the GATA3 site, we inserted a site-specific mutation deleting the GATA3-binding site. This mutation increased luciferase activity by 3-fold in memory CD4<sup>+</sup>CD45RO<sup>+</sup> T cells, whereas no difference was observed in naive (GATA3<sup>–</sup>) CD4<sup>+</sup>CD45RA<sup>+</sup> T cells, revealing a repressor activity of GATA3 on the FOXP3 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g008">Figure 8</xref>C). Furthermore GATA3 binds directly to the FOXP3 promoter as investigated by pull-down assay. HEK cells were transiently transfected with GATA3 or a control vector, and increasing amounts of lysates were incubated with oligonucleotides containing the GATA3 site of the FOXP3 promoter or a control oligonucleotide with a mutated GATA3-binding site. After the pull-down, GATA3 binding was detected by Western blot. Similarly, GATA3-expressing Th2 cells and iT<sub>reg</sub> cells were subjected to this approach. Only HEK cells overexpressing GATA3 and Th2 cells showed GATA3-binding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g008">Figure 8</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g008">8</xref>E). These experiments demonstrated that GATA3 binds the palindromic FOXP3 promoter. To gain insights into the in vivo situation, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using an anti-GATA3 antibody and showed that GATA3 binds to the FOXP3 promoter region in Th2 cells, but not in iT<sub>reg</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g007">Figure 7</xref>F). Taken together these data demonstrate that the GATA3-binding to the FOXP3 promoter is repressing FOXP3 expression.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The current study reveals that FOXP3 induction, an important step in iT<sub>reg</sub> commitment, is inhibited by GATA3, which is the key regulator for polarization toward Th2 cells. After differentiation, the effector Th2 cells become refractory to conversion into a FOXP3<sup>+</sup> phenotype.</p>
      <p>In accordance with other studies, we found that CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>–</sup> cells were able to up-regulate FOXP3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b027">27</xref>]. Already-committed cells such as memory T cells and Th1 cells showed only moderate and transient FOXP3 induction, which is not sufficient to change the phenotype toward a regulatory T cell profile. In contrast, naive T cells could efficiently up-regulate FOXP3 when treated with TGF-β to induce iT<sub>reg</sub> cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b034">34</xref>], suggesting that FOXP3 plays an important role in the early differentiation process and may act in a way similar to that known for the Th1/Th2 decision factors T-bet and GATA3. This commitment is characterized by competitive expression of these factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b036">36</xref>], which we also observed in differentiating FOXP3<sup>+</sup> iT<sub>reg</sub> cells including a phase of co-expression, which turns into nonoverlapping expression upon completed differentiation. In this competitive process TGF-β appeared to be mandatory for the induction of FOXP3, possibly by keeping the expression of GATA3 and T-bet low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b038">38</xref>]. In contrast, differentiating naive T cells in the absence of polarization factors (Th0) such as IL-4, IL-12, or TGF-β showed only a transient FOXP3 expression and failed to generate a population of FOXP3-expressing cells, but GATA3 and T-bet were up-regulated (unpublished data). Interestingly, as we and others previously described, FOXP3-promoting factors, such as dexamethasone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b039">39</xref>], CTLA-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b040">40</xref>], and estrogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b041">41</xref>], are also known as inhibitors of GATA3 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b045">45</xref>]. Therefore GATA3 not only induces differentiation into Th2 cells but also inhibits FOXP3 expression and commitment into iT<sub>reg</sub> cells.</p>
      <p>The Th2 cytokine IL-4 but not IL-13 (unpublished data) was able to inhibit TGF-β–mediated FOXP3 induction and therefore prevented conversion into the regulatory phenotype. To prove the inhibitory effect of IL-4 on inducible or natural T<sub>reg</sub> commitment in vivo, we treated mice with IL-4 and anti-IL-4. This has been shown to increase the effect of the cytokine in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b019">19</xref>]. Only the IL-4/IL-4 mAb complex resulted in a decrease of the amount of natural or inducible T<sub>reg</sub> (CD25<sup>+</sup> and Foxp3<sup>+</sup>) cells 7 d after treatment. Our results suggest that IL-4 is only interfering with the differentiation of naive T cells into iT<sub>reg</sub> cells. But since a distinction of nT<sub>reg</sub> and iT<sub>reg</sub> cells is currently not possible, because iT<sub>reg</sub> cells also transiently express CD25 after activation, we cannot exclude that IL-4 may also inhibit Foxp3 expression in nT<sub>reg</sub> cells in vivo or that additional effects may contribute to the observed drop in Foxp3 expression. IL-4 has already been shown to negatively regulate the development of naive T cells into Th1 or the IL-17–producing T cells (Th17) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b047">47</xref>]. Similar effects have been recently described for IL-6, which, combined with TGF-β, inhibits the generation of iT<sub>reg</sub> cells and induces differentiation into the Th17 cells by an unknown mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b049">49</xref>]. Thus the polarization into iT<sub>reg</sub> cells is negatively regulated by the effector cytokines IL-4 and IL-6.</p>
      <p>IL-4 has been previously shown to induce the generation of FOXP3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells out of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>–</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b050">50</xref>]. In those experiments, the concentrations of IL-4 used were low, and as we also observed, IL-4 at low concentration slightly enhanced FOXP3 expression. Importantly, these concentrations were not sufficient to induce GATA3 expression. IL-4 may favor proliferation of nT<sub>reg</sub> cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b047">47</xref>] or directly regulate FOXP3 expression in a STAT-dependent fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b051">51</xref>].</p>
      <p>Since IL-13 does not effectively reduce FOXP3 and fails to induce GATA3, we hypothesized that the IL-4–dependent inhibition of FOXP3 could be mediated by GATA3. In fact, GATA3-inducing IL-4 concentrations repressed TGF-β–mediated FOXP3 expression, whereas IL-4 as well as TGF-β signaling were intact. This result suggested a competitive mechanism between GATA3 and FOXP3 transcription factors in determining lineage commitment during the early phase of differentiation. Accordingly, we investigated naturally high GATA3-expressing cells and confirmed the absence of FOXP3. Protein transduction of GATA3 into naive T cells inhibited FOXP3 induction in human, differentiating, naive T cells. This inhibitory effect of GATA3 was further confirmed in BALB/c transgenic mice, expressing GATA3 in T cells (DO11.10:CD2-GATA3 transgenic mice). In line with the transient overexpression of GATA3 in human T cells, cells of these mice failed to induce FOXP3 expression upon exposure with antigen in the presence of TGF-β. Strikingly, the DO11.10:CD2-GATA3 mice do have peripheral FOXP3<sup>+</sup> cells, which however displayed a 10%–25% lower frequency compared to wild-type DO11.10 mice. Thus GATA3 restrains the development of certain T<sub>reg</sub> subsets, presumably the inducible, peripheral population and not those of thymic origin. Thymic T cells undergo a different maturation process, which may explain the insensitivity of nT<sub>reg</sub> to GATA3 overexpression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b052">52</xref>]. In contrast to the Th2-differentiating and iT<sub>reg</sub>-inhibiting function of GATA3 in peripheral T cells, GATA3 acts in the thymus together with other transcription factors such as the <italic>Repressor of GATA3</italic> (ROG) in the differentiation process toward CD8 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b054">54</xref>] or participates in complex transcriptional feedback network to regulate sympathoadrenal differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b055">55</xref>]. Therefore, the role of GATA3 appears to be tissue specific and cannot be generalized.</p>
      <p>Our study demonstrates that GATA3 repressed FOXP3 expression directly by binding to the FOXP3 promoter region. A palindromic GATA-site is located 303 bp upstream of the TSS in a highly conserved region, which we have previously identified as the FOXP3 promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b024">24</xref>]. Site-specific mutation of this site increased the activity of the promoter constructs, thus revealing the repressive nature of this GATA element in memory T cells, which naturally express GATA3, whereas no difference was seen in naive T cells, which do not express GATA3. This palindromic GATA element is bound by GATA3 protein as proven with pull-down experiments. Furthermore, it is shown by ChIP that GATA3 binds this element also in intact cells. It is known that GATA3 can induce transcription by chromatin remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b056">56</xref>], by directly transactivating promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b036">36</xref>], or, as shown in the current study, acts as a repressor of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b057">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b059">59</xref>]. Therefore keeping GATA3 expression low might be required to induce efficient FOXP3<sup>+</sup> iT<sub>reg</sub> cell generation.</p>
      <p>The molecular interactions enabling GATA3 to inhibit FOXP3 are not identified yet, but the GATA-binding site is located adjacent to positive, inducing sites, composed of AP-1-NFATc2 sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b024">24</xref>], and GATA3 may compete with the binding of AP-1/NFAT to the promoter (unpublished observations).</p>
      <p>In summary, we demonstrated that FOXP3 is negatively regulated by cytokines such as IL-4. GATA3 acts as an inhibitor of FOXP3 expression in early T cell differentiation, as well as in differentiated Th2 cells by directly binding and repressing the FOXP3 promoter. We therefore describe a new mechanism of how Il-4 avoids tolerance induction by repressing FOXP3 expression. These findings will give new perspectives toward understanding molecular mechanisms of iT<sub>reg</sub> induction and thus pathways of peripheral tolerance induction, particularly in allergy and asthma.</p>

The lysates were incubated with 10 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Sigma) and 70 μl of streptavidin-agarose (Amersham Biosciences) carrying biotinylated oligonucleotides, for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice with buffer C:D (1:3) and resuspended in DTT-containing loading buffer (NuPAGE; Invitrogen), heated to 70 °C for 10 min, and the eluants on a NuPAGE 4–12% bis-tris gel (Invitrogen). The proteins were electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and detected using an anti-GATA3 mAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Accumulated signals were analyzed using AIDA software (Raytest).</p>

          <p>B6 mice were given every other day ip injections of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), recombinant mouse IL-4 (rmIL-4), anti-IL-4 mAb (anti-IL-4 mAb, 11B11, or MAB404), or a mixture of rmIL-4 plus anti-IL-4 mAbs (11B11 or MAB404). Mice were analyzed on day 7 by flow cytometry for CD3, CD4, and CD25 expression. Shown is CD25 versus CD4 expression in CD3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> spleen cells (A–F). Numbers indicate percentages of CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>high</sup> CD3<sup>+</sup> cells. Total cell counts (G) of CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>high</sup> cells in spleen from mice in (A–F) are shown as mean ± SD. The data are representative of three independent experiments.</p>

          <p>(A) CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>high</sup> nT<sub>reg</sub> cells were FACS-sorted and activated with plate-bound anti-CD3/CD28 plus IL-2 during 3 d and in the presence or absence of IL-4 (100 ng/ml) and harvested for real-time PCR analysis. The results shown represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments.</p>
          <p>(B) iT<sub>reg</sub> cells were induced in vitro. FOXP3 espression was assessed by real-time PCR analysis in resting cells, in cells re-stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3/CD28, with or without TGF-β, plus IL-2 during 3 d and in the presence (black bar) or absence (white bar) of IL-4 (100 ng/ml).</p>
          <p>(C) Activation dramatically increases CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells suppressive capacity of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> nT<sub>reg</sub> cells. CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> nT<sub>reg</sub> cells were preactivated during 2 d in the presence or absence of an increasing IL-4 concentration. After vigorous washing, their suppressive capacity on responder CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>−</sup> was tested. IL-4 pretreatment did not affect the suppressive capacity of FACS-sorted CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>high</sup> cells. 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> nT<sub>reg</sub> cells were added to 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>–</sup> and 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> irradiated PBMCs.
