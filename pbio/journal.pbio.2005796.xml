<abstract>
<p>Aging is characterized by degeneration of unique tissues. However, dissecting the interconnectedness of tissue aging remains a challenge. Here, we employ a muscle-specific DNA damage model in <italic>Drosophila</italic> to reveal secreted factors that influence systemic aging in distal tissues. Utilizing this model, we uncovered a cytokine—Diedel—that, when secreted from muscle or adipose, can attenuate age-related intestinal tissue degeneration by promoting proliferative homeostasis of stem cells. Diedel is both necessary and sufficient to limit tissue degeneration and regulate lifespan. Secreted homologs of Diedel are also found in viruses, having been acquired from host genomes. Focusing on potential mechanistic overlap between cellular aging and viral-host cell interactions, we found that Diedel is an inhibitor of apoptosis and can act as a systemic rheostat to modulate cell death during aging. These results highlight a key role for secreted antagonists of apoptosis in the systemic coordination of tissue aging.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Aging in multicellular organisms is characterized by a progressive decline in the proper function of organs. This deterioration of organ function is a risk factor for many diseases. However, it is unlikely that organs age in isolation, as damage in one organ can presumably impact aging of other organs through either beneficial or detrimental cross-talk. Our work attempts to explore this aspect of aging using fruit flies as a model system. We uncovered that damaged fly muscle can protect against aging in other organs, such as the intestine, through the secretion of a blood-borne factor named Diedel. This blood-borne factor presumably allows damaged organs to communicate with each other during aging. Related factors are also found in certain viruses, which have been hijacked from insect genomes to promote viral spreading during infection. Using this information, we found that viral Diedel inhibits death of infected cells, allowing viruses to spread. Similarly, host (insect) Diedel also blocks cell death in organs during aging, thus limiting deterioration of organ function and extending the organism’s lifespan.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In most metazoans, aging is characterized by a drastic decline in cellular and tissue function. This ultimate decline in function is driven by a multitude of complex, age-related cellular changes. The cellular and tissue changes that promote aging can be defined by (i) primary causes of cellular damage (such as genomic instability/DNA damage and telomere attrition), (ii) antagonistic responses to damage (such as changes in mitochondria function, cell death regulation/senescence, and changes in nutrient sensing), and (iii) integrative responses that eventually promote tissue dysfunction (such as a decline in regenerative potential, described in detail in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref001">1</xref>]). Adding to this complexity is the fact that tissues do not age in isolation, as aging also involves changes at the level of intertissue communication. The interconnectedness of primary, antagonistic, and integrative responses in the context of tissue aging is likely to involve both autonomous and systemic mechanisms. This is highlighted by the systemic control of age-related changes in tissue regeneration.</p>
<p>Attenuation in regenerative potential is a defining characteristic of aged tissues and a primary driver of tissue dysfunction. This decline in regenerative potential originates from age-related changes in the regulation of stem cell function, which include stem cell exhaustion and/or deficient proliferation and differentiation, as well as stem cell hyperproliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref003">3</xref>]. Collectively, a loss of proliferative homeostasis within stem and progenitor cells during aging promotes tissue dysfunction and degeneration. Heterochronic parabiosis and heterochronic blood exchange experiments have intricately demonstrated that the systemic environment plays an immense role in controlling age-related changes in proliferative homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref002">2</xref>]. Systemic or secreted factors from “old blood” can have inhibitory effects on young tissue stem cells, and although less robust, “young blood” can reverse the decline of stem cell function in aged tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>The precise nature of communication between unique tissues with diverse functions, during aging, remains unclear. However, the systemic coordination of tissue aging and regeneration, or the ability of age-related changes in one tissue to alter aging in distal tissues, is constricted by both deleterious and beneficial consequences.</p>
<p>Antagonistic mechanisms that respond to primary causes of age-related cellular damage also govern proliferative homeostasis to control tissue regeneration. This includes altered mitochondrial function and associated stress response pathways (such as the endoplasmic reticulum stress response [ER stress], the unfolded protein response [UPR], mitochondrial DNA [mtDNA] stress, and autophagy), cell senescence, altered programmed cell death/apoptosis, and changes in nutrient sensing (through insulin-like growth factor [IGF], insulin, and target of rapamycin [TOR] signaling), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref013">13</xref>]. Critically, many of these signaling mechanisms and stress pathways promote both normal tissue regeneration and age-related tissue degeneration, highlighting the pleiotropic nature of antagonistic responses to cellular aging. Thus, uncovering secreted factors (such as cytokines, growth factors, and other small molecules) that both enable organ cross-talk and precisely modulate antagonistic responses to affect proliferative homeostasis is likely to reveal fundamental mechanisms driving the systemic coordination of tissue aging and longevity.</p>
<p>The utilization of these antagonistic stress response mechanisms is not limited to cell-autonomous/nonautonomous control of tissue function and regeneration. Similar signaling mechanisms play critical roles in pathogen-host cell interactions, especially those related to viruses. For example, host cells can employ mtDNA stress, ER/UPR stress, cell senescence, and/or apoptotic responses as antiviral mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref017">17</xref>]. In contrast, many viruses have developed mechanisms to suppress or modify these host responses to facilitate viral replication and spread. The coevolution of viruses and hosts has also promoted viral hijacking of host-secreted factors (encoded virokines) in order to alter cell signaling and cell communication to favor virus-infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref020">20</xref>]. The obvious mechanistic overlap between cellular aging and pathogen–host cell interactions suggests that pathogens may contain vital information associated with age-related changes in intercellular or intertissue communication.</p>
<p>To this end, we show here that a secreted cytokine named Diedel, which has also been acquired by viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref022">22</xref>], is a critical regulator of systemic tissue aging. Utilizing the genetic capacity of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we designed a model in order to characterize age-related systemic interactions between distal tissues that influence proliferative homeostasis, tissue degeneration, and longevity (described in detail in the section Hormetic responses from muscle-specific DNA damage attenuate systemic tissue aging and enhance lifespan). Using this fly model, we uncovered that Diedel, when secreted from muscle or adipose, can attenuate age-related intestinal tissue degeneration by promoting proliferative homeostasis of stem cells and that Diedel is both necessary and sufficient to limit tissue degeneration and extend lifespan. Focusing on potential mechanistic overlap between cellular aging and viral-host cell interactions, we found that Diedel and its viral homolog act as functionally conserved inhibitors of apoptosis. For the virus, virokine Diedel can limit apoptosis to facilitate viral abundance and spread. For the host, cytokine Diedel acts as a systemic rheostat to limit apoptosis-induced degeneration of the aging intestine. These results highlight a key role for secreted antagonists of apoptosis, specifically those acquired by viral genomes, in the systemic coordination of tissue aging.</p>

<title>Hormetic responses from muscle-specific DNA damage attenuate systemic tissue aging and enhance lifespan</title>
<p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, genetic manipulations in multiple individual tissues and unique cell types have been shown to impact longevity. In regard to systemic aging, muscle and fat body (adipose) appear to be critical effector/modulator tissues, and the brain can function as a control center though the regulation of secreted hormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref026">26</xref>]. The fly intestine is also central to lifespan. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> adult midgut (intestine) is regenerated by a population of intestinal stem cells (ISCs), and in a young midgut, ISCs divide rarely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref029">29</xref>]. However, during aging, changes in activity of a multitude of stress response pathways leads to stem cell hyperproliferation/misdifferentiation and epithelial dysplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref030">30</xref>]. This results in tissue degeneration, which ultimately limits lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref031">31</xref>].</p>
<p>In order to uncover novel systemic mechanisms and communication axes that govern age-related changes in proliferative homeostasis, we tested multiple genetic strategies in order to induce tissue-specific and age-dependent tissue damage/stress within thoracic skeletal muscle, with the aim to assay integrative responses to primary causes of aging in distal tissues. The muscle has emerged as a critical regulator of longevity in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and muscle injury in mammals has been suggested to influence regeneration in distal organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref033">33</xref>]. We discovered that mild attenuation of DNA repair within skeletal muscle leads to systemic responses that limit age-related intestinal degeneration and extend lifespan.

Attenuating Mei-9 alone (Act88FGal4&gt;UAS-Mei-9<sup>RNAi</sup>) results in mild up-regulation of DNA damage and age-related increases in markers of muscle tissue damage/stress when compared to controls (Act88FGal4&gt;+[w<sup>1118</sup>], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s001">S1C Fig</xref>).

However, concurrently attenuating both Mei-9 and ERCC1 (Act88FGal4&gt;UAS-Mei-9<sup>RNAi</sup>, UAS-ERCC1<sup>RNAi</sup>) leads to robust increases in both DNA damage and apparent tissue damage, highlighted by a premature loss of proteostasis and disruption of myofibril muscle structure during aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>Beneficial effects of adaptive responses to low doses of cellular stress or damage (termed hormesis) have been linked to systemic aging, including stress associated with genomic instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref038">38</xref>]. We found that mild increases in muscle DNA damage (Act88FGal4&gt;UAS-Mei-9<sup>RNAi</sup>) also increase mean adult lifespan and decrease age-specific mortality, although the impact on mortality rate was slightly reduced later in life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s002">S2A Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s009">S1 Table</xref>). In order to confirm these longevity results, we generated a thoracic muscle-specific GeneSwitch driver (Act88FGS) for adult-specific and mifepristone (RU486)-inducible gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s001">S1E–S1L Fig</xref>). Inhibiting DNA repair with this driver extends mean lifespan as well (Act88FGS&gt;UAS-Mei-9<sup>RNAi</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s003">S3A and S3B Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s010">S2 Table</xref>). Muscle-specific DNA damage can also systemically attenuate intestinal tissue degeneration during aging. Inhibiting Mei-9 function in muscle limits age-related ISC hyperproliferation and epithelial dysplasia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g001">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>). Utilizing a split-lacZ reconstitution assay to heritably label-select ISCs (clones), we also found that muscle-specific DNA damage limits clone growth (cells per clone) in aged midguts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g001">Fig 1G and 1H</xref>), further highlighting a preservation of proliferative homeostasis. Female flies are used exclusively for all assays (except for survival analysis) because of sexual dimorphism related to midgut regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref039">39</xref>]. Alternatively, strong enrichment of muscle-specific DNA damage (Act88FGal4&gt;UAS-Mei-9<sup>RNAi</sup>, UAS-ERCC1<sup>RNAi</sup>) does not positively impact age-related tissue degeneration or lifespan (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s004">S4C and S4D Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s010">S2 Table</xref>), and inhibiting DNA repair in other tissues, such as directly in the midgut, leads to accelerated aging (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s004">S4E–S4G Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s009">S1 Table</xref>). These results highlight the dose dependency and tissue specificity associated with DNA damage–mediated hormesis.</p>
<p>Taken together, our data show that mild enhancement of DNA damage in muscle can drive systemic hormetic responses to promote proliferative homeostasis of distal regenerating tissues during aging and increase longevity.</p>

<title>Cytokine Diedel governs systemic tissue aging and lifespan</title>
<p>We next wanted to use this genetic model of hormesis, and putative muscle-gut communication axis, to uncover systemic factors/mechanisms that modulate age-related changes in proliferative homeostasis. To this end, we generated genome-wide expression profiles from dissected thoraces (enriched in indirect flight muscle) and intestines of young and old flies with muscle-specific attenuation of DNA repair (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s004">S4H and S4I Fig</xref>). In midguts, we found a significant overlap in age-related intestinal transcriptome changes (focusing on up-regulated gene expression) between Act88FGal4&gt;UAS-Mei-9<sup>RNAi</sup> flies and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g001">Fig 1I</xref>), despite the strong rescue of intestinal epithelial dysplasia in animals with Mei-9 inhibition in muscle. Gene Ontology (GO) clustering analysis revealed that the reason for this overlap is due to overrepresentation of GO terms associated with innate immune responses. Chronic activation of innate immunity in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestine during aging can promote tissue degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref040">40</xref>], and age-related up-regulation of innate genes occurs in both genotypes (select genes highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g001">Fig 1J</xref> and confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR [qRT-PCR] in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s004">S4J and S4K Fig</xref>). These data suggest that the maintenance of proliferative homeostasis in flies with muscle-specific DNA damage is not due to a general suppression of age-related systemic inflammatory responses and is likely achieved through more direct mechanisms.</p>
<p>We turned to thoracic/muscle transcriptomes in order to identify genes or secreted factors the might mediate muscle–gut communication during aging. We discovered a small subset of genes that are up-regulated uniquely in aged Act88FGal4&gt;UAS-Mei-9<sup>RNAi</sup> thorax/muscle samples (with minimal or no induction in controls samples, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). One gene in particular, named Diedel, was of distinct interest because it encodes a small protein with a putative signal peptide, and a recent report has shown that Diedel is a secreted factor (cytokine) found in circulation (hemolymph, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref021">21</xref>]). Gene expression profiles in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have previously linked Diedel transcriptional induction to sterile injury, septic infection, viral infection, and tissue damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref046">46</xref>]. In our model, Diedel expression is strongly up-regulated in Act88FGal4&gt;UAS-Mei-9<sup>RNAi</sup> thorax/muscle (and also slightly up-regulated in controls) during aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). We thus asked whether Diedel expression from muscle could phenocopy the systemic hormetic responses induced by muscle-specific DNA repair inhibition. Indeed, overexpression of transgenic Diedel cDNA in skeletal muscle (Act88FGal4&gt;UAS-Diedel, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s005">S5A Fig</xref>) affects both intestinal tissue regeneration and aging. Diedel expression in muscle limits ISC-derived clone growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g002">Fig 2C</xref>) in young animals, as well as regenerative responses (ISC proliferation) induced by natural infection of enteropathogenic bacteria (<italic>Erwinia carotovora carotovora 15</italic> [<italic>Ecc</italic>15], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Furthermore, muscle-specific Diedel expression also inhibits age-related ISC hyperproliferation and epithelial dysplasia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g002">Fig 2E and 2F</xref>) and increases mean lifespan (utilizing both Gal4 and GeneSwitch systems, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g002">Fig 2G and 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s002">S2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s003">S3C</xref> Figs, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s009">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s010">S2</xref> Tables).</p>

<p>These data thus suggest that Diedel is an important systemic factor governing tissue aging and longevity. Because this gene can be induced by a wide variety of cellular and tissue stress (some related to aging), we wanted to determine if Diedel is important for normal aging, independent of our hormetic model. Surprisingly, Diedel knock-down in muscle (using RNAi-mediated targeting of the Diedel, UAS-Die<sup>RNAi</sup>) had no impact on systemic intestinal tissue aging (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s005">S5B and S5C Fig</xref>). We hypothesized that Diedel was either not required for normal aging or may be expressed in multiple tissues during aging. To answer this question, we generated Diedel reporter flies (using a 366-base-pair region located upstream of Diedel transcription start site, linked to red fluorescent protein [RFP]; Diedel<sup>P</sup>-RFP) to monitor Diedel expression changes in aging flies. Diedel reporter activity is off in young animals, but during aging, mild reporter activity is found in the muscle, while strong activation is observed in carcass fat body (muscle and fat body activation appear concurrently in the same animal, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). Populations show a significant age-dependent increase in Diedel<sup>P</sup>-RFP animals, reaching nearly 100% of surviving flies later in life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Similar affects are seen in our model of hormesis. DNA repair attenuation in muscle leads to reporter activation in the carcass fat body, although at a much accelerated rate over controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s005">S5D Fig</xref>), and age-related changes in Diedel gene expression are even stronger in fat body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g003">Fig 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s005">S5E Fig</xref>) when compared with the thorax/muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Muscle tissue stress is thus likely to autonomously and nonautonomously (in fat body) promote Diedel expression and secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref041">41</xref>].</p>

<p>Unlike the muscle, Diedel expression in fat body is required for normal systemic tissue aging and longevity. Diedel knock-down in fat body (using CGGal4 and PplGal4 coupled with RNAi) leads to accelerated aging of the intestine, in regard to ISC hyperproliferation and epithelial dysplasia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g003">Fig 3E and 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s005">S5F Fig</xref>). Similar to muscle, overexpression of Diedel in fat body also attenuates the age-related loss of proliferative homeostasis in the midgut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g003">Fig 3E</xref>) and does not impact feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s005">S5G Fig</xref>). Diedel is also required for normal longevity, as inhibiting Diedel in fat body or ubiquitously in the adult animal (using the TubGeneSwitch driver) shortens fly lifespan and increases age-specific mortality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g003">Fig 3G and 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s003">S3D Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s009">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s010">S2</xref> Tables). Ubiquitous or fat body–specific overexpression of Diedel also shortens lifespan, despite the attenuation of intestinal dysplasia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s009">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s010">S2</xref> Tables). Previous reports have shown that the balance between normal regeneration and dysplasia in this tissue determines longevity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref031">31</xref>]. Furthermore, Diedel overexpression using the muscle-specific GeneSwitch driver does not obviously impact mortality rates, notwithstanding the influence on mean lifespan (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s003">S3C Fig</xref>). We thus hypothesized that strong overexpression of Diedel might negatively impact normal regeneration and variably impact longevity. In support of this hypothesis, we found that levels of Diedel expression (using the TubGS driver and various doses of RU486) can positively or negatively influence longevity and that ultimately, Diedel can dose-dependently extend mean lifespan and impact age-specific mortality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g003">Fig 3I and 3J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s003">S3E and S3F Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s011">S3 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, these data show that the secreted factor Diedel is a critical regulator of systemic aging. As a critical regulator of tissue communication during aging, this cytokine is both necessary and sufficient to prevent the loss of proliferative homeostasis in the aging intestine, as well as influence longevity.</p>

While we observed some Diedel-dependent phenotypes associated with attenuation of NFkB function in the midgut (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s005">S5H and S5I Fig</xref>), NFkB, however, is not required for bacterial-induced regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref047">47</xref>], and presumably homeostatic clone formation as well. Thus, we hypothesized that this cytokine likely impacts age-related tissue regeneration through alternative/parallel or partially overlapping mechanisms. In order to sort through the numerous signaling pathways and stress responses that modulate regeneration in the fly intestine, which could be influenced by Diedel, we turned to Diedel homologs for guidance. Although there are no obvious homologs in vertebrate or mammalian genomes, Lamiable and colleagues previously highlighted that homologs of Diedel are found in unrelated families of DNA viruses that primarily infect lepidoptera (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s006">S6A Fig</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref048">48</xref>]). During evolution, DNA viruses have acquired an array of cellular genes from various host genomes. Termed virokines, these often-secreted proteins may act as a mimetics or antagonists of their host homologs, altering cell signaling to promote viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref049">49</xref>]. Due to the previously mentioned overlap in host signaling mechanisms used to either (i) govern stress-related tissue regeneration or (ii) control antiviral responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), we decided to explore virokine Diedel function in order to inform on the host’s gene’s role in influencing tissue degeneration during aging. First, we generated upstream activating sequence (UAS)-dependent transgenic flies capable of expressing either a full-length virokine Diedel (ORF121 from <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> Ascovirus 1a [SfAV-1a]) or a recombinant version in which the putative signal peptide from the viral protein was replaced with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> signal peptide sequence (REC-ORF121, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Overexpressing either ORF121 or REC-ORF121 from fat body strongly attenuated midgut regenerative responses induced by bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>), while overexpressing REC-ORF121 from muscle inhibited regenerative responses during infection and aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). ORF121 expression in muscle did not impact these responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g004">Fig 4E</xref>), suggesting that the full-length virokine may not be readily secreted from all types of host cells. These data suggest that the viral homolog of Diedel may mimic function of the host gene and thus can inform on its function.</p>

<p>Virokines have been shown to influence various host responses in order to limit antiviral mechanisms and promote infection, including programmed cell death (including apoptosis), inflammation, and growth-factor signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g004">Fig 4F</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref050">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref054">54</xref>]). We next investigated virokine Diedel function in relation to viral infection. Utilizing a previously described in vitro infection model of <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref055">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref056">56</xref>]), we assayed the ability of secreted virokine Diedel to impact viral infection. Transfection of expression plasmids containing tagged host Diedel or REC-ORF121 in S2 cells revealed that these proteins are readily secreted into media (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s006">S6B and S6C Fig</xref>). However, as predicted from in vivo experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g004">Fig 4E</xref>), tagged full-length ORF121 secretion from these cells is less efficient (ORF121-conditioned media, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s004">S4B and S4C Fig</xref>). Still, we found that conditioned media containing secreted ORF121 markedly increased the abundance of VSV-G and VSV-M RNA in infected S2 cells (monitored by qRT-PCR of viral RNA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g004">Fig 4G and 4H</xref>). These results suggest that Diedel may increase viral replication on a per-cell basis or inhibit apoptosis, the latter of which is an important host response to viral infection to minimize both viral replication and spread. To explore a role for Diedel in limiting apoptosis, we employed an immunofluorescence approach to coordinately monitor viral abundance and TUNEL positivity. In control experiments, many VSV-GFP-positive S2 cells were observed undergoing apoptosis (monitored by TUNEL-positive nuclei, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g004">Fig 4I</xref>). However, ORF121 promoted striking increases in the amount of cellular VSV-GFP but an absence of TUNEL staining. These data suggest that secreted virokine Diedel can antagonize apoptosis to increase viral abundance and likely promote spread.</p>
<p>We thus further investigated the role of host cytokine Diedel in the regulation of apoptosis. Still utilizing S2 cells, we assayed the ability of secreted Diedel (Die<sup>V5</sup>-conditioned media, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s006">S6B–S6E Fig</xref>) to limit UV/DNA damage–induced apoptosis in vitro. Apoptosis is highly conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, as various apoptotic responses are mediated by initiator caspases (death regulator Nedd2-like caspase [Dronc]; caspase 9 [Cas-9]-like) and effector caspases (DrICE and death caspase 1 [Dcp-1]; caspase 3 [Cas-3]-like), as well as a family of inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP; Diap1) antagonists (head involution defect [Hid], Reaper [Rpr], and Grim) governed by Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref013">13</xref>]. Dronc, Hid, Rpr, and Grim can be transcriptionally induced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref057">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref058">58</xref>]. We found that Diedel strongly attenuated UV-induced Dronc expression but not Hid, Rpr, Grim (only Rpr is shown), or Puckered (Puc, a classical JNK target gene) expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g005">Fig 5A–5C</xref>), at least suggesting that Diedel does not impact JNK-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, Diedel is transcriptionally induced after UV-treatment in S2 cells, and Diedel inhibition (using double-stranded RNA [dsRNA]) significantly enhances UV-induced Dronc expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g005">Fig 5D and 5E</xref>). This cytokine also attenuates the temporal cleavage (activation) of Cas-3 after UV-treatment (visualized by western blots utilizing a mammalian cleaved Cas-3 antibody that is a marker for both effector caspase activity and Dronc activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref059">59</xref>], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g005">Fig 5F and 5G</xref>). Immunostains of S2 cells further revealed that secreted Diedel almost completely blocks the UV-induced activation/induction of effectors caspases (Cas-3 and Dcp-1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g005">Fig 5H and 5I</xref>). We also monitored end points of apoptotic pathway activation (5 h after UV treatment) and found that Diedel can potently block DNA fragmentation assayed by TUNEL staining and gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g005">Fig 5J and 5K</xref>). Diedel purified from conditioned media has similar effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g005">Fig 5L</xref>). Diedel did not influence NFkB target gene expression at steady state or acutely in response to UV in S2 cells, suggesting that NFkB is not required for these apoptotic responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s006">S6F–S6J Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>Despite a lack of sequence homology, secreted Diedel is also capable of inhibiting apoptosis in mammalian cells (mouse embryonic fibroblasts [MEFs]) in response to UV treatment, attenuating Cas-3 activation and DNA fragmentation (TUNEL, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g005">Fig 5M and 5N</xref>), as well as blocking the induction of apoptosis-related inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNFα] and interleukin 1 beta [IL-1β], <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s008">S8K Fig</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref060">60</xref>]).

<p>Apoptosis is also required for normal tissue regeneration, but misregulation of apoptotic responses is increasingly linked to tissue aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref061">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref062">62</xref>]. Apoptosis has thus emerged as a critical antagonistic response to primary causes of cellular damage during aging and must be precisely modulated to ensure proper tissue architecture and epithelial function. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestine, apoptotic responses in enterocytes are required for both homeostatic regeneration/tissue growth and pathogen-induced regeneration through the production of mitogenic signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref063">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref066">66</xref>]. These paracrine signals drive stem cell proliferation and differentiation. Critically, overactivation of apoptotic responses in enterocytes promotes hyperproliferation and tissue degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref063">63</xref>]. Thus, we next wanted to determine if secreted Diedel could influence apoptosis in vivo in the aging midgut. Similar to our in vitro findings, Diedel expression in muscle (Act88FGal4&gt;UAS-Diedel) inhibits age-related increases in intestinal Dronc expression but not JNK-target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). We also found a marked increase in apoptosis and cell death in the aging midgut (assayed by TUNEL staining and Cas-3 immunostaining), and muscle-specific Diedel expression significantly blocks these age-related increase in apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g006">Fig 6B–6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s007">S7A–S7C Fig</xref>), which correlates with an attenuation of ISC hyperproliferation and tissue dysplasia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Alternatively, Diedel knock-down in fat body (using CGGal4 and PplGal4 coupled with RNAi) leads to hastened induction of apoptosis and cell death in the aging midgut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g006">Fig 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s007">S7D–S7H Fig</xref>), which correlates with accelerated aging of the intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). Furthermore, secreted Diedel can inhibit cytokine (unpaired 3 [Upd3])-mediated Janus kinase (Jak)/signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins (Stat) signaling, which in turn regulates stress- and age-related stem cell proliferation/midgut regeneration (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref067">67</xref>]). Both in vitro and in vivo, Diedel indirectly attenuates Jak/Stat activation by repressing stress-induced Upd3 transcriptional up-regulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s008">S8A–S8J Fig</xref>). We also confirmed that apoptotic responses can drive Upd3 induction and Jak/Stat activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005796.s006">S6E Fig</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Overall, our results reveal that primary causes of cellular aging can have tissue-autonomous and systemic effects on integrative responses that drive age-related phenotypes, highlighting a systemic coordination in tissue aging. Furthermore, we uncovered a systemic signaling mechanism (mediated by the cytokine Diedel) that is capable of promoting communication between muscle/adipose and the regenerating midgut during aging in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This cytokine is both necessary and sufficient to limit age-related tissue degeneration and extend lifespan, and our data highlight Diedel as a critical regulator of aging and longevity.</p>
<p>Diedel appears to impact tissue aging through the attenuation of apoptosis. Apoptosis is the major programmed cell death pathway used to remove unneeded or harmful cells during development or tissue maintenance/regeneration. Increasing evidence also suggests that apoptosis may be a driving force of tissue aging, albeit extremely pleiotropic. Too little can promote cancer or age-related (and harmful) cell senescence, while too much can promote tissue atrophy or hyperplastic overgrowth through compensatory proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref061">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref062">62</xref>]. The loss of proper apoptotic responses during aging is thus likely to be influenced by changes in both pro- and antiapoptotic mechanisms. An abundance of precisely regulated mammalian cytokines act as critical proapoptotic signals to control various programmed cell death pathways, especially those related to immune cell regulation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref060">60</xref>]). Diedel emerges as an intriguing antagonist of these responses, as it is a secreted factor under tight transcriptional control (similar to other stress response genes and cytokines), allowing it to function as a systemic rheostat to properly balance apoptosis.</p>
<p>While <italic>Drosophila</italic> Diedel is able to attenuate activity of the apoptotic pathway in both fly and mammalian cells, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Apoptosis is governed by both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Extrinsic receptor-induced signaling (triggered at the cell surface by ligands such as TNFα and IL-1β) and the release of intrinsic apoptogenic factors (triggered by changes in the permeabilization of mitochondrial membranes) ultimately converge on activation of downstream caspases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref068">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref070">70</xref>]. JNK, through the induction of mitochondrial-localized IAP antagonists, plays a crucial role in the intrinsic activation of apoptosis, especially in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref058">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref071">71</xref>]. Our data suggest that secreted Diedel does not influence JNK activation after cell damage, implying that this cytokine attenuates apoptosis through an extrinsic pathway and putative unknown receptor. Diedel’s potentially unique role in regulating apoptosis may influence other signaling pathways as well, such as immune/NFkB responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref021">21</xref>], known to share common control elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref072">72</xref>]. Furthermore, Diedel may also directly influence NFkB in certain cell types (39) and thus impact apoptosis through governing NFkB activity. A more detailed spatiotemporal analysis of Diedel molecular function is required to understand how various signaling pathways intersect to control outputs. The exact fate of Diedel-treated cells also needs further examination, as it remains unclear if these cells are just temporally blocked from cell death or display more permanent features that could be beneficial, detrimental, or likely both. Exploring this protein’s unique function is likely to inform on how secreted antagonists of apoptosis precisely modulate cell death in concert with extrinsic and intrinsic activators. Furthermore, uncovering the underlying mechanism by which Diedel influences apoptotic responses will also shed light on the complex spatiotemporal role of programmed cell death pathways in aging phenotypes.</p>
<p>Our data show that Diedel expression increases with age in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and that the cytokine limits age-related induction of apoptosis and concurrent loss of proliferative homeostasis in the aging intestine. However, Diedel can be induced in response to various stressors, suggesting a broad role in regulating apoptosis beyond just that associated with midgut regeneration. Our data also imply that Diedel, and antiapoptotic mechanisms in general, may be critical for beneficial hormetic responses. Age-related hormetic effects induced by various antagonistic stress responses appear to have diverse systemic components, which are likely to exert broad effects on cellular targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref073">73</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref075">75</xref>]. Because change in the regulation of apoptosis is a general feature of many aging metazoans, Diedel may represent an important secreted factor that systemically communicates various types of cell damage/stress between tissues during aging, generally eliciting beneficial effects.</p>
<p>Diedel’s potentially broad role in regulating apoptosis is perhaps best highlighted by its viral counterparts. Diedel, like other host genes from various species—including humans—has been hijacked by viral genomes. During evolution, DNA viruses have acquired a broad array of genes from hosts in order to shift virus–host cell interactions toward survival of virus-infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref076">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref077">77</xref>]. Encoded virokines often act as mimetics or antagonists of their cellular homologs, and we find that virokine Diedel can also limit apoptosis during viral infection, as well as attenuate age-related tissue degeneration in vivo. These data show that viral genomes may contain vital information associated with underlying mechanisms that govern aging and can perhaps be exploited to uncover novel modulators and potential therapeutics related to tissue aging. Using Diedel as an example, secreted virokines have been proposed as putative immunomodulatory therapeutics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref078">78</xref>], and there is a long history of targeting cell death (apoptosis) pathways for drug development related to cancer and other age-associated diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref079">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref080">80</xref>]. Finally, while most virus-acquired host genes are linked to evolution of pathogenic virus–host cell interactions, mutualistic relationships also exist in which viruses are beneficial to their hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref081">81</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref082">82</xref>]. Thus, secreted viral proteins emerging from symbiotic or “good” viruses might also have the capability to influence host-tissue homeostasis during stress or aging, similar to mutualistic microorganisms.</p>

<title>Lifespan analysis</title>
<p>Thirty virgins were crossed to 10–15 males of the desired genotype for all survival experiments unless otherwise indicated (see below). After initial mating, parental flies were allowed 2 d to lay eggs before being removed from bottles. Progeny of crosses was collected for 3–4 d after initial eclosion. Collected progeny were allowed to mate for 2 d at room temperature. Progeny were then separated according to sex and genotype into cages (around 75–100 flies/cage) and aged at 25 °C with constant humidity (approximately 65%).</p>
<p>In order to normalize population densities for RU486 dose-dependency longevity experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005796.g003">Fig 3I and 3J</xref>), 75 virgin flies were mated with 50 males and allowed to lay eggs for less than 24 h on apple plates, supplemented with live yeast paste. Eggs were collected from the apple plate by washing in 1X PBS solution into 15 ml tubes. Then, 18–20 μL of egg suspension was dispensed into 200-mL bottles containing standard lab food. Two days after eclosion, once-mated flies were transferred to plastic cages at a density of 100–120 flies per cage.</p>
<p>For all independent populations, plastic cages (175-ml volume, 5-cm diameter from Greiner Bio-One) were used for lifespan experiments.

<title>ISC lineage analysis</title>
<p>The previously developed marked lineage system was used to generate clones of lacZ-expressing cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005796.ref086">86</xref>]. In this system, flippase-mediated recombination fuses the α-tubulin promoter to the lacZ gene, allowing transcription of lacZ. In the absence of heat shock, X15 flies carry 2 inactive tubulin-promoter lacZ (X-15–29 and X-15–33). Upon heat shock induction of flippase in dividing cells, these transgenes can recombine through the flippase recombination target (FRT) region, generating an active lacZ transgene. Thereafter, cells carrying the recombined lacZ transgene, as well as its progeny, will be marked by constitutive production of ß-galactosidase. The size of the marked clone is a direct measure of the division rate. To induce somatic recombination, adult flies were heat-shocked at 10 d or 30 d of age at 37 °C for 60 min. Midguts were dissected 5 d after heat shock and stained with anti-LacZ antibody.</p>
