The Bxb1 integrase is a member of the serine recombinase family of site-specific recombination proteins and utilizes small (&lt;50 base pair) substrates for recombination, promoting strand exchange without the necessity for complex higher order macromolecular architectures. To elucidate the regulatory mechanism for the integration and excision reactions, we have identified a Bxb1-encoded recombination directionality factor (RDF), the product of gene

Bxb1 gp47 is an unusual RDF in that it is relatively large (̃28 kDa), unrelated to all other RDFs, and presumably performs dual functions since it is well conserved in mycobacteriophages that utilize unrelated integration systems. Furthermore, unlike other RDFs, Bxb1 gp47 does not bind DNA and functions solely through direct interaction with integrase–DNA complexes. The nature and consequences of this interaction depend on the specific DNA substrate to which integrase is bound, generating electrophoretically stable tertiary complexes with either

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Integration of bacteriophage genomes into the chromosomes of their hosts is typically accomplished by integrase-mediated site-specific recombination between 
				<italic>attP</italic> and 
				<italic>attB</italic> sites located in the phage and bacterial genomes respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b001">1</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b002">2</xref>]. Integration generates the junction sites—
				<italic>attL</italic> and 
				<italic>attR</italic>—that flank the integrated prophage and are used as substrates for excision of the genome during prophage induction. The phage-encoded integrase protein (gpInt) catalyzes both integration and excision, but the reactions are highly directional, with the selection of integrative (using 
				<italic>attP</italic> and 
				<italic>attB</italic>) or excisive (using 
				<italic>attL</italic> and 
				<italic>attR</italic>) recombination determined by accessory proteins called recombination directionality factors (RDFs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b003">3</xref>].
			</p>
      <p>Phage integrases can be grouped into two main classes, the tyrosine and serine recombinase families. Perhaps the best-studied member of the tyrosine integrase group is that encoded by phage lambda, in which the DNA sites and protein components are well characterized and structural information on proteins and protein–DNA complexes is now available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b002">2</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b006">6</xref>]. The basis for directional control of lambda site-specific recombination is well defined, with the RDF (lambda Excise, Xis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b007">7</xref>] functioning as a DNA-binding and DNA-bending protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b008">8</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b009">9</xref>] whose action specifically alters the formation of higher-order macromolecular architectures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b010">10</xref>]. These structures are generated by the binding of Int to a relatively large (234 base pair [bp]) 
				<italic>attP</italic> site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b011">11</xref>] that contains both core-type (C and C′) and arm-type Int binding sites (P1, P2, P′1, P′2, and P′3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b012">12</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b013">13</xref>] together with the accessory proteins IHF (binding sites HI, H2, and H3) and Xis (binding sites X1 and X2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b014">14</xref>]. Both IHF and Xis introduce substantial DNA bends at their sites and influence the ability of Int to form intra- or inter-molecular bridges through bivalent binding of Int to core- and arm-type sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b015">15</xref>]. When Xis is absent, the 
				<italic>attP</italic>/Int/IHF intasome is competent to capture naked 
				<italic>attB</italic> DNA, and strand exchange occurs to generate 
				<italic>attL</italic>/
				<italic>attR</italic> product complexes that are unable to undergo excisive recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b016">16</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b017">17</xref>]. When Xis is present, its binding to the P arm of 
				<italic>attP</italic> precludes formation of an 
				<italic>attP</italic> intasome that is proficient for integration (resulting in strong inhibition of the reaction) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b010">10</xref>]; binding of Xis to 
				<italic>attR</italic> promotes the formation of an 
				<italic>attR</italic> intasome that is competent to synapse productively with an 
				<italic>attL</italic> intasome enabling excisive recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b018">18</xref>], and integrase and excise make close protein contacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b021">21</xref>]. Interestingly, several RDFs have functions outside of recombination, including the Cox proteins of phages P2 and HP1, and AlpA of the 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Escherichia coli</named-content> genomic island CP4–57 that act as transcriptional regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b024">24</xref>].
			</p>
      <p>The mechanism and control of site-specific recombination events mediated by serine integrases is much less well understood than for the tyrosine integrases. This group of proteins is still relatively small (̃30) compared to the tyrosine integrases (&gt;500) and was only discovered in the mid 1990s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b025">25</xref>], more than 30 years after the Campbell model for lambda integration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b026">26</xref>]. The serine integrases are relatively large (500–900 amino acids [aa]) and diverse, but all contain an N-terminal segment (̃150 aa) that is shared with the catalytic domains of transposon resolvases and DNA invertases of the serine recombinase class [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b029">29</xref>]. In vitro integration systems have been established for Streptomyces phage ϕC31 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b030">30</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b031">31</xref>], Lactococcal phage TP901–1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b032">32</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b033">33</xref>], Mycobacteriophage Bxb1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b034">34</xref>] and the 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</named-content> prophage-like element, ϕRv1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b035">35</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b036">36</xref>]. In each example, the 
				<italic>attP</italic> and 
				<italic>attB</italic> sites are small (&lt;50 bp) and likely contain only sufficient sequence information for the binding of two protomers of gpInt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b036">36</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b037">37</xref>]. The two sites typically contain partial dyad symmetry flanking a central dinucleotide with gpInt cleaving such as to generate two-base 3′ extensions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b037">37</xref>]. All mechanistic aspects of strand exchange—including covalent linkage of gpInt to the cleaved DNA via a phosphoserine bond—appear to be similar to that of the well-studied resolvase and DNA invertase systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b027">27</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b028">28</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b037">37</xref>].
			</p>
      <p>Mycobacteriophage Bxb1 is a temperate phage of 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. smegmatis</named-content> and integrates its genome at an 
				<italic>attB</italic> site located within the 3′ end of the 
				<italic>groEL1</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b034">34</xref>], leading to a defect in biofilm formation of Bxb1 lysogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b038">38</xref>]. Integration is catalyzed by a 500-aa serine integrase that is composed of two domains, an N-terminal 150-aa catalytic domain, and a 350-aa C-terminal domain that confers DNA binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b039">39</xref>]. The minimally functional recombination sites are 48 bp 
				<italic>(attP)</italic> and 38 bp 
				<italic>(attB)</italic> in length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b037">37</xref>] and are substantially different at the sequence level, although both contain interrupted inverted repeats flanking a 5′-GT central dinucleotide. In vitro, integrative recombination is both efficient and directional, converting greater than 95% substrate DNAs to the 
				<italic>attL</italic> and 
				<italic>attR</italic> products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b037">37</xref>], and unlike the resolvase/DNA invertase systems, there is no requirement for DNA supercoiling; gpInt is the only protein component, and no accessory proteins are involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b034">34</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b037">37</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b039">39</xref>]. Curiously, synapsis is permissive with respect to site-alignment, with 
				<italic>attP</italic> and 
				<italic>attB</italic> aligning equally efficiently in parallel and antiparallel configurations, both of which proceed through strand cleavage and rotation. However, the non-palindromic nature of the central 5′-GT dinucleotide results in a mismatch in the recombinant configuration when the sites are misaligned, and the intermediates are resolved by a second strand rotation and religation in the substrate arrangement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b037">37</xref>].
			</p>
      <p>It is unclear how the directionality of serine integrase–mediated site-specific recombination is regulated, since these systems typically do not contain accessory integrase or cofactor DNA-binding sites common in the tyrosine integrase systems, nor are they controlled by DNA topology as in the resolvase/DNA invertase members of the serine recombinase family. In two examples of serine integrases—ϕRv1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b035">35</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b036">36</xref>] and TP901–1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b032">32</xref>]—RDFs have been described, both of which are small and basic, and have limited sequence similarity to previously described RDFs that act in tyrosine integrase systems. The mechanism of action of these cofactors in unknown, although the ϕRv1 system uses small simple substrates for both integration and excision, suggesting that directionality does not involve the remodeling of higher order macromolecular architectures (L. Bibb and G. F. Hatfull, unpublished data).
			</p>
      <p>Here, we report the identification and characterization of an RDF that regulates the directionality of recombination by the Bxb1 integrase. This RDF (Bxb1 gp47) is unusual in that it is relatively large (255 aa), unrelated to all other RDFs, and likely has functions outside of recombination, since close relatives are present in other mycobacteriophages that utilize tyrosine integrase systems and for which all the recombination functions are defined. Bxb1 gp47 is a required accessory protein for excisive recombination both in vitro and in vivo, and is a potent inhibitor of integrative recombination in vitro. However, it does not have DNA-binding activity, only small simple excision substrates are required, and it does not function through remodeling of higher order structures. In contrast to other RDFs, Bxb1 gp47 appears to act via direct protein interactions with gpInt, but in a conformation-dependent manner that is determined by the specific DNA substrate bound by gpInt. Inhibition of integration is facilitated by stable association of gp47 with 
				<italic>attB</italic>–gpInt or 
				<italic>attP</italic>–gpInt complexes to prevent further participation in recombination, whereas excision is strongly stimulated without stable association to 
				<italic>attL</italic>–gpInt or 
				<italic>attR</italic>-gpInt complexes and presumably involves transient but productive associations.

        <title>Isolation of a Bxb1 DNA Segment Promoting Excisive Recombination</title>
        <p>Using bioinformatic analysis of the Bxb1 genomic sequence, we have not been able to identify candidate proteins showing sequence similarity to previously identified RDFs; this is however not surprising as excises comprise a diverse group of proteins with little sequence conservation. In order to identify and characterize the Bxb1 recombination directionality factor a positive selection assay using a strain reflecting the organization of genes in a Bxb1 lysogen with respect to 
					<italic>attL, attR,</italic> and 
					<italic>int</italic> was established. A portion of the Bxb1 DNA containing 
					<italic>attP</italic> and 
					<italic>int</italic> was cloned into an integrative plasmid containing the hygromycin resistance cassette and the sucrose sensitivity cassette 
					<italic>(sacB),</italic> and the resultant plasmid pPGA1 was electroporated into

        <title>Bxb1 gp47 Is an RDF</title>
        <p>The Bxb1 sequence in pPGX6 contains no open reading frames (ORFs) encoding proteins with sequence similarity to previously identified RDFs, although this is perhaps not surprising given the high diversity of the RDFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b003">3</xref>]. The only previously annotated ORF in this region is gp47, which not only has no similarity to other RDFs, but is closely related to predicted proteins of unknown function encoded by mycobacteriophages Che12 (gp57), U2 (gp50), Bethlehem (gp51), Bxz2 (gp54), L5 (gp54), and D29 (gp54) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b042">42</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). However, only phages U2, Bethlehem, and Bxz2 are predicted to encode serine integrases, whereas L5, D29, and Che12 utilize tyrosine integrases. Furthermore, all of the phage-encoded requirements for L5 recombination have been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b043">43</xref>] and do not include L5 gp54, the homolog of Bxb1 gp47. Presumably Bxb1 gp47 and its related proteins play a role other than in site-specific recombination; given their location between DNA polymerase and DNA primase genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), we speculate that they may also play a role in DNA replication. Phylogenetic analysis of the Bxb1 gp47-related proteins suggests that acquisition of a role in recombination was not a recent event, since the Bxz2 member of this family is more closely related to the homologs found in the tyrosine integrase phages L5, D29, and Che12 than to other phages encoding serine integrases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g003">Figure 3</xref>B).

        <p>The observation that Bxb1 gp47 is unrelated to other RDFs (including the two previously described serine integrases for phages TP901 and ϕRV1), and that it is larger than all previously characterized RDFs (28 kDa, 255 aa) raises the question as to whether gp47 provides the excision activity, or whether excision function is conferred by the products of one or more other ORFs within this region. We note for example the involvement of three small ORFs in a contiguous DNA segment of the 
					<italic>Bacteroides</italic> conjugative transposon CTnDOT that are required for excisive recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b045">45</xref>]. To address this question, we have used three approaches. First, the 835-bp segment of Bxb1 DNA within plasmid pPGX6b was truncated from both ends, and all truncations are inactive in excision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). Second, pPGX6b was randomly mutagenized by passage through the mutator strain XL1Red, and excision defective mutants were selected on media containing hygromycin (see 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g001">Figure 1</xref>). DNA from 20 mutants was isolated and sequenced, all of which contain mutations within frame 1 encoding gp47 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g004">Figure 4</xref>B and 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g004">4</xref>C); furthermore, every base change results in an amino acid (or nonsense) substitution in frame 1 (corresponding to gene 
					<italic>47</italic>) whereas base changes in other frames contain those that are conservative and do not generate amino acid substitutions (
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref>). Of the 20 mutations, five generate nonsense codons in gene 
					<italic>47,</italic> ten are changes in the first codon position, and the remaining five have changes in the second position; all 15 missense mutations result in an amino acid change in gp47.

Taken together, these results unequivocally demonstrate that gp47 is the protein responsible for stimulating excisive recombination.

        <p>RDFs typically inhibit integrative recombination as well as stimulate excisive recombination in vitro (e.g., λ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b007">7</xref>], P2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b046">46</xref>], ϕRv1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b036">36</xref>]); since the substrates and reaction requirements for excision were not yet established, we first explored the ability of Bxb1 gp47 to inhibit integrative recombination. We have previously described an in vitro integrative recombination assay in which one of the partner DNAs is part of a supercoiled plasmid and the other is a short linear DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b034">34</xref>]. Addition of purified gpInt catalyzes formation of a linear DNA product containing 
					<italic>attL</italic> and 
					<italic>attR</italic> that can be readily separated from both substrates by agarose gel electrophoresis. Addition of Bxb1 gp47 was observed to strongly inhibit integrative recombination, whereas a similar protein preparation extracted from control cells without Bxb1 gp47 did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). Bxb1 gp47 is thus a potent inhibitor of Bxb1 integrative recombination.
				</p>
        <p>Tyrosine recombinases utilize relatively large 
					<italic>attP</italic> substrates with multiple binding sites for integrase and accessory factors leading to the formation of complex architectures at these sites—their cognate RDFs function by influencing the formation or disruption of these nucleoprotein architectures at specific substrates. Although Bxb1 integration requires only short DNA substrates (38 bp in 
					<italic>attB</italic> and 48 bp in 
					<italic>attP</italic>) and does not require accessory proteins, we initially used relatively large (&gt;300 bp) segments of 
					<italic>attL</italic> and 
					<italic>attR</italic> DNA to establish an in vitro excisive recombination assay in case either auxiliary Int-binding sites or Xis-binding sites are required for excision, as in the tyrosine integrase systems. Addition of purified gpInt and gp47 to a reaction in which one DNA is on a supercoiled plasmid and the other a short linear DNA results in the formation of a linear product, the amount of which increases with increasing concentration of gp47 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g005">Figure 5</xref>C, panel a). No recombinant product is obtained when gpInt and a control extract is added (panel b); recombination also does not occur when only gp47 or gpInt is present or when only one of the recombining DNAs is present in the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g005">Figure 5</xref>C, panel c).
				</p>
        <p>In order to determine the site requirements for excision, in vitro recombination was performed using large (̃350 bp) 
					<italic>attL</italic> or 
					<italic>attR</italic> DNA in supercoiled plasmids and varying sizes of linear partner DNAs. Recombination takes place efficiently in vitro even when short (50 bp) partner DNA is used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g005">Figure 5</xref>D); the efficiency of the reaction remains unchanged even when 
					<italic>attL</italic> and 
					<italic>attR</italic> are both less than 60 bp (
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>) demonstrating that like integration, excisive recombination uses short substrate DNA sequences (≤50 bp) and there is no requirement for accessory Int-binding sites in 
					<italic>attL</italic> and 
					<italic>attR</italic> for excisive recombination. DNase I footprinting confirms that gpInt protects a region of approximately 50 bp surrounding the cleavage site in both 
					<italic>attL</italic> and 
					<italic>attR</italic> (
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">Figure S3</xref>). Since these substrates are too small to include additional Xis-binding sites, Bxb1 gp47 presumably either binds DNA within the core Int-binding region, or alternatively may not interact directly with DNA at all and influences the direction of the reaction solely through protein–protein interactions with gpInt.

        <p>Since Bxb1 gp47 does not bind DNA directly, we examined whether it is able to alter Int–DNA complexes, presumably via protein–protein interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g007">Figure 7</xref>). We have shown previously that Bxb1 gpInt forms a single well-defined protein–DNA complex (Complex I) with each of the four 
					<italic>att</italic> DNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b037">37</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g006">Figure 6</xref>). However, when gp47 is included in binding reactions with either 
					<italic>attP</italic> or 
					<italic>attB,</italic> an additional slower migrating complex (Complex II) is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). The presence of gp47 in Complex II was confirmed by the ability of α-His antibodies (recognizing the N-terminal hexahistidine tag of gp47) to supershift Complex II formed with 
					<italic>attP</italic> or 
					<italic>attB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g007">Figure 7</xref>C). Association of gp47 with Int–
					<italic>att</italic> complexes could conceivably be mediated by either protein–protein interactions or by Int-dependent binding of gp47 to DNA, but the observation that Complex II forms with a smaller 
					<italic>attB</italic> substrate (60 bp)—most of which is involved in interactions with gpInt (
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg004">Figure S4</xref>)—argues against the latter possibility. We therefore favor the idea that gp47 interacts with gpInt–
					<italic>attP</italic> and gpInt–
					<italic>attB</italic> complexes through protein–protein interactions with gpInt, although interactions between gp47 and the DNA cannot be entirely ruled out (and we note that the 8 bp at the centers of all four sites are identical). Thus, in contrast to the architectural roles of Xis in the tyrosine integrase systems, gp47 presumably acts to inhibit integrative recombination by either stearically blocking synapsis of gpInt–
					<italic>attP</italic> and gpInt–
					<italic>attB</italic> complexes, or by changing the conformation of these complexes so that they either no longer synapse or synapse but cannot undergo strand exchange.

							<italic>attP</italic>/
							<italic>attB</italic>/
							<italic>attL</italic>/
							<italic>attR</italic> was monitored by native gel electrophoresis. Radiolabeled DNA fragments (̃300 bp) were incubated with either gpInt (0.072 μM) alone or gpInt with increasing concentrations of gp47 (0.45, 0.89, 1.78, and 3.56 μM). The positions of DNA–gpInt complexes (cmplx I) as well as tertiary complexes containing DNA, gpInt, and gp47 (cmplx II) are shown.
						</p>
            <p>(C and D) The presence of gp47 in the tertiary complexes shown in (A) was determined by the ability of α-His antibodies to supershift complexes observed by native gel electrophoresis. α-His antibodies were either added to reactions containing DNA, gpInt, and gp47 (indicated as lane 1), or first preincubated with gp47 for 30 min and then added to reactions containing DNA and gpInt (lane 2). The protein–DNA complexes were separated from free DNA on a 5% native PAGE. The positions of the tertiary complexes of gp47, gpInt, and DNA as well as the antibody supershifted complexes are indicated.</p>
            <p>(E and F) Bxb1 gp47 is required for trapping a synaptic complex in excision. A suicide substrate version of 
							<italic>attL</italic> DNA (5′ radiolabeled at both ends) was used that has a nick on the top strand positioned four bases to the 5′ side of the scissile bond. Bxb1 gpInt (72 nM) binds normally to this substrate to form Complex I (cmplx I), but when 
							<italic>attR</italic> partner DNA (200 bp) and gp47 (3.56 μM) is added, no recombinant products are released. Instead, a prominent slow-moving complex is observed that absolutely requires Bxb1 gp47 for its formation. We have identified this as a synaptic complex using 2D-PAGE (F). In brief, a vertical gel slice was removed from the last lane in panel E, incubated with proteinase K and SDS, and then electrophoresed through a second dimension. Approximately 50% of the radiolabeled DNAs in this complex correspond to 
							<italic>attP</italic> recombinant product and 50% correspond to a cleaved half-site. The bottom of the gel slice containing unbound 
							<italic>attL</italic> DNA was removed prior to the second dimension of electrophoresis. Further details on the characterization of these suicide substrates will be described in future publications.

        </fig>
        <p>Curiously, supershifted complexes are not formed when gpInt and gp47 are added to approximately 350-bp 
					<italic>attL</italic> or 
					<italic>attR</italic> DNA substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g007">Figure 7</xref>B), although they are weakly formed with high concentrations of gp47 with shorter (60 bp) DNA substrates (
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg004">Figure S4</xref>). To address the trivial explanation that the reaction conditions are simply not permissible for excision (or Complex II formation), we performed similar reactions containing both 
					<italic>attL</italic> and 
					<italic>attR</italic> DNAs (unpublished data) and showed that recombination does indeed occur. Thus, under recombination-permissive conditions, gp47 associates only weakly or unstably with gpInt–
					<italic>attL</italic> and gpInt–
					<italic>attR</italic> complexes, in sharp contrast to its more stable association with 
					<italic>attP</italic> and 
					<italic>attB</italic> complexes. The nature of the gp47–gpInt interaction is thus dependent on the specific DNA site to which gpInt is bound.
				</p>
        <p>Interestingly, addition of α-His antiserum to reactions containing gpInt, gp47, and either 
					<italic>attL</italic> or 
					<italic>attR</italic> DNA generates a supershifted complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g007">Figure 7</xref>D) consistent with the formation of weak or unstable complexes that can be stabilized by antibody binding. To exclude the possibility that a tertiary stable complex does form with 
					<italic>attL</italic> and 
					<italic>attR,</italic> but migrates with the same mobility as Complex I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g007">Figure 7</xref>), we have performed binding experiments with an MBP-gp47 fusion protein (unpublished data). Although this fusion protein does not support excision, it forms Complex II with both 
					<italic>attP</italic> and 
					<italic>attB</italic> DNAs that migrate considerable slower than with native gp47. Nevertheless, no Complex II is seen with MBP-gp47 and either 
					<italic>attL</italic> or 
					<italic>attR</italic> DNA (unpublished data). Finally, the order of addition of gp47 and the anti-His antibodies makes a significant difference to the amount of the supershifted complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g007">Figure 7</xref>D) with 
					<italic>attL</italic> and 
					<italic>attR,</italic> in a manner that is not seen with 
					<italic>attP</italic> or 
					<italic>attB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g007">Figure 7</xref>C). We conclude from these experiments that Bxb1 gp47 binds weakly to gpInt–
					<italic>attL/R</italic> complexes and that the bound forms are unstable during gel electrophoresis.

        <title>A Model for the Role of Bxb1 gp47 in the Control of Recombination Directionality</title>
        <p>Bxb1 gp47 is an unusual RDF and modulates the directionality of integrase-mediated site-specific recombination by a mechanism that is quite distinct from that used by the tyrosine integrase systems. The data presented here show that gp47 does not act through direct DNA interactions, but by changing the ability of gpInt–DNA complexes to participate further in the reaction pathway. The mechanism for the inhibition of integrative recombination may be relatively simple, involving the association of gp47 with gpInt–
					<italic>attP</italic> and Int–
					<italic>attB</italic> complexes—via protein–protein interactions—and preventing them from productively associating. However, it is noteworthy that these proposed gp47–gpInt interactions are qualitatively different, depending on the DNA substrate to which gpInt is bound. This is consistent with a model we have proposed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b039">39</xref>] suggesting that the conformations of gpInt–DNA complexes are different depending on the specific DNA substrate that is bound, and that the compatibility of the various possible conformations plays a role in the selection of sites for productive synapsis. It is, however, interesting that gp47 associates with both 
					<italic>attP</italic>- and 
					<italic>attB</italic>-bound complexes since these two substrates are quite distinct in both their sequence and in their length requirements and likely adopt different conformations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b037">37</xref>,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b039">39</xref>].
				</p>
        <p>How does Bxb1 gp47 promote excisive recombination without stably associating with gpInt–
					<italic>attL/R</italic> complexes? There are three main possibilities. First, gp47 could enzymatically modify gpInt in a manner that confers the ability to perform excisive recombination. However, this explanation seems unlikely since titration experiments show that gp47 acts stoichiometrically and not enzymatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g005">Figure 5</xref>C, unpublished data). Second, gp47 could act by shifting the dynamic equilibrium between a series of reversible reactions that usually favor integration. Thus, by binding to gpInt–
					<italic>attB</italic> and –
					<italic>attP</italic> complexes and preventing them from participating further in these reactions, 
					<italic>attP</italic> and 
					<italic>attB</italic> would eventually accumulate as products. Third, gp47 could associate with gpInt–
					<italic>attL</italic> and gpInt–
					<italic>attR</italic> complexes—albeit with lower affinity and perhaps unstably, and stimulate either synapsis of 
					<italic>attL</italic> and 
					<italic>attR</italic> or the initiation of strand exchange. To distinguish between these latter two models, we have utilized a suicide 
					<italic>attL</italic> substrate (similar to those described for the lambda system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b047">47</xref>,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b048">48</xref>]) that promotes the accumulation of synaptic complexes containing cleaved substrates covalently joined to gpInt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g007">Figure 7</xref>E and 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g007">7</xref>F). Formation of these complexes is strongly dependent on the presence of gp47 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g007">Figure 7</xref>E), eliminating the simple equilibrium model and strongly supporting a role for gp47 generating productive synaptic complexes.

        <title>Concluding Remarks</title>
        <p>We have demonstrated here that mycobacteriophage Bxb1 utilizes a novel RDF to regulate the directionality of recombination by its serine integrase. It is relatively large, does not bind to DNA, does not act by the remodeling of macromolecular architectures, and associates with Bxb1 gpInt in a DNA-dependent manner. Although it is not known what other functions gp47 might possess, its presence in other phages that use different integration systems, and its gene location within other replication functions, suggest that it may also act in DNA replication. While some recombination accessory proteins—including the RDFs of phages P2 and HP1 (Cox)—have dual functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b023">23</xref>,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b024">24</xref>], all of these act through DNA binding, so that although the biological roles may be quite distinct, the mechanisms are based on common DNA-binding specificities. Since Bxb1 gp47 appears to associate with gpInt in a highly specific manner that is dependent on the particular DNA substrate bound, it raises the interesting question as to whether it performs its other activities through similar and highly specific interaction with other phage-encoded—or possibly host-encoded—proteins in unrelated processes such as DNA replication.
