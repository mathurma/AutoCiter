				<article-title>An Unexpected Connection: Potassium Limitation and Ammonium Toxicity in Yeast</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>DNA microarray analysis of gene expression in steady-state chemostat cultures limited for potassium revealed a surprising connection between potassium and ammonium: potassium limits growth only when ammonium is the nitrogen source. Under potassium limitation, ammonium appears to be toxic for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content>. This ammonium toxicity, which appears to occur by leakage of ammonium through potassium channels, is recapitulated under high-potassium conditions by over-expression of ammonium transporters. Although ammonium toxicity is well established in metazoans, it has never been reported for yeast. To characterize the response to ammonium toxicity, we examined the filtrates of these cultures for compounds whose excretion might serve to detoxify the ammonium (such as urea in mammals). Using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry to assay for a wide array of metabolites, we detected excreted amino acids. The amounts of amino acids excreted increased in relation to the severity of growth impairment by ammonium, suggesting that amino acid excretion is used by yeast for ammonium detoxification.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Maintaining intracellular metabolites within acceptable levels in the face of an ever-changing environment is one of the great challenges faced by microorganisms. This maintenance of metabolic homeostasis is achieved largely by controlling the activities and concentrations of enzymes and transporters. One important means of controlling enzyme concentrations is transcriptional regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b003">3</xref>]. In the wake of the genomic sequence, comprehensive measures of transcript levels can be readily obtained. By combining these data with other high throughput measurements, such as metabolite profiling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b004">4</xref>], one can hope to capture how various cellular systems are interacting to maintain metabolic homeostasis (cf., reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b005">5</xref>]).</p>
      <p>Although there is a relatively rich literature describing microbial growth regulation in response to changes in limiting nutrients, responses to limiting ion concentrations have not been extensively studied. In this paper we show how genomic analysis led to the realization that potassium limitation is intimately intertwined with ammonium toxicity. Specifically, we demonstrate how the combined power of microarray analysis of transcripts and mass spectrometry–based analysis of small molecule metabolites led unexpectedly from experiments on potassium limitation to three major findings regarding ammonium: (1) growth of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content> is limited at low concentrations of potassium ions by ammonium toxicity; (2) ammonium toxicity also occurs, even in the presence of high concentrations of potassium ions, if ammonia transporters are constitutively expressed; and (3) the physiological response of yeast to ammonium toxicity, however achieved, involves excretion of large quantities of amino acids.</p>
      <p>Potassium ions (K<sup>+</sup>; hereafter referred to as “potassium”) are the most abundant intracellular cations in most types of cells, from <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> to humans. Intracellular levels are maintained in yeast against a steep chemical gradient, often exceeding 100-fold, with the intracellular concentration of 150 mM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b007">7</xref>]. This gradient is maintained in media containing less than 1 mM potassium and has been reported to play a crucial role in a variety of cellular processes, including regulation of cell volume, intracellular pH, and protein synthesis, and prevention of the deleterious effects of sodium ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b008">8</xref>]. Understanding of the role of potassium in yeast is relatively undeveloped compared to that in mammalian systems (e.g., in neurons and cardiomyoctes).</p>
      <p>With an initial aim of better understanding the physiological role of potassium ions in yeast, we studied the gene expression pattern of cells grown to steady state in chemostats with potassium as the limiting nutrient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b010">10</xref>]. Analysis of DNA microarray data from chemostat cultures growing in apparently limiting concentrations of potassium showed a surprisingly small set of substantial gene expression changes. Yet more surprisingly, the majority of these changes involved genes implicated in nitrogen metabolism. All the known ammonium assimilation pathways of yeast were strongly down-regulated in low-potassium media. Ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) was the sole source of nitrogen in these experiments; it is the preferred nitrogen source for bacteria and fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b011">11</xref>]. Subsequent experiments revealed that its presence was responsible for the poor growth of the “potassium-limited” cells.</p>
      <p>Excess ammonium is well known to cause toxicity in plant and animal systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b011">11</xref>]. Ammonium toxicity has been dismissed as a problem for microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b012">12</xref>] on the rationale that regulation of ammonium transporters can prevent excess ammonium from entering the cell. The similar ionic properties (charge, radius, and hydration energies) of potassium and ammonium raises the possibility that, under “limiting potassium,” toxic amounts of ammonium might enter yeast via potassium channels as has been observed for potassium channels in other systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b014">14</xref>]. Furthermore, experiments in yeast have implicated a link between ammonium and potassium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b016">16</xref>]. Below we report a series of studies confirming this suspicion. We also find via metabolite profiling that, when experiencing ammonium toxicity, yeast respond by excreting amino acids. Such amino acid excretion may constitute a rudimentary ammonia detoxification mechanism in the yeast.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>A chance observation in phosphate-limited chemostat cultures showed that it was possible to limit growth in such cultures even further by limiting the concentration of potassium ions in the medium. To study this possibility more systematically, a series of such nominally phosphate-limited chemostats were established with decreasing amounts of potassium in the medium. These experiments were done in an otherwise typical minimal yeast medium, which happens to contain 76 mM ammonium as the nitrogen source. The results of measurements of steady-state cell number and residual levels of phosphate are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040351-g001">Figure 1</xref>. As the supplied potassium concentration fell below about 3 mM, the cell numbers (and thus the biomass) were sharply reduced, and the residual phosphate was sharply higher, indicating that phosphate is no longer limiting growth.</p>

        <title>Transcriptional Response to Low Potassium Implicates Ammonium</title>
        <p>To investigate the physiological reason(s) for this apparent growth limitation by potassium, gene expression studies were carried out on the cells recovered from these chemostat cultures. The results of these gene expression studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040351-g002">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040351-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040351-t002">2</xref>) were remarkably informative. A surprisingly limited number of genes were strongly affected by the potassium limitation, and the great majority of these were genes known to be involved in nitrogen metabolism. The genes encoding major ammonium ion and amino acid transporters <italic>(GAP1</italic> and <italic>MEP2)</italic> were down-regulated 30-fold; virtually all other nitrogen catabolite–repressed genes were strongly down-regulated as well. The SPS-regulated amino acid permeases were all strongly up-regulated. Notably there was a more than 10-fold up-regulation of high-affinity and high-capacity permeases for glutamine <italic>(GNP1),</italic> for glutamate and aspartate <italic>(DIP5),</italic> and for tryptophan and tyrosine <italic>(TAT2)</italic>. Genes encoding the other amino acid and oligopeptide permeases in this group <italic>(AGP1, PTR2, BAP2,</italic> and <italic>MUP1)</italic> were up-regulated 5-fold or more. Together these permeases facilitate transport of all the amino acids except arginine.</p>

        <p>These results prompted another series of chemostat cultures, this time with two different fixed levels of supplied potassium (either “low” [1.3 mM] or “normal” [13 mM]) and varying levels of ammonium. The term “low” is used for 1.3 mM potassium, because typical yeast media contain 13 mM potassium. However, 13 mM potassium is higher than both seawater (0.5 mM potassium) and human serum (4 mM potassium), suggesting that in reality, 1.3 mM potassium may be more reflective of typical yeast environmental conditions than 13 mM potassium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b018">18</xref>]. The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040351-g003">Figure 3</xref>) clearly showed a decline of cell numbers (and hence biomass) that was a strong function of the ammonium concentration in 1.3 mM potassium media, but not 13 mM potassium media. Indeed, in 1.3 mM potassium media at levels greater than 300 mM ammonium, the yeast were entirely unable to maintain steady-state chemostat growth at reasonable dilution rates. These results led to the hypothesis that toxic levels of ammonium were leaking into the cell via potassium channels.</p>

        <p>The above results suggested that the reduction of biomass in low-potassium chemostats would be specific to ammonium as a nitrogen source. To test this, we compared a set of “normal” (13 mM) and “low” (1.3 mM) potassium chemostats with asparagine versus ammonium as the nitrogen source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040351-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Only the ammonium-fed cells were sensitive to low potassium, bolstering the hypothesis that the biomass reduction in low-potassium chemostats was due to ammonium toxicity.</p>

        <p>Besides the physiologically reasonable relationship between the growth impairment by ammonium toxicity and the level of amino acids found in the filtrates, there are three reasons for believing that the presence of amino acids in these filtrates is due to bona fide excretion. First, our chemostat medium was a completely defined minimal medium containing no amino acids, so the amino acids must have been synthesized by the yeast. Second, we tested cell viability at concentrations of potassium from 13.3 mM to 0.65 mM and found cell viability above 85% in all cases, making it unlikely that cell lysis was the source of the significant levels of amino acids in the filtrate. Third, using the isotope spiking system described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, we could estimate the total amounts of three different amino acids inside the cells (i.e., in the extract) relative to the medium (i.e., in the filtrate) in a 1.3 mM potassium chemostat culture. From these numbers (1:10 extract:filtrate for glutamine; 1:4 for alanine; and 1:3 for glutamate) it is clear that at least three fourths of the cells would have had to lyse to account for the amino acids in the filtrate, a finding completely inconsistent with the &gt;90% viability observed in that 1.3 mM potassium chemostat (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040351-sg001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Nitrogen assimilation into amino acids is expensive both energetically and in terms of amino acid carbon skeletons. Consistent with this, glucose consumption increased modestly under low-potassium conditions at 76 mM ammonium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040351-g006">Figure 6</xref>A), and dramatically as ammonium concentration was increased yet further at 1.3 mM potassium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040351-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). Ethanol production increased in parallel with glucose consumption, consistent with idea that these cells were fermenting more glucose for energy.</p>

        <title>Ammonium Toxicity and Amino Acid Excretion Caused by Over-Expression of Ammonium Transporters</title>
        <p>To test our hypothesis that ammonium toxicity was occurring via an unregulated leakage of ammonium ions, we undertook to provide the cells with unregulated ammonium ion influx independent of potassium channels. To this end, we constructed strains in which we replaced the promoters of known ammonium transporters with a strong, galactose-inducible promoter. <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> has three genes encoding ammonium transporters <italic>(MEP1, MEP2,</italic> and <italic>MEP3),</italic> each of which is normally under tight transcriptional regulation in response to nitrogen levels. <italic>MEP1</italic> and <italic>MEP3</italic> encode high-flux, low-affinity transporters, whereas <italic>MEP2</italic> encodes the low-flux, high-affinity transporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b022">22</xref>]. We produced strains that contained each of these genes individually under the control of a galactose promoter. In addition we placed the galactose promoter construct in front of a dubious open reading frame (ORF), <italic>YIL028w,</italic> as a control strain. The construction of these strains allowed us to examine how <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> would respond to a strong ammonium influx that could not be regulated by ammonium or other internal nitrogen metabolite levels.</p>
        <p>We found that expression from the galactose promoter of the high-flux ammonium transporters <italic>(MEP1</italic> and <italic>MEP3),</italic> but not the low-flux one <italic>(MEP2),</italic> caused lethality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040351-g008">Figure 8</xref>A) in ammonium-containing minimal media. To test whether this lethality was due to ammonium toxicity, we induced the promoters with galactose in the presence of several nitrogen sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040351-g008">Figure 8</xref>B). When asparagine, leucine, proline, or citrulline were used as a nitrogen source, strains expressing the <italic>MEP1</italic> and <italic>MEP3</italic> from the galactose promoter grew well, and showed no lethality, in the presence of galactose.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The central biological finding of this study is that there are circumstances under which <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> is subject to ammonium toxicity. We found this toxicity under two circumstances: lower than standard concentrations of potassium in the medium, and over-expression of genes <italic>(MEP1</italic> and <italic>MEP3)</italic> encoding ammonium ion transporters.</p>
      <p>We believe that ammonium toxicity has gone undiscovered in yeast and bacterial systems largely because standard defined growth media contain very high (likely supra-physiological) potassium concentrations. For example, although seawater contains only 0.5 mM potassium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b017">17</xref>] and human serum only 4 mM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b018">18</xref>], the medium in which <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. glutamicum</named-content> was recently tested for ammonium toxicity contained 92 mM potassium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b012">12</xref>]. Thus it may well be that ammonium toxicity in a variety of bacterial and fungal systems has been masked by the routine use of these very high potassium concentrations.</p>
      <p> Although ammonium toxicity in low-potassium medium greatly affected the steady-state biomass in the chemostat, gene expression studies did not indicate a strong stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b023">23</xref>]. Instead, a specific and coordinated transcriptional program that mainly affected nitrogen metabolism (specifically ammonium and amino acid transport), and a few cell wall–related functions. We interpret the transcription response as part of <italic>Saccharomyces</italic>' natural homeostatic repertoire.</p>
      <p>We believe all our observations are consistent with the following physiological interpretation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040351-g010">Figure 10</xref>).</p>

          <title>Model for Ammonium Toxicity and Detoxification in Yeast</title>
          <p>We believe the results of this paper support the following model. If ammonium is present in high concentrations in the environment, then ammonium ions can enter the cell unregulated via potassium channels. Although most of the ammonium can be taken up into new biomass (if excess carbon and other nutrients are available), the unregulated flux creates an excess of internal ammonium that becomes toxic. To reduce internal ammonium levels, amino acids are excreted (most likely through the SPS amino acid transporters). The nitrogen affixed to amino acids will not be taken up through the potassium channels and is thus detoxified with respect to the cell.</p>
        </caption>

      </fig>
      <p>First, ammonium ions and potassium ions are both transported by potassium transporters; under low (but physiologically reasonable) potassium concentrations; this results in a toxic inflow of ammonium ions when the latter are present in large concentrations in the medium. At the relatively very high concentrations of potassium found in standard laboratory media, this “leak current” of ammonium ions is small and tolerable.</p>
      <p>Second, the SPS amino acid transporters are somehow induced at high internal ammonium levels, facilitating the excretion of amino acids, which appears to be the major (possibly the only) means of ammonium detoxification available to <italic>Saccharomyces</italic>. Besides the transcriptional evidence for this role, it is notable that, of the 15 amino acids that we can readily detect from extracts of yeast cells, the only one that was found not be excreted was arginine, the sole amino acid that is not a substrate for the SPS system.</p>

        <title>Integrating Systems Biology Techniques to Discover New Physiology</title>
        <p>The discovery of ammonium toxicity in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> provides an example of the utility of systems biology techniques for making unexpected and yet fundamental biological discoveries. In this case, microarray analysis aimed at investigating potassium limitation surprisingly revealed that all the known ammonium assimilation pathways of yeast were strongly down-regulated. Investigation of this puzzling result led us to discover ammonium toxicity, a basic component of yeast biology that had been missed despite decades of study of related nutrient perturbations. Furthermore, the discovery of excreted amino acids would have been unlikely without metabolic profiling of the filtrate.</p>
        <p>Unlike animals, which excrete urea or uric acid in response to nitrogen toxicity, yeast appear to use the simpler expedient of excreting amino acids to reduce the intracellular ammonium concentration. Testing directly for urea or uric acid would have yielded a negative result, and trying to assay individually for all the nitrogen-containing organic compounds in yeast would have been impractical. Thus, although genomic tools to date have been used most commonly to bring global understanding to well-studied biological processes (e.g., to determine the overall extent of transcriptional changes involved in a particular biological response), the present study highlights the value of these tools for making focused biological discoveries more efficiently.</p>

        <title>Yeast and Bacteria May Show Similar Links between Limiting Potassium and Ammonium Toxicity</title>
        <p>Although ammonium toxicity has to our knowledge never been previously reported in microbes, evidence describing a link between potassium and ammonium has been noted previously. Rodriguez-Navarro and Ramos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b016">16</xref>] found that the minimal potassium requirement for optimal growth of yeast was 100-fold lower if ammonium was not used as a nitrogen source. As indicated above, our results and interpretation readily account for this observation.</p>
        <p>Buurman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b024">24</xref>] found evidence that ammonium could replace potassium in certain bacteria, i.e., that growth on limiting potassium improved with up to 100 mM ammonium as the nitrogen source. This result is opposite to those found here for yeast. However, there were certain similarities between the studies of Buurman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b024">24</xref>] and our own, including increased glucose utilization and glycolytic waste-product excretion (acetate or ethanol, depending on the organism) as increasing ammonium is added to potassium-limited chemostats. Also similar to our studies in yeast, Buurman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b025">25</xref>] found evidence for ammonium entry into bacteria via potassium channels. Nevertheless, future work is required to explore whether our key findings of ammonium toxicity and ammonium detoxification via amino acid secretion apply also to any prokaryotes.</p>

        <title>Ammonium Toxicity Is a New Component in the Complex Regulatory Network for Nitrogen Metabolism</title>
        <p>The metabolic and regulatory processes involved in sensing and utilizing nitrogen comprise a complex biological network (for review: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b026">26</xref>]). Ammonium plays a central role in this network. High levels of ammonium activate nitrogen catabolite repression which represses nitrogen uptake from the environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b027">27</xref>]. The high-affinity ammonium transporter (the product of the <italic>MEP2</italic> gene) is required for pseudohyphal differentiation upon nitrogen starvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b028">28</xref>]. Furthermore, ammonia excretion has been suggested as a signaling mechanism in long-term colony growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b029">29</xref>].</p>
        <p>The response to ammonium toxicity we describe here in high-ammonium and low-potassium conditions employs known features of the nitrogen metabolic and regulatory network of yeast. As we have shown, nitrogen catabolite repression is strongly activated. In contrast, expression of the SPS-induced amino acid transporters is strongly up-regulated. The literature offers two kinds of explanations for this phenomenon: first, it is well established that amino acids in the medium induce the SPS system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b031">31</xref>], and we have shown above that amino acids are indeed excreted; second, it has been reported that the SPS system participates in the production of ammonia pulses implicated in colony signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b032">32</xref>]. Currently, we favor the relatively simple idea that excreted amino acids induce the SPS system, producing a positive-feedback loop because the induction facilitates further excretion; however, direct participation of an ammonia signaling system cannot be ruled out. In this connection, it is worth noting that tiny concentrations of amino acids consistent with leakage (e.g., 1 μM leucine) suffice to induce the SPS system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b031">31</xref>].</p>

        <title>Role of the SPS-Induced Amino Acid Transporters</title>
        <p>The spectrum of amino acids that are excreted in response to ammonium toxicity is consistent with our hypothesis of the central role of the SPS transporters: out of the 15 amino acids that we routinely detect from yeast extracts, only arginine is not detectably excreted. The <italic>CAN1</italic> gene encodes the only transporter of arginine, and <italic>CAN1</italic> is not among the broad range of transporter genes induced by the SPS pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b034">34</xref>]. The conspicuous absence of arginine from the filtrate thus supports the idea that the SPS system is the primary means by which amino acids leave the cells.</p>
        <p>Although the SPS system has traditionally been considered a means of amino acid import, the transporters are passive and thus must, based on the second law of thermodynamics, be bidirectional. Consistent with this, we have recently obtained additional evidence supporting the ability of the SPS system to export amino acids (D. C. Hess, unpublished results): use of aspartate, a known inducer of the SPS system, as a nitrogen source leads to leakage of a broad spectrum of amino acids into the media, whereas use of proline, which does not induce the SPS system, does not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b038">38</xref>].</p>
        <p>Other potential routes to activation of the SPS system are suggested by the previous findings that amino acid excretion in yeast can occur in conditions of deregulated anabolism or impaired catabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b039">39</xref>], and that the transporter encoded by the <italic>AQR1</italic> gene can excrete amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b040">40</xref>]. Although Aqr1p might play a role in initiating amino acid excretion, we think it is unlikely to be the major contributor, as its transcription does not change significantly under conditions of ammonium toxicity, and the excreted amino acid profile of nitrogen toxicity differs from the excreted amino acid profile of an <italic>AQR1</italic> over-expressing strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b040">40</xref>].</p>
        <p>Beyond excreting amino acids, <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> might be able to detoxify excess nitrogen by excreting ammonium directly. Excretion of ammonium by the transporters encoded by the <italic>ATO1, ATO2,</italic> and <italic>ATO3</italic> genes has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b041">41</xref>]. Interestingly, transcription of one of these transporters <italic>(ATO3)</italic> is regulated by the SPS signaling cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b042">42</xref>]. We observe a modest 2-fold induction of <italic>ATO3</italic> under low-potassium conditions.</p>

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>The experiments described above show that, at physiological concentrations of potassium, excess ammonium is toxic to three strains of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> and to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. bayanus</named-content> as well. Our data show that detoxification involves massive excretion of amino acids, more or less in proportion to the degree of ammonium toxicity. Based on its induction, and the spectrum of amino acids excreted, we believe that the bulk of the amino acid excretion occurs via the SPS-induced transporters. Although we believe that, in the natural environment, excess ammonium leaks into the cells through the potassium channels, both the toxicity of ammonium and the amino acid excretion response can be recapitulated by artificially inducing excess ammonium inflow with <italic>MEP</italic> transporter over-expression. Taken together these data uncover a new facet of nitrogen metabolism in yeast and demonstrate that, like higher eukaryotes, yeast detoxify ammonium by excretion of nitrogen-rich compounds.</p>

        <p>LC-MS/MS analyses were performed on a Finnigan TSQ Quantum Ultra triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corporation, San Jose, California, United States), coupled with a LC-10A HPLC system (Shimadzu, Columbia, Maryland, United States). The instrument control and data analyses were performed through XCalibur software (version 1.4 SR1, Thermo Electron Corporation). The metabolites were detected in Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) mode allowing for scanning numerous metabolites in a single LC run. A complete list of the SRM parameters for every metabolite studied, as well as a full description of the LC-MS/MS method development and validation, has been given previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b047">47</xref>]. The MS instrumental parameters were: positive ionization mode, spray voltage 3,200 V, nitrogen as sheath gas at 30 psi and as auxiliary gas at 10 psi, argon as the collision gas at 1.5 mTorr, and capillary temperature 325 °C. Scan time for each SRM was 0.1 s with a scan width of 1 <italic>m/z.</italic></p>
        <p>Chromatography separation was achieved on a Luna aminopropyl (NH<sub>2</sub>) column (250 × 2 mm, particle size 5 μm; Phenomenex, Torrance, California, United States) at hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) mode, using a binary gradient solvent system. Solvent A is 20 mM ammonium acetate plus 20 mM ammonium hydroxide in 95:5 water:acetonitrile, [pH 9.40]. Solvent B is acetonitrile. The gradient was: t = 0, 85% B; t = 15 min, 0% B; t = 28 min, 0% B; t = 30 min, 85% B; t = 40 min, 85% B. Other LC parameters were: autosampler temperature 4 °C, column temperature 15 °C, injection volume 20 μl, and solvent flow rate 150 μl/min.</p>
        <p>Just prior to LC-MS/MS analysis, the filtration samples were spiked with three isotopic-labeled internal standards at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml each. The internal standards were, L-alanine (U-13C3, 98%; 15N, 98%), L-glutamine (U-13C5, 98%; 15N2, 98%), and L-glutamate (U-13C5, 98%; 15N, 98%), all obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, Massachusetts, United States). Error reported in the figures was based on the internal standard that varied the most over a set of conditions. All other metabolite standards were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, Missouri, United States). The metabolite concentrations in the samples were derived by comparing the peak area of the corresponding chromatography trace with metabolite standards in a separate run (external calibration). Spiking also allowed direct quantitation of the relative amounts of amino acids inside cells and in the filtrates (i.e., excreted). Cell extracts were performed with a method adapted from previous methods for metabolite extraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040351-b048">48</xref>]. Briefly, yeast cells harvested onto a filter were extracted twice with 100% methanol at −70 °C and then twice with 80% methanol at 4 °C. The isotope-labeled standards were added after the extraction process. In one experiment under nitrogen toxicity (1.3 mM potassium; 76 mM ammonium), we found in cell lysates the following amounts (nmoles per million cells): ala, 0.12; glu, 0.13; and gln, 0.03; for the filtrates: ala, 0.48; glu, 0.41; and gln, 0.31.</p>
