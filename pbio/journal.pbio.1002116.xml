<article-title>How Salmonella Survives the Macrophage's Acid Attack</article-title>
</related-article>
<abstract>
<p>In bacteria, one paradigm for signal transduction is the two-component regulatory system, consisting of a sensor kinase (usually a membrane protein) and a response regulator (usually a DNA binding protein). The EnvZ/OmpR two-component system responds to osmotic stress and regulates expression of outer membrane proteins. In <italic>Salmonella</italic>, EnvZ/OmpR also controls expression of another two-component system SsrA/B, which is located on <italic>Salmonella</italic> Pathogenicity Island (SPI) 2. SPI-2 encodes a type III secretion system, which functions as a nanomachine to inject bacterial effector proteins into eukaryotic cells. During the intracellular phase of infection, <italic>Salmonella</italic> switches from assembling type III secretion system structural components to secreting effectors into the macrophage cytoplasm, enabling <italic>Salmonella</italic> to replicate in the phagocytic vacuole. Major questions remain regarding how bacteria survive the acidified vacuole and how acidification affects bacterial secretion. We previously reported that EnvZ sensed cytoplasmic signals rather than extracellular ones, as intracellular osmolytes altered the dynamics of a 17-amino-acid region flanking the phosphorylated histidine. We reasoned that the <italic>Salmonella</italic> cytoplasm might acidify in the macrophage vacuole to activate OmpR-dependent transcription of SPI-2 genes. To address these questions, we employed a DNA-based FRET biosensor (“I-switch”) to measure bacterial cytoplasmic pH and immunofluorescence to monitor effector secretion during infection. Surprisingly, we observed a rapid drop in bacterial <bold>cytoplasmic</bold> pH upon phagocytosis that was not predicted by current models. Cytoplasmic acidification was completely dependent on the OmpR response regulator, but did not require known OmpR-regulated genes such as <italic>ompC</italic>, <italic>ompF</italic>, or <italic>ssaC</italic> (SPI-2). Microarray analysis highlighted the <italic>cadC/BA</italic> operon, and additional experiments confirmed that it was repressed by OmpR. Acidification was blocked in the <italic>ompR</italic> null background in a Cad-dependent manner. Acid-dependent activation of OmpR stimulated type III secretion; blocking acidification resulted in a neutralized cytoplasm that was defective for SPI-2 secretion. Based upon these findings, we propose that <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection involves an acid-dependent secretion process in which the translocon SseB moves away from the bacterial cell surface as it associates with the vacuolar membrane, driving the secretion of SPI-2 effectors such as SseJ. New steps in the SPI-2 secretion process are proposed.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The human pathogenic bacteria <italic>Salmonella</italic> encounters extreme and diverse conditions during the course of host infection. Survival and adaptation inside the host requires highly regulated virulence factors. When <italic>Salmonella</italic> is engulfed by a macrophage, it forms a vacuole-type structure that is actively acidified by the macrophage in an attempt to kill or neutralize the bacteria. However, the acidic pH in this “<italic>Salmonella</italic>-containing vacuole,” or SCV, does not kill the bacteria and is instead a major inducing signal for the expression of a specific class of virulence proteins. These proteins, encoded in the <underline><italic>S</italic></underline><italic>almonella</italic> <underline>P</underline>athogenicity <underline>I</underline>sland <underline>2</underline> (SPI-2), function as a nanomachine that mediates the delivery of <italic>Salmonella</italic> effector proteins that disrupt host immune defenses. In this paper, we investigate unanswered questions regarding the ability of Salmonella to survive the low pH and its consequences for bacterial growth in the SCV. Using a fluorescent biosensor, we monitored the intracellular pH of the <italic>Salmonella</italic> cytoplasm while it resides in the SCV during macrophage infection. Our results indicate that the bacteria cytoplasm acidifies in response to SVC acidity; this acidification requires the transcription factor OmpR, a known regulator of SPI-2. OmpR represses the <italic>cadC/BA</italic> operon, which is involved in the recovery from acid stress, thus enabling <italic>Salmonella</italic> to assume the acidic pH of the macrophage vacuole. Acidification is required for the secretion of virulence factors; blocking acidification resulted in a neutralized cytoplasm that was defective for SPI-2 secretion. Our work challenges existing views that bacteria regulate their pH to maintain neutrality, and provides a new model for <italic>Salmonella</italic> virulence factor secretion and infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gram-negative pathogens use type III secretion systems (T3SS) to secrete effectors into the host, which promote virulence and alter host signaling functions. <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium encodes two T3SS on <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity islands 1 and 2 (SPI-1 and SPI-2). Their unique secreted effectors are primarily active during different phases of infection. SPI-1 effectors promote adherence and initial infection of the intestinal epithelium, while SPI-2 effectors are responsible for survival and replication in the macrophage vacuole [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and bacterial spreading to distal organs [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The SPI-1 needle complex has been well characterized both functionally and structurally [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], but the SPI-2 needle complex is fragile and not very abundant and has not been well characterized. This raises questions about the conditions that induce SPI-2 needles during <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection and about how SPI-2 needles function. In the present work, we show that the <italic>Salmonella</italic> cytoplasm is acidified both in vitro and in vivo in response to acid stress. Furthermore, acidification is necessary for OmpR activation of SPI-2–dependent secretion, but not assembly. Thus, the macrophage vacuole provides signals that activate SPI-2 expression, assembly, and secretion in vivo, and these include acidification of the bacterial cytoplasm.</p>
<p>After entry into the macrophage, <italic>Salmonella</italic> resides in a modified intracellular compartment, the <italic>Salmonella</italic>-containing vacuole (SCV). Several studies indicate that the pH of this compartment is approximately 5 [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and the SCV is comparable to a normal phagosome in terms of its biogenesis [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Once inside the vacuole, the EnvZ/OmpR two-component system is activated. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, the EnvZ/OmpR system is a sensor of osmotic stress, regulating expression of outer membrane porins [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We recently discovered that the EnvZ histidine kinase responds to <bold>cytoplasmic</bold> osmotic stress rather than extracellular stress, and it is capable of sensing osmolality and activating its downstream target OmpR without being in the membrane [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Based on this result, we postulated that <italic>Salmonella</italic> might respond to the acidic pH of the macrophage vacuole by acidifying its cytoplasm, providing the protons that drive formation of the activated conformation of EnvZ, which promotes phosphorylation and phosphotransfer to OmpR [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Thus, we set out to measure the cytoplasmic pH of <italic>Salmonella</italic> while it resides in the SCV. For these experiments, we employed a novel DNA biosensor (the “I-switch”) that undergoes non-Watson-Crick base pairing in the presence of excess protons, resulting in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We tested the I-switch in <italic>Salmonella</italic> in vitro and then used I-switch–containing bacteria to infect RAW264.7 macrophages. This study represents the first application of the I-switch in which it has been used to measure the unknown pH of an intracellular compartment. Our results indicate that in vitro, <italic>Salmonella</italic> acidifies its cytoplasmic compartment in response to extracellular acid stress, and during infection, the <italic>Salmonella</italic> cytoplasm rapidly acidifies in response to the low pH of the vacuole in which it resides. Thus, the bacterial cytoplasm responds positively to extracellular (vacuolar) pH changes. Furthermore, EnvZ and OmpR are completely required for acidification, establishing OmpR as a regulator of genes that enable <italic>Salmonella</italic> to survive the acid stress of the SCV. The known, well-characterized targets of OmpR regulation, including OmpC, OmpF, and SPI-2 [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] were not required for acidification, indicating that new, unidentified OmpR targets were involved. Microarray analysis in the absence and presence of <italic>ompR</italic> at pH 5.6 indicated that approximately 390 genes were up-regulated. Of interest was the cadaverine operon <italic>cadC/BA</italic>, which is involved in recovery from acid stress. In the macrophage vacuole, these genes were repressed by OmpR and the <italic>Salmonella</italic> cytoplasm remained acidified. In the absence of <italic>ompR</italic>, <italic>Salmonella</italic> regulated its intracellular pH and returned to near neutral in a CadC/BA-dependent manner. This activation of EnvZ/OmpR by acid stress stimulates production of the SsrA/B two-component system (located on SPI-2), and ultimately, expression of SPI-2-secreted effectors [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
<p>During <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection, bacteria switch from assembling structural components of the T3SS (represented herein by the translocon SseB) to secreting effectors (SseJ in this study) into the host cytosol to modify host functions. We used the I-switch to test an existing model that proposed a neutralization step was required for the switch from translocon secretion to effector secretion. Our results indicate that when the vacuole is not acidified, effector secretion does not occur, in agreement with some previous results [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] but differing from others [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Interestingly, we found that the onset of SseJ effector secretion correlated with an outward movement of the SseB translocon away from the bacterial cell surface. This outward movement coincided with an association of SseB with the vacuolar membrane. This step required vacuolar acidification, since the presence of the V-ATPase inhibitor Bafilomycin prevented vacuolar acidification and SseB remained on the <italic>Salmonella</italic> cell surface. As a result, effector secretion into the host cytosol was prevented. Our results suggest a new model where acidification of the bacterial cytoplasm drives the secretion and release of translocon protein(s) from the bacterial cell surface, which in turn facilitates effector secretion.</p>

<title>The I-switch Tracks Intracellular pH in <italic>Salmonella</italic></title>
<p>To determine the impact of acid stress on <italic>Salmonella</italic> intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>), we used the I-switch (I<sub>A488/A647</sub>) labeled at its 5′ and 3′ termini with Alexa-488 and Alexa-647, respectively, as a cytoplasmic pH sensor. The I–switch consists of cytosine-rich unpaired regions that form an anti-tetraplex CH<sup>+</sup>.C by alternate Watson and Crick base pairing in the presence of protons. This leads to a “closed” conformation of DNA, enabling FRET to occur between the fluorophore pairs. This process is reversible, and at neutral pH, the I-switch dissociates into an open, extended conformation because of electrostatic repulsion between the duplex arms [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We first compared the fluorescence intensity of the donor alone (520 nm, "D") and the acceptor alone (666 nm, "A") with the fluorescence of the I-switch containing both donor and acceptor. This provided a determination of the cross-talk between the fluorophores, which was negligible (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>). I-switch labeled with Alexa 488 and Alexa 647 was suspended in buffers ranging from pH 5.0 to 7.2. The samples were excited at 480 nm and spectra were recorded in a Tecan spectrophotometer (GENios) from 510 to 700 nm. A D/A curve as a function of pH was plotted from the ratio of donor (520 nm) to acceptor (666 nm) intensities to generate the in vitro standard curve (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). The I-switch exhibited a sigmoidal increase over this range due to the formation of the I-motif in the closed state.</p>

<p>Wild-type (WT) <italic>Salmonella</italic> was electroporated with 6 μM I-switch and recovered in SOC for 1 h at 37°C, followed by three washes with PBS. Bacteria were then clamped at various pH values in K<sup>+</sup>-rich buffer containing 40 μM nigericin for 1 h at room temperature (RT) and imaged on an Applied Precision Delta Vision inverted wide-field fluorescence microscope. The fluorescence intensity of both donor and acceptor channels of 50 cells were measured for every pH value indicated in the figure. The ratio of D/A intensities were obtained and the normalized D/A ratios were plotted as a function of pH, which yielded a sigmoidal intracellular calibration curve (<bold>A</bold>).

We used 6 μM I<sub>A488/A647</sub> for electroporation, since it showed optimum fluorescence at both donor and acceptor channels inside bacterial cells; this concentration was used in all subsequent experiments.

<title>Extracellular Acid Stress Acidifies the <italic>Salmonella</italic> Cytoplasm and Requires EnvZ/OmpR Activation</title>
<p>We next measured the change in cytoplasmic pH (pH<sub>i</sub>) in response to varying the pH of the extracellular media (pH<sub>e</sub>). <italic>Salmonella</italic> containing the I-switch were subjected to acid stress and the fluorescence was measured in SPI-2–inducing (pH<sub>e</sub> 5.6) and non-inducing (pH<sub>e</sub> 7.2) conditions over time (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>).

Acidification was readily reversible upon addition of extracellular media at alkaline pH (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>), which restored the near neutrality of the cytoplasm. This result further demonstrates the functionality of the I-switch; i.e., it is not degraded, because it can reversibly switch from an open state (low FRET at neutral pH) to a closed state (high FRET at acidic pH) in response to changes in pH<sub>e</sub>.</p>

The requirement of the cytoplasmic domain of the EnvZ kinase only (EnvZc) further indicates that the I-switch is in the cytoplasm and the cytoplasmic pH becomes acidic under these conditions. Acidification was not dependent on growth phase, but was similar at both exponential and stationary phase (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>An alternative method employed by many <italic>Salmonella</italic> researchers for examining intracellular bacteria involves Triton solubilization at various time points post-infection to recover bacteria from macrophages. Although this method is less rigorous than direct visualization by confocal microscopy, the results obtained using this approach were in agreement with the microscopy (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>). The pH<italic>i</italic> of cells recovered after solubilization was determined from the reference intracellular standard curve.

<p>To examine whether OmpR repression was a result of a direct interaction, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C–5F</xref>). DNA sequences upstream of <italic>cadC</italic> (-354 to -3), upstream of <italic>cadB</italic> (-362 to -1) and 264-bp upstream to 34-bp downstream of <italic>cadA</italic> relative to the ATG in each case were amplified using primers that were biotinylated on the 5′-ends. The resulting biotinylated DNA fragment was used in the assay with purified OmpR or OmpR~P prepared by phosphorylation from acetyl phosphate (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The formation of an OmpR~P-DNA complex is clearly visible in the presence of 0.3 μM OmpR~P at both <italic>cadB</italic> and <italic>cadC</italic> promoters (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D and 5E</xref>).

Neither OmpR nor OmpR~P bound to a 60 bp biotin end-labeled Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen <bold>(</bold>EBNA) DNA, a control for non-specific binding (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref>). In the absence of phosphorylation, OmpR bound to DNA (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D and 5E</xref>), but with considerably lower affinity [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].

<p>We next measured the intracellular pH of the <italic>cadBA</italic> null strain in the macrophage vacuole and compared it to the WT and <italic>ompR</italic> null strains (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5G and 5H</xref>). If OmpR functions as a repressor of <italic>cadC/BA</italic> (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>), we would expect the <italic>cadBA</italic> null strain to be similar to the WT strain in terms of cytoplasmic acidification, i.e., knocking out <italic>cadBA</italic> would be the same as OmpR repressing <italic>cadBA</italic>. Indeed, the pH<sub>i</sub> of the <italic>cadBA</italic> null strain was similar to WT <italic>Salmonella</italic> and unlike the bafilomycin-treated strain or the <italic>ompR</italic> null strain (see Figs <xref rid="pbio.1002116.g004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002116.g005" ref-type="fig">5G and 5H</xref>). This result identifies the <italic>cadC/BA</italic> operon as the major system that eliminates protons upon acid stress and maintains pH homeostasis when <italic>Salmonella</italic> is in the macrophage vacuole. OmpR represses the <italic>cadC/BA</italic> system to prevent recovery from acidification.

<p>Over-expression of <italic>cadBA</italic> was able to completely over-ride the OmpR-dependent acidification, and the <italic>Salmonella</italic> cytoplasm remained neutral both during macrophage infection and in response to in vitro acid stress (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5G and 5H</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002116.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>).

<p>We next investigated the kinetics of translocon secretion by immuno-labeling SseB in macrophages at various times post-infection. <italic>Salmonella</italic> were visualized using anti-LPS antibody up to 6 h. SseB was detectible immediately 30 min post-infection at one locus of the cell, and the number of SseB-labeled cells increased over time. After 3.5 h, SseB was no longer associated with a majority of <italic>Salmonella</italic> cells, but was removed from the cell surface (Figs <xref rid="pbio.1002116.g006" ref-type="fig">6A</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002116.g007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). SseB was also detected in <italic>Salmonella-</italic>infected macrophages treated with BAF, but SseB remained on the bacterial cell surface (Figs <xref rid="pbio.1002116.g006" ref-type="fig">6B</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002116.g007" ref-type="fig">7A</xref>).</p>

<title>Measurement of SseB from the <italic>Salmonella</italic> Cell Surface</title>
<p>To measure the extent to which SseB protein was separated from the bacterial cell surface, the Distance Transformation function of Imaris Software (version 7.7.1) was employed. The distance of the red SseB translocon protein to the nearest green <italic>Salmonella</italic> cell was measured by applying the distance transformation on the green channel surface to generate a new channel whose intensity indicated the shortest distance to the surface object border. Hence, for each red SseB protein spot, the minimum distance to its nearest green cell was obtained. For each time point post-infection, the distance of 50 SseB protein spots from the nearest cells were measured. A distance value of 0 indicated that SseB was attached to the cell surface, whereas a distance value larger than 0 indicated that SseB was separated from the surface. The percentage of distant SseB was plotted over time post-infection (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>). Using this approach, it was evident that the vast majority of SseB (&gt;60%) were no longer surface-associated by 3.5 h, and by 6 h post-infection this value increased to 88% (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>). When acidification was prevented by treatment with BAF, the number of cells in which SseB was detached was only 5%–10%. Measurements of the distance (in μm) of SseB from the bacterial cell surface as a function of time post-infection are shown in (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). At 6 h post-infection, the average distance from the <italic>Salmonella</italic> cell surface was approximately 3 μm, indicating that SseB was no longer cell-surface associated.</p>

<title>SseB Co-localizes with the SCV Membrane after it Separates from the Bacterial Surface</title>
<p><italic>Salmonella</italic> translocated effectors (SifA, SseF, SseG, PipB, and SpiC) localize to the SCV and to its tubular membranous structures termed <italic>Salmonella</italic>-induced filaments (Sifs) [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The Sifs extend from and connect SCVs during <italic>Salmonella</italic> replication inside host cells [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Therefore it was possible that once SseB was separated from the cell surface, it might be in association with endosomal tubules of vacuolar membrane origin. To address this question, we used immunofluorescence to compare the localization of SseB with the endosomal membrane marker, LAMP-1. RAW macrophages were infected with <italic>Salmonella</italic> WT harboring pFPV25.1 for constitutive expression of GFP and immunolabeled for LAMP-1 (blue) and SseB (red). Confocal microscopic images indicated that when SseB was separated from the <italic>Salmonella</italic> surface, it was co-localized with LAMP-1 positive membranes, resulting in magenta staining of SseB (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A</xref>). Nearly 90% of the translocon protein SseB was co-localized with LAMP-1 by 3.5 h and this level did not change up to 6 h post-infection (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8B</xref>).</p>

<p>In the macrophage vacuole, a single focus of SseB was evident on the bacterial surface (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). This was similar to the localization of SseB that we observed in vitro (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10A Fig</xref>, bottom panel). Other components of the T3SS exhibited similar patterns of localization, including the outer membrane ring protein SsaC (top panel) and the inner membrane ring protein SsaJ (middle panel). Thus, the SPI-2 needle complex is localized primarily near to one end of the cell pole, unlike SPI-1 needles, which are distributed all over the bacterial surface [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. An <italic>ssaC</italic> null strain was deficient for secretion and SseB was retained in the cytoplasm, substantiating that the focal assembly of the SPI-2 needle complex was competent for SPI-2 effector secretion (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10B Fig</xref>). Our observation that only approximately 13% of the population expressed SPI-2 needles on their surface in vitro highlights that, in contrast to SPI-1, SPI-2 is not abundant.</p>

<title>Acidification Leads to SseJ Effector Secretion After SseB Translocon Surface Release</title>
<p>To gain insight into the fate of effector secretion, we also compared the kinetics of SseJ secretion in <italic>Salmonella</italic>-infected macrophages by immunofluorescence microscopy. A strain expressing SseJ-HA was completely comparable to WT in terms of its intracellular pH response and replication in macrophages. SseJ-HA secretion was first detected 3.5 h post-infection in macrophages, similar to a time course of SseF-HA expression in HeLa cells reported previously [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The percentage of cells secreting SseJ increased between 3.5 and 6 h post-infection (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>, visible as red puncta in the macrophage cytoplasm). In contrast to SseB secretion (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>), SseJ was not translocated in the presence of BAF, indicating that cytoplasmic acidification was essential for effector secretion (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9B</xref>, lower panel; i.e., no red puncta are visible in the BAF-treated macrophages). SseJ secretion was subsequent to SseB release from the bacterial surface (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). These results are in agreement with previous results [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] but significantly differ from other studies that reported that a neutralization step from the host was required for SPI-2 effector secretion [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Our results indicate that formation of the translocon pore is essential and precedes effector secretion. To verify that the translocon complex was required for effector secretion, we monitored the kinetics of SseJ secretion in an <italic>sseB</italic> null strain expressing SseJ-HA. No translocation of SseJ was evident, even after 6 h post-infection in the macrophages in the absence of SseB (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Nucleic acids have been employed as remarkable tools to create synthetic nanomachines like DNA tweezers, walkers, and DNA-hybridization motors [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. We describe herein a successful application of an artificially designed nanomachine in <italic>Salmonella</italic> to determine pH values under relevant physiological conditions that were previously unknown. The I-switch was effectively taken up by <italic>Salmonella</italic> after electroporation with ≥80% transformation efficiency (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12 Fig</xref>). However, at later time points, the limitation of the I-switch was apparent upon bacterial cell division, which resulted in dilution of I-switch positive cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12 Fig</xref>). In the macrophage vacuole, bacterial cell division is slower and the I-switch is effective for longer periods. Nevertheless, in the present study, using the I-switch, we measured a rapid acidification of the bacterial cytoplasm within 30 min upon entry into the SCV, followed by a further decrease to pH<sub>i</sub> 5.65 over 3 h of infection.</p>
<p>Our results present evidence of <bold>cytoplasmic</bold> acidification of <italic>Salmonella</italic> inside the SCV during macrophage infection. This pH drop is a result of SCV acidification upon <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Since the pH of the SCV remained below 5 during 6 h post-infection [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and in the present study we show that the <italic>Salmonella</italic> cytoplasm mirrors vacuolar pH, we argue that intracellular acidification persists during the phase of macrophage infection when the translocon and effectors are being secreted. Both enumerated bacteria from macrophages and intracellular bacteria within the SCV reported similar intracellular pH values (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002116.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>). Our results go beyond measuring the pH of the SCV and link vacuolar pH to acidification of the <italic>Salmonella</italic> <bold>cytoplasm</bold>.</p>
<p>Our results differ substantially from studies in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> in suspension that reported an initial drop in intracellular pH after extracellular acid stress, followed by a rapid recovery within minutes [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. More recent experiments in single cells on poly (L-lysine)-coated coverslips reported that 2%–23% of individual cells failed to recover from pH<sub>i</sub> 5.5 [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], indicating significant stochastic variation. Current experiments underway in our laboratory indicate fundamental differences between <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> (Chakraborty and Kenney, manuscript in preparation). Previous reports have shown that bacterial recovery times varied depending on the composition of the media and required potassium, presumably to stimulate K<sup>+</sup>-dependent proton efflux [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. This rapid response was shown to require the <italic>cadBA</italic> operon [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], which would lead to a rapid neutralization. However, we found no evidence of K<sup>+</sup>-dependent intracellular neutralization in <italic>Salmonella</italic> (Chakraborty and Kenney, manuscript in preparation). Our experiments emphasize the role of EnvZ/OmpR in controlling intracellular <italic>Salmonella</italic> pH inside the SCV during macrophage infection. The intracellular pH of both <italic>envZ</italic> and <italic>ompR</italic> null mutants were not responsive to in vitro acid stress (Figs <xref rid="pbio.1002116.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002116.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, the OmpR/EnvZ two-component regulatory system plays a pivotal role in the modulation of gene expression in response to changes in extracellular pH [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The OmpR/EnvZ system is essential for <italic>Salmonella</italic> replication and survival within macrophages ([<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; see also <xref rid="pbio.1002116.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S13 Fig</xref>) and to render full virulence in mice [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The <italic>ompR</italic> mutant strain showed a replication defect in macrophages, similar to that of SPI-2 deficient <italic>ssaC</italic> null strain (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S13 Fig</xref>). To verify that intracellular acidification was essential for replication and survival within macrophages, we infected RAW264.7 macrophages with the <italic>cadBA</italic> over-expressed strain of <italic>Salmonella</italic> and monitored its ability to survive and replicate. Indeed, the <italic>cadBA</italic> over-expressed strain showed a similar replication defect as the SPI-2–deficient <italic>ssaC</italic> null strain. This result suggests that intracellular acidification increases the replication and survival fitness of <italic>Salmonella</italic> during macrophage infection.</p>
<p>Recently, it was shown that the inner membrane protein MgtC binds to AtpB, the <italic>a</italic> subunit of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase, inhibiting proton translocation and ATP synthesis [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In our experiments, the <italic>mgtC</italic> null strain was completely comparable to the WT in terms of its intracellular pH response (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>). The <italic>mgtC</italic> null strain exhibited an increase in intracellular ATP levels (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9A Fig</xref>), in agreement with previous reports [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Under our experimental conditions, <italic>mgtC</italic> transcripts were identical in both the WT and <italic>ompR</italic> null strains (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9B Fig</xref>), eliminating a role for OmpR in regulating MgtC [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. These results suggest that different signaling pathways (e.g., EnvZ/OmpR versus PhoQ/PhoP) may play significant roles under different, unique activating conditions.</p>
<p>Our previous structural analysis of OmpR determined the physical basis for the ability of OmpR to function as a global regulator [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. OmpR binds to AT-rich DNA, making phosphate backbone contacts, but very few base contacts [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Furthermore, OmpR contacts can vary at different promoters, i.e., DNA contacts are different at the porin genes compared to the SPI-2 <italic>ssrA</italic> gene [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. This property of OmpR enables it to become a regulator of horizontally acquired genes during the course of evolution and to play a significant role in the response to acid stress. A previous study in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> reported that switching from aerobic to anaerobic respiration was important for surviving acid stress and also demonstrated a key role for OmpR in this switch, although no direct targets were identified [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The identified genes lacked complete OmpR binding sites, although OmpR binding sites are notoriously degenerate and difficult to define [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. This lack of specificity makes OmpR a good global regulator, because it does not require specific amino acid/base contacts.</p>
<p>The SPI-2 T3SS is essential for survival of <italic>Salmonella</italic> within phagocytes [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], by avoiding the terminal stages of the degradative pathway [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Acidic pH and other environmental factors play an important role in the induction of SPI-2 genes [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Co-localization of <italic>Salmonella</italic> with the lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1), clearly indicated that I-switch-incorporated <italic>Salmonella</italic> were in the SCV within 30 min after infection in macrophages and remained so during 6 h of macrophage infection (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S14 Fig</xref>). Thus, the acidified cytoplasm of <italic>Salmonella</italic> is a result of residing in the acidified SCV and is one trigger of the onset of virulence gene expression. This view is substantiated by our results with BAF (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002116.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>), which demonstrated that blocking SCV acidification inhibited SPI-2 secretion.</p>
<p>SseB, SseC, and SseD form the translocon complex; SseC and SseD are membrane proteins, while SseB is soluble. Initially, SseB is on the bacterial cell surface inside the vacuole. Over time (approximately 3.5 h in our experiments), SseB moves further away from the <italic>Salmonella</italic> surface and becomes associated with LAMP-1 positive host membranes (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.g006" ref-type="fig">Figs 6</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002116.g009" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). This event coincides with pore-opening for effector secretion and might be dependent on vacuolar membrane contact. It is logical to assume that this separation occurs as the SsaG needle elongates, emerging from the SsaC ring in the outer membrane (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10A, 10B, 10E and 10F</xref>). In the absence of acidification, SseB was not released from the bacterial surface and effector secretion did not occur. Neither SseC nor SseD were detected in RAW264.7 cells infected with an <italic>sseB</italic> null mutant <italic>Salmonella</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], confirming an important role of SseB in forming the translocon complex. Furthermore, secretion of SseJ was not observed in RAW264.7 cells infected with an <italic>sseB</italic> null <italic>Salmonella</italic> strain, indicating that translocon pore formation is also essential for effector secretion. The observation that effector secretion commences approximately 3.5 h post-infection suggests that this is the time required for formation of the translocon pore spanning the vacuolar membrane. Our attempts to tag the needle filament protein SsaG have thus far been unsuccessful but are a focus of current research efforts. Alternately, the translocon complex may detach from the SPI-2 needle, remaining in the vacuolar membrane, and providing a pore for SPI-2 effectors (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10A–10D</xref>). Acidification leads to OmpR-P repression of the <italic>cadC/BA</italic> operon, resulting in cytoplasmic acidification of WT <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10G</xref>). In the <italic>ompR</italic> null strain, up-regulated CadC/BA consumes intracellular protons maintaining intracellular pH homeostasis (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10H</xref>).</p>

<p>Acidification was absolutely required for the secretion of effector SseJ in macrophages (<xref rid="pbio.1002116.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>). Our results are in agreement with some previous studies [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], but differ significantly from others [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], in that we never observe a neutralization step in the <italic>Salmonella</italic> cytoplasm prior to effector secretion. In summary, we used a novel biosensor and determined that the <italic>Salmonella</italic> cytoplasm acidifies immediately upon entry into the macrophage vacuole. This acidification was dependent on OmpR repression of the <italic>cadC/BA</italic> operon, and drives translocon release and subsequent effector secretion.</p>

<title>Cell Culture, Bacterial Strains, and Antibodies</title>
<p>RAW 264.7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, United States) and grown in a humidified 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> tissue culture incubator. Cell culture reagents were from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA, US) unless otherwise stated. RAW 264.7 were maintained in Dulbecco’s Minimal Essential Media (DMEM) containing 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 17.5 mM D-glucose with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). RAW 264.7 cells were always cultured in antibiotic-free media. Low passage number cells (&lt;15 after receipt from ATCC) were seeded in 24-well dishes (Nunclon) and grown O/N before infection. The cells were washed gently with PBS and removed from the flask by scraping. The cells were suspended at a density of 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well in 24-well plates. WT <italic>S</italic>. enterica serovar Typhimurium 14028s and the <italic>ompR</italic> null derivative (<italic>ΔompR</italic>) were used for all infection experiments unless otherwise indicated. DMSO was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO).

<p>pH clamping protocols were modified based on [<xref rid="pbio.1002116.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Double-labelled I-switch (I<sub>A488/A647</sub>) was diluted to 60 nM in clamping buffers (120 mM KCl, 5 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl, 1 mM CaCl, 20 mM HEPES buffered at various pH). The samples were excited at 488 nm and emission collected between 500–750 nm in a Tecan Spectrophotometer (GENios). The fluorescence intensity at 520 nm (D) was divided by the fluorescence intensity at 666 nm (A) and the D/A ratio was plotted over the pH range. For in vivo pH clamping experiments, bacterial cells electroporated with the I-switch were incubated in a K<sup>+</sup>-rich clamping buffer at various pH at RT for 1 h in the presence of 40 μM nigericin. Cells were placed on microscope slides (Marienfeld, Germany) coated with 1% agarose and then imaged by wide field fluorescence microscopy. Three independent measurements were recorded for each pH value and the D/A ratios were plotted as the mean ± SEM.</p>

<title><italic>Salmonella</italic> Infection in RAW264.7 Macrophages</title>
<p><italic>Salmonella</italic> were first electroporated with the I-switch as described. Cells were seeded onto overnight-grown monolayers of RAW264.7 cells at a multiplicity of infection of 100:1 in 24-well plates. The plates were centrifuged at 500 rpm for 10 min to synchronize the infection. The infection was conducted for 30 min at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with DMEM containing 100 μg/ml of gentamicin for 1 h at 37°C. Cells were again washed three times with PBS and incubated in DMEM containing 10 μg/ml gentamicin for the remainder of the experiment. For BAF-treated cultures, RAW264.7 cells were pre-treated with 25 nM BAF for 30 min prior to infection and 25 nM BAF was maintained in every step of the infection. At the stated time points, the cells were fixed using 3% PFA for 15 min at RT. The coverslips were mounted on a drop of gold anti-fade reagent (Invitrogen) and sealed with entellan (Merck). Samples were imaged using confocal microscopy (Nikon A1R) and analyzed by Image J imaging software. To inhibit vacuolar acidification, 25 nM BAF or an equal volume of DMSO were added to the macrophage cells 30 min prior to infection and maintained throughout the infection process.</p>

<title>Wide-Field Fluorescence and Confocal Microscopy</title>
<p>All the wide-field images were collected using an Olympus IX71 Inverted Microscope (Applied Precision DeltaVision Deconvolution microscope system) equipped with 100X, 1.4 numerical aperture (NA) objective lens with a mercury arc bulb (OLYMPUS U-RFL-T: Mercury 150W) as the illumination source. Image capture was performed with the CoolSnap HQ, a fast, high resolution, high quantum efficiency, cooled CCD camera (Photometrics CoolSNAP HQ2 (CCD); 1,392 x 1,040 pixels; 11 fps). Two sets of images were taken corresponding to (i) donor emission wavelength (525/36 nm) upon donor excitation (490 ± 20 nm) (donor image: D), and (ii) acceptor emission wavelength (666 nm long pass) (acceptor FRET: A) upon donor excitation (490/20 nm). Acceptor images (I) acceptor emission wavelength (666 nm long pass) upon acceptor excitation (645 ± 20 nm) were obtained for cells clamped at pH 5.2 and 7.1. Confocal imaging was carried out on an inverted Nikon A1Rsi-Polarizing Module equipped with CFI Plan ApochromatVC 100X, 1.4 numerical aperture (NA) objective lens by using a Coherent CUBE laser at 488 excitation with set appropriate dichroics. Excitation at 470/40 nm wavelength was performed through a 510 nm dichroic mirror, and emission was recorded through a 525/50 nm band pass filter on a Andor DU897 EMCCD camera to yield the donor image (D). Similarly, emission was recorded through a 700/75 nm band pass filter upon similar excitation to generate the FRET intensity (A). Multiple Z sections were taken (0.5 μm apart) and each image is represented as sum slices. Images were analyzed using ImageJ ver.1.42. All of the images were background-subtracted by taking the mean intensity over an adjacent cell-free area. Autofluorescence of unlabeled <italic>Salmonella</italic> in RAW 264.7 cells was measured and used to correct the determined pH values. However, there was no difference in the intracellular pH values when we corrected for auto-fluorescence compared with the uncorrected values. Because the measurement is ratiometric, auto-fluorescence did not influence the determined pH values. Images showing the D/A values were obtained by using the ratio plus plugin of ImageJ software. The high and low values were color-coded and calibrated to their respective pH values as described in the main text. For all studies in macrophages, the mean D/A intensity of at least thirty bacterial cells was measured and is represented as the mean ± SEM of three independent batches of experiments.</p>

<title>Measurement of BCECF in <italic>Salmonella</italic></title>
<p>The free acid form of BCECF was suspended in buffers ranging from pH 5.0 to 7.2. Fluorescence intensities were measured at excitation wavelengths of 488 and 440 nm and the emission wavelength was recorded at 525 nm in a Tecan spectrophotometer (GENios). This generated the in vitro standard curve. Overnight cultures of WT and the <italic>ompR</italic> null mutant of <italic>Salmonella</italic> were clamped in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer at various pH containing 40 μM nigericin and incubated in the presence of 20 μM BCECF-AM. Paired images were obtained by using excitation wavelengths of either 440 nm (pH-insensitive wavelength) or 488 nm (pH-sensitive wavelength). Fluorescence emission was recorded through a 525/50-nm band pass filter on a Andor DU897 EMCCD camera on an inverted Nikon A1Rsi-Polarizing Module by using Coherent CUBE lasers at 488 and 440 excitation with set appropriate dichroics. The ratios were plotted as a function of pH, and are comparable to the in vitro calibration curve. WT and the <italic>ompR</italic> null mutant of <italic>Salmonella</italic> were incubated at either acidic pHe (5.6) or neutral pHe (7.2) for 2 h. 20 μM BCECF-AM was added to the cultures for 30 min before imaging. To determine whether acidification was growth phase dependent, cells were grown until O.D. = 0.56 (log phase) or O.D. ≈ 2.3 (stationary phase) before the addition of the probe. The ratios of the fluorescence intensities of emission channel (525 nm) upon 488 nm excitation and 440 nm excitation were obtained as before. Cells were placed on microscope slides (Marienfeld Germany) coated with 1% agarose and then imaged. Images were first corrected for background fluorescence by subtracting an image of a cell-free area and analyzed by Image J imaging software.</p>
