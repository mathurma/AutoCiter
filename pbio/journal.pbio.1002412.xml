<article-title>The SMC-5/6 Complex and the HIM-6 (BLM) Helicase Synergistically Promote Meiotic Recombination Intermediate Processing and Chromosome Maturation during <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> Meiosis</article-title>

<abstract>
<p>During the first meiotic division, crossovers (COs) between homologous chromosomes ensure their correct segregation. COs are produced by homologous recombination (HR)-mediated repair of programmed DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). As more DSBs are induced than COs, mechanisms are required to establish a regulated number of COs and to repair remaining intermediates as non-crossovers (NCOs). We show that the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> RMI1 homolog-1 (RMH-1) functions during meiosis to promote both CO and NCO HR at appropriate chromosomal sites. RMH-1 accumulates at CO sites, dependent on known pro-CO factors, and acts to promote CO designation and enforce the CO outcome of HR-intermediate resolution. RMH-1 also localizes at NCO sites and functions in parallel with SMC-5 to antagonize excess HR-based connections between chromosomes. Moreover, RMH-1 also has a major role in channeling DSBs into an NCO HR outcome near the centers of chromosomes, thereby ensuring that COs form predominantly at off-center positions.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>During meiosis, faithful separation of chromosomes into gametes is essential for fertility and healthy progeny. During the first meiotic division, crossovers (CO) between parental homologs ensure their correct segregation. Programmed DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and resection steps generate single-stranded overhangs that invade a sister chromatid of the homolog to initiate homologous recombination. This culminates in the generation of a DNA double Holliday junction (dHJ). This can be acted upon by resolvases to produce CO and non-crossover (NCO) products, depending on where the resolvases cut the DNA. Alternatively, NCOs can also be produced by decatenation via the RecQ helicase‚ÄìtopoisomeraseIII‚ÄìRmi1 (RTR) complex. The mammalian RTR contains a topoisomerase, Bloom‚Äôs helicase, and RMI1/2 scaffolding components. It disassembles dHJs in vitro and contributes the major NCO activity in mitosis. Here, we provide evidence that the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> RMH-1 functions in distinct complexes during meiosis to produce both COs and NCOs in an in vivo animal model system. Strikingly, RMH-1 spatially regulates the distribution of COs on chromosomes, demonstrating that the RTR complex can act locally within specific chromosome domains.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During meiosis, the accurate segregation of chromosomes relies on the formation of crossovers (COs) and sister chromatid cohesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref001">1</xref>]. COs are produced by homologous recombination (HR)-mediated repair of programmed DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, the holocentric chromosome pairs usually undergo a single off-center CO, resulting in a cruciform and asymmetric bivalent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref003">3</xref>]. This is important to define the organization of kinetochore proteins, motor proteins, protein kinases, and the domains of cohesion release, which is necessary for the accurate segregation of homologs during anaphase I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p>During prophase I, several mechanisms guarantee the formation of COs as well as the repair of the additional recombination intermediates as non-crossovers (NCOs).</p>
<p>First, to ensure CO formation, programmed DSBs are induced in excess compared to the actual number of COs, e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref005">5</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref007">7</xref>]. Second, a subset of the early recombination intermediates are stabilized and protected by pro-CO factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref008">8</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref010">10</xref>]. CO maturation is supported by the MutSŒ≥ complex (MSH-4/5), sumo/ubiquitin ligases ZHP-3/RNF212, and HEI10 and the cyclin-related protein COSA-1/CNTD1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref011">11</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref016">16</xref>]. In addition to efficient CO designation, it is essential that the resolution of joint molecules (JM) at CO-designated sites is biased toward the CO outcome. JMs result from second-strand capture and DNA synthesis after strand invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref017">17</xref>]. Depending on where the cut is made by structure-specific endonucleases (resolvases), CO or NCO products can be generated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref018">18</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref021">21</xref>]. In <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, at least two parallel pathways of a redundant resolvase system have been defined (MUS-81/SLX-1 and XPF-1/HIM-6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref022">22</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref024">24</xref>]. It is unclear how the bias in resolution toward either a CO or NCO is achieved.</p>
<p>In yeast, the bulk of DSBs not destined to become COs are processed by synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) at an early stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref025">25</xref>]. In <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, a similar activity is attributed to RTEL-1 by D-loop displacement after strand invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref027">27</xref>]. NCOs can also be generated by the activity of the RTR complex, composed of a RecQ helicase (Bloom syndrome protein [BLM]), topoisomerase IIIŒ± (TOP3), and the RecQ-mediated genome instability 1 and 2 (RMI1,2) scaffolding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref028">28</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref030">30</xref>]. This complex provides a major NCO activity during mitosis. Importantly, patients with mutated BLM helicase display genomic instability and a cancer predisposition, and they exhibit a cellular phenotype of elevated COs between sister chromatids, which potentially drives cancer by loss of heterozygosity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref032">32</xref>]. In vitro studies have shown that the RTR complex dismantles double Holliday junctions (dHJs). A branch migration step mediated by the RecQ helicase brings the two dHJs in close proximity to allow the topoisomerase to unhook the two DNA strands by decatenation, stimulated by the scaffolding proteins RMI1/2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref033">33</xref>].</p>
<p>RMI1 was discovered as a protein associated with BLM containing protein complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref034">34</xref>]. It colocalizes with recombination foci containing BLM helicase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref035">35</xref>]. RMI1 depletion leads to destabilization of BLM and topoisomerase foci. Moreover, its depletion phenocopies the BLM mutant phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref035">35</xref>]. Furthermore, RMI1 directly interacts with both BLM helicase and TOP3, shown with pulldown experiments using recombinant protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref036">36</xref>]. Human RMI1 protein contains two oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) fold domains, in which the N-terminal OB fold binds both the helicase and the topoisomerase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref037">37</xref>]. Structural and biochemical studies established that RMI1 cooperates with the topoisomerase in the strand passage reaction during decatenation. The topoisomerase-generated nick allows strand passage of the other strand, in which RMI1 plays a role in the regulation of opening and closure of the ‚Äúgate‚Äù [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref039">39</xref>].</p>
<p>An ‚Äúanti-CO‚Äù role has been described for BLM orthologs in yeast, plants, mice, and <italic>Drosophila</italic> in meiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref040">40</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref045">45</xref>]. A recent study showed that, in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, <italic>him-6</italic> is required to eliminate persistent MutSŒ≥-independent recombination intermediates when an excess is induced by irradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref046">46</xref>]. Similar ‚Äúanti-CO‚Äù functions have been attributed to other members of the complex: Rmi1 and/or Top3 in yeast and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref047">47</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref052">52</xref>]. In yeast, Top3 and Rmi1 cooperate with Sgs1 to prevent aberrant joint molecule (JM) accumulation, but they also act later, without Sgs1, to allow chromosome separation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref052">52</xref>].</p>
<p>Despite the widely conserved anti-CO function of the RTR complex, several studies suggest that it could also contribute a pro-CO activity; however, a direct involvement has not been demonstrated. In <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, <italic>him-6</italic> (the BLM ortholog) is required to ensure that CO-designated recombination intermediates mature into interhomolog COs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref054">54</xref>]. In yeast, Sgs1 has been found colocalizing with the pro-CO factor Zip3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref040">40</xref>]. Nevertheless, in <italic>sgs1</italic> mutants, the recombination rate is increased rather than decreased, as one would expect if it favored CO formation. More recently, the Sgs1/BLM helicase has been proposed to have an early role in promoting COs, acting to disassemble unprotected strand invasion intermediates to channel them back into CO pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref056">56</xref>]. Furthermore, in a situation in which JM resolution is blocked (<italic>mms4 slx4 yen1</italic>), Sgs1 can promote CO formation. Here, <italic>sgs1</italic> might generate JMs with a certain configuration that could be recognized by the major yeast CO pathway Exo1-MutLŒ≥ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref055">55</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we present the role of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> RMH-1. We show that RMH-1 and HIM-6 localize at numerous recombination intermediates that will become either a CO or NCO. Consistent with its localization, RMH-1 plays genetically separable and antagonistic roles during meiosis. On one hand, <italic>rmh-1</italic> ensures CO formation at two levels: by promoting CO designation and by protecting CO-designated sites and promoting their maturation into chiasmata. Remarkably, RMH-1 and HIM-6 localize as closely juxtaposed doublets, suggesting that they may flank the two junctions of a dHJ CO intermediate. In addition, <italic>rmh-1</italic> prevents illegitimate connections between homologs redundantly with <italic>smc-5</italic>, an activity known from yeast meiosis to prevent multi-JMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref057">57</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref059">59</xref>]. Moreover, RMH-1 anti-CO activity is required to inhibit CO formation at chromosome centers, which would facilitate correct segregation of chromosomes.</p>

<title>RMH-1 (But Not RMH-2) Is Required for Robust Chiasma Formation and Chromosome Segregation in Meiosis</title>
<p>To establish the respective requirements of <italic>rmh-1</italic> and <italic>rmh-2</italic>, we examined the mutants for embryonic lethality, larval arrest, and a high incidence of males (Him) phenotype among the progeny. An increased incidence of males in the progeny indicates X chromosome nondisjunction during meiosis, as <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> hermaphrodites have the genotype X/X and males X/O. The combination of increased embryonic lethality with a Him phenotype further suggests the occurrence of aneuploid eggs arising from meiotic missegregation of autosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref063">63</xref>]. Increased larval arrest is indicative of somatic defects.</p>
<p>Analysis of <italic>rmh-1</italic> mutants revealed the cohort of phenotypes characteristic of a defect in meiotic recombination, as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g001">Fig 1G and 1H</xref>). Second, DAPI staining of oocytes at diakinesis, the last stage of meiotic prophase, revealed that a fraction of chromosome pairs was not connected by chiasmata in <italic>rmh-1</italic> mutants. Whereas in the wild type, six bivalents (chromosome pairs connected by chiasmata) can be seen in diakinesis oocytes, <italic>rmh-1</italic> mutant alleles showed an increase of DAPI-stained bodies, reflecting a mixture of bivalents and univalents (achiasmate chromosomes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g001">Fig 1B‚Äì1E</xref>). In the -1 oocyte (the most mature oocyte, next to the spermatheca, the oocyte prior to fertilization), we observed on average 8.9 ¬± 1.0 DAPI bodies in <italic>rmh-1(jf92)</italic> and 9.3 ¬± 1.4 in <italic>rmh-1(jf54)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). As the <italic>jf54</italic> allele behaved identically to the <italic>jf92</italic> insertion allele with regards to the hatch rate and Him and diakinesis phenotypes, and as we were unable to detect GFP::RMH-1 containing the <italic>jf54</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002412.s002">S2B Fig</xref>), we infer that <italic>rmh-1(jf54)</italic> behaves like a null allele. Interestingly, fewer univalents were observed in <italic>rmh-1(tn309)</italic> (7.4 ¬± 1.1 DAPI bodies), suggesting that RMH-1 function is differently affected by this allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). To confirm the presence of univalents in <italic>rmh-1</italic> mutants (and not fragments due to absence of DNA repair), we measured the average volumes of DAPI bodies in diakinesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002412.s003">S3A and S3B Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002412.s012">S1 Text</xref>) and confirmed both the presence of univalents and the absence of DNA fragments.</p>
<p>In contrast to the <italic>rmh-1</italic> mutants, the <italic>rmh-2(jf94)</italic> single mutant did not exhibit any meiotic phenotypes. However, all <italic>rmh</italic> mutants showed increased levels of larval arrest (around 12% for <italic>rmh-1</italic> mutants and 7% for <italic>rmh-2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g001">Fig 1I</xref>). Furthermore, the double mutant <italic>rmh-1(jf54); rmh-2(jf94)</italic> was inviable, suggesting a redundant function of the two genes in somatic tissue.</p>
<p>To better understand which meiotic processes are impaired in <italic>rmh-1(jf54)</italic>, we analyzed chromosome pairing, synapsis, and induction and repair of DSBs. No defects in pairing and synapsis were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002412.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). To study the induction and processing of DSBs, we assessed the appearance and disappearance of foci of the strand exchange protein RAD-51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g002">Fig 2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref064">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref065">65</xref>]. RAD-51 foci appeared with normal timing in the <italic>rmh-1(jf54)</italic> mutant, but accumulated at higher levels than in wild type and persisted at elevated levels through late pachytene. However, RAD-51 foci disappeared in diplotene, suggesting that repair of DSBs was delayed but did eventually occur. We also found that <italic>rmh-1</italic>-specific chromosomal defects depended on the induction of meiotic DSBs. In summary, meiotic recombination is aberrant in <italic>rmh-1</italic> mutants.</p>

<title>Dynamic Localization of RMH-1 in Distinct Foci during Pachytene Progression</title>
<p>To assess RMH-1 localization in the gonad, we expressed GFP::RMH-1 using its endogenous regulatory elements as a functional fusion protein. Indeed, GFP::RMH-1 is capable of rescuing embryonic lethality and the Him phenotype when expressed in the null allele <italic>jf92</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002412.s005">S5A and S5B Fig</xref>). GFP::RMH-1 was found in foci throughout pachytene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g003">Fig 3A‚Äì3C</xref>). In early pachytene, RMH-1 was first detected as a nucleoplasmic haze, and faint foci progressively appeared on chromosomes. During mid pachytene, RMH-1 foci increased in number and intensity. Mid pachytene nuclei contained, on average, 15.2 foci ¬± 3.6, ranging from ten to 25, and, in late pachytene, the number of RMH-1 foci drastically reduced to 5.9 ¬± 1.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). In late pachytene, the number of foci ranged from one to nine foci; however, the majority of nuclei contained six or seven foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). (This distribution is broader than the distribution of COSA-1 foci, visible as six signals in late pachytene. However, the mutant phenotype of <italic>cosa-1</italic> already suggests that it acts before the protein can be observed in the six prominent foci. In addition, we believe RMH-1 marks a stage of recombination, through which all mature CO intermediates have to pass).</p>

<title>Dynamic localization of RMH-1 to distinct foci in pachytene.</title>
<p>(A) In early pachytene (EP), GFP::RMH-1 is diffuse and few foci are detected on DNA. In mid pachytene (MP), high numbers of foci (up to 25 per nucleus) are observed (yellow square and B and B‚Ä≤).

(D) Quantification of the average number of RMH-1 foci per nucleus in EP, MP, and LP (<italic>n</italic> = 123 nuclei for EP, <italic>n</italic> = 205 for MP, and <italic>n</italic> = 180 for LP). Data are represented as mean +/- SEM.

<p>Importantly, RMH-1 foci seem to increase in signal intensity (about 1.8-fold) between mid and late pachytene. This suggested that the protein might accumulate over time.</p>
<p>RMH-1 localization in foci in pachytene is reminiscent of localization of markers of ongoing recombination events such as RAD-51 and CO-promoting factors MSH-5, ZHP-3, or COSA-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref064">64</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref066">66</xref>]. Moreover, RMH-1 localization depends on meiotic DSBs, since foci were absent in a <italic>spo-11</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002412.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). Co-immunostaining experiments indicated that RAD-51 foci appear and disappear earlier than RMH-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002412.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). RAD-51 foci appear in transition zone, peak in mid pachytene, and disappear in late pachytene. GFP::RMH-1 foci appear in early pachytene, peak in mid pachytene, and disappear in diplotene. Moreover, when RAD-51 and RMH-1 are present in the same nucleus, they do not colocalize (only 4.0 +/- 4.0% RMH-1 foci coincide with RAD-51) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g003">Fig 3F and 3F‚Ä≤</xref>). This suggests that RAD-51 and RMH-1 mark different recombination intermediates and that RMH-1 may act after RAD-51 removal.</p>
<p>In contrast with the lack of colocalization with RAD-51 foci, the six bright RMH-1 foci in late pachytene nuclei do coincide with the localization of pro-CO factors MSH-5, ZHP-3, and COSA-1 at the CO sites (90.1 +/- 10.7% RMH-1 foci colocalize with COSA-1 and MSH-5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g003">Fig 3G, 3J and 3K</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref066">66</xref>]. Interestingly, RMH-1 foci disappear before COSA-1 foci, which persist until diplotene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002412.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). RMH-1 foci also partially colocalize with the earlier MSH-5 foci present during mid pachytene; the brighter foci of each protein tend to colocalize, while the fainter ones do not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g003">Fig 3G‚Äì3I</xref>). Furthermore, we found that late-pachytene RMH-1 foci are severely reduced (to one focus on average) in <italic>msh-5</italic>, <italic>zhp-3</italic>, and <italic>cosa-1</italic> mutants, which fail to form CO-designated recombination intermediates. RMH-1 foci in mid pachytene are also less abundant and smaller in these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g004">Fig 4A‚Äì4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002412.s007">S7D and S7E Fig</xref>), suggesting that <italic>msh-5</italic>, <italic>zhp-3</italic>, and <italic>cosa-1</italic> also contribute to stable localization of RMH-1 during earlier stages. The dynamic localization of RMH-1 through pachytene suggests that it may function at both CO and NCO repair events.</p>

<p>The mid pachytene number of RMH-1 foci, at least twice the number of eventual COs, is consistent with RMH-1 localizing both at CO sites and at sites that will ultimately become NCOs. This is consistent with our analysis of GFP::RMH-1 localization following induction of excessive DNA breaks by ionizing radiation (IR, 50Gy). We found that at 4 h post IR treatment, the number of RMH-1 foci in mid pachytene nuclei had risen significantly, suggesting that RMH-1 was loaded on many of the excess recombination intermediates produced by IR. To understand what would happen to those excess recombination intermediates positive for RMH-1, we analyzed gonads 8 h post IR treatment (after this time, the nuclei with the increased number of RMH-1 foci should have reached late pachytene). However, at this stage, the numbers were reduced to wild type numbers of foci in late pachytene nuclei (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002412.s007">S7A‚ÄìS7C Fig</xref>). Thus, we conclude that RMH-1 marks recombination intermediates that can be increased transiently by irradiation but will be repaired as NCOs, as the final number of marked CO sites is not affected.</p>

<p>The robust accumulation of RMH-1 at CO sites, the dependence of its localization on pro-CO factors, and the presence of univalents in the <italic>rmh-1</italic> mutants together suggest that RMH-1 likely functions in promoting the CO outcome of initiated recombination events. Several lines of evidence provide further support for pro-CO role(s) for RMH-1. First, we tested whether <italic>rmh-1</italic> is required for normal localization of pro-CO factors by assessing the localization of GFP::COSA-1 in <italic>rmh-1</italic> mutants. This analysis revealed that only 75% of nuclei in <italic>tn309</italic> and 57% of nuclei in <italic>jf54</italic> had six COSA-1 foci (compared to 88% in wild-type) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g004">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>), indicating a deficit of CO-designated sites in <italic>rmh-1</italic> mutants.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we observed several indications of a delay in pachytene progression in both <italic>rmh-1</italic> mutants. First, we assessed localization of ZHP-3, which normally localizes along the full length of the synaptonemal complex (SC) during mid pachytene, then retracts during late pachytene to a short stretch and, finally, to a single focus at the CO site in diplotene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref066">66</xref>]; we found that ZHP-3 retraction was delayed in <italic>rmh-1(jf54)</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002412.s008">S8A‚ÄìS8D Fig</xref>). Second, we evaluated a readout of a checkpoint-like feedback mechanism that operates during <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> meiosis to coordinate meiotic progression with generation of CO-eligible recombination intermediates. A single chromosome pair that lacks a CO-eligible recombination intermediate can be detected and elicit a prophase progression delay, visible by the persistence of markers such as phospho-SUN-1 S8 on the nuclear envelope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref067">67</xref>]. SUN-1 S8Pi staining was prolonged in <italic>rmh-1</italic> mutants, indicating a delay in prophase progression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002412.s008">S8E‚ÄìS8H Fig</xref>), which is in line with delayed and/or impaired formation of CO-specific recombination intermediates. These data in combination with the observed reduction in COSA-1-marked CO-designated sites together indicate a role for RMH-1 in ensuring efficient CO designation.</p>
<p>Although the number of CO-designated sites is reduced in <italic>rmh-1</italic> mutants, CO designation still occurs to a large extent, as 57% to 75% of nuclei contain six COSA-1 foci. Moreover, the reduction in number of COSA-1-marked CO sites is not sufficient to account for the number of univalents observed. To calculate the expected number of DAPI bodies in diakinesis nuclei based on our quantification of COSA-1 foci in <italic>rmh-1</italic> mutants, we assumed that pachytene nuclei containing six COSA-1 foci would lead to diakinesis nuclei with six bivalents, pachytene nuclei containing five COSA-1 foci would lead to diakinesis nuclei with seven DAPI bodies (five bivalents and two univalents), and so on. This approach yields an expectation of 6.7 DAPI bodies at diakinesis for <italic>rmh-1(jf54)</italic> and 6.6 for <italic>rmh-1(tn309)</italic>, values that are significantly lower than those observed in the -1 oocytes of these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g001">Fig 1B and 1F</xref>). Thus, the number of univalents present at the end of meiotic prophase is higher than would be expected if all COSA-1-marked sites had successfully matured into COs.</p>
<p>To understand this excess of univalents, we investigated the organization of chromosomes in diakinesis. In wild type, the presence of a CO precursor triggers domain restructuring of the ensuing bivalent such that the axial proteins HTP-1/2 and LAB-1 become concentrated along the long arm of the bivalent, and the synapsis protein SYP-1 and the Aurora B kinase (AIR-2) are found on the short arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref068">68</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref070">70</xref>]. In <italic>spo-11</italic> or <italic>msh-5</italic> mutants, short and long arm markers overlapped on the univalents. In <italic>rmh-1</italic> mutants, however, we observed long and short arm markers localized to reciprocal domains on univalents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g004">Fig 4G</xref>), suggesting that a CO site had been designated but failed to mature to actually link the homologs. Furthermore, quantification of DAPI bodies during progression through the diakinesis stage (-3, -2, and -1 oocyte) showed that they increased significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g004">Fig 4H‚Äì4J</xref>). We observed that in the -3 oocyte, the number of DAPI bodies in <italic>rmh-1</italic> mutants (6.9 ¬± 0.7 DAPI bodies for <italic>jf54</italic> and 6.8 ¬± 0.9 for <italic>tn309</italic>) was significantly increased compared to wild type. Interestingly, the observed number of DAPI bodies in -3 oocytes of the mutants corresponds to the calculated number of DAPI bodies based on COSA-1 foci analysis. However, in both mutants, the number of DAPI bodies strongly increased during oocyte maturation. In <italic>rmh-1(jf54)</italic>, we observed 9.3 ¬± 1.4 DAPI bodies in the -1 oocytes, while the effect was milder but still significant in <italic>rmh-1(tn309)</italic> (7.4 ¬± 1.1 in -1 oocytes). We conclude that, in <italic>rmh-1</italic> mutants, connections between homologs may sometimes be lost after CO designation.</p>

<title>Genetic Interactions with Mutations Affecting Structure-Specific Endonucleases</title>
<p>Dissociation of bivalents that appeared to have undergone CO designation suggested that RMH-1 might function to enforce CO bias in the resolution of recombination intermediates at CO sites. This hypothesis prompted us to examine double mutants carrying <italic>rmh-1(jf54)</italic> in combination with mutations in <italic>xpf-1</italic>, <italic>mus-81</italic>, or <italic>slx-1</italic>, which encode structure-specific endonucleases proposed to function in two separate and partially redundant meiotic resolution pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref022">22</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref024">24</xref>], and <italic>him-18</italic> (<italic>Slx4 ortholog)</italic>, which encodes a nuclease scaffolding protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref071">71</xref>]. Dissociation of bivalents in <italic>rmh-1(jf54)</italic> was reduced by loss of <italic>xpf-1</italic>, <italic>mus-81</italic>, or <italic>slx-</italic>1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g004">Fig 4K</xref>), consistent with persistence of recombination intermediates; however, it is unclear whether such putative persistent intermediates are located at CO-designated sites and/or at other sites on the chromosomes. Furthermore, we observed an elevated incidence of unresolved bivalents linked by DNA bridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g004">Fig 4M and 4N</xref>) in these double mutants compared to the <italic>xpf-1</italic>, <italic>mus-81</italic>, or <italic>slx-1</italic> single mutants. Together with previous work showing that such linkages observed in nuclease-defective mutants are <italic>spo-11</italic>-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref022">22</xref>], these results suggest that loss of RMH-1 function may result in the accumulation of excess and/or aberrant recombination intermediates that require these structure-specific endonucleases for their resolution.</p>
<p>We also observed the occurrence of DNA bridges in the double <italic>rmh-1(jf54); him-18</italic> mutant, but, those linkages appeared with the same frequency as in the <italic>him-18</italic> single mutant. Furthermore, loss of <italic>him-18</italic> in <italic>rmh-1(jf54)</italic> did not appreciably suppress the dissociation of homologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g004">Fig 4K</xref>), in contrast to the outcomes with the single-nuclease mutants. We can reconcile these seemingly paradoxical observations by postulating (1) that unscaffolded nucleases may be able to act on recombination intermediates produced in <italic>rmh-1</italic> mutants to remove excess connections between homologs, and (2) that the presence of multiple unresolved intermediates connecting homologs (in <italic>rmh-1; xpf-1</italic>, <italic>rmh-1 mus-81</italic>, or <italic>rmh-1 slx-1</italic> mutants) might obscure detection of discrete bridges.</p>

<title>Interdependent and Separable Functions of RMH-1 and HIM-6 (BLM Helicase)</title>
<p>As RMI1 was first identified as a component of a complex containing the RecQ helicase BLM and the topoisomerase TOP3, we used the yeast-two-hybrid assay to confirm interactions between RMH-1 and HIM-6 (the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> BLM ortholog) and between RMH-1 and TOP-3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002412.s009">S9A Fig</xref>). Furthermore, as several phenotypes of the <italic>rmh-1</italic> mutants resemble phenotypes seen in <italic>him-6</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002412.s009">S9B and S9C Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref053">53</xref>], we investigated the cytological and functional inter-relationships between RMH-1 and HIM-6.</p>
<p>To examine colocalization of RMH-1 and HIM-6, we used the CRISPR method to tag the <italic>him-6</italic> locus with a C-terminal human influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope. The tag did not compromise HIM-6 function, since neither an increase in embryonic inviability nor a Him phenotype was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002412.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). HIM-6 is found in few foci in early pachytene. The number of foci increases in mid pachytene and decreases again in late pachytene, reminiscent of the RMH-1 pattern. In mid pachytene, RMH-1 and HIM-6 substantially colocalized, and, in late pachytene, RMH-1 strictly colocalized with HIM-6; however, additional HIM-6 foci were also present (96.6 +/- 4.1% RMH-1 foci colocalize with HIM-6 in mid pachytene and 96.3 +/- 6.7% in late pachytene; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g005">Fig 5A‚Äì5C</xref>).</p>

<p>To investigate the interdependence of localization, we assayed localization of HIM-6::HA in <italic>rmh-1</italic> mutants. In <italic>tn309</italic>, HIM-6 was completely absent in most of the gonads we imaged. In the rest, HIM-6 was barely detectable, and when foci were seen, they were not at CO sites in late pachytene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). In <italic>jf54</italic>, HIM-6 foci were present in all gonads but seemed smaller and fainter in mid and late pachytene, suggesting that RMH-1 is required to stabilize and enrich HIM-6 in foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). Although HIM-6 is sometimes found in proximity to CO site markers, these do not exhibit robust colocalization in the absence of <italic>rmh-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g005">Fig 5E</xref>).</p>
<p>Assessment of the localization of GFP::RMH-1 in the <italic>him-6(ok412)</italic> mutant revealed that <italic>him-6</italic> is required for RMH-1 localization in mid pachytene but not in late pachytene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g005">Fig 5H‚Äì5J</xref>). This finding is consistent with the idea that RMH-1 may be present in genetically distinguishable complexes in mid and late pachytene stages. However, <italic>him-6</italic> is required for normal numbers of RMH-1 foci even in late pachytene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g005">Fig 5K</xref>).</p>
<p>An important difference between <italic>rmh-1</italic> and <italic>him-6</italic> mutants is their impact on CO designation. A previous study showed that in the null allele of <italic>him-6</italic>, the abundance of COSA-1 foci was unaffected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref046">46</xref>]; thus, the <italic>him-6</italic> null mutant appears to be proficient for CO designation. On the other hand, both <italic>rmh-1</italic> alleles impair CO designation, as evidenced by an elevated frequency of nuclei containing fewer than six COSA-1 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). Furthermore, the fact that CO designation is unaffected in a <italic>him-6</italic> null mutant but is impaired in an <italic>rmh-1; him-6</italic> double mutant implies that RMH-1 can assist in promoting CO designation in the absence of HIM-6.</p>
<p>A deficit of bivalent connections is a shared feature of <italic>rmh-1</italic> and <italic>him-6</italic> mutants. The phenotype is evident but less pronounced in <italic>him-6</italic> or <italic>rmh-1(tn309)</italic> (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), while it is more prominent in <italic>rmh-1(jf54)</italic> (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). The number of DAPI bodies in <italic>rmh-1(tn309); him-6(ok412)</italic> and the respective single mutants was not different. Interestingly, however, we found that the deficit of connections between homologs in <italic>rmh-1(jf54); him-6(ok412)</italic> oocytes was reduced compared to the <italic>rmh-1(jf54)</italic> single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g005">Fig 5G</xref>), despite the fact that COSA-1 foci were reduced in this double mutant. One possible explanation for this observation would be that the dissociation of bivalents observed in <italic>rmh-1(jf54)</italic> might be mediated by HIM-6. An alternative explanation is that the simultaneous loss of HIM-6 and RMH-1 may lead to persistence of unresolved recombination intermediates that maintain connections between the homologs.</p>

<title>RMH-1 and HIM-6/ BLM Pachytene Foci Are Doublets/Elongated Structures</title>
<p>We investigated the foci structure of RMH-1 and HIM-6 foci using structured illumination microscopy (SIM). Both in mid pachytene and late pachytene, RMH-1 and HIM-6 signals were resolved into more complex structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g006">Fig 6</xref>). In mid pachytene, we observed foci that clearly exhibit a doublet structure and foci that show an elongated shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). In late pachytene, RMH-1 and HIM-6 appear even more clearly as doublets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g006">Fig 6C‚Äì6E</xref>). In both pachytene stages, we hypothesize that RMH-1 and HIM-6 foci mark similar recombination intermediates. The doublet structure is likely easier to observe in late foci as RMH-1 protein accumulates during pachytene progression, leading to larger foci in late pachytene. We measured the average distance between the foci peak in the three-dimensional stacks as an average of 227 +/- 46 nm. Interestingly, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the size of a recombination nodule has been estimated to around 100 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref072">72</xref>]. It has also been shown that 1 kb of B-form DNA is 340 nm in length. We conclude that the structure we describe here is on an appropriate scale for flanking dHJs. We also observed that the late pachytene HIM-6 doublet structures flank a COSA-1 focus in the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). Interestingly, in the <italic>rmh-1(jf54</italic>) mutant, HIM-6 appears as single foci and not as elongated or doublet structures in late pachytene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g006">Fig 6G</xref>). This suggests that <italic>rmh-1</italic> is required to concentrate HIM-6 at CO sites and also to organize a complex structure surrounding late recombination intermediates.</p>

<title>SMC-5 and RMH-1 Act Synergistically to Eliminate Illegitimate Interhomolog Connections</title>
<p>The mid pachytene localization of RMH-1 (and HIM-6) to numerous foci in excess of the eventual number of COs, together with the well-known role for the RTR complex in discouraging COs in other systems (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec001">Introduction</xref>), led us to investigate the possibility that RMH-1 also functions at NCO sites during <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> meiosis. We focused on the possibility that RMH-1 might function in parallel with the SMC-5/6 complex, based on several considerations. First, several studies in budding yeast showed that in the absence of <italic>Smc5</italic> or <italic>Smc6</italic> during meiosis, COs form but joint molecules accumulate, leading to chromosome segregation defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref057">57</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref059">59</xref>]. Moreover, it was shown that Smc6 was required for the resolution of the joint molecules accumulating in absence of Sgs1, suggesting collaboration of pathways mediated through those two proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref059">59</xref>]. Second, a prior study showed that the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> SMC-5/6 complex is important for meiotic DSB repair under conditions in which interhomolog CO formation is abrogated and/or in mutant situations when intersister repair is the only option [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref073">73</xref>]. Moreover, the data of Bickel et al. are fully consistent with the SMC-5/6 complex participating in interhomolog NCO repair as well.</p>
<p>Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that RMH-1 functions in parallel with the SMC-5/6 complex to antagonize accumulation of aberrant interhomolog connections. First, we observed a significant increase in RMH-1 foci in mid pachytene nuclei in the <italic>smc-5</italic> mutant; 29.1% of nuclei contained more than 25 foci, never seen in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>). However, late pachytene nuclei in the <italic>smc-5</italic> mutant had an average of six foci per nucleus, as in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g007">Fig 7C</xref>), suggesting that an excess of RMH-1-associated recombination intermediates accumulate in the <italic>smc-5</italic> mutant, but they are ultimately taken care of in agreement with the wild type viability of the single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). Second, the <italic>rmh-1(jf54); smc-5(ok2421)</italic> double mutant showed both a synthetic decrease in embryonic hatch rates and increase in larval arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g007">Fig 7D and 7E</xref>), indicating a strong genetic interaction between <italic>rmh-1</italic> and <italic>smc-5</italic> in the soma but also likely during meiosis (a similar genetic interaction is reported between <italic>him-6</italic> and <italic>smc-5</italic> in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref074">74</xref>]). Third, quantification of the number of DAPI bodies in diakinesis oocytes in the <italic>rmh-1; smc-5</italic> double mutant revealed an average of 5.9 ¬± 0.3 DAPI bodies in the -1 oocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g007">Fig 7F</xref>), consistent with the presence of connections between the homologs. However, cytological examination of chromosome organization revealed that these interhomolog connections were aberrant. Consistent with the low viability of this double mutant, bivalent organization was dramatically defective: both long arms (indicated by LAB-1 staining) were always found together, precluding the wild-type cross-shaped appearance of the bivalent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g007">Fig 7G‚Äì7J</xref>). Such abnormal bivalents were already observed at a low frequency in each of the single mutants, but are now present in each diakinesis nucleus in the double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g007">Fig 7K</xref>). This result strongly suggests that <italic>rmh-1</italic> and <italic>smc-5</italic> cooperate to eliminate and/or prevent accumulation of connections between homologs at NCO sites. Finally, we found that simultaneous loss of both RMH-1 and SMC-5 results in a high frequency of interhomolog connections even in the absence of the conserved meiotic CO factor ZHP-3. Whereas COs and chiasmata are eliminated in the <italic>zhp-3</italic> single mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref016">16</xref>], a small but significant reduction in DAPI bodies in -1 oocytes was observed in the <italic>zhp-3; smc-5</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g007">Fig 7L, 7M and 7O</xref>). This ability to create aberrant homolog connections in a <italic>zhp-3</italic> mutant is consistent with the finding that a mutation affecting the budding yeast Smc5/6 complex has the ability to create connections between homologous chromosomes in a mutant lacking Zip3 (the ZHP-3 ortholog) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref059">59</xref>]. Moreover, ectopic ZHP-3-independent connections occurred at very high frequency in a <italic>zhp-3; rmh-1; smc-5</italic> triple mutant, in which we observed an average of 7.3 DAPI bodies at diakinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g007">Fig 7N and 7O</xref>). Together, our data indicate that <italic>smc-5</italic> and <italic>rmh-1</italic> act in parallel to antagonize MutS gamma-independent inter-homolog connections, supporting the conclusion that RMH-1 also functions at NCO sites.</p>

<title>RMH-1 Discourages COs in the Center of Chromosomes</title>
<p>To assess the role of RMH-1 at NCO sites in more detail, we analyzed the localization of COs along the chromosomes. We used deep sequencing to compare CO frequency and CO distribution between the wild type and <italic>rmh-1</italic> mutants (<italic>jf54</italic> and <italic>tn309</italic>). We took advantage of the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> Hawaiian (Hw) strain, which contains a high frequency of SNPs compared to the Bristol strain (wild type). Thus, we generated strains containing <italic>rmh-1</italic> mutants in combination with a subset of introgressed ‚ÄúHawaii chromosomes‚Äù: chromosomes II and V for <italic>rmh-1(jf54)</italic> and chromosomes X, IV, and V for <italic>rmh-1(tn309)</italic>. (Introgression of all Hawaii chromosomes into the <italic>rmh-1</italic> mutants led to sterility).</p>
<p>We sequenced all the parental strains (Bristol, Hw, and the ‚ÄúHw introgressed <italic>rmh-1</italic> mutants‚Äù) and used them as references. Recombinants between the Bristol strain and Hw were generated as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g008">Fig 8A</xref>. We singled F2 animals and allowed them to self-fertilize for three to four generations and deep-sequenced DNA isolated from their progeny. Paired-end reads were mapped as described in the Experimental Procedures section. Bioinformatic analysis identified 166,928 homozygous unique SNPs in the Hw genome. To assess the chromosome composition in each recombinant, we used the homozygous unique SNPs of the Hw strain. We used SNPs located at least 400 bp apart to avoid having two or more SNPs per paired read. In the absence of recombination, two genotypes are expected in the offspring: fully homozygous (i.e., both homologous chromosomes come from the same parental strain) and fully heterozygous (each homolog comes from one parental strain). If recombination occurred, blocks of homozygosity and blocks of heterozygosity were detected. We identified the recombination break-points by analyzing the changes in heterozygosity along the chromosome (for more details, see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec015">Experimental Procedures</xref> section).</p>

<p>We did not detect a significant difference between the mutants and wild-type control in the total frequencies of crossovers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). This observation contrasts with the reduction in COSA-1 foci observed in both mutants, and could potentially reflect sample size or the fact that viable progeny were used in the recombination assay; alternatively, it may reflect crossovers occurring at sites not marked by COSA-1 foci in the mutants. However, we found that the positions of the COs were shifted significantly toward the center of chromosomes in both mutants, in contrast to the preference observed in the wild type, in which the majority of COs occurred in the gene-sparse ‚Äúarm‚Äù regions of the chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g008">Fig 8C and 8D</xref>).</p>
<p>We conclude that <italic>rmh-1</italic> is required to discourage COs in the center of chromosomes.

<title>Genetically Separable Roles for RMH-1 at CO and NCO Sites</title>
<p>Although protein complexes involving RMI1 and/or BLM helicase were initially recognized based on anti-CO activities, recent work in several systems has led to a growing realization that BLM and RMI1 play multiple roles during meiotic recombination, functioning both in antagonizing and promoting COs (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref075">75</xref>] and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec001">Introduction</xref>). One current view for <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> is that the primary role of the RTR complex is as a ‚Äúrecombination intermediate chaperone‚Äù [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref056">56</xref>]. Under this model, RTR plays an indirect role in promoting COs during yeast meiosis, either by generating recombination intermediates recognized and processed by the Exo1-MutLŒ≥ pathway or by disassembling aberrant recombination intermediates, thereby helping to channel early recombination intermediates into either a MutSŒ≥-dependent CO pathway or into the SDSA pathway for generating NCOs. Yeast Sgs1 has also been implicated in promoting resolution of CO intermediates under circumstances in which JM resolution is impaired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref055">55</xref>]. A more prominent pro-CO role has been uncovered for HIM-6/BLM during <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> meiosis, in which loss of BLM function results in reduced COs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref054">54</xref>]. It was proposed that HIM-6 functions to enforce a CO-biased outcome of resolution of CO intermediates; however, it was not clear whether this proposed pro-CO role for HIM-6 was direct or indirect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref046">46</xref>]. Our combined genetic and cytological analysis provides a strong case that RMH-1 functions directly at both CO and NCO sites. For a summary, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g009">Fig 9</xref>.</p>

<p>First, RMH-1 and HIM-6 colocalize at CO designated sites (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g003">3G‚Äì3K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g005">5A‚Äì5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g006">6F</xref>), and this late pachytene localization is dependent on conserved pro-CO factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g004">Fig 4A‚Äì4D</xref>). Conversely, pro-CO factors can concentrate at presumptive CO sites in the absence of HIM-6 or RMH-1 (albeit less reliably in <italic>rmh-1</italic> mutants) consistent with RMH-1 and HIM-6 being recruited to CO designated sites to perform a late function in CO formation (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g004">4E, 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g005">5F</xref>). Moreover, SIM imaging of CO sites in late pachytene nuclei revealed that RMH-1 and HIM-6 colocalize in an elongated structure or closely juxtaposed doublets, potentially reflecting two separate populations of RTR complexes flanking the two junctions of a dHJ CO intermediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g006">Fig 6</xref>). The ‚Äúdoublet‚Äù organization leads us to suggest that RMH-1 and HIM-6 localized at CO sites may support the CO outcome of recombination intermediate resolution either by promoting an optimal geometry for endonucleases (resolvases) to position DNA cleavage, or by protecting the structure from unscheduled action of endonucleases. Our analysis with the truncation allele <italic>tn309</italic> raises the possibility that HIM-6 itself may contribute to inappropriate resolution when RMH-1 is absent.</p>
<p>Interestingly, RMH-1 and HIM-6 differ regarding the requirements for their recruitment at CO sites. Whereas RMH-1 is successfully recruited to most presumptive CO sites in <italic>him-6</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g005">Fig 5H‚Äì5K</xref>), HIM-6 does not stably concentrate at the sites of pro-CO factors in <italic>rmh-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g006">Fig 6G</xref>), raising the possibility that RMH-1 (or TOP-3 associated with RMH-1) may interact more directly with pro-CO factors at such sites. The absence of HIM-6 at CO sites in <italic>rmh-1</italic> mutants suggests that RMH-1 might provide a structural support to ensure the final processing of a mature recombination intermediate by limiting branch migration or the collapse of a putative dHJ and, thereby, influencing the outcome of resolution.</p>
<p>We provide multiple lines of evidence that RMH-1 also localizes to NCO sites and that its function(s) in NCO repair events are distinct from its pro-CO role(s). First, localization of RMH-1 during early and mid pachytene has different genetic requirements than its late pachytene localization at CO-associated foci: Early/mid pachytene RMH-1 foci can still form (albeit at reduced levels) in mutants defective for pro-CO factors, but are strictly dependent on HIM-6, suggesting that the intermediates present at early and late foci differ in structure (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g004">4A‚Äì4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g005">5H‚Äì5K</xref>). Furthermore, we show that such foci can occur at elevated levels when numbers of DSB are increased or when alternative pathways for DSB repair are abrogated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g007">Fig 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002412.s007">S7A‚ÄìS7C Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>In mid pachytene, HIM-6 and RMH-1 proteins colocalize, but only a fraction colocalize with MSH-5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g003">Fig 3G‚Äì3I</xref>). We hypothesize that foci positive for all three proteins correspond to CO-eligible recombination sites, while those positive for only HIM-6 and RMH-1 may be processed as NCOs (perhaps by a decatenation reaction). The occurrence of chromosome bridges in <italic>rmh-1; resolvase</italic> double mutants could indicate either the accumulation of recombination intermediates due to defective dissolution or a more direct collaboration between RMH-1 and resolvases to produce COs and/or NCOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g004">Fig 4K‚Äì4M</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, our data suggest direct but distinct roles for RMH-1 in both CO and NCO repair during <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> meiosis.</p>

<sec id="sec014">
<title>Functions of RMH-1 at CO and NCO Sites Collaborate to Prepare Chromosomes for Segregation During the Meiotic Divisions</title>
<p>Another important concept emphasized by our work analyzing the functions of RMH-1 during <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> meiosis is that a successful outcome of meiosis requires proper execution of the prescribed recombination events at both CO and NCO repair sites. Whereas COs serve as the basis of chiasmata that connect homologous chromosomes to enable them to orient toward opposite poles of the meiosis I spindle, efficient homolog segregation also depends on elimination of other recombination-based interactions between homologs that might impede their timely separation.</p>
<p>Beyond ensuring CO formation, RMH-1 has (at least) two roles in preparing homologous chromosome for segregation at meiosis I. First, RMH-1 functions in parallel with SMC-5 in eliminating excess associations between homologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Importantly, we also demonstrate another major role for RMH-1 in ensuring that COs usually form in positions that favor reliable homolog segregation. In the absence of localized centromeres (due to the holocentric nature of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> chromosomes), the position of the CO dictates multiple features of bivalent organization that are crucial for correct alignment and behavior of chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref069">69</xref>]. This defines distinct long arm and short arm domains where cohesion will be retained or released at the meiosis I division and delineates how kinetochore components, motor proteins, and cell-division protein kinases associate with the chromosomes. We found that, whereas COs usually occur at off-center positions during wild-type meiosis, COs occurred more frequently near the centers of the chromosomes in <italic>rmh-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002412.g008">Fig 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002412.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). We speculate that an altered distribution of COs in an <italic>rmh-1</italic> mutant may reflect impaired execution at both CO and NCO repair sites. On the one hand, an impaired ability to impose CO-biased resolution at CO-designated sites results in intermediates at some of those sites being resolved as NCOs. On the other hand, impairment of a mechanism that would normally help dissociate intermediates to promote repair via SDSA may result in accumulation of DNA structures that require structure-specific endonucleases for their resolution, resulting in CO repair products at some sites that should have been NCOs. We have not observed a significant frequency of double COs in the mutants, suggesting that the misplaced COs are still subjected to interference. Interestingly, the SLX-1 resolvase is also required to suppress CO formation in the chromosome center [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref024">24</xref>]. It is appealing to speculate that RMH-1 might cooperate with SLX-1 in a locally defined region to promote NCO resolution.</p>
<p>We note that while CO positioning may be especially important in organisms like <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> that use COs to trigger differentiation of the bivalent, CO position is also very important during <italic>Drosophila</italic>, yeast, and human meiosis. in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, centromere proximal recombination events have been correlated to metaphase II nondisjunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref076">76</xref>]. In yeast, centromere proximal COs have been shown to trigger premature separation of sister chromatids (PSSC). Interestingly, <italic>sgs1</italic> mutants exhibit reduced spore viability, potentially due to an excess of COs near the centromere leading to PSSC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref077">77</xref>]. In human meiosis, COs located very near to either telomeres or centromeres are associated with elevated risk of aneuploidies, e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref078">78</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002412.ref082">82</xref>].</p>
