<abstract>
<p>Dendritic cells (DCs) play pivotal roles in T-cell homeostasis and activation, and metabolic programing has been recently linked to DC development and function. However, the metabolic underpinnings corresponding to distinct DC functions remain largely unresolved. Here, we demonstrate a special metabolic–epigenetic coupling mechanism orchestrated by tuberous sclerosis complex subunit 1 (TSC1)-mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) for homeostatic DC function. Specific ablation of <italic>Tsc1</italic> in the DC compartment (<italic>Tsc1</italic><sup>DC-KO</sup>) largely preserved DC development but led to pronounced reduction in naïve and memory–phenotype cluster of differentiation (CD)8<sup>+</sup> T cells, a defect fully rescued by concomitant ablation of <italic>mTor</italic> or regulatory associated protein of MTOR, complex 1 (<italic>Rptor</italic>) in DCs. Moreover, <italic>Tsc1</italic><sup>DC-KO</sup> mice were unable to launch efficient antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T effector responses required for containing <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> and B16 melanomas. Mechanistically, our data suggest that the steady-state DCs tend to tune down de novo fatty acid synthesis and divert acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) for histone acetylation, a process critically controlled by TSC1-mTOR. Correspondingly, TSC1 deficiency elevated acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) expression and fatty acid synthesis, leading to impaired epigenetic imprinting on selective genes such as major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I and interleukin (IL)-7. Remarkably, tempering ACC1 activity was able to divert cytosolic acetyl-CoA for histone acetylation and restore the gene expression program compromised by TSC1 deficiency. Taken together, our results uncover a crucial role for TSC1-mTOR in metabolic programing of the homeostatic DCs for T-cell homeostasis and implicate metabolic-coupled epigenetic imprinting as a paradigm for DC specification.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dendritic cells (DCs) are specialized sentinel cells of immune system responsible for the initiation and coordination of innate and adaptive immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref002">2</xref>]. It has become increasingly appreciated that DCs encompass phenotypic and functional heterogeneous subsets, which can be further diversified in different anatomic locations, such as the spleen, lymph nodes (LNs), and peripheral tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref003">3</xref>]. Whereas plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) are professional interferon (IFN)-I producers required for the imminent control of viral infections, the classical DCs (cDCs) comprising cDC1 and cDC2 are specialized in antigen presentation and dedicated to T-cell priming and effector differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref005">5</xref>]. Recent advancement indicates that DCs not only are central to T-cell activation but also hold the keys for immune tolerance and homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref004">4</xref>]. Although the principles governing DC control of T-cell activation have been established, the mechanisms underlying DC control of T-cell homeostasis remain underappreciated. Given the broad association of corruptions in immune homeostasis with human diseases, particularly autoimmune diseases and cancers, it is of great interest to understand how DCs regulate immune homeostasis.</p>
<p>T lymphocytes generated in the thymus can be maintained as naïve cells in the periphery for a relatively long period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref006">6</xref>]. During the naïve state, T cells are believed to stay in quiescence and, thus, barely divide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref008">8</xref>]. However, quiescent cluster of differentiation (CD)8<sup>+</sup> T cells must engage self-peptide/major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I complexes for tonic T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling to survive in the periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref009">9</xref>]. As MHC class I molecules are ubiquitously expressed, both DCs and non-DCs have been shown to be able to present autoantigens to the naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref011">11</xref>]. In addition, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells also depend on interleukin (IL)-7 for their periphery maintenance, and those unable to respond to IL-7 become rapidly lost in the periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref013">13</xref>]. Although stroma cells such as fibroblast reticular cells (FRCs) are regarded as the major cellular source for IL-7, evidence implicating DCs as a possible IL-7 provider has also emerged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref015">15</xref>]. In the steady state, a proportion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells spontaneously convert into so-called memory–phenotype T cells with CD62L<sup>lo</sup> and CD44<sup>hi</sup> surface markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref008">8</xref>]. How these memory–phenotype CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells arise remains unclear, but their maintenance and survival seem contingent on cytokines IL-7 and IL-15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref008">8</xref>]. Notably, the numbers of naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells must be kept constant and steady throughout their life, and central to this precision control is the competition for the limited IL-7 and self-peptide/MHC-I resources among CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref009">9</xref>]. The molecular mechanisms underlying the stringent control of IL-7 production and MHC class I–restricted antigen presentation are poorly understood. Because disruption of T-cell quiescence can lead to autoimmunity and lymphopenia, the balance of being quiescent while surviving is critically maintained by both T cell–intrinsic and–extrinsic signals.</p>
<p>With prominent expression of a diversity of pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), DCs are specialized in recognition of pathogen-associated molecule patterns (PAMPs) and danger-associated molecule patterns (DAMPs) associated with pathogen infection and tissue injury, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref002">2</xref>]. Engagement of PRRs such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) leads to DC activation, characterized with up-regulated capacities in antigen presentation, migration, and cytokine production. The emerging view suggests metabolic reprograming as an integral component of DC activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref017">17</xref>]. TLR-activated DCs rapidly elevate glucose uptake and oxidative glycolysis, leading to marked increase in de novo fatty acid synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref018">18</xref>]. Interestingly, this metabolic program features lipid production and appears to fit into the demand for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi expansion, allowing activated DCs to produce a myriad of cytokines and chemokines. Consistent with this theme, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-regulated fatty acid oxidation (FAO) has been implicated in DC regulation of allergic T helper 2 (Th2) response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref019">19</xref>]. Therefore, different metabolic programs must incorporate into distinct DC subsets at various anatomic locations to accommodate respective functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref020">20</xref>]. In this regard, a special metabolic program featured a high level of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and, orchestrated by mammalian sterile-20-like 1/2 (Mst1/2), was only associated with cDC1 but not cDC2 subset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref021">21</xref>]. It is noteworthy that metabolic reprograming has been linked to epigenetic regulation of gene expression, largely because of their profound impact on the cofactors of epigenetic enzymes, such as S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), which are used by histone methyltransferase and acetyltransferase to shape the chromatin landscapes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref025">25</xref>]. Indeed, macrophages stimulated with IL-4 exhibited pronounced FAO and up-regulation of ATP-citrate lyase (Acly), leading to increased acetyl-CoA production and histone acetylation for selective alternatively activated macrophage (M2 macrophage)-specific gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref026">26</xref>]. However, whether and how DC-specific metabolic programs might intersect with diverse epigenetic mechanisms awaits investigation.</p>
<p>Recent development has placed mTOR at the center of immune regulation, highlighting its multifaceted functions in a wide array of immune cells. mTOR constitutes two multicomponent complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), and through these complexes shape the cellular metabolic programs to meet the specific bioenergetic and biosynthetic needs of immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref020">20</xref>]. Whereas mTORC1 has been widely linked to anabolic metabolism through the downstream effectors hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and cellular myelocytomatosis (c-Myc), mTORC2 can also participate in the regulation of glycolysis in part through up-regulating c-Myc expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref020">20</xref>]. It is becoming increasingly evident that mTOR activity varies in immune cells at distinct activation stages or different anatomic locations, partly attributing to the upstream negative regulators such as tuberous sclerosis complex subunit 1/2 (TSC1/2), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref027">27</xref>]. TSC1/TSC2 heterocomplexes are responsible for receiving and integrating signals from cytokines, growth factors, and PRRs, thereby executing stringent control on mTORC1. Not surprisingly, precision control of mTOR activation has been implicated in DC survival and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref030">30</xref>]. In this study, we established a crucial role for TSC1-mTOR in the steady-state DCs and unraveled a unique metabolic–epigenetic program underpinning DC-mediated CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell survival. Importantly, our data implicate the existence of a novel TSC1-mTOR–acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) axis operating at the interface of fatty acid synthesis and histone acetylation, thus providing important insight into the understanding of metabolic–epigenetic coupling mechanisms. It is also noteworthy that this study serves as a unique paradigm supporting DC’s involvement in the peripheral CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell maintenance.</p>

<title>DC expression of TSC1 is pivotal for CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell development and maintenance</title>
<p>To comprehensively understand the role of TSC1-mTOR and corresponding metabolic programs in DC function, we generated <italic>Tsc1</italic> floxed:Cd11c-Cre (cyclization recombination enzyme) mouse model to achieve specific ablation of <italic>Tsc1</italic> in the DC compartment (referred to as TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> hereafter).

Intriguingly, unexpected reduction in TSC1 expression was observed in the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> spleens, particularly at the mRNA level (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s001">S1A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s001">S1B Fig</xref></bold>). Next, we examined how TSC1 deficiency might influence DC development and differentiation. Flow cytometry analyses revealed a largely normal presence of various DC subsets in the major lymphoid organs of TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> mice, including the thymus, spleen, and LNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g001"><bold>Fig 1A</bold> and <bold>1B</bold></xref> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s001">S1C Fig</xref></bold>). Specifically, the percentages and numbers of CD8α<sup>+</sup> DCs (cDC1), CD11b<sup>+</sup> or CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs (cDC2), and pDC Ag-1 (PDCA1)<sup>+</sup>/B220<sup>+</sup> pDCs were comparable in the thymuses and spleens of wild-type and TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> mice (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g001">Fig 1A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s001">S1C Fig</xref></bold>), indicating a dispensable role for TSC1 in DC lineage commitment and differentiation. Moreover, the LNs from TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> mice constituted unaltered resident DCs (CD11c<sup>hi</sup>/MHC-II<sup>int</sup>) but fewer migratory DCs (CD11c<sup>int</sup>/MHC-II<sup>hi</sup>) as compared with the wild-type LNs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g001">Fig 1B</xref></bold>).

<p>Subsequently, we investigated whether TSC1 deficiency might affect DC function, with the focus on adaptive immune cells. The percentages and numbers of B lymphocytes were largely normal in the TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> secondary lymphoid organs, with the exception of peripheral LNs (pLNs), where B cells increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g001"><bold>Fig 1D</bold> and <bold>1E</bold></xref>). In contrast, marked reduction in CD3<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes was detected in TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g001"><bold>Fig 1D</bold> and <bold>1E</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s001"><bold>S1F</bold> and <bold>S1G Fig</bold></xref>). Among the CD3<sup>+</sup> T-cell populations, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells showed a substantial decrease in percentages and numbers crossing various lymphoid organs, whereas CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were normally present in the LNs but slightly diminished in the spleens of TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g001"><bold>Fig 1D</bold> and <bold>1E</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s001"><bold>S1F</bold> and <bold>S1G Fig</bold></xref>). These results thus revealed an unexpected association of DC-restricted TSC1 expression with peripheral CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell homeostasis.</p>
<p>As naïve T cells developed in the thymus continuously replenish peripheral tissues, we then examined whether T-cell development was affected in TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> mice. The presence of both double-negative and double-positive T cells was unimpaired in the thymuses of TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> mice, suggestive of normal positive- and negative-selection processes. However, whereas CD4<sup>+</sup> TCRβ<sup>+</sup> T cells were generated at the expected percentage, the CD8<sup>+</sup> TCRβ<sup>+</sup> T cells were modestly underrepresented (about 2-fold reduction) in the TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> thymuses (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g001">Fig 1F</xref></bold>), implicating compromised CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell development by TSC1 DC deficiency. In the periphery, the majority of the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were kept at the naïve state, whereas a portion of them also spontaneously converted to memory–phenotype T cells, including central memory (CD62L<sup>hi</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup>) and effector memory (CD62L<sup>lo</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup>) T cells. In TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> mice, the ratios of naïve and central memory subsets were slightly decreased, whereas the effector memory T-cell percentages increased within the CD8 and CD4 T-cell populations (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g001">Fig 1G</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s001">S1H Fig</xref></bold>).

<p>A number of checkpoints, such as development, proliferation/survival, and quiescence, have been implicated in T-cell homeostasis. Because CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were only slightly decreased (approximately 40% reduction) in the thymus of TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> mice (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g001">Fig 1F</xref></bold>), the developmental process alone cannot account for nearly 90% of CD8<sup>+</sup> cell reduction in the spleen and LNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g001"><bold>Fig 1D</bold> and <bold>1E</bold></xref>). Hence, we reasoned that processes like cell proliferation and survival might be affected in TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> mice. Upon administering bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) via intraperitoneal injection followed by continuous feeding in drinking water for 7 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref031">31</xref>], we observed very few BrdU-positive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the spleen, and the percentages of BrdU<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were comparable in both wild-type and TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> mice (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g002">Fig 2C</xref></bold>). Conversely, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> spleens displayed nearly 5-fold more annexin V–positive apoptotic cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g002">Fig 2D</xref></bold>), indicative of impaired CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell survival. Meanwhile, increased apoptosis was also associated with TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> splenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s002">S2C Fig</xref></bold>), corroborating the decreased CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell population in the TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> spleen (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g001">Fig 1D</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Subsequently, we conducted a series of reciprocal adoptive transfer experiments to ascertain the role of DCs in CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell defects described above. At first, CD45.1 wild-type CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were transferred into CD45.2 wild-type or TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> recipients and traced by flow cytometry after 2 weeks. Notably, much fewer CD45.1 donor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were recovered from the TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> recipients than wild-type recipients (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g002">Fig 2E</xref></bold>). In contrast, when CD45.2 CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from wild-type or TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> spleens were transferred into CD45.1 wild-type recipients, both types of CD45.2 donor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were similarly recovered from the wild-type recipients (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g002">Fig 2F</xref></bold>). Nevertheless, CD45.2 CD4<sup>+</sup> T donor cells from TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> spleens were recovered with diminished numbers as compared with their counterparts from wild-type spleens (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g002">Fig 2F</xref></bold>). These data collectively ruled out any possible intrinsic defect associated with the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells; however, the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> spleen might be intrinsically compromised, which is consistent with subset CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell reduction observed in the TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> spleens (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g001">Fig 1D</xref></bold>). As CD11c expression can be associated with myeloid cell lineages other than DCs, we further examined whether the observed CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell defect could be attributable to macrophages or neutrophils. However, the CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell populations were completely normal when TSC1 was ablated in the macrophage/neutrophil compartments via lysozyme 2 (<italic>Lyz2</italic>)-Cre (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s002">S2D Fig</xref></bold>). Together, these data demonstrate that TSC1 expression in DCs is critically involved in CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell development and maintenance.</p>

Moreover, TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> mice also had much fewer activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells compared with wild-type mice, exhibiting pronounced reduction in both CD44<sup>+</sup> killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily G, member 1 (KLRG1)<sup>+</sup> effector cells and CD44<sup>+</sup>KLRG1<sup>−</sup> memory cells (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s003">S3A Fig</xref></bold>). Among the activated T cells, the numbers of IFNγ- and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-producing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were also substantially diminished in L.M.-infected TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> mice (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g003">Fig 3B</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s003">S3B Fig</xref></bold>). Remarkably, the induction of tetramer<sup>+</sup> and IFNγ<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was fully restored in the TSC1/mTOR<sup>DC-DKO</sup> mice (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s003">S3C Fig</xref></bold>), indicating a crucial role for TSC1-mTOR in DC-mediated CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell activation. Furthermore, upon stimulation of splenocytes isolated from L.M.-infected mice with OVA<sub>257-264</sub> peptides ex vivo, it was evident that the OVA-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> mice secreted very little IFNγ and TNF, indicative of compromised ability to eradicate infected bacteria (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g003">Fig 3C</xref></bold>). Consequently, TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> mice became extremely vulnerable to L.M. infection and suffered 100% mortality by 10 days of infection (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g003">Fig 3D</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Consistent with the crucial role for CD8<sup>+</sup> T response in the elimination of malignant cancer, TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> mice were unable to efficiently control the subcutaneously transplanted B16 melanomas. Consequently, massive tumor growth and expansion were detected in the TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> mice but not in the TSC1/mTOR<sup>DC-DKO</sup> mice (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g003">Fig 3E</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s003">S3D Fig</xref></bold>). These data collectively indicate that TSC1-mTORC1 in DCs is instrumental for the induction of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses to bacterial infection and tumor growth.</p>
<p>Notably, upon activation, TSC1-deficient DCs demonstrated normal induction of cytokines (TNF, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-10) and chemokines (chemokine [C-X-C motif] ligand [CXCL]-1 and CXCL-10) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s004">S4A Fig</xref></bold>). Furthermore, the expression of costimulatory molecules (CD80/CD86 and CD40) appeared slightly increased in the TSC1-deficient DCs, whereas MHC-I expression decreased (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s004">S4B Fig</xref></bold>). Additionally, the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> mice showed increased expression of chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) but unaltered expression on other trafficking receptors such as CCR7 and CD62L (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s004">S4C Fig</xref></bold>). Concomitantly, the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells also expressed normal CCR7, CD62L, and IL-2, but they expressed more CXCR4 and IL-7Rα in TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> mice (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s004">S4C–S4E Fig</xref></bold>). These data are consistent with the observation that the percentages of activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, particularly the IFNγ- and TNF-producing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, were comparable in both wild-type and TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> mice (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s003">S3B Fig</xref></bold>). Hence, it seems that the TSC1-deficient DCs are still capable of priming CD8 T cells, and the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells do not have overt defects in trafficking or receiving signals from CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells either. Conceivably, the drastic reduction in the number of activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> mice may be largely due to its defective homeostasis.</p>

<title>TSC1 controls a transcriptional program involved in DC–T interaction</title>
<p>To decipher how TSC1 deficiency in DCs leads to T-cell impairment primarily on the CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell compartment, we conducted genome-wide RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis on splenic DCs purified from wild-type and TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> mice. It is notable that several gene sets involved in metabolism, antigen presentation, and T-cell regulation were differentially expressed in TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DCs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g004">Fig 4A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s005">S5A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s005">S5B Fig</xref></bold>).

Consistent with increased Glut1 expression, BMDCs from TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> mice demonstrated efficient uptake of 2-deoxy-2-[(7-nitro-2, 1, 3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl) amino]-D-glucose (2-NBDG), a fluorescent glucose analogue (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g004">Fig 4C</xref></bold>).

<p>Subsequently, we conducted Seahorse assays to examine the metabolic processes in TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DCs. By measuring extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), which is indicative of glycolytic rate, we found that the conversion of glucose to lactate was up-regulated in TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DCs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g004">Fig 4E–4G</xref></bold>). Moreover, despite their unaltered mitochondria mass (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s005">S5C Fig</xref></bold>), TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DCs displayed marked increase in oxygen consumption rate (OCR), indicative of accelerated OXPHOS and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g004">Fig 4E–4G</xref></bold>). Furthermore, in addition to marked elevation in both basal and maximal OCRs, TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DCs also acquired prominent spare respiratory capacity (SRC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g004"><bold>Fig 4E</bold> and <bold>4F</bold></xref>), which reflects the difference between maximal and basal OCRs. Importantly, etomoxir, but not 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) or bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1, 3, 4-thiadiazol-2-yl) ethyl sulfide (BPTES), inhibited the spare OCR (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s005">S5D Fig</xref></bold>), thus suggesting that TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DCs are more prone to use FAO generating energy.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DCs also exhibited impaired expression of cytokines <italic>Il7</italic>, <italic>Il15</italic>, and <italic>Il15Rα</italic>, which have been widely linked to T-cell homeostasis, and antigen-presenting genes histocompatibility 2, K1, K region (<italic>H2-k1</italic>) and histocompatibility 2, D region locus 1 (<italic>H2-d1</italic>), which encode MHC class I molecules histocompatibility 2, K1, K region (H2-K<sup>b</sup>) and histocompatibility 2, D region locus 1 (H2-D<sup>b</sup>), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g004"><bold>Fig 4A</bold> and <bold>4B</bold></xref>). Flow cytometry analyses confirmed that the cell surface presence of MHC-I H2-K<sup>b</sup> and H2-D<sup>b</sup>, but not of MHC-II, was down-regulated in TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DCs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g004">Fig 4H</xref></bold>). Moreover, both CD8α<sup>+</sup> and CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC subsets from the TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> spleen showed reduction in MHC-I but not MHC-II expression (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s005">S5E Fig</xref></bold>). Upon infection with L.M.-OVA, splenic DCs from the wild-type mice showed notable surface presentation of H2-K<sup>b</sup>/OVA<sub>257-264</sub> (H2-K<sup>b</sup>-SIINFEKL) complexes, indicative of efficient cross presentation of antigens by DCs in vivo (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g004">Fig 4I</xref></bold>). Conversely, flow cytometry analysis barely detected H2-K<sup>b</sup>/OVA<sub>257-264</sub> complexes on the surface of splenic DCs from TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> mice (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g004">Fig 4I</xref></bold>), demonstrating severely compromised capacity in MHC-I-restricted cross presentation. Hence, transcriptome analyses revealed crucial roles for TSC1 in the control of antigen presentation, cytokine production, and fatty acid synthesis in DCs.</p>

<title>Impaired expression of H2-K<sup>b</sup> and IL-7 underlie TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DC dysfunction</title>
<p>Considering MHC-I-restricted antigen presentation is essential for CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell response, we sought to directly assess antigen presentation in DCs via well-established in vitro assays. Untreated or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated BMDCs were loaded with OVA<sub>257-264</sub> peptides, and the surface presentation of H2-K<sup>b</sup>/OVA<sub>257-264</sub> complexes were assessed by flow cytometry. Compared with the wild-type DCs, TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DCs showed considerable reduction in surface presentation of H2-K<sup>b</sup>/OVA<sub>257-264</sub> complexes before and after LPS stimulation (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s006">S6A Fig</xref></bold>). Nevertheless, the ability to uptake dextran was well preserved in TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DCs (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s006">S6B Fig</xref></bold>). Hence, TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DCs are compromised specifically in antigen presentation, rather than in general processes like endocytosis or phagocytosis. As DC presentation of H2-K<sup>b</sup>/OVA<sub>257-264</sub> or MHC-II/OVA<sub>323-339</sub> can lead to ovalbumin-specific TCR transgenic mouse (OT)-I CD8<sup>+</sup> or OT-II CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell proliferation in vitro, we further interrogated antigen presentation in TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DCs via the functional assay. As expected, wild-type BMDCs loaded with OVA or OVA<sub>257-264</sub> peptides were able to drive successive division of carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled naïve OT-I CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g005">Fig 5A</xref></bold>). Conversely, TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> BMDCs loaded with respective antigens were much less efficient in driving OT-I CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells’ division (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g005">Fig 5A</xref></bold>). It is noteworthy that TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> BMDCs loaded with OVA<sub>323-339</sub> were able to trigger OT-II CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell proliferation as well as wild-type BMDCs, indicating the intact MHC-II-restricted antigen presentation (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s006">S6C Fig</xref></bold>). Furthermore, splenic TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DCs loaded with OVA were also defective in driving OT-I CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell proliferation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g005">Fig 5B</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>To correlate H2-K<sup>b</sup> reduction with defective cross presentation, we restored H2-K<sup>b</sup> expression in TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DCs via lentiviral transduction (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s006">S6D Fig</xref></bold>) and followed this with functional analysis of antigen presentation. Whereas the exogenous expression of H2-K<sup>b</sup> only marginally elevated the antigen-presenting ability in wild-type BMDCs, it resulted in prominent augmentation of antigen presentation in TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> BMDCs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g005">Fig 5C</xref></bold>). In particular, once loaded with OVA proteins, H2-K<sup>b</sup>-transducted TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> BMDCs demonstrated a nearly 10-fold increase in antigen cross presentation, reflected by OT-I CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell proliferation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g005">Fig 5C</xref></bold>). Remarkably, H2-K<sup>b</sup>-restored TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DCs closely resembled wild-type DCs in terms of triggering CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell proliferation, thus underscoring the functional relevance of TSC1-regulated MHC-I expression in DCs.</p>
<p>Similarly, we addressed the functional relevance of IL-7 reduction in TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> mice through intraperitoneal injection of exogenous IL-7 to restore T-cell homeostasis. Interestingly, exogenous IL-7 did not have any significant impact on T cells in the wild-type mice: neither CD8<sup>+</sup> nor CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell numbers were altered following IL-7 injection. In contrast, supplementation with IL-7 exerted a notable effect on T lymphocytes in the TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> mice, whose CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were doubled, but was still lower than that in wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g005"><bold>Fig 5D</bold> and <bold>5E</bold></xref>). Mechanistically, IL-7 supplementation decreased the percentage of apoptotic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DCs by 2-fold (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g005">Fig 5F</xref></bold>), implicating an important role for DC-derived IL-7 in maintaining homeostatic CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell survival.</p>

We first examined the expression of a variety of transcriptional factors but found that certain transcriptional activators such as FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene (c-fos), IFN regulatory factors (IRFs), and c-Myc were actually elevated in TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DCs, whereas others such as nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) and cAMP responsive element binding proteins (CREBs) were unaltered (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g006">Fig 6A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s007">S7A Fig</xref></bold>). These results may be helpful to explain why genes involved in fatty acid synthesis were up-regulated, but they could not directly address how the defective gene expression occurred. We therefore conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-quantitative PCR (qPCR) to examine the epigenetic markers associated with <italic>Il7</italic> and <italic>H2-k1</italic>. The presence of a variety of histone methylation markers, especially tri-methyl-histone H3 (Lys27) (H3K27me3) and tri-methyl-histone H3 (Lys9) (H3K9me3), in the promoter regions of <italic>Il7</italic> and <italic>H2-k1</italic> genes were largely comparable between wild-type and TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DCs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g006">Fig 6B</xref></bold>). However, the enrichment of acetylation markers acetyl-histone H3 (Lys27) (H3K27ac) and acetyl-histone H3 (Lys9) (H3K9ac) within <italic>Il7</italic> and <italic>H2-kb</italic> promoters was substantially reduced in the TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DCs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g006">Fig 6B</xref></bold>). Given the established correlation between acetyl-CoA abundance and histone acetylation, we sought to quantitatively measure cellular acetyl-CoA levels. Remarkably, decreased acetyl-CoA was detected in both the cytosolic and nuclear compartments of TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DCs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g006">Fig 6C</xref></bold>). To determine whether the reduction in nuclear acetyl-CoA was accountable for the decrease in histone acetylation, we supplemented both wild-type and TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DCs with abundant acetate, which could convert into acetyl-CoA by acyl-CoA synthetase short chain family member 2 (ACSS2) in the cytosolic/nuclear compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref025">25</xref>]. Notably, replenishing acetyl-CoA with acetate elevated the enrichment of epigenetic markers H3K27ac and H3K9ac in <italic>Il7</italic> and <italic>H2-k1</italic> promoters, especially in the TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DCs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g006">Fig 6D</xref></bold>). These results revealed an intimate association between acetyl-CoA production and histone acetylation in the regulation of a DC-specific gene program.</p>

<p>Given the widespread association between metabolic reprograming and acetyl-CoA fluctuations in the regulation of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref023">23</xref>], we subsequently examined which metabolic processes might be responsible for the altered epigenetic regulation on DC-specific genes. To this end, we screened a panel of inhibitors targeting various metabolic checkpoints by assessing their effects on the expression of MHC-I molecules H2-K<sup>b</sup> and H2-D<sup>b</sup>. Corroborating the critical role of TSC1-mTORC1 in DC function (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g002">Fig 2A</xref></bold>), blockade of mTOR with rapamycin, KU0063794, and PP242 increased H2-K<sup>b</sup> and H2-D<sup>b</sup> expression in BMDCs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g006">Fig 6E</xref></bold>) but decreased MHC-II expression (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s007">S7B Fig</xref></bold>). However, 2-DG, which targets hexose kinase HK, did not alter either H2-K<sup>b</sup> or H2-D<sup>b</sup> expression (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g006">Fig 6E</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s007">S7C Fig</xref></bold>), indicating a dispensable role for glycolysis in this process. Moreover, dampening FAO by etomoxir also failed to exert any significant impact on MHC-I expression. Remarkably, blockade of ACC1 by 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid (TOFA) elevated H2-K<sup>b</sup> and H2-D<sup>b</sup> expression (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g006">Fig 6E</xref></bold>) but had no impact on MHC-II molecules (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s007">S7B Fig</xref></bold>). In contrast, blockade of other enzymes required for fatty acid synthesis, such as Acly and fatty acid synthase (Fasn) with Acly inhibitor (Aclyi) and C75, respectively, did not have the same effect as TOFA (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s007">S7D</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s007">S7E Fig</xref></bold>). As all these inhibitors similarly target fatty acid synthesis, their differential effects on MHC-I argue against a crucial role for fatty acid synthesis per se in the regulation of MHC-I expression.</p>
<p>Notably, ACC1 expression was elevated in TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DCs, as demonstrated by real-time PCR and immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g004"><bold>Fig 4A</bold> and <bold>4B</bold></xref> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g006">Fig 6A</xref></bold>). It is plausible that highly active ACC1 led to consumption of acetyl-CoA for malonyl-coenzyme A (malonyl-CoA) and subsequent fatty acid synthesis. Conceivably, blockade of ACC1 could result in acetyl-CoA accumulation and thus possible increase in histone acetylation. Indeed, TOFA treatment increased the abundance of H3K27ac and H3K9ac in <italic>Il7</italic> and <italic>H2-k1</italic> promoters and concomitant recruitment of polymerase II (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g006">Fig 6F</xref></bold>). Consequently, the expression of IL-7 and H2-Kb were up-regulated by TOFA or acetate (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g006">Fig 6G</xref></bold>). Notably, treatment with either TOFA or acetate but not C75 led to increased acetyl-CoA in the cytosolic and nuclear compartments of wild-type and TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DCs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g006">Fig 6H</xref></bold>). Correspondingly, TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DCs pretreated with TOFA showed increased capacity in antigen presentation of both OVA proteins and OVA<sub>253-264</sub> peptides (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g006">Fig 6I</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s007">S7E Fig</xref></bold>). In contrast, TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DCs pretreated with C75 had slightly elevated cross presentation of OVA (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g006">Fig 6I</xref></bold>) but similar antigen presentation of OVA<sub>253-264</sub> peptides (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000420.s007">S7E Fig</xref></bold>). These results demonstrate that blockade of ACC1 is the most efficient way to rescue the metabolic dysfunction in TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DCs.</p>
<p>Next, we took a genetic approach to validate the role of ACC1 in the regulation of acetyl-CoA and <italic>H2k1</italic>/<italic>Il7</italic> expression in DCs. Upon knocking down the expression of ACC1 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g007">Fig 7A</xref></bold>), we observed increased acetyl-CoA levels in the cytosolic and nuclear compartments of both wild-type and TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DCs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g007">Fig 7B</xref></bold>). Consistently, ACC1 knockdown led to elevated histone acetylation markers H3K27ac and H3K9ac on the promoters of <italic>H2k1</italic> and <italic>Il7</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g007">Fig 7C</xref></bold>). Consequently, DC-mediated OT-I CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell proliferation was considerably augmented in ACC1-knockdown DCs, correlating with increased H2-Kb and IL7 expression (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g007">Fig 7D–7F</xref></bold>). On the other hand, short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of <italic>Alcy</italic> led to reduced acetyl-CoA production and impaired expression of H2-kb and IL-7 in DCs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g007">Fig 7G–7I</xref></bold>). Together, these results identify ACC1 as a key checkpoint where metabolic and epigenetic pathways intersect (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000420.g008">Fig 8</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Recent findings have placed the multifaceted TSC1-mTORC1 pathway at the center of DC biology. Nevertheless, the full spectrum of TSC1-mTOR function in diverse DC subsets has yet to be unveiled, and the complex mechanisms involved remain very much underappreciated. In this study, we uncovered a central role for TSC1-mTOR in programing DC metabolism, a process integral to homeostatic DC–T cell interaction. Whereas DCs have been conventionally linked to T-cell priming and activation, its role in immune tolerance and homeostasis has also emerged. Upon entering the periphery, naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells rely on two major signals for long-term survival—i.e., the tonic TCR signaling triggered by self-peptide/MHC-I complexes and the intermittent IL-7 signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref013">13</xref>]. Although multiple cell types are capable of supplying both signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref036">36</xref>], our data strongly support the assertion that DCs are the key cellular source providing survival signals for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Metabolic programing has pivotal roles in immune cell function, yet how metabolism impinges on epigenetics to influence gene expression has been less explored. In this regard, the metabolic–epigenetic coupling mechanism revealed by this study may serve as a paradigm for further understanding of metabolic regulation in the immune system.</p>
<p>Because of its unique ability to coordinate gene transcription/translation with cell metabolism, it is not surprising that the TSC1-mTOR pathway has been implicated in DC development and function. Whereas ablation of TSC1 through inducible Cre-estrogen receptor (CreER) led to marked reduction in all the DC subsets, irrespective of their anatomic locations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref028">28</xref>], DC-specific ablation of late endosomal/lysosomal adaptor, MAPK and MTOR activator (LamTOR), mTOR, or Raptor via CD11c-Cre caused selective loss of CD103<sup>+</sup> DCs and Langerhans cells only in certain nonlymphoid tissues including lung and skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref039">39</xref>]. In this study, DC-specific ablation of TSC1 through Cd11c-Cre did not cause widespread defects in DC development either; the resident DC subsets in the secondary lymphoid organs were well reserved. However, we did observe relatively subtle reduction of the migratory DCs within the pLNs of TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> mice. Whether the reduction in migratory DCs might have contributed to the decrease in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells remains an open question; however, the fact that the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were normally present in the LNs argue against this scenario. It has been reported that the tonic inhibitor of kappaB kinase (IKK)β activity is involved in DC migration to the draining LNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref040">40</xref>]; however, TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DCs demonstrated increased IKKβ activation upon LPS stimulation instead [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref029">29</xref>]. As TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DCs also display normal surface CCR7, the mechanism underlying their migration defect has yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Although TSC1 expression may not be absolutely required for DC development and survival, it can be involved in various DC functions. Previous studies have shown that TSC1-deficient DCs are defective in CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell priming and differentiation, in part because of compromised MHC-II and IL-12 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref029">29</xref>]. Interestingly, we did not see any major defect in the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell compartment that is contingent on TSC1 deficiency in DCs. Instead, TSC1 deficiency in DCs profoundly affected the CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell compartment, leading to substantial reduction in both naïve and memory–phenotype CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the steady state, and severely compromised CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell activation in response to L.M. infection and melanoma challenge. Mechanistically, our data suggest a scenario that defective expression of MHC-I and cytokines such as IL-7 in the DC compartment might have contributed to the overt apoptosis in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Although the current consensus is that naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells need continuous but intermittent engagement with IL-7 and MHC-I in order to maintain long-term survival in the periphery, it is the cellular source for both signals that has been under debate. Because MHC-I molecules are ubiquitously expressed, both immune cells and nonimmune cells have been shown to be able to present self-peptide and promote naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell survival and/or proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref041">41</xref>]. However, there are also circumstances in which DC presentation of self-antigen can be mandatory for CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref042">42</xref>]. Indeed, DCs, particularly XCR1<sup>+</sup> DCs in the secondary lymphoid organs and CD103<sup>+</sup> DCs in the peripheral tissues, possess a unique ability to cross-present antigens captured from damaged or apoptotic cells through micropinocytosis or efferocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref044">44</xref>]. With abundant enzymes specialized in precision digestion and processing antigens, DCs are also better equipped for generating self-peptides fitting into MHC-I molecules. In this regard, it is plausible that DCs may be able to present a much broader range of antigens than non-DCs. Indeed, DCs, especially migratory DCs, are known to constantly survey peripheral tissues, engulfing apoptotic cells, processing self-antigens, and cross-presenting them to naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the LNs. Therefore, DCs may have a nonredundant role in cross-presenting tissue antigens to naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with special TCR repertoires, thus supporting the abundance and breadth of naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell population.</p>
<p>IL-7 is a pleiotropic cytokine required not only for CD8<sup>+</sup> but also for CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell survival. However, it remains a great challenge to unequivocally determine the cellular sources for IL-7, which is generally present at low abundance. Whereas a broad range of epithelia and fibroblasts can produce ample IL-7, DCs also express a decent amount of IL-7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref045">45</xref>]. Importantly, DC production of IL-7 can be crucial for T-cell survival and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref012">12</xref>]. As T-cell numbers are generally kept steady, exogenous administration of IL-7 did not have a significant impact on T-cell numbers in the wild-type mice. However, supplementation with IL-7 exerted a notable effect on T cells in the TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> mice, increasing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by 2-fold. These data suggest that DC-produced IL-7 also contributes to the bulk amounts of IL-7. Intriguingly, two studies using CD11c-diphtheria toxin A (DTA) to achieve DC depletion revealed that loss of DCs did not have major effects on T-cell development or homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref047">47</xref>], albeit a notable increase in CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> ratio was observed in one study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref047">47</xref>]. However, our data indicate that the presence of functional defective DCs could impair CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell homeostasis. Our finding is consistent with the report that ablation of MHC-II in DCs compromised CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell homeostasis in the spleen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref048">48</xref>], even though depletion of DCs did not generate such effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref046">46</xref>]. To reconcile these disparate findings, we propose that when DCs are absent, other cells could presumably fill the void and still manage to maintain T-cell homeostasis. Conversely, when DCs are present but functionally corrupted, they would be still poised to engage T cells but incapable of providing adequate help signals. As DCs are the favorite targets for T cells, other cells would have very limited access to T cells under such circumstances. Conceivably, occupying CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells but failing to provide the intermittent IL-7 and TCR signals may be the key cause of impaired CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell response in the TSC1<sup>DC-KO</sup> mice. In this regard, we propose that CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell homeostasis is contingent on the MHC-I/self-peptide and IL-7 signals from the DC compartment.</p>
<p>In addition to host defense, DC has been widely associated with immune homeostasis by sensing environmental cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref004">4</xref>]. In line with this notion, TSC1-mTOR has been recognized as one of the core modules responsible for the detection of environmental cues, including nutrients, growth factors, and PAMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref027">27</xref>]. How TSC1-mTOR-controlled cell metabolism works together with gene transcription/translation program that enables DC for immune homeostasis can be complex and context dependent. Whereas TLR-stimulated DCs rapidly elevate glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis for ER and Golgi expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref018">18</xref>], overaccumulation of lipids can dampen cross presentation as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref050">50</xref>]. In the steady-state DCs, glycolysis and OXPHOS are relatively low to accommodate their basic energetic and biosynthetic demands, although CD103<sup>+</sup> DCs demonstrate higher metabolic activity than CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs do [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref021">21</xref>]. However, in the absence of TSC1, we found that the steady-state DCs carry out active glycolysis and accelerated fatty acid synthesis, thus showing metabolic features fitting into activated DCs rather than steady-state DCs. One of the consequences of fatty acid synthesis is lipid accumulation, which has been implicated in dampening cross presentation of antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref050">50</xref>]; another consequence of fatty acid synthesis is the consumption of cytosolic acetyl-coA, a cofactor highly demanded in the nucleus for histone acetylation and epigenetic regulation of immune gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000420.ref026">26</xref>]. In line with these assumptions, TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DCs indeed displayed high amounts of lipids in the cytosol but low amounts of acetyl-CoA in the nucleus. Although Alcy, Acc1, and Fasn are all required for fatty acid synthesis, only blocking ACC1 by TOFA or shRNA rescued H2-K<sup>b</sup> and IL-7 expression, thus arguing against the notion that lipid accumulation might be responsible for the dysfunction of TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DCs. Instead, our data strongly suggest that exhaustion of cytosolic acetyl-CoA by accelerated fatty acid synthesis might have attributed to impaired DC function. In support of this notion, we observed reduced H3K27ac and H3K9ac in the promoters of <italic>H2k1</italic> and <italic>Il7</italic> genes in TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> DCs, and supplementation with acetate or treatment with TOFA was able to restore the histone acetylation markers. Therefore, this study presents a paradigm highlighting the unique metabolic–epigenetic coupling in immune regulation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our data support the notion that metabolic programing is integral to DC function and reveal a special metabolic–epigenetic coupled program in imprinting DCs for T-cell homeostasis. We propose that the TSC1-mTOR pathway may play central roles in defining specific DC functions via integration of environmental cues such as nutrients and tissue factors with inflammatory signals like PAMPs and cytokines. We believe that the complex interplay between metabolism and epigenetics has broad implications in autoimmunity and host defense.</p>
