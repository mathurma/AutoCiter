				<article-title>The Path to Digestion Is Paved with Repair</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>When a cell suffers a plasma membrane disruption, extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> rapidly diffuses into its cytosol, triggering there local homotypic and exocytotic membrane fusion events. One role of this emergency exocytotic response is to promote cell survival: the internal membrane thus added to the plasma membrane acts as a reparative “patch.” Another, unexplored consequence of disruption-induced exocytosis is secretion. Many of the cells lining the gastrointestinal tract secrete mucus via a compound exocytotic mechanism, and these and other epithelial cell types lining the digestive tract are normally subject to plasma membrane disruption injury in vivo. Here we show that plasma membrane disruption triggers a potent mucus secretory response from stomach mucous cells wounded in vitro by shear stress or by laser irradiation. This disruption-induced secretory response is Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent, and coupled to cell resealing: disruption in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> does not trigger mucus release, but results instead in cell death due to failure to reseal. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, disruption-induced mucus secretion and resealing were also demonstrable in segments of intact rat large intestine. We propose that, in addition to promoting cell survival of membrane disruptions, disruption-induced exocytosis serves also the important protective function of liberating lubricating mucus at sites of mechanical wear and tear. This mode of mechanotransduction can, we propose, explain how lubrication in the gastrointestinal tract is rapidly and precisely adjusted to widely fluctuating, diet-dependent levels of mechanical stress.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Plasma membrane disruption is a common form of cell injury observable under physiological conditions in a wide variety of mechanically active mammalian tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040276-b001">1</xref>]. Its occurrence was first detected in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040276-b002">2</xref>]. In mice fed membrane-impermeant microscopic markers of cell wounding, epithelial cells became labeled cytosolically in the stomach and small and large intestine. One possible cause of this “cell wounding” is gut motility, which subjects GI tract epithelia to shear and compression stresses.</p>
      <p>The GI tract protects itself from damaging mechanical and other stresses by producing and secreting onto epithelial surfaces a layer of lubricating mucus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040276-b003">3</xref>]. For example, mechanical stimulation, such as distention of the stomach wall, potently stimulates mucus secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040276-b004">4</xref>]. Mucus production is, moreover, stimulated by high-fiber diets, confirming that, under physiological conditions in vivo, a mechanism is in place for sensing and responding to mechanical stress with an increase in lubrication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040276-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040276-b006">6</xref>]. However, the mechanism of this important mechanotransduction event, responsible for triggering exocytotic membrane fusion events, and consequent mucus secretion, remains unknown. We here test the novel possibility that plasma membrane disruptions, induced in mucous cells by mechanical stress, trigger protective mucus secretory events in the GI tract.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>Three different fluorescently tagged lectins, soybean agglutinin (SBA), <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Ulex europaeus</named-content> agglutinin 1 (UEA1), and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) all strongly stained the mucus granules of gastric surface mucous cells, both in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040276-g001">Figure 1</xref>), and also other mucus-producing cells (goblet cells) of the GI tract (unpublished data). These lectins were therefore employed as fluorescence markers in evaluating mucus secretion microscopically and in a quantitative enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040276-b007">7</xref>] of mucus secretion. To quantitatively evaluate whether and with what level of efficacy plasma membrane disruption elicits mucus secretion, primary cultures of gastric mucous cells were wounded by syringing. Drawing suspended cells into and forcing them out of a syringe needle creates sub-lethal, reparable plasma membrane disruptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040276-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040276-b009">9</xref>]. The medium conditioned by this cell-wounding event was evaluated for mucus content by ELLA. Increasing the number of “strokes,” or cell intake and expulsion events, resulted in a nearly linear increase in the amount of mucus present in medium, exceeding that obtainable with a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040276-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This assay revealed, moreover, that release failed to occur when Ca<sup>2+</sup> was omitted from the medium present during syringing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040276-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Therefore, release of mucus was potently induced by levels of shear stress known to produce plasma membrane disruptions and was Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent.</p>

          <p>Cells were taken up into and ejected from (one “stroke”) a syringe operating under constant pressure in the presence of 1.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (+Ca), or were not so treated (Control). One group of cells was wounded by syringing in the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (−Ca), and another was incubated with a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore (Ionomycin, 1 μM, 10 min). The medium conditioned by these cells was then harvested and the content of mucus present quantitated in an ELLA assay employing either WGA (A) or UEA (B) as the mucus ligand. All treatments, except wounding in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (−Ca, eight strokes), gave mean (± standard error of the mean) values that differed significantly from the control, <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001 (A), <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.01 (B), Kruskal-Wallis test.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>To test if these two events, mucus secretion and resealing, were temporally and spatially coupled responses, we imaged both simultaneously in living individual cells responding to a laser-induced plasma membrane disruption. Gastric surface mucous cells were bathed in a membrane-impermeant dye, FM 4–64, which is widely used to monitor endocytotic traffic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040276-b010">10</xref>]. In the short-term incubations, it strongly stains the plasma membrane only of an intact cell, but enters rapidly through an open plasma membrane disruption, where it stains the internal membrane. In the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040276-g003">Figure 3</xref>A; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040276-sv001">Video S1</xref>), laser-wounded cells (arrows) could not restrict entry of FM4–64 dye (red channel), and consequently developed strong cytoplasmic staining with this dye over the 5-min observation period. By contrast, in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040276-g003">Figure 3</xref>B; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040276-sv002">Video S2</xref>), laser-wounded cells (arrows) restricted FM4–64 entry over the 5-min interval, and consequently did not develop strong cytoplasmic membrane staining. Thus, as in numerous other cell types, resealing is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent event in gastric mucous cells. Cells that succeeded in resealing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040276-g003">Figure 3</xref>B, arrows) in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> became, simultaneously, heavily stained with a fluorescent lectin, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-SBA (green channel), that stains extracellular mucus. Those cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040276-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, arrows), by contrast, that failed to reseal due to the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> did not develop increased surface staining with the FITC-SBA. Thus, disruption-induced mucus secretion also is Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent, and secretion occurs only in those cells that mount a resealing response. These, and additional images, were also analyzed quantitatively using image analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040276-g003">Figure 3</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040276-g003">3</xref>D). Entry of FM4–64 dye was rapidly blocked in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040276-g003">Figure 3</xref>C), indicating that a successful resealing response had been mounted, restoring membrane integrity. This restoration of boundary formation clearly fails in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040276-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). During this same interval, FITC-SBA surface staining intensity rose dramatically immediately after laser wounding in the presence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but not in its absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040276-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). These data directly demonstrate that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered resealing and mucus secretion are temporally and spatially coupled in cultured gastric surface mucous cells.</p>

          <p>(A) A cluster of gastric mucous cells was imaged by confocally before (0 s) and after (300 s) wounding of two cells (arrows) with a laser in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Minus Ca). Shown are differential interference contrast (DIC), and fluorescence images of FM4–64 dye (red channel), which stains the cytoplasmic membranes of cells that fail to reseal, and of FITC-SBA (green channel), which stains extracellular mucus. Note that strong cytoplasmic staining with FM4–64 is seen 300 s after wounding, whereas no detectable increase in surface staining with FITC-SBA is observed at this time point.</p>
          <p>(B) A cluster of gastric mucous cells wounded and imaged as in (A) but in the presence of 1.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Plus Ca). Note that very little cytoplasmic staining with FM4–64 is seen 300 s after wounding, whereas strong surface staining with FITC-SBA is observed at this time point.</p>
          <p>(C) Entry of FM 4–64 dye into cell cytoplasm was monitored over time after laser wounding (arrow). In the presence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Plus Ca), a small amount of dye entry is detectable only during the first 20–30 s post-wounding, indicating that resealing was completed within this time frame. In the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Minus Ca), entry of dye continues until, at approximately 100 s, internal membranes reach a saturation point. Resealing failed in these cells (<italic>n</italic> = 3). Bars indicate the standard error of the mean.</p>
          <p>(D) Surface staining intensity of the cells with FITC-SBA monitored over time after laser wounding (red arrow). In the presence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Plus Ca<sup>2+</sup>), an increase in surface staining is detectable at 50 s post-wounding and continues throughout the time course of the experiment, indicating that, concurrently with resealing, mucus was being exocytosed. In the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Minus Ca<sup>2+</sup>), by contrast, only a slight increase in staining was observed (<italic>n</italic> = 3). Bars indicate the standard error of the mean.</p>

      <p>We next asked if loss of intracellular mucus accompanies a successful resealing response, another predicted outcome if mucus secretion is coupled to resealing. Monolayers of MKN28 cells were scratched with a sharp implement in the presence of fluorescent dextran so as to mechanically induce plasma membrane disruptions in the cells lining the scratch site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040276-b011">11</xref>]. Cells that survive a disruption trap the fluorescent dextran marker in their cytosol and thus can subsequently be identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040276-b011">11</xref>]. The monolayers were washed thoroughly after wounding and stained after detergent permeablization (to provide access to cytoplasmic mucin) with fluorescent WGA. There was a striking negative correlation between fluorescent dextran (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040276-g004">Figure 4</xref>A) and WGA labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040276-g004">Figure 4</xref>B), indicating that cells surviving a plasma membrane disruption had exocytosed most if not all of their mucus granules. This loss of intracellular mucus could also be demonstrated quantitatively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040276-g004">Figure 4</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040276-g004">4</xref>D). Flow cytofluorometry was used to evaluate the intracellular staining with FITC-WGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040276-g004">Figure 4</xref>C) of undisturbed MKN28 cells (dark green population) and wounded MKN28 (light green population). A downward shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040276-g004">Figure 4</xref>C) in the fluorescence of wounded population (light green) relative to the undisturbed population (dark green) was reproducibly observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040276-g004">Figure 4</xref>D).</p>

      <p>The massive deposition of cytoplasmic membrane onto surface plasma membrane that accompanies mucus secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040276-b012">12</xref>] would be expected to dramatically alter surface architecture. To test this prediction, we used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to compare the surface morphology of undisturbed MKN28 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040276-g005">Figure 5</xref>A) with that of cells wounded in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040276-g005">Figure 5</xref>B) or in the presence of resealing-permissive physiological Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040276-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). Wounding in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040276-g005">Figure 5</xref>C) induced a dramatic alteration in surface architecture: the cell becomes richly decorated with numerous membrane protrusions, as expected if disruption-induced exocytosis had added additional membrane to the surface. Additionally, spherical structures, possibly representing exocytosed mucus granules, were observed on the surfaces of wounded cells. Transmission electron micrographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040276-g005">Figure 5</xref>D), through disruption sites of cells wounded in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, confirmed that a dramatic alteration in surface architecture accompanies resealing, and that this alteration involved the formation of microvilli and liberation of mucus granules (intracellular granules are marked by arrows) onto the cell surface.</p>

      <p>Finally, we asked if disruption-induced mucus secretion could occur in an excised segment of the GI tract. A segment of rat colon was immersed in saline with or without added Ca<sup>2+</sup>, scratched with a sharp implement, and then exposed to saline containing FM 4–64 and FITC-UEA. When the scratch was carried out in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, staining with FM 4–64, which strongly stains cells that fail to reseal (see above), was minimal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040276-g006">Figure 6</xref>A), whereas strong staining with the mucus stain, FITC-UEA, was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040276-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). The converse staining pattern was observed in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040276-g006">Figure 6</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040276-g006">6</xref>D). Thus, membrane disruptions made in intact segments of gut under resealing-permissive conditions, as in the in vitro models systems described above, also result in a strong, local mucus secretory response, one that is coupled to a resealing response. Resealing failure, on the other hand, is associated with minimal mucus release.</p>

As indicated by relative FM4–64 staining intensities, an increased incidence of resealing failure occurred in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Mucin, in vivo, is stored in a dense cluster of apical granules, both in the surface mucous cell which continuously lines the entire luminal surface of the stomach, and in the specialized goblet cells, which are intermittently present throughout small and large intestine epithelia. Secretion apparently can occur constitutively, but it also clearly can be regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040276-b013">13</xref>]. Given the protective role of mucus, it is not surprising that numerous injurious chemical agents stimulate mucus secretion, as do mechanical stimuli.</p>
      <p>Several neurohormonal agonists capable of triggering mucus secretion have been identified. During secretagogue-induced mucin secretion, both homotypic (between mucin granule membranes) and heterotypic/exocytotic (between granule and plasma membranes) fusion events occur, a process referred to as <italic>compound exocytosis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040276-b012">12</xref>]. The result is that a single, large bolus of mucus, the contents of many fused mucus granules, is secreted. Candidate secretagogues include cholinergic agents, which can activate cells of salivary glands, and the cultured mucous cells of the stomach and small intestine goblet cells, but only those present in the crypts. Interestingly, given the potential importance of direct mechanical regulation for those cells directly exposed to luminal stresses, surface- and villus-resident mucous cells become refractory to neurohormonal stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040276-b014">14</xref>]. Neuropeptides also will induce mucus secretion from certain mucous cell lines in vitro, and prostaglandins induce mucus secretion from cultured cells, cell lines, and gastric surface mucous cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040276-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040276-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040276-b015">15</xref>]. However, the physiological significance of these and other described chemical agonists remains unclear.</p>
      <p>Regulated secretion of mucus strikingly resembles membrane fusion-based resealing. In both, a rise in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040276-b016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040276-b019">19</xref>] can trigger homotypic and heterotypic membrane fusion events leading to the massive surface deposition of internal membrane, a process referred to as compound exocytosis in relation to mucus secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040276-b012">12</xref>] and patching in relation to resealing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040276-b020">20</xref>]. Strikingly, secretagogue-stimulated mucus secretion in vivo is accompanied by the sloughing of considerable cytoplasmic constituents, and also of membrane, into the extracellular milieu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040276-b012">12</xref>]. This is true also for resealing-based exocytotic fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040276-b020">20</xref>]. The loss of cytoplasm just mentioned strongly implies that, in fact, during secretagogue-stimulated secretion, a disruption in plasma membrane continuity occurs, and that, therefore, all strong mucus secretory events are, in part, a resealing response. Such sloughing of unused membrane may be the result of a “vertex” fusion mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040276-b021">21</xref>]. In this mode, rather than a single fusion pore, membranes are envisioned to interact extensively along vertices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040276-b022">22</xref>]. The predicted result, when this model is applied to a resealing or compound exocytotic event, is the excision, and consequent sloughing, of a large segment of the fusing membrane. Vertex fusion may, therefore, be another shared characteristic.</p>
      <p>We here propose that, in mucus-producing cells of the GI tract, plasma membrane disruption events, which occur physiologically in this mechanically active environment, potently induce mucus release. This adaptation to a stressful environment would confer two benefits. First, the wounded cell survives the disruption. Our results suggest that the cytoplasmic membrane compartment utilized for repair is not, as has been previously proposed for fibroblasts and other cultured cells, the lysosomal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040276-b023">23</xref>] or endocytotic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040276-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040276-b025">25</xref>] compartments but instead, a classical secretory (mucus granule) pathway compartment. The positioning of this compartment, at cellular apices exposed to injurious events, may indeed represent an adaptation that facilitates rapid repair in a particularly hostile environment. Second, and perhaps more important, a deposit of lubricating mucus is made at sites of mechanical wear and tear, which could then serve to protect other cells from injury. Strongly supporting this hypothesis is our finding in three different mucus-producing cell types––primary cultures of surface gastric mucous cells, a cultured cell line, and intestinal goblet cells––that a plasma membrane disruption can potently induce mucus secretion. Release of mucus is, in each case, not simply a matter of cell lysis, which is far more effectively achieved when Ca<sup>2+</sup> is absent and resealing is therefore blocked. Rather, as we show here by monitoring these events simultaneously in living, single cells, mucus secretion and successful resealing occur simultaneously, and both require that external Ca<sup>2+</sup> be present during a plasma membrane disruption. Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through a plasma membrane disruption, we propose, involves mucus granules in a homotypic fusion response leading to the creation of a patch vesicle, or compound exocytotic granule, from individual granule membranes (summarized schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040276-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Its exocytotic annealing to surrounding plasma membrane then reseals the disruption, and, most important, deposits a bolus of mucus on the cell surface.</p>

          <title>Coupling of Repair and Protective Mucus Secretion</title>
          <p>Mechanical or other stressors produce a plasma membrane disruption in a mucous cell lining the GI tract. Ca<sup>2+</sup> enters through the disruption. Homotypic fusion of granules with one another is triggered by this signal. Exocytotic fusion of the homotypic fusion product with the plasma membrane surrounding the defect site completes repair and liberates mucus into the extracellular environment. Some cytoplasmic components and membrane are also liberated (see text for explanation).</p>

      <p>Mucus secretion by this mechanism might protect against forms of injury other than mechanical. For example, when the rodent stomach is insulted with injurious levels of ethanol, a protective layer of mucus is rapidly laid down, under which locomotion by cells protected in glandular epithelial invaginations (gastric pits) rapidly promotes restitution of epithelial integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040276-b026">26</xref>]. Our hypothesis suggests that protection does not require that the secreting mucus cells necessarily survive an insult, but rather that release of mucus occur, e.g., that it be liberated from its cytoplasmic, membrane-bound state. For this to transpire, all that would be required is extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Two sources are available in the stomach. One is saliva, which is notably rich in Ca<sup>2+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040276-b027">27</xref>] and, hence, represents a constitutive source of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> for surface epithelial cells. A second source, available apically as a signal for mucus-producing cells, but only upon injury, is the Ca<sup>2+</sup> present in the abluminal, extracellular environment. Abluminal fluids rapidly permeate any paracellular route opened by an injury to the epithelium, such as an ethanol insult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040276-b026">26</xref>]. We propose that wounds to mucus-producing cells, occurring under physiological or pathological conditions, and caused by either chemical or physical agents, result in an important adaptive response in the GI tract, the elaboration of a protective layer of mucus. Onsite mucus lubrication is thus rapidly and directly tuned to the widely fluctuating stress levels of the GI environment.</p>
