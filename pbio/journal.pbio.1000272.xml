<p>The mating plug is a key regulator of mosquito fertility.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>Insect seminal fluid proteins are powerful modulators of many aspects of female physiology and behaviour including longevity, egg production, sperm storage, and remating. The crucial role of these proteins in reproduction makes them promising targets for developing tools aimed at reducing the population sizes of vectors of disease. In the malaria mosquito <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>, seminal secretions produced by the male accessory glands (MAGs) are transferred to females in the form of a coagulated mass called the mating plug. The potential of seminal fluid proteins as tools for mosquito control demands that we improve our limited understanding of the composition and function of the plug. Here, we show that the plug is a key determinant of <italic>An. gambiae</italic> reproductive success. We uncover the composition of the plug and demonstrate it is formed through the cross-linking of seminal proteins mediated by a MAG-specific transglutaminase (TGase), a mechanism remarkably similar to mammalian semen coagulation. Interfering with TGase expression in males inhibits plug formation and transfer, and prevents females from storing sperm with obvious consequences for fertility. Moreover, we show that the MAG-specific TGase is restricted to the anopheline lineage, where it functions to promote sperm storage rather than as a mechanical barrier to re-insemination. Taken together, these data represent a major advance in our understanding of the factors shaping <italic>Anopheles</italic> reproductive biology.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Male seminal fluid proteins trigger a wide range of behavioural and physiological changes in females and can have important effects on reproductive success. In many animals, seminal fluid is transferred to females as a gelatinous mass termed a mating plug. Although many hypotheses have been put forward to explain the function of mating plugs, their precise role in most organisms remains unclear. We have studied the composition, mechanism of formation, and function of the mating plug in the mosquito <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>, the principal vector of human malaria. We show that the plug is formed through the action of a transglutaminase enzyme that links seminal fluid proteins together resulting in semen coagulation. This process is similar to the way seminal fluid is coagulated in mammals. Interfering with the production of this transglutaminase prevented plug formation. Females that did not receive a plug failed to store sperm correctly, with important consequences for fertility. Our data show that the mating plug is an important feature of <italic>An. gambiae</italic> reproduction, and reinforce the notion that a deeper understanding of mosquito reproductive biology can aid efforts to eradicate these disease vectors.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> mosquitoes are the principal vectors of human malaria, a disease with devastating consequences for public health and the economic development of disease-endemic countries. The creation of new tools to control vector populations is a focal point of intensive efforts to eradicate the burden of malaria. As mosquitoes generally copulate only once during their lives <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Tripet1">[1]</xref>, interfering with the mating process is a promising avenue for research into vector control. Unfortunately, very little is known about the molecular or physiological basis of mating and insemination in malaria vectors. Of particular concern is our lack of knowledge about factors and pathways ensuring male reproductive success, such as those that result in sperm storage, oviposition, and the inhibition of remating in females. Improving our understanding of mating biology might not only inform currently proposed strategies for vector control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Ferguson1">[2]</xref>, but could potentially allow the development of entirely novel tools for combating malaria.</p>
<p>In sharp contrast with this scenario, a wealth of information is available on the mating biology of some non-vector insect species, particularly the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Seminal fluid proteins (generally named Acps) derived from the male accessory glands (MAGs) and transferred to females during copulation have been demonstrated to be crucial regulators of sperm storage and viability and to be the triggers of oviposition and the reduced receptivity to remating experienced by <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> females after mating (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-RaviRam1">[3]</xref>). Recently, large numbers of MAG-expressed proteins have been identified in numerous insects (e.g., honeybees <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Baer1">[4]</xref>, butterflies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Walters1">[5]</xref>, crickets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Andrs1">[6]</xref>, medflies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Davies1">[7]</xref>) including two mosquito vectors: <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Sirot1">[8]</xref> and <italic>An. gambiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Dottorini1">[9]</xref>. However, assigning specific functions to these seminal fluid proteins has proved to be difficult. Even in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, where genetic tools are well developed, only a handful of the &gt;100 secreted Acps identified in the MAGs have been functionally characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-RaviRam1">[3]</xref>. Our current knowledge of the importance of seminal fluid proteins to mating biology in <italic>An. gambiae</italic> is limited, and their role in reproduction is inferred mainly by the presence of similar functional classes amongst <italic>Anopheles</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Acps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Dottorini1">[9]</xref>. For instance, in contrast to our understanding in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Findlay1">[10]</xref> and <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Sirot1">[8]</xref> where many Acps have been identified in mated females, not a single MAG-expressed protein has been demonstrated to be transferred to females in <italic>An. gambiae</italic> (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Pondeville1">[11]</xref>).</p>
<p>MAG secretions in <italic>An. gambiae</italic> are deposited into the atrium of the female reproductive tract in the form of a gelatinous mating plug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000272-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Giglioli1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Gillies1">[13]</xref>. Mating plugs are a common feature in the reproduction of many organisms including invertebrates, reptiles, and mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Birkhead1">[14]</xref>, however, among mosquitoes, they are exclusive to anopheline species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Yuval1">[15]</xref>. The <italic>An. gambiae</italic> plug is formed entirely within the male and is digested by the female over a period of 24 h. Nothing is known about its composition or how the liquid contents of the MAGs coagulate to form a solid mass during mating. Even the function of the plug is unclear. One prominent hypothesis is that the mating plug of <italic>An. gambiae</italic> serves as a physical barrier to re-insemination by blocking access to the spermatheca <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Yuval1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Parker1">[16]</xref>. Indeed, Gillies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Gillies1">[13]</xref> observed rare instances of females with two plugs and sperm trapped between them. Alternatively, the mating plug might act to prevent loss of sperm from the female storage organ, ensuring male reproductive success <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Gerber1">[17]</xref>. However, early researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Giglioli1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Lum1">[18]</xref>) dismissed both of these possibilities and proposed that the mating plug serves no function and is simply a vestige of the ancestral dipteran spermatophore.</p>

<title>Proteins of the mating plug of <italic>An. gambiae</italic>.</title>
<p>A total of 27 proteins were identified by mass spectrometry analysis of mating plugs dissected from recently mated females. The source of each protein found in the plug was determined initially by the comparative proteomic MS analysis of MAGs compared to mating plug samples compared to virgin female atrium controls, and then refined by RT-PCR. The spermathecal capsule (sc), in the figure shown next to the atrium (a), was not included in this analysis. The tissue of expression of the genes encoding the proteins found in the plug are indicated by the letters m (MAGs), a (atrium), or b (for both). Proteins are named using their VectorBase identifiers (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.vectorbase.org/index.php" xlink:type="simple">http://www.vectorbase.org/index.php</ext-link>), unless currently unannotated. The novel accessory gland protein (NOVEL ACP1) is encoded by a predicted gene located between <italic>AGAP009370</italic> and <italic>AGAP009371</italic>, while the novel zinc carboxypeptidases (ZCPs) correspond to <italic>ab initio</italic> prediction located within the region 3R: 5051000-5067900 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000272.s004">Table S3</xref> for details).

<p>Here, we show that the plug is a crucial determinant of <italic>An. gambiae</italic> reproductive success. By studying its composition, we were able to identify the mechanism of plug formation, which is based on the cross-linking activity of a MAG-specific transglutaminase (TGase) on seminal proteins. RNAi-mediated depletion of this TGase in males prevents plug formation and transfer, and severely impairs fertility. Females that do not receive a mating plug cannot retain sperm in their sperm storage organ, the spermatheca, and therefore do not become inseminated. Moreover, we show that the plug provides little defence against re-insemination.</p>

<title>The Mating Plug Is Composed of Multiple MAG Proteins</title>
<p>To identify MAG proteins that are transferred to females during copulation, we examined the composition of mating plugs dissected from the reproductive tracts of recently mated <italic>An. gambiae</italic> females by mass spectrometric (MS) proteomic analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-vanDerWel1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Wacker1">[23]</xref>. To determine the source of the proteins found in the plug, we also analyzed the composition of the MAGs, and the atria of virgin females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000272-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000272.s001">Figure S1</xref>), followed by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). These analyses identified 27 plug proteins: 15 derived from the male, six derived from the female, and six found in both male and female reproductive tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000272-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Five of the male-derived proteins (Acps) were previously shown to be exclusively expressed in the accessory glands, and included four proteins located within a “male fertilization island” on chromosome arm 3R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Dottorini1">[9]</xref>. The 10 remaining male-derived proteins in the plug were not previously known to play a role in reproduction and included five proteases. Even though proteases have been shown to be important components of the seminal fluid of other Diptera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-RaviRam1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Sirot1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Findlay1">[10]</xref>, a previous study had failed to identify these enzymes in the MAGs of <italic>An. gambiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Dottorini1">[9]</xref>. The six plug proteins derived from the female reproductive tract included two secreted atrium-specific serine proteases (AGAP005194 and AGAP005195) whose transcripts were previously shown to be strongly downregulated 24 h after mating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000272-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Rogers1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>Multiple gel bands in particular from 50 to 140 kDa in the MS proteomic analysis of mating plug samples contained peptides derived from one particular protein, AGAP009368, which we have named Plugin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000272.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Plugin was found by MS in both MAG and mating plug samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000272-g001">Figure 1</xref>), and quantitative RT-PCR revealed that it is expressed exclusively in the MAGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000272-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Western blot analysis confirmed this tissue specificity and showed the presence of high molecular weight bands in plug extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000272-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Within the MAGs, Plugin was detected by immunofluorescence primarily in the anterior region of a secretory epithelium and in the channels formed by an actin-rich muscle network lining the outside of the glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000272-g002">Figure 2C, 2D</xref>).</p>

<p>Plugin lacks any recognizable protein domains, but is glutamine-rich (134/557 residues, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000272.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Many of these glutamine residues are excellent candidates for TGase-mediated cross-linking sites, as they often occur in tandem with a lysine at the +2 position, and are located in a region of the protein predicted to be intrinsically disordered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Csosz1">[25]</xref>. This observation, combined with the MS identification of both Plugin tryptic peptides in the digests of high molecular weight gel bands and a MAG-derived TGase (AGAP009099) in the mating plug, suggested that plug formation may be mediated by cross-linking of Plugin by this TGase.</p>

<title>The Plug Is Formed by TGase-Mediated Cross-Linking of Plugin</title>
<p>We tested for TGase activity in males using a monodansylcadaverine (MDC) incorporation assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Lundwall1">[26]</xref>, which allows the incorporation of the fluorescent amine MDC into TGase substrates to be detected under UV illumination. High levels of TGase activity were detected in homogenized MAGs, but not in the mating plug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000272-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), nor other male and female tissues (unpublished data). MDC was incorporated into proteins that perfectly matched the observed sizes of Plugin, strongly indicating that this protein is the primary substrate for TGase in the MAGs. This incorporation was blocked by the addition of EDTA and GTP, which suggests that the TGase activity in the MAGs is calcium-dependent. These inhibitors also greatly reduced the formation of the higher molecular weight Plugin-immunoreactive bands in the MAG samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000272-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>

<p>AGAP009099 was found mass spectrometrically in both mating plug and MAGs. (A) MDC assay of the MAGs and plug.

<p>The high levels of TGase activity observed in the MAGs prompted a closer investigation of <italic>An. gambiae</italic> TGases. Unusually for insects, which are believed to possess only a single TGase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Chen1">[27]</xref>, <italic>An. gambiae</italic> mosquitoes have three genes (<italic>AGAP009098</italic>, <italic>AGAP009099</italic>, and <italic>AGAP009100</italic>), clustered on chromosomal arm 3R. <italic>AGAP009099</italic> was expressed exclusively in the MAGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000272-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), as confirmed by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000272-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), while the other two genes were ubiquitously transcribed at much lower levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000272-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). These results suggested that <italic>AGAP009099</italic> is principally responsible for the TGase activity detected in the MAGs. Within the MAGs, the AGAP009099 protein was localized in a similar pattern to Plugin, however it was primarily concentrated in the posterior part of the glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000272-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>The role of AGAP009099 in plug formation was then tested in vivo by RNA interference-mediated knockdown.

When injected males were allowed to mate with virgin females, 55 out of 367 females (15.0%) mated to <italic>ds9099</italic>-injected males failed to receive a mating plug, compared to 4 out of 228 (1.8%) females mated to control males. This large and statistically significant difference (contingency test, <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> = 27.55, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001) demonstrates that AGAP009099 is crucial for the formation of the mating plug.</p>

<title>The Mating Plug Ensures Correct Sperm Storage But Is an Inefficient Barrier to Re-Insemination</title>
<p>We next assessed the function of the mating plug in <italic>Anopheles</italic> reproduction. In the large majority of cases where <italic>ds9099</italic>-injected males failed to transfer a mating plug, no sperm was found in the female spermatheca by microscopic analysis (41/55 = 74.5%). The absence of sperm was confirmed by our inability to amplify a Y-chromosome specific sequence by quantitative PCR in these spermathecal samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000272.s002">Table S1</xref>). In these females, sperm were observed in the atria, indicating successful transfer, but were not appropriately stored and therefore would not be available for fertilization. In contrast, when a mating plug was found in the atrium, the spermatheca always contained sperm. Thus, the mating plug is important for sperm storage and for ensuring successful insemination.</p>
<p>Only 2.5% of field-caught female <italic>An. gambiae</italic> store sperm from more than one male in their spermathecae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Tripet1">[1]</xref>. One possible explanation for the low numbers of multiple inseminations is that, prior to the establishment of long-term mating refractoriness, if females mate again within a few hours of the first copulation, the presence of a plug might effectively block sperm from the second male from entering the spermatheca. We directly tested this hypothesis by mating females with wild-type males followed in rapid succession by transgenic males to be able to distinguish alleles from this second mating. Quantitative PCR of relative quantities of the two sperm types showed that 24 of the 38 twice-mated females tested (66%) had sperm from both males in their spermathecae (mean % sperm from 2<sup>nd</sup> male = 38%, range = 7%–56%), demonstrating that the mating plug is an inefficient physical barrier to re-insemination.</p>

<title>A MAG-Specific TGase Is Not Present in Mosquitoes That Do Not Produce Plugs</title>
<p>Anophelines are the only mosquitoes that produce mating plugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Yuval1">[15]</xref>. If TGase activity underlies the ability to produce plugs, we would not expect to find a MAG-specific TGase in species that transfer uncoagulated seminal fluid, such as culicine mosquitoes. To test this hypothesis, we searched for TGase genes in the complete genomes of two culicines, <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>, the only other mosquito species sequenced to date. We identified two culicine TGases retaining partial synteny with the three genes identified in <italic>An. gambiae</italic> and the single one present in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000272-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000272.s003">Table S2</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have identified the molecular composition, mechanism of formation, and function of the mating plug of <italic>An. gambiae</italic>. Our MS analysis identified 15 MAG-expressed proteins that are transferred to females as part of the mating plug. Two of these proteins, the MAG-specific TGase AGAP009099 and its glutamine-rich substrate Plugin, are responsible for the coagulation of the liquid secretions of the MAGs into a solid mass. Some of the other MAG-proteins from the plug, particularly the three small Acp-like proteins AGAP009362, AGAP009370, and AGAP012830, could represent important modulators of female behavioural responses to copulation, such as a reduced receptivity to further mating and induced oviposition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Dottorini1">[9]</xref>. To our knowledge, these are the first proteins transferred to females during mating that have been identified in <italic>Anopheles</italic>. Further studies will clarify the role of these proteins in modulating female reproductive biology and possibly in sperm function. The identification of a number of female proteins, mainly proteases, associated with the mating plug suggests a direct interaction between male and female proteins that may be important for plug processing. Indeed two of the female proteases identified on the plug (AGAP005194 and AGAP005195) were shown previously to be expressed exclusively in the atrium of virgin females and were considerably downregulated at 24 h after mating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Rogers1">[24]</xref>. This transcriptional modulation is entirely compatible with a role of these enzymes in plug digestion, which is mostly completed in the female atrium by 24 h post-mating.</p>
<p>Mating plugs are found in a wide assortment of vertebrate and invertebrate species, and many hypotheses have been advanced to explain their function. However, in the vast majority of taxa, empirical evidence for a specific role of the plug in mating remains elusive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Birkhead1">[14]</xref>. Perhaps the most common presumption is that plugs act as barriers to re-insemination. The high levels of monogamy observed in wild mosquito populations are thought to be enforced, at least over the short term, by the presence of a mating plug <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Yuval1">[15]</xref>. We have shown that the plug provides little defence against the storage of sperm from subsequent males. This is consistent with the observed mating behaviour of <italic>An. gambiae</italic>. In this generally monoandrous species, virgin females enter a swarm of males, mate, and leave the swarm while still in copula <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Charlwood1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Charlwood2">[29]</xref>. It is unlikely that a female would re-enter the swarm (and indeed double plugs are almost never observed in the field <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Giglioli1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Charlwood3">[30]</xref>), and therefore there would be very little selective pressure for a plug that acts as a physical block.</p>
<p>Instead, we have demonstrated that the plug plays an important role in the reproductive biology of <italic>An. gambiae</italic>. By manipulating the expression of the MAG-specific TGase, we have prevented plug formation and transfer, resulting in the incomplete storage of sperm by the female. The presence of a plug in the early post-copulatory hours may be needed to facilitate sperm retention in the sperm storage organ until motility is acquired. Indeed the sperm of <italic>An. gambiae</italic> are deposited in a immotile state directly into the spermatheca, immediately followed by plug transfer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Giglioli1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Spielman1">[31]</xref>, and become motile only &gt;17 h after copulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Verhoek1">[32]</xref>. In support of this hypothesis, we observed sperm in the atria of females that did not receive a plug, strongly suggesting that they had been transferred but had leaked out of the spermatheca. Interestingly, a role for the mating plug in sperm storage was dismissed by some earlier researchers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Giglioli1">[12]</xref>. Using the forced copulation technique for mating, females could be inseminated even when they did not receive a plug <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Giglioli2">[33]</xref>. However, the forced copulation required the female to be anaesthetized during mating. One possible explanation for these earlier results is that female activity is required for sperm loss. Sperm backflow from the spermatheca into the atrium occurring in plug-less matings may be a passive consequence of female movement, or—more intriguingly—females may use the mating plug as a male “quality check,” actively ejecting sperm from males that fail to transfer it. As the spermathecae of a small number of females that did not receive a plug contained observable sperm, future investigations of the relative numbers of sperm stored by these females could shed light on this issue. An alternative or additional explanation for the observed lack of sperm in the storage organs of females mated with plug-less males is that the formation of a complete mating plug in the male reproductive tract may be important for the correct delivery of sperm to the female. Although sperm are directly deposited in the spermatheca prior to plug transfer, it cannot be ruled out at this stage that coagulation of seminal fluids within the MAGs may play a role in the successful completion of the transfer process.</p>
<p>The expansion of the TGase family in mosquitoes, and the acquisition of a function in seminal coagulation, underlies the ability of <italic>An. gambiae</italic> to form mating plugs. The presence of multiple TGases has not been previously reported in insects, but is common in vertebrates, and nine have been characterized in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Chen1">[27]</xref>. These proteins fulfil numerous functions including seminal coagulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Peter1">[34]</xref>, which is achieved by the cross-linking of glutamine-rich substrates such as semenogelins and seminal vesicle secretory proteins by the prostate-specific TGase TGM4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Peter1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Ramm1">[36]</xref>. Thus, mosquitoes and mammals have independently evolved highly similar systems of semen coagulation. The convergent evolution of similar systems for plug formation in mosquitoes and in mammals is made all the more remarkable by the fact that other organisms have developed very different TGase-independent mechanisms to achieve similar results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Baer2">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000272-Palopoli1">[39]</xref>. TGase-mediated cross-linking of plug proteins seems to be finely controlled as the plug-forming TGase and its major substrate (i.e., Plugin) are expressed in two different compartments of the MAGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000272-g002">Figure 2C, 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000272-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). These two proteins may be brought together in the aedegus during copulation by contraction of the muscle cells surrounding the MAGs, and a concomitant release of calcium from intracellular stores could cause the activation of the secreted TGase.</p>
<p>Our findings reveal a crucial role of the mating plug in mosquito reproductive biology and identify this important structure as a potential target for the manipulation of mosquito fertility. This discovery was only possible because we first identified the molecular composition and mechanism of formation of the plug. Understanding the basic genetics underlying mating biology is an essential starting point for developing new tools that target mosquito reproduction and may influence the design of novel vector control strategies currently under development. The proteins identified in this study will not only provide a powerful basis for understanding other processes that regulate mosquito fertility, but will also allow comparative studies of reproduction in other organisms. Indeed, given the remarkable similarity between mechanisms of seminal coagulation in mosquitoes and mammals, our results can inform studies of mammalian, including human, reproduction.</p>

For <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and <italic>C. quinquefasciatus</italic>, we used a single set of primers against <italic>RpS7</italic> (AAEL009496 and CPIJ006763, respectively), which perfectly matched the sequences in both species. Primers against the Y-chromosome of <italic>An. gambiae</italic> and the <italic>dsRed</italic>-containing transgenic cassette were used to quantify relative sperm numbers by standard quantitative PCR in the remating experiment.</p>

<p><bold>Genomic locations of Plugin and TGase gene predictions.</bold> VectorBase IDs that refer to incomplete or otherwise incorrect gene predictions are indicated by an asterisk. The genomic positions of our corrected predictions are indicated by the chromosome arm (CA, orientation in parentheses) or the super contig (SC) number, as well as the specific location. Only Plugin and AGAP009099 were fully sequenced. The reported locations of other genes refer only to <italic>ab initio</italic> predictions. <italic>Ab initio</italic> predictions for mosquito TGase genes were determined using BLAST searches using known TGases from other species and scanning the resulting genomic regions with <italic>ab initio</italic> gene prediction software (Fgenesh, Genescan, and Augustus). Each consensus sequence was analyzed for conserved domains using PFAM 22.0 and SMART 5.1 to ensure it contained the three canonical TGase domains.</p>

<p><bold>Summary of MS/MS results.</bold> Proteins identified by MS/MS analysis of mating plugs (plug), male accessory glands (MAGs), and virgin female atria (atrium) are listed on separate spreadsheets. Protein identifiers are the same as those listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000272-g001">Figure 1</xref>, and the locations refer to the chromosomal arm followed by the exact position of the predicted proteins on the AgamP3 genome assembly. The total number of residues in each protein prediction (the signal peptide has been removed where appropriate) is described in the column “protein size” followed by the number of residues identified in the MS/MS analysis (“identified”). These values were used to calculate the percentage coverage. “Total hits” refers to the complete number of peptide matches to each protein, including redundant matches found in multiple gel bands or in more than one replicate sample. “N-R hits” refers to the number of non-redundant peptide matches across all gel bands and replicates. The expected mass of each predicted protein (signal peptides removed where appropriate) was calculated using Protein Calculator (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.scripps.edu/~cdputnam/protcalc.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.scripps.edu/~cdputnam/protcalc.html</ext-link>). The observed mass refers to the approximate distance migrated by the gel band in which the peptides were identified. When peptides matching a single protein were identified in multiple bands, approximate sizes are separated by semi-colons. For peptides found in many bands, only the range is provided. Mascot protein assignments were based on nano-LC MS/MS data with ion scores&gt;60 (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) together with multiple matches and total protein scores, with outliers accepted subject to visual inspection and sequence verification. Inclusion of assignments in the table was then further subject to confirmation by RT-PCR.</p>
