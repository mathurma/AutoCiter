      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) mediate fast signaling at most central synapses in the<italic>Drosophila</italic> central nervous system. The<italic>Drosophila</italic> genome contains ten nAChRs, of which three (Dα5, Dα6, and Dα7) are more homologous to vertebrate α7 receptors than to other insect nicotinic receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b001">1</xref>]. These receptors have unique properties that set them apart from other nicotinic subunits: They can form homomeric channels consisting of only the α subunit, have high permeability to calcium, and desensitize rapidly in the continued presence of agonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b004">4</xref>]. Despite the prevalence of acetylcholine in the<italic>Drosophila</italic> central nervous system, to our knowledge so far no studies have analyzed the function of these receptors in vivo. Here we have investigated the role of the Dα7 receptor in behaviorally relevant circuits.</p>
      <p>In many invertebrates and vertebrates, intense selection pressure has led to dedicated reflex circuits that continuously monitor the environment for danger and trigger escape behaviors when presented with a specific set of stimuli. These circuits must be able to detect potentially threatening stimuli and respond within a minimal time frame to prevent capture. In dipteran insects the giant fiber system serves this function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b005">5</xref>]. The rapid approach of a predator produces an expanding shadow at the retina. Although in wild-type flies stereotypical visual stimuli may be necessary to cause spiking in the giant fiber, rapid dimming of ambient light is sufficient to activate this interneuron in white-eyed mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b008">8</xref>]. One explanation, suggested by Wyman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b005">5</xref>], is that because of the screening pigments in the eyes of wild-type flies, only a small number of ommatidia are activated by the light-off stimulus, while in white-eyed mutants the same stimulus can activate a much larger number of ommatidia, hence increasing the stimulus input to the giant fiber.</p>
      <p>Two of the cell types that are immediately presynaptic to the giant fiber have been identified anatomically. Visual input arrives via a subtype of the lobula columnar neurons (Lcn neurons in<italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b009">9</xref>]) called the Col A neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b011">11</xref>]. Additionally, mechanosensory afferents from the antennal chordotonal organs found between the first and second antennal segments also make monosynaptic connections onto the giant fiber. The visual and mechanosensory projections make both electrical and chemical synapses with the giant fiber, but the primary excitatory drive to the giant fiber has been proposed to be mediated exclusively by electrical synapses, while chemical synapses are thought to have an inhibitory role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b012">12</xref>]. However, no direct evidence indicates that this is the case, and the transmitter of Col A neurons has not yet been identified. Furthermore, chordotonal organs of the antenna have been shown to be cholinergic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b013">13</xref>].</p>
      <p>The giant fiber integrates sensory input and activates flight motor neurons in a precise temporal order. Based on electrophysiological and anatomical data from the giant fiber circuit, the following model has been proposed for the sequence of muscle activation underlying the escape jump. First, the tergotrochanteral muscle (TTM) is triggered through electrical synapses, causing the mesothoracic leg to extend and initiate the jump. A second consequence of the activation of this muscle is the compression of the thorax, leading to stretch activation of the dorsal lateral muscle (DLM), which in turn stretches and activates the antagonistic dorsal ventral muscles and causes a self-perpetuating oscillation of the thorax that powers the wings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b014">14</xref>]. The timing of DLM activation is delayed relative to TTM activation to precisely control the initiation of flight. The delay in DLM activation is achieved through an interneuron, the peripherally synapsing interneuron (PSI), that is specialized to activate all six DLMs simultaneously via a cholinergic synapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b015">15</xref>].</p>
      <p>The DLMs are stretch-activated muscles that, during normal flight, receive nervous system input only once every 20 cycles to prime them with calcium. The central rhythm for this nervous input is generated by synaptic interactions between the dendrites of the DLM motor neurons (DLMmns) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b017">17</xref>]. However, the rapid start of the flight motor during the escape jump requires synchronized activation of the DLMs, which bypasses the dendritic structure of the DLMmns. Although synchronized DLM activation is an integral part of the escape flight initiation program and is required for flight, it does not directly play a role in jumping. Mutant animals that specifically lose DLMs through degeneration while retaining the TTM are still able to jump, although they are unable to fly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b018">18</xref>].</p>
      <p>Here, using genetic, immunohistochemical, behavioral and electrophysiological techniques we describe the role of the Dα7 nAChR in the giant fiber mediated escape response of flies.</p>

        <title>Cloning of the cDNA and Mutational Analysis of Dα7</title>
        <p>To assess the in vivo role of Dα7 we cloned and created mutations in its gene.<italic>Dα7</italic> is located on the X chromosome at cytological band 18C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b019">19</xref>]. We generated a full-length cDNA by ligation of two partial cDNAs, RE30878 and GH16126, obtained from the BDGP EST collection. A comparison of the cDNA with the genomic sequence showed that the gene consists of 16 exons that span ∼ 20 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). The first two exons are mostly 5′UTR, while the last two exons code for the 3′UTR. Since the protein predicted from our sequence differed from the one recently reported by Lansdell and Millar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b020">20</xref>], we performed RT-PCR from two wild-type strains, Canton-S and Hikone-R, and confirmed our protein sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>A). During sequencing we noticed that the protein predicted by our RT-PCR sequence had a substitution of valine for isoleucine 295 when compared with the protein predicted by the published genomic sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>B). This is a consequence of a basepair difference from A in the genomic sequence to a G in the cDNA, indicating the presence of RNA editing, as reported for other nAChRs from<italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b001">1</xref>]. Sequencing the genomic region from Canton-S flies confirmed this hypothesis.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>To create mutations in<italic>Dα7</italic> we identified three P-element insertions: KG3295 maps 25 bp upstream of the 5′UTR, EY10801 maps to exon 8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b021">21</xref>], and NP515 maps 580 bp downstream of the 3′UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b022">22</xref>]. We generated several additional alleles by carrying out imprecise excisions of each P-element. None of the KG3295 excisions disrupted the open reading frame (ORF), since it is approximately 5 kbp upstream of the translation start site. However, we were able to recover two deletions,<italic>Dα7<sup>PΔ14G</sup></italic> (abbreviated to<italic>PΔ14G</italic>) and<italic>Dα7<sup>PΔD5</sup> (PΔD5),</italic> that result in a small and a large reduction in protein levels (see below), respectively. The location and the breakpoints of the excisions are shown in<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g001">Figure 1</xref>A. Excisions of NP515 also resulted in a hypomorphic allele (as judged by protein levels, see below),<italic>Dα7<sup>PΔ41</sup> (PΔ41),</italic> although it lacks the entire 3′UTR and several amino acids from the C terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Imprecise excision of the EY10801 P-element yielded the allele<italic>Dα7<sup>PΔEY6</sup> (PΔEY6),</italic> which showed loss of almost the entire ligand-binding domain, the transmembrane domain M1, and part of the pore-lining helix M2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). This deletion also removed a splice site in M2 and hence has a larger lesion than predicted by analysis of the breakpoints. In the remainder of the paper, the precise excision of KG3295,<italic>Dα7<sup>PΔL1</sup> (PΔL1),</italic> which completely removed the P-element and reverted the insertion site to wild-type sequence, is used as a control for mutants from the KG3295 and NP515 excisions, while the precise excision of EY10801,<italic>Dα7<sup>PΔEY5</sup> (PΔEY5),</italic> is used as a control for<italic>PΔEY6</italic>.</p>
        <p>Using an antibody that we generated against the variable cytoplasmic loop between M3 and M4, we tested for presence of protein in our mutant alleles with immunohistochemistry. The three alleles<italic>PΔ14G, PΔ41,</italic> and<italic>PΔD5</italic> retained signal, with<italic>PΔ14G</italic> showing the strongest staining followed by somewhat weaker staining in<italic>PΔ41,</italic> and still weaker staining in<italic>PΔD5</italic> (unpublished data)<italic>.</italic> As shown for the medulla, a synapse-rich region in the optic lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), in<italic>PΔEY6</italic> the staining was reduced to background levels almost everywhere. This antibody recognizes numerous synapses in specific regions throughout the brain and in the ventral ganglion in wild-type animals, most notably in the vicinity of the giant fiber dendrites, where the staining is 10–100 times stronger than anywhere else (see below). However, some synapses in the lamina also stained positively in mutants. These data suggest that the antibody recognizes an epitope on Dα7, that Dα7 is widely expressed (see<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>), and that the antibody also recognizes another epitope whose expression is restricted to the lamina (see<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd001">Protocol S1</xref> for antibody expression pattern and discussion of its specificity). Additionally, to identify the cells that express Dα7 protein, we generated an enhancer trap GAL4 line by replacing the KG3295 P-element with a GAL4 P-element using P-element conversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b023">23</xref>]. The staining pattern of this enhancer trap matched the immunostaining observed with the Dα7 antibody (see<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

        <title><italic>Dα7</italic> Mutants Are Defective in a Visually Mediated Escape Behavior</title>
        <p>Flies mutant for Dα7 are viable and not readily distinguishable from wild-type flies by cursory observation. To establish whether there are behavioral deficits in flies carrying Dα7 mutations, we tested mutant flies in assays that allowed us to assess the function of brain regions in which Dα7 is expressed (see<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd001">Protocol S1</xref>).</p>

In this assay, single flies are released from an Eppendorf tube into a 30-cm high cylinder. Good fliers fly horizontally toward the walls of the cylinder and land close to the level at which they were dropped. The lower the fly lands, the worse it is considered at flying.

          <p>The Dα7 receptor is expressed in various elements of the olfactory neuropil, including the antennal lobes and the mushroom bodies. In order to test if loss of the Dα7 receptor resulted in a deficit in olfactory sensitivity, we tested the mutant alleles in the olfactory trap assay that scores the ability of flies to find a source of odor, in this case fly food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b026">26</xref>].

          <p>Like many animals, flies have startle reactions that are activated when they sense danger. One well-studied reflex is the giant fiber-mediated response to a sudden change in light levels. We tested the mutant flies in this paradigm to evaluate both visual performance and sensory-motor integration. As shown in<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g002">Figure 2</xref>C, while the two control lines<italic>PΔL1</italic> and<italic>PΔEY5</italic> showed a robust response to a 20-ms pulse of darkness, all of the mutant flies failed to respond (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001).</p>

          <title>Visual tests</title>
          <p>Since Dα7 is expressed in the optic neuropil, it is possible that the mutant flies are blind and unable to sense light. We, therefore, performed two separate assays of visual system performance by (1) direct electrophysiological assessment of processing at the first visual neuropil, the lamina, with electroretinogram (ERG) recordings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b027">27</xref>]; and (2) a different vision-dependent behavior, the phototaxis assay.</p>
          <p>The ERG response to a pulse of light consists of three components: the depolarization that corresponds to the response of the photoreceptor to light, the on-transient that is a postsynaptic response of the lamina monopolar cells to photoreceptor depolarization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b027">27</xref>], and the off-transient, which is not well understood but may have a cholinergic component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b028">28</xref>]. As shown in<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g002">Figure 2</xref>D, all of the mutants responded to light with a depolarization and on- and off-transients.</p>
          <p>Since Dα7 is expressed in the optic neuropil, it is possible that the mutant flies are unable either to sense light or to transmit this signal to the locomotor areas. Visual performance was tested in the countercurrent phototaxis assay of Benzer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b029">29</xref>] as described by Connolly and Tully [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b030">30</xref>]. In this assay flies are tested in seven different trials and are sorted into eight classes according to the number of trials in which they walk toward the light source. From these data, a phototaxis index is calculated using a weighted average of the responses in each class. Although two alleles,<italic>PΔ41</italic> and<italic>PΔD5,</italic> showed differences compared to wild-type flies, all mutant alleles moved toward light, indicating that no substantial problem in light sensation can be linked to deletions in<italic>Dα7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). Taken together, the results from the phototaxis and ERG assays indicate that flies with mutant alleles do not have a generalized defect in basic visual performance.</p>

        <title><italic>Dα7</italic> Mutants Have a Defect in the Jump Circuit</title>
        <p>Since the<italic>Dα7</italic> mutant flies had a behavioral defect in the visually mediated jump response but responded normally to light in other visual assays, we tested whether there was a defect in the giant fiber circuit itself. The giant fiber circuit mediates escape behavior in<italic>Drosophila</italic> and is named for the largest interneuron in the fly brain, the giant fiber, which connects the visual neuropil to the flight circuit in the thoracic ganglion (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b005">5</xref>]). As shown in<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, the giant fiber terminates in two branches. One branch makes an electrical connection with the motor neuron of the TTM, or jump muscle, while the other branch makes an electrical connection with an interneuron called the PSI. The PSI in turn makes a chemical synapse with the five motor neurons supplying the six DLMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). By electrical stimulation through electrodes in the eyes, it is possible to activate the giant fiber directly and assess the synapses that connect the giant fiber to the flight motor neurons by using activation of the flight muscles as a readout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b031">31</xref>].</p>

The DLMs of wild-type and control flies were able to follow stimulation of the giant fiber at frequencies of up to 100 Hz.<italic>PΔ14G</italic> responded robustly to giant fiber stimulation at frequencies of 1 and 10 Hz, but started to fail when stimulated at 100 Hz.<italic>PΔ41</italic> followed reasonably well at 1 Hz, although it had an abnormally long latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g003">Figure 3</xref>C top panel). At 10 Hz this mutant started to fail, and it had little response at 100 Hz.<italic>PΔD5</italic> showed little response in the DLMs even at a stimulation frequency of 1 Hz, while the null mutant<italic>PΔEY6</italic> did not respond at all at this frequency in most animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). The defects are specific to the synapses between the PSI and the DLMmn (encircled in<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g003">Figure 3</xref>A), since the TTMs were able to follow the giant fiber stimulation at 100 Hz without any problem in the most severe mutation,<italic>PΔEY6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). Furthermore, there is no defect at the DLM neuromuscular junction, because direct stimulation of the DLMmn through electrodes in the thorax drove the DLM without failure at 100 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). When we reintroduced the wild-type<italic>Dα7</italic> transgene into the mutant<italic>PΔD5</italic> or<italic>PΔEY6</italic> background by using OK307-GAL4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b032">32</xref>], a driver with expression in several elements of the giant fiber circuit (including the giant fiber, DLMmn, TTMmn and PSI), we were able to fully rescue the activation of the DLM by giant fiber stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g003">3</xref>C). This experiment confirms that the observed defect is due to lesions in the<italic>Dα7</italic> gene.

Since homozygous, weak partial loss of function alleles also showed failures at 100 Hz (<italic>PΔ14G,</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g003">Figure 3</xref>A), the DLM phenotype seems to be very sensitive to gene dosage of Dα7.

Since<italic>PΔEY6</italic> is a null allele, while<italic>PΔD5</italic> has residual levels of protein, these data suggest that one wild-type copy of<italic>Dα7</italic> is not sufficient for normal function at this synapse when it is heavily challenged.</p>

        <p>To identify the mutation in<italic>gfA<sup>1</sup>,</italic> we performed RT-PCR and sequenced the mutant gene. We found two nucleotide changes.

This amino acid maps to loop 2 of the ligand-binding domain and is implicated in gating by providing a bridge between the ligand-binding domain and the pore-lining transmembrane helix M2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b034">34</xref>].<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g004">Figure 4</xref>F shows the location of the analogous amino acid (drawn in red as a van der Waals atomic representation to emphasize the location of the residue) on the structure of the nAChR from the electroplax of<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Torpedo marmorata</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b035">35</xref>].

One possible explanation is that, due to changes in the nAChR properties, the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) generated at the PSI-DLMmn synapse in<italic>gfA<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant animals is faster and decays so rapidly that it is not able to trigger an action potential, similar to the effect of nAChR mutations in fast channel myasthenic syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b036">36</xref>]. An alternative possibility is that the amplitude of the EPSP is reduced in<italic>gfA1</italic> mutants so that it is insufficient to drive the cell to threshold. In order to directly test this possibility, we developed a novel preparation for performing whole-cell patch clamp recordings from one of the DLM motor neurons, MN5, that supplies two muscles, DLMa and b. MN5 is located on the dorsal surface of the thoracic ganglion and is prominently labeled with CD8-GFP under the control of Dα7-GAL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g005">Figure 5</xref>A).</p>

        <p>The basic methodology for recording from these neurons is depicted in<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g005">Figure 5</xref>B. In spite of their large size and characteristic location, MN5 neurons are not readily detectable under Nomarski optics. Therefore, we backfilled these neurons by injecting Texas red dextran into the thorax in the vicinity of the DLMa/b muscles and waiting 18–22 h to allow transport of the dye into the motor neuron. To access these neurons for recording, we removed the indirect flight muscles and the gut to expose the thoracic ganglion. As shown in<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g005">Figure 5</xref>C, following the backfill procedure, the cell body of the motor neuron was clearly visible, as were the primary neurite and some of the dendritic structure. By locally applying protease, we were able to gain access to the cell body for whole cell patch recording without damaging the giant fiber, which was activated through insulated tungsten stimulating electrodes placed in the eyes. Protease treatment can affect electrophysiological measurements by cleaving molecules such as certain ion channels. While we cannot rule out these effects in our experiments, neurons in the DLM branch of the giant fiber circuit appeared healthy, as judged by the input resistance of MN5 as well as its ability to generate action potentials in response to current injection and EPSPs in response to giant fiber stimulation.</p>
        <p>We recorded potentials from these cells using whole-cell patch clamp. Since no differences in basic passive properties of the cells were found between Canton-S controls and mutant flies, the average of the combined datasets is reported. In keeping with the large size of these cells, the capacitance of these cells was 43 ± 2 pF (<italic>n</italic> = 22), and their average input resistance was 102 ± 12 MΩ (<italic>n</italic> = 22). Unlike other insect neurons, current injection into MN5 cell bodies can generate large action potentials of 50 to 60 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). In a few preparations we observed spontaneous rhythmic activity at ∼ 1 Hz consisting of plateau potentials with large spikes, suggesting that these cells receive patterned input close to the cell body and are able to generate action potentials close to this site (unpublished data).</p>
        <p>Since the primary role of the giant fiber circuit is to initiate escape behavior, the PSI bypasses the entire dendritic structure of MN5 and makes multiple synaptic contacts that span 50 μm and follow the axons out into the posterior dorsal motor nerve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b038">38</xref>]. This specialization minimizes the delay to DLM activation by generating a suprathreshold EPSP distally in the axon, which leads to a spike that travels rapidly to the DLM. In wild-type animals, when we activated the giant fiber at 1 Hz, the action potential generated at the distal PSI-DLMmn synapse on the axon appeared small and broad in somatic recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g005">Figure 5</xref>E). This differed considerably from the narrow, large action potential evoked in the soma by current injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g005">Figure 5</xref>D), suggesting that the peripherally generated action potential fails to propagate antidromically into the dendrite and therefore is filtered by the passive membrane properties of the dendritic and/or axonal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g005">Figure 5</xref>E, top). As we increased the frequency of eye stimulation, the action potential failed to fire, revealing an underlying EPSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g005">Figure 5</xref>E middle). The EPSPs are shown at a higher magnification in the bottom panel of<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g005">Figure 5</xref>E to emphasize their amplitude and shape.</p>
        <p>In order to measure the amplitude of the EPSP, we used three different strategies that all gave approximately the same values when compared in the same preparation. The first was to directly measure the amplitude of the EPSP at high frequencies when the spike fails. The second was to measure the amplitude to the inflection point where the spike takes off from the EPSP in cases where it is clearly visible. The third was to trigger an action potential by current injection in the MN5 soma just before giant fiber activation to force an absolute refractory period at the PSI-DLMmn synapse, causing the spike to fail thereby revealing the EPSP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b039">39</xref>]. The mean amplitude of the synaptic potential underlying the spike measured at the soma using these three methods was 4.71 ± 0.35 mV (<italic>n</italic> = 10) in wild-type animals.</p>
        <p>In<italic>gfA1<sup>1</sup></italic> animals, we observed considerable failures even at 1 Hz, similar to what we observed in muscle recordings from the intact animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g005">Figure 5</xref>E). The spikes showed a considerable amount of jitter and began at different points of the EPSP. The underlying EPSP is significantly smaller than the EPSP generated in wild-type animals (<italic>p</italic> = 0.00001, Student's t-test), with a mean amplitude of 1.5 ± 0.32 mV (<italic>n</italic> = 7). However, while smaller, the EPSP in<italic>gfA1</italic> animals followed without failure and did not show significant changes in shape or jitter. This suggests that the inability of the DLMmn to follow and the increase in jitter in<italic>gfA1</italic> mutants is most likely due to reduced synaptic drive at the PSI-DLM synapse. This observation also rules out the possibility that a slow, alternative pathway is being activated in<italic>gfA1</italic> mutants during electrical stimulation through the eyes.</p>

        <title>Dα7 Is Present in the Dendrites of the Giant Fiber</title>
        <p>The electrophysiological results presented so far show a defect downstream of the giant fiber but do not explain the behavioral data. Indeed, as shown in<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g002">Figure 2</xref>C, all the<italic>Dα7</italic> mutants failed to jump in response to a “lights off” stimulus, yet the branch of the giant fiber neuron synapsing with the jump muscle (i.e., TTM) motor neuron is intact and functional in all the mutants tested. Since the DLM has not been implicated in jumping in<italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b018">18</xref>], we postulated that perhaps there is an additional defect in the giant fiber circuit. This defect should be prior to or at the input of the giant fiber, such that it renders it unresponsive to visual stimuli in mutant animals.</p>
        <p>The dipteran giant fiber receives mechanosensory input via the Johnston's organ in the antenna [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b012">12</xref>] and visual input via the photoreceptors and optic lobes. The mechanosensory neurons connect directly with the posterior lateral dendrite (PLD) of the giant fiber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g006">Figure 6</xref>A–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g006">6</xref>C), while the visual input has to travel through at least four synapses to reach the giant fiber [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b040">40</xref>].

        <title>Dα7 Mediates Synaptic Transmission at the Dendrites of the Giant Fiber</title>
        <p>Since Dα7 is localized to the dendrites of the giant fiber, we wished to test whether loss of Dα7 leads to loss of transmission at these synapses. In order to test this hypothesis we took advantage of the observation that, in contrast to strong stimulation, which directly activates the giant fiber, low-strength electrical stimulation activates the elements presynaptic to the giant fiber, which in turn activate the giant fiber [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b041">41</xref>]. We therefore recorded from the TTM and stimulated the eyes at low strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). As shown in<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g007">Figure 7</xref>B and<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g007">7</xref>C, low-strength stimulation, which activates the presynaptic elements of the giant fiber, results in a significantly longer latency to activation of the TTM (3.5–4.0 ms) compared with high-strength stimulation, which activates the giant fiber directly (∼ 1 ms). These values are comparable to long-latency values reported in the literature, which vary from ∼ 3–4.2 ms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b045">45</xref>]. Since the TTMmn is electrically coupled to the giant fiber, activation of the TTM serves as a readout of giant fiber activity. When we tested the<italic>Dα7</italic> mutant alleles in this paradigm, we discovered that only the weakest allele,<italic>PΔ14G,</italic> showed a long-latency response (upon low-strength stimulation), as well as a short-latency response (upon high-strength stimulation), while all other mutant alleles responded only with short latency (see Discussion for<italic>PΔ14G</italic>). These data suggest that there is a defect in synaptic transmission somewhere in the pathway either upstream of the giant fiber or at the input of the giant fiber itself. In order to distinguish between these possibilities, we carried out a rescue experiment using a giant fiber-specific driver, c17-GAL4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b046">46</xref>]. Reintroducing a wild-type copy of<italic>Dα7</italic> into the giant fiber using this driver completely rescued the long-latency response, indicating that the lack of Dα7 in the giant fiber itself is responsible for the mutant phenotype. Furthermore, since absence of Dα7 prevents activation of the giant fiber, these experiments provide strong evidence that the defect in jump behavior is due to the loss of Dα7 in the giant fiber neuron.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Using anatomical, behavioral and physiological techniques to analyze mutant alleles of a nAChR, Dα7, we show that this receptor is essential for the giant fiber-mediated escape response in<italic>Drosophila</italic>. Flies with mutations in<italic>Dα7</italic> do not jump in response to a “lights off” stimulus. Using electrophysiological and anatomical evidence, we show that the visual and mechanosensory inputs on the dendrites of the giant fiber are cholinergic, and that loss of Dα7 in the giant fiber is responsible for the behavioral deficit in the visually mediated escape response. Furthermore, the cholinergic synapse between the PSI and DLMmn is defective in<italic>Dα7</italic> mutants. Finally, we find that<italic>gfA<sup>1</sup>,</italic> a previously molecularly uncharacterized mutant isolated in a behavioral screen for giant fiber defects, is a missense mutant of<italic>Dα7</italic> that shows diminished EPSPs at the PSI-DLMmn synapse.</p>
      <p>The<italic>gfA1</italic> mutant phenotype is caused by the amino acid substitution K46E in loop 2 of the ligand binding domain of Dα7. Interestingly, although mutations in loop 2 of the ligand binding domain of nAChRs have been the focus of a number of structure-function studies in recent years (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b034">34</xref>]), this is the first mutant in this domain that has been linked to a genetic phenotype. This region has been implicated in coupling ligand binding to gating in a number of cys-loop receptors that include nAChRs, GABA receptors, and glycine receptors. Charge reversal mutations in K46 of bovine α7 nAChRs, the homolog of Dα7K46, show diminished responses to acetylcholine and can act in a dominant-negative fashion when coexpressed with wild-type receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b047">47</xref>], similar to what we observed for the<italic>gfA1</italic> mutation. Our data show that the charge of Dα7K46 is critical to the functioning of this receptor and hence synapses mediated by Dα7 containing nAChRs.</p>
      <p>The giant fiber circuit has been a model for central circuits in<italic>Drosophila</italic> and has been studied in some detail using elegant experiments that revealed significant details about the circuit in the intact fly. The giant fiber output in the thorax activates at least three pathways: the TTM motor neuron via electrical synapses, the DLM motor neuron via an interneuron (PSI) that is itself electrically coupled to the giant fiber, and the tibial levator muscle motor neuron through a novel pathway that is not well characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b042">42</xref>]. We show that the PSI-DLMmn synapse, which was previously suggested to be cholinergic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b015">15</xref>], is mediated by the Dα7 nAChR. Wyman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b005">5</xref>] showed that the<italic>gfA1</italic> mutation affects this synapse. However,<italic>gfA1</italic> was identified in a screen for behavioral defects in the giant fiber-mediated jump response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b031">31</xref>]. Since it is known that flies can jump even in the absence of the DLMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b018">18</xref>], the behavioral defect of<italic>gfA1</italic> cannot be explained by the physiological defect at the PSI-DLMmn synapse.</p>
      <p>Since the TTM pathway downstream of the giant fiber is not affected by the<italic>Dα7</italic> mutations, a more likely explanation is that the giant fiber is not activated by visual input in<italic>Dα7</italic> mutant animals. We show that this is indeed the case. In most deletion mutations of<italic>Dα7,</italic> the giant fiber did not respond to electrical stimulation of its presynaptic components, and this phenotype could be rescued by overexpressing a transgene coding for<italic>Dα7</italic> specifically in the giant fiber. These data indicate that the behavioral defect in the visually mediated jump in most deletion mutants of<italic>Dα7</italic> can be explained by a failure of activation of the giant fiber. The sole exception is the weak hypomorphic mutation<italic>PΔ14G;</italic> the affected animals respond to electrical stimulation of the elements presynaptic to the giant fiber, and yet fail to jump in response to a “lights off” stimulus. One possible explanation is that electrical stimulation through the eyes may activate both the mechanosensory and visual inputs to the giant fiber, while the behavioral assay relies on a strictly visual input. Therefore, activation by presynaptic electrical stimulation of the giant fiber in<italic>PΔ14G</italic> mutants may reflect the simultaneous activation of neurons presynaptic to the giant fiber that does not occur during normal visual system function.</p>
      <p>Our rescue of the long-latency component by expression of a<italic>Dα7</italic> transgene in the giant fiber shows that the chemical synapses onto the giant fiber are cholinergic, and this component provides a significant proportion of the synaptic drive. The sensory projections to the giant fiber in three different dipteran species,<italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b012">12</xref>],<italic>Musca</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b012">12</xref>], and<italic>Calliphora</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b012">12</xref>], make mixed chemical and electrical synapses onto specific dendrites of the giant fiber: The mechanosensory projection synapses onto the PLD, while the lobula projection synapses onto the VLD. Strausfeld and Bassemir [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b012">12</xref>] hypothesized that the electrical synapses from the Col A and mechanosensory projections provide the excitatory drive to the giant fiber, while the chemical component is inhibitory. Our data clearly show that chemical synapses mediating visual and mechanosensory inputs onto the giant fiber are excitatory in nature and play an essential role in the giant fiber-mediated jump response.</p>
      <p>It is probable that additional behavioral defects are present in these mutants that were missed because we performed only a limited number of assays. It is nevertheless surprising, given the widespread expression of this receptor, that the mutant animals did not show many obvious defects and were relatively healthy. One possible explanation is that the large number of nicotinic subunits can functionally compensate for each other. Although all ten nAChRs from<italic>Drosophila</italic> have been cloned, a detailed description of localization exists for only two of these proteins, ALS and ARD, which colocalize in most regions of the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b048">48</xref>]. Although these two receptors are localized to many of the same regions as the Dα7 protein, analysis of specific neuropils showed some differences in expression patterns. Furthermore, although a number of screens have been carried out in<italic>Drosophila</italic> to find genes implicated in behavior, the only nicotinic receptor that has so far been isolated to our knowledge is<italic>gfA</italic>. Given that ACh is considered the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system of insects, there may be much functional redundancy among the receptors, and only in the few instances when a synapse relies mostly or entirely on a particular nicotinic receptor, such as the visual and mechanosensory inputs on the dendrites of the giant fiber or the PSI-DLM synapse, is it possible to see a phenotype. Functional redundancy has also been observed in nAChR mutants in vertebrates, where some phenotypes are observed only when multiple nicotinic receptors are deleted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b050">50</xref>]. It is remarkable that redundancy does not extend to the circuit underlying one of the most important behaviors for the day-to-day survival of the fly, the giant fiber-mediated escape circuit. This fact suggests that particular properties of Dα7 may be selected for during evolution to endow certain qualities to the circuit. Further characterization of the biophysical properties of Dα7 both in vivo and in vitro should shed some light on how specializations at the synaptic level are implemented in the choice of neurotransmitter receptor.</p>

        <title>Cloning of Dα7</title>
        <p>In order to obtain the full-length cDNA for Dα7, we scanned the BDGP EST database and found four clones that mapped 5′ of the predicted gene for Dα7. We sequenced the largest of these clones, RE30878, and found that it had a small deletion that resulted in an early stop codon and a truncated protein. A second EST, GH16126, did not have this deletion but was truncated further 3′. Making use of a common unique Kpn1 site, we were able to construct a full-length cDNA. The largest ORF predicted from the cDNA has a length of 1,683 bp. However, identifying the Kozak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b051">51</xref>] sequence and signal peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b052">52</xref>], we predict that the translated ORF is 1,563 bp in length, with 5′ and 3′UTRs of 1,205 and 1,056 bp, respectively. This ORF encodes a protein of 502 amino acids (excluding the putative signal peptide of 18 amino acids) with a predicted molecular weight of 57 kDa.</p>
        <p>For reverse transcriptase PCR, total RNA was extracted from 30 flies using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, United States). The reverse transcriptase reaction was carried out using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Stratagene, La Jolla, California, United States) primed with poly-dT primers. The ORF was amplified using<italic>Pfu</italic> polymerase and cloned into Blunt-TOPO PCR vectors and sequenced. To establish the mutation in<italic>gfA<sup>1</sup>,</italic> we directly sequenced the PCR product.</p>

        <p>Upon screening an initial 250 excision lines generated from KG3295, we discovered a second site insertion on the X chromosome in the furrowed gene<italic>(fw)</italic>.

        <title>Behavioral assays</title>
        <p>We tested control and mutant flies in the behavioral assays described below. For all tests the flies were between 2 and 7 d old. Statistical significance was tested with one-way ANOVA using<italic>PΔL1</italic> or<italic>PΔEY5</italic> as controls.</p>
        <p>The flight assay was performed according to the method of Drummond et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b024">24</xref>] as modified by Nelson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b025">25</xref>] Briefly, we aspirated single flies into an Eppendorf tube that had its tip sliced off to leave an opening of approximately 3 mm. The fly was then tapped from the tube through a hole in the lid of a cylinder with inner diameter of 70 mm and length 300 mm. which was divided into 12 zones of 25 mm each. The zone in which the fly landed was noted for each fly and used to estimate the landing height. At least ten separate flies were used for each genotype, and the results were averaged. In a few cases flies failed to fly at all and were not used as part of the analysis, since they may have been damaged during handling.</p>
        <p>The olfactory trap assay of Woodard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b026">26</xref>] was used to test for olfactory defects. Approximately ten cold-anesthetized flies were placed in a Petri dish containing 1% agarose along with a trap containing fly food as described. The number of flies in the trap were counted and expressed as a percentage of the total number of flies per Petri dish. At least eight trials were conducted for each genotype.</p>
        <p>Since the visually mediated jump assay works only with white-eyed flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b005">5</xref>], and<italic>PΔEY5</italic> and<italic>PΔEY6</italic> lines are in a<italic>w</italic><sup>+</sup> background, we generated white-eyed<italic>PΔEY5; bw; st</italic> and<italic>PΔEY6; bw; st</italic> flies by crossing and backcrossing males to<italic>C(1) DX; bw; st</italic> flies. Flies were individually aspirated into a 60 × 15 mm Petri dish covered on the bottom and sides with vellum. This Petri dish was placed inside a 100 × 15 mm Petri dish illuminated by four green light-emitting diodes (LEDs; peak wavelength 572 nm) placed at 90° to each other. A “lights off” stimulus was provided by turning off the LEDs for 20 ms using a simple custom device driven by a TTL signal from a pulse generator.</p>
        <p>Flies were tested for phototaxis in the countercurrent apparatus of Benzer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b029">29</xref>] as described by Connolly and Tully [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b030">30</xref>]. Groups of 20 flies were given a choice between a vial facing a light source provided by a fluorescent lamp and a vial facing away from the light source. Each fly was given the choice eight times and separated into seven groups according to the number of times they moved toward the light source. A phototaxis index was calculated using the equation (1/<italic>N</italic>) Σ<italic><sub>i</sub></italic><italic>i</italic> •<italic>n<sub>i</sub></italic> where<italic>i</italic> is the fraction number,<italic>n<sub>i</sub></italic> is the number of flies in that fraction, and<italic>N</italic> is the total number of flies tested.</p>

        <title>In vivo electrophysiological assays</title>
        <p>For all assays, flies were anesthetized with either exposure to CO<sub>2</sub> or cooling on ice for 5 min, and glued to a glass slide using Elmer's school glue gel.</p>
        <p>Electroretinograms were recorded between a microelectrode inserted just below the surface of the eye and a reference electrode in the thorax with an Axopatch 200B amplifier. The light stimulus was provided by a bright white LED driven directly by a 1-s TTL pulse from the digital out port of a Digidata 1322 interface (Axon Instruments, Union City, California, United States) controlled by Axograph 4.9 software. A 150-Ω resistor was placed in series with the LED to limit the maximum current.</p>
        <p>To assay the giant fiber system, intracellular recordings were made from DLM 45a using the stereotaxic map of Levine and Hughes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b054">54</xref>] using glass microelectrodes filled with 3 M potassium acetate and 0.1 M KCl with an Axopatch 200B amplifier. The giant fiber was electrically stimulated through tungsten electrodes placed in the eyes. In most control flies, the threshold of evoking a high-threshold response was ∼10–15 V with a 100-μsec pulse. Since very large stimuli could activate the DLM motor neurons directly (as judged by very short latency responses), in most cases we kept the stimulus amplitude constant at 30 V.</p>
        <p>To evaluate the long-latency response of TTMs, recordings were made using etched tungsten electrodes with an A-M Systems 1800 extracellular amplifier (A-M Systems, Carlsborg, Washington, United States). 10-μs voltage pulses were applied across tungsten electrodes inserted just under the cuticle of the eyes. The voltage was increased in 0.5-V increments every 10 s to minimize habituation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b043">43</xref>]. Even with these precautions, in a few cases we were not able to record the long-latency response in wild-type animals.

        <title>Motor neuron electrophysiology</title>
        <p>Control and mutant animals were anesthetized with CO<sub>2</sub> and the DLM muscles injected with 3,000 MW Texas red dextran solution (5% w/v in water) to backfill the DLM motor neuron. The flies were then allowed to recover for 15–20 h before further experiments.</p>
        <p>After clipping off the wings and legs, cold-anesthetized flies were attached ventrally to a glass coverslip using low melting point wax (Paraplast). The thorax was opened dorsally using a 30-gauge hypodermic needle, and the indirect flight muscles and gut were removed to reveal the thoracic ganglion. The body walls were then cut away to allow access for the recording electrode.</p>
        <p>The MN5 motor neurons were visualized, under constant perfusion, with a 40× water immersion objective and unambiguously identified by Texas red fluorescence and morphology. The neurolemma was disrupted around the cell body using 0.5% protease (type XIV, Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri, United States) applied through a micropipette as described by Baines and Bate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b055">55</xref>]. Fire-polished electrodes made from thin-walled borosilicate glass (3–5 MΩ) were used to patch onto the cell body of MN5. Seals of 2–10 GΩ formed readily, and whole-cell access was achieved with light suction or using the zap function of the Axopatch 200B. Whole-cell capacitance was compensated, and access resistance was generally kept below 20 MΩ. Diffusion of carboxyfluorescein from the patch electrode to the cell unambiguously identified the recorded cell by colocalization of red and green fluorescence. A constant current command was delivered in current clamp mode to keep the voltage at −74 mV to reduce the spontaneous activity of the neuron to that observed in cell-attached mode. The giant fiber was stimulated through insulated tungsten electrodes placed in the eyes. In some cases, stimulation was provided via a suction electrode on the neck connective.</p>
        <p>The extracellular solution was composed of (in mM) 120 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 6 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 trehalose, 10 TES, and 15 glucose, and was bubbled continuously with a mixture of 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.
