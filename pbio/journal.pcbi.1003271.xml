<abstract>
<p>Whether unique to humans or not, consciousness is a central aspect of our experience of the world. The neural fingerprint of this experience, however, remains one of the least understood aspects of the human brain. In this paper we employ graph-theoretic measures and support vector machine classification to assess, in 12 healthy volunteers, the dynamic reconfiguration of functional connectivity during wakefulness, propofol-induced sedation and loss of consciousness, and the recovery of wakefulness. Our main findings, based on resting-state fMRI, are three-fold. First, we find that propofol-induced anesthesia does not bear differently on long-range versus short-range connections. Second, our multi-stage design dissociated an initial phase of thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical hyperconnectivity, present during sedation, from a phase of cortico-cortical hypoconnectivity, apparent during loss of consciousness. Finally, we show that while clustering is increased during loss of consciousness, as recently suggested, it also remains significantly elevated during wakefulness recovery. Conversely, the characteristic path length of brain networks (i.e., the average functional distance between any two regions of the brain) appears significantly increased only during loss of consciousness, marking a decrease of global information-processing efficiency uniquely associated with unconsciousness. These findings suggest that propofol-induced loss of consciousness is mainly tied to cortico-cortical and not thalamo-cortical mechanisms, and that decreased efficiency of information flow is the main feature differentiating the conscious from the unconscious brain.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>One of the most elusive aspects of the human brain is the neural fingerprint of the subjective feeling of consciousness. While a growing body of experimental evidence is starting to address this issue, to date we are still hard pressed to answer even basic questions concerning the nature of consciousness in humans as well as other species. In the present study we follow a recent theoretical construct according to which the crucial factor underlying consciousness is the modality with which information is exchanged across different parts of the brain. In particular, we represent the brain as a network of regions exchanging information (as is typically done in a comparatively young branch of mathematics referred to as graph theory), and assess how different levels of consciousness induced by anesthetic agent affect the quality of information exchange across regions of the network. Overall, our findings show that what makes the state of propofol-induced loss of consciousness different from all other conditions (namely, wakefulness, light sedation, and consciousness recovery) is the fact that all regions of the brain appear to be functionally further apart, reducing the efficiency with which information can be exchanged across different parts of the network.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite the centrality of consciousness to our experience, no agreement has yet emerged on which aspects of brain function underlie its presence, and what changes are connected to its disappearance in the healthy brain (e.g., during sleep) as well as in pathological conditions (e.g., coma). As a consequence, we are currently hard pressed to answer even basic questions concerning the presence, absence, degree and nature of the phenomenon of consciousness in humans and other species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Tononi1">[1]</xref>. As experimental investigations into this domain have increased, a number of proposals have been put forth to characterize the neural fingerprint of consciousness. According to some views, the crucial feature underlying consciousness is the presence of specific patterns of activations, such as the presence of competing assembly of cells, or ‘neural coalitions’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Crick1">[2]</xref>, synchronization of neural activity in specific frequency bands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Engel1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-TallonBaudry1">[4]</xref>, or the level of spontaneous oscillatory activity, at fast frequencies, in the thalamo-cortical system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Dehaene1">[5]</xref>. According to other proposals, consciousness is related to the spread and reverberation of information across the neural system, and in particular within specific regions in parietal and frontal cortices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Baars1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Baars2">[7]</xref> – although the scope of this view is mostly relevant to the idea of conscious availability of content to a neural system, as compared to the more general “state of consciousness” of a neural system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Dehaene2">[8]</xref>. Finally, a recently proposed view <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Tononi1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Tononi2">[9]</xref>, stresses the importance of evaluating not the degree of correlation among different (often long-range) regions, but rather the degree of information present and the extent to which information is integrated across the nodes of a system.</p>
<p>In the present work we look at spontaneous low-frequency fluctuations in the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Raichle1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Fox1">[11]</xref>, to assess the relationship between different states of consciousness and basic principles of information processing (as captured by the blood oxygenation level dependent signal; i.e., BOLD). The analysis of spontaneous fluctuations of the BOLD signal has been fruitfully employed to explore consciousness-related changes in clusters of temporally coherent regions during sedation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Martuzzi1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Schrouff1">[13]</xref>, sleep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-LarsonPrior1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Uehara1">[16]</xref>, and in the pathological brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Boly2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-FernndezEspejo1">[18]</xref>. In particular, associations within specific networks of regions have been found to be monotonically modulated by consciousness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Boly3">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Boveroux1">[21]</xref>, consistent with some theoretical views <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Engel1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Dehaene1">[5]</xref>. This idea, however, clashes with reports of increased cross-regional correlation concurrent with decrease or loss of consciousness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Blumenfeld1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Pyka1">[23]</xref>, suggesting the importance of characterizing not just the strength but also the quality of information processing within a system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Tononi1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Boly4">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>Following this idea, we employ previously collected resting-state fMRI data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Boveroux1">[21]</xref> to assess, in 12 healthy volunteers, the dynamic change of governing principles of brain organization during wakefulness (W), propofol-induced sedation (S) and loss of consciousness (LOC), as well as after consciousness recovery (R), a dynamic approach that has been recently advocated for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Schrter1">[25]</xref>. In particular, we focus on the change of global and local topological metrics of information processing across conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Bassett1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Rubinov1">[28]</xref>, a technique that has been successfully employed to characterize and model dynamics within physical <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-McQuillan1">[29]</xref>, biological <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Watts1">[30]</xref> and social systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Freeman1">[31]</xref>, and that has been shown to capture specific aspects of brain organization in the maturing, healthy adult, and pathological brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Bassett2">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Fair1">[36]</xref>. A particularly appealing aspect of this technique in the context of studies of consciousness is the parallel between the measures it offers, focused on characterizing how information is exchanged and propagated through a network, and theories of consciousness that stress the centrality of how information is treated and integrated within the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Tononi1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Tononi2">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>As detailed below, we report three main findings. First, contrary to a recent report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Schrter1">[25]</xref>, we find that long- and short-range connections are not differentially affected by sedation. Second, employing a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, we dissociate the thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical hyperconnectivity observed during sedation from the cortico-cortical hypoconnectivity observed during loss of consciousness. Finally, contrary to results in other species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Liang1">[37]</xref>, we find significant global changes in the (functional) topological organization of the brain during sedation. However, we show that normalized clustering, the global metric that was previously reported to be sensitive to the loss of consciousness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Schrter1">[25]</xref>, remains significantly elevated also through post-sedation recovery of wakefulness. Conversely, we find that a strong decrease in efficiency of information distribution (defined as the inverse of the characteristic path length – see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) is the only unambiguous marker of propofol-induced loss of consciousness.</p>

<p>The average connectivity matrices and the frequency distribution of (average) correlations for each condition are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003271-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003271-g002">Figure 2a</xref>, respectively. According to a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit test, the distribution of positive and negative correlations are significantly different for all pairwise comparisons (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; all <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). In all four conditions about 80% of correlations were between 0 and 0.4. LOC, however, exhibited a leftwards shift of the distribution, as shown by the median correlation value of 0.11, as compared to 0.23, 0.22, and 0.19 for W, S, and R, respectively. Furthermore, 14% of correlations in the LOC condition were negative, as compared to about 2% in all other conditions, while only 6% were above 0.4, versus 17%, 14% and 11% for W, S, and R, respectively. To assess whether correlations between areas at different distances were unequally affected by the level of consciousness, we employed a repeated measures ANCOVA with one within-subjects variable (i.e., condition) with four levels (W, S, LOC, R), and inter-ROI distance as a covariate (with distance defined as the 3-dimensional Euclidean distance between the baricenter of each ROI; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003271-g002">Figure 2b</xref>) to predict correlation strength. As expected, we found a significant effect of condition (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), indicating that correlation strength systematically varied across conditions. Specifically, W consistently exhibited the strongest average correlation level, across all bins, followed by S and R, while LOC consistently exhibited the weakest average correlation across all bins. We also found a significant effect of distance (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), indicating that, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003271-g002">Figure 2b</xref>, the average correlation strength decreased with distance. In addition to the two main effects, we also found a significant interaction between condition and distance (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), indicating an uneven effect of condition on links of different length. However, when we followed up this significant interaction with a set of separate repeated measures ANOVAs (one per each bin) we found that it was entirely driven by the absence of a significant difference between W and S for the first 3 bins (out of 15; i.e., regions closer than 3.4 cm). With this exception, the effect of propofol was remarkably consistent at all other connection lengths (particularly with respect to the crucial condition – i.e., loss of consciousness – where no difference was found across connection length). Indeed, at all other bins the four conditions were found to be significantly different from each other, based on estimated marginal means and a Sidak correction for multiple comparisons. The observation of a small effect of distance on connection strength across levels` of sedation is also consistent with the extremely low effect size observed for the interaction between condition and distance in the overall ANOVA (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), and strengthens the idea that, overall, connection size had a minimal effect on correlation strength – something that is immediately clear from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003271-g002">Figure 2b</xref>.</p>

<p>At the local level, accurate classification of each transition relied on different sets of edges within each brain graph (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003271.s002">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003271.s003">S2</xref> for full details). In particular, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003271-g003">Figure 3b</xref>, and more in detail in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003271-g004">Figure 4a</xref>, the edges mostly contributing to correctly classifying S versus W included positive cortico-cortical (54.8%) and thalamo-cortical (40.9%) connections, as well as a minority of cerebello-cortical (0.5%) and striato-cortical (3.8%) connections. Conversely, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003271-g003">Figures 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003271-g004">4b</xref>, the distribution of connections correctly classifying LOC, as compared to S, mostly included negative cortico-cortical connections (82.5%), as well as a minority of positive cortico-cortical (9.9%), thalamo-cortical (3.5%), cerebello-cortical (2.9%) and thalamo-striatal (1.2%) connections. Notably, when tested statistically, the allocation of classifying edges for these two transitions are significantly different (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>).

<p>Overall, the global repeated measures ANOVA indicated a significant effect of condition on normalized clustering (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). The threshold factor was also significant (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), as expected, but did not interact with the condition factor (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), indicating that the effect of the level of sedation on this measure is robust to the thresholding procedure. Follow-up pairwise comparison indicated that the effect of condition was mainly due to W and S exhibiting significantly less clustering than LOC and R, while no significant difference was found between either the first two or the latter two conditions. The follow-up 1-way ANOVAs (one per threshold) replicated the overall results at all thresholds, although it was only marginally significant at the lowest density threshold (i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003271-g005">Figure 5</xref>, top row).</p>
<p>The level of sedation also affected the normalized characteristic path length (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>).

Pairwise comparisons indicated that the only significant difference occurred between LOC and all other conditions, with the state of unconsciousness exhibiting significantly greater (normalized) characteristic path length.

In the 1-way ANOVAs, the same pattern was numerically detected at each threshold, but it was only significant at the three highest density thresholds (i.e., 21%, 26% and 31%), non-significant at the lowest density threshold (i.e., 11%) and marginally significant at the second lowest threshold (i.e., 16%; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003271-g005">Figure 5</xref>, third row).</p>
<p>Consistent with the results for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e062" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, a significant effect of condition was also found on normalized global efficiency (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e063" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e065" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e066" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>).

Pairwise comparisons indicated that in LOC efficiency is significantly decreased, as compared to all other conditions. The general pattern was replicated at each threshold individually, but it was only significant for the three highest density thresholds (i.e., 21%, 26% and 31%), marginally significant at the second lowest density (i.e., 16%; p = 0.06) and non-significant at the lowest density threshold (i.e., 11%; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003271-g005">Figure 5</xref>, fourth row).</p>
<p>Finally, normalized mean modularity (nQ) was also significantly affected by condition (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and threshold (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), with no significant interaction between the two factors (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Pairwise comparison indicated that the effect of condition was mainly due to W and S exhibiting significantly less modularity than LOC and R, while no significant difference was found between either the first two or the latter two conditions. This same effect was seen in the follow-up ANOVAs at the three highest density thresholds (i.e., 21%, 26% and 31%), while only a marginal effect was seen at the second threshold (i.e., 16%) and no effect at the lowest threshold (i.e., 11%). With respect to the mean number of modules uncovered in each condition, at the global level we find a marginally significant effect of sedation (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), although it exhibited a very small effect size (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Pairwise comparison indicated that the only difference was observed between S and LOC, with the latter showing a lower number of modules than the former. Consistent with the effect size statistic, however, although the same numerical trend was observed at each individual threshold (see in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003271-t002">Table 2</xref>), it was never found to be significant in any of the follow-up 1-way ANOVAs.</p>

<title>Local metrics</title>
<p>With respect to local metrics, results for nodal strength and local efficiency are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003271-g006">Figure 6</xref>. The level of sedation had a significant effect on nodal strength across a wide variety of lateral and midline regions. Overall, two main patterns were detected. In some regions (shown in blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003271-g006">Figure 6a</xref>), local strength was stronger (across thresholds and subjects) during W and R. This U-shape pattern was detected across a wide number of regions throughout the midline as well as in occipital, parietal and latero-ventral prefrontal-cortices (consistent with previous results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Schrter1">[25]</xref>). In other regions (shown in yellow-red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003271-g006">Figure 6a</xref>), local strength was stronger during S and LOC, as compared to the other two conditions. This inverted U-shape pattern was mainly detected in temporal cortex, ventro-medial prefrontal cortex, and the apical aspect of prefrontal cortex. The effect of sedation on local efficiency (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) was, as expected (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Latora1">[39]</xref>), consistent with the clustering results. All regions in which a significant effect of condition was detected exhibited greater efficiency (on average, across subjects and density thresholds) in LOC and R. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003271-g006">Figure 6b</xref>, condition mainly affected the local efficiency of regions within the medial section of parietal and frontal cortices.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we assessed propofol-induced changes in patterns of connectivity, as well as in global and local governing principles of brain organization, during wakefulness, sedation, loss of consciousness, and wakefulness recovery. Our results contribute to a growing literature addressing the topological organization of the human brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Bassett1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Rubinov2">[38]</xref>, the changes in functional architecture accompanying the loss of consciousness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Uehara1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Schrter1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Liang1">[37]</xref>, as well as a specific hypothesis concerning the role of different subsystems in loss of consciousness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Alkire1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Boly5">[41]</xref>.</p>
<p>Overall, our main findings are three-fold. First, despite the frequently voiced idea that long-range connections play a key role in anesthesia-induced unconsciousness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Alkire1">[40]</xref>, we fail to find a substantial asymmetric decrease in cross-region correlation as a function of inter-regional distance. Average connectivity strength decreased monotonically with distance in approximately the same manner across conditions (with the sole exception of extremely short connections, below 34 mm, but only during the initial phase of sedation, and not during loss of consciousness). This finding runs counter to a recent report demonstrating an uneven effect of propofol-induced unconsciousness on short-range (i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) versus long-range (i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) connections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Schrter1">[25]</xref>. The only effect we detected concerned much shorter connections (i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), and was only found for the initial period of sedation, and not for the period of loss of consciousness. Whether the different result is to be attributed to methodological asymmetries (e.g., 2-timepoint versus 4-timepoint paradigms, the binning procedure, the use of different ROIs parcellation schemes) or to un-modelled third factors remains to be determined.</p>
<p>The second central aspect of our results directly addresses the discussion concerning the role of thalamo-cortical versus cortico-cortical circuits in propofol-induced unconsciousness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Alkire1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Boly5">[41]</xref>. In particular, our SVM classification isolated increased thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical synchronization as being maximally informative in the wakefulness versus sedation classification, suggesting a prominent role of this circuit in the initial stages of sedation, before the onset of unconsciousness. Conversely, correct classification of the state of loss of consciousness, as compared to sedation, overwhelmingly relied on negative cortico-cortical correlations. These findings support the view that propofol-induced loss of consciousness is more closely linked to cortico-cortical mechanisms rather than thalamo-cortical ones, as also suggested in a recent EEG effective connectivity study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Boly5">[41]</xref>. It is important to point out that our SVM classification is entirely based on the full matrix of ROI-to-ROI correlations and is, therefore, entirely data driven and blind to the existence of particular neural circuits or opposing hypothesis concerning their role in propofol-induced loss of consciousness. The observed major role of negative cortico-cortical connectivity in propofol-induced unconsciousness should be differentiated, however, from studies on pathological loss of consciousness in severe brain injury where post-mortem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Adams1">[42]</xref> and in-vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-FernndezEspejo2">[43]</xref> evidence highlights the role of thalamus in loss and recovery of consciousness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Laureys1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Schiff1">[45]</xref>. While further studies will have to directly address the issue, our findings are consistent with the suggestion that thalamus may be a necessary but not sufficient component in maintaining consciousness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Boly5">[41]</xref> consistent with the view that thalamic lesions might induce unconsciousness after severe brain injury by virtue of disconnecting an otherwise functioning cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Giacino1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Monti1">[47]</xref>.</p>
<p>The third result of our study concerns changes in governing principles of information processing during loss and recovery of consciousness. Contrary to a recent study in other species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Liang1">[37]</xref>, we do find significant changes in global topological measures across levels of consciousness. Consistent with a previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Schrter1">[25]</xref>, we find that loss of consciousness is marked by an increase in normalized clustering (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), which measures the ‘cliquishness’ of brain regions, potentially indicating an increase in localized processing and thus a decrease of information integration across the brain. Our multi-stage design, however reveals that clustering remains significantly elevated (as compared to initial wakefulness and sedation) during post-anesthesia wakefulness recovery. This result shows that while it is true that clustering increases once consciousness is lost, it is not a sufficient marker of consciousness, something that the two-point design (i.e., initial wakefulness versus loss of consciousness) in Schröter <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Schrter1">[25]</xref> could not reveal. On the other hand, we find that the normalized characteristic path length (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) is significantly increased only during loss of consciousness, suggesting that during unconsciousness the efficiency of information distribution within the network is reduced (a finding that is consistent with a very recent study on loss of consciousness in sleep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Uehara1">[16]</xref>). Whether this state of increased “functional distance” between regions is causal or consequent to propofol-induced loss of consciousness will have to be addressed in future research. As previously reported, the small-world architecture of brain networks (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e089" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) persisted (and in fact increased) in loss of consciousness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Schrter1">[25]</xref>, confirming the robustness of this core principle of organization of biological networks despite profound state changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Bassett2">[32]</xref>. Mirroring <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e090" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, however, small-world architecture also remained significantly elevated during wakefulness recovery. Although much weaker, a similar effect of condition was also uncovered for normalized modularity (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e091" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Finally, we remark that the presence of different results observed in the two propofol conditions (sedation and loss of consciousness) and, importantly, consciousness recovery, is consistent with the view that changes in global brain topology observed here and elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Schrter1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Liang1">[37]</xref> are not simply due to drug exposure, but rather reflect brain state changes relating to the loss of consciousness, supporting a previously expressed view <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Schrter1">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>Beyond the global reorganization of brain topology, we also observed changes in local network topology. With respect to nodal strength, selected frontal and parietal regions along the midline, as well some lateral and opercular ROIs, appeared to be modulated by changes in the level of consciousness. In particular, regions in medial frontal and parietal cortices, along with occipital and lateral parietal, exhibited less nodal strength during sedation and loss of consciousness. Other regions, on the other hand, in temporal cortex especially, but also in dorsal and ventro-medial prefrontal cortex, exhibited the reverse pattern. Mirroring the result for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e092" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, local efficiency appeared to be modulated mostly across midline parietal and prefrontal regions. Overall, this pattern of reorganization of local network topology is consistent with the view that propofol affects specific hubs central to normal/wakeful connectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Tomasi1">[48]</xref> which are also known to play a critical role in consciousness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Laureys2">[49]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Voss1">[51]</xref> and self-consciousness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Laureys4">[52]</xref>.</p>
<p>Taken together, our findings support the idea that (propofol-induced) loss of consciousness correlates with a change in the quality of information processing, and not only a change in the strength of connectivity across regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Tononi1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Boly4">[24]</xref>. In particular, dynamic reconfiguration of thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical connections, and contemporaneous decrease of efficiency and increased local processing might affect the degree by which information can be effectively integrated across the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Tononi2">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>In terms of theories of consciousness, these findings can be interpreted as making two contributions. First, the significant increase of cortico-cortical decorrelations during loss of consciousness is coherent with views of consciousness stressing the role of coherent reverberation and spread of neural activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Baars1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Baars2">[7]</xref>, particularly within fronto-parietal regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Dehaene1">[5]</xref>. (We point out that, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003271.s002">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003271.s003">S2</xref>, all fronto-parietal connections driving the correct classification of loss of consciousness, compared to sedation, are negative.) Second, our graph theoretic analysis further indicates that, in terms of network information processing, propofol-induced loss of consciousness is marked by a specific change in the quality of information exchange (i.e., decreased efficiency), consistent with the view that the specific modality with which information is exchanged within brain networks is crucial to the maintenance of a state of consciousness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Tononi1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Tononi2">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to stress that many of the methodological limitations expressed elsewhere concerning the interpretation of the blood oxygenation level dependent signal, as well as the current challenges tied to applying graph theory to brain measures previously discussed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Schrter1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Rubinov1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Bassett2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-vandenHeuvel1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Liang1">[37]</xref>, also apply to our study. In particular, with respect to the implementation of graph-theory measures in neuroscience, several issues are still in search of resolution. Here, we believe it is important to stress five methodological considerations. First, as we note in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> section, most topological measures require thresholding of adjacency matrices, a procedure that presently lacks a defined standard approach (e.g., how many and which thresholds to employ) and might have important effects on the derived metrics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-vanWijk1">[53]</xref>. While the real resolution of the issue will likely include measures that can be applied to fully connected matrices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Rubinov1">[28]</xref>, we stress that our results were robust to the choice of threshold. Second, in contrast to some previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Schrter1">[25]</xref>, we made use of weighted measures, a difference that might explain the divergence of results. For instance, we note that the observed between-group differences in our study were most pronounced at the lowest density thresholds (corresponding to least sparse networks), in contrast to many binary brain-network studies, in which between-group differences are most pronounced at the highest density thresholds (corresponding to most sparse networks) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Bullmore1">[54]</xref>. Many binary-network studies discard as many as 90–95% of all possible connections to elucidate the observed between-group differences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-vanWijk1">[53]</xref> and it is likely that these more radical thresholding approaches are associated with substantial loss of connectivity information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Rubinov3">[55]</xref>. High thresholds are needed in binary studies because when weak and strong links surviving thresholding are equally assigned a value of 1, measures based on path length become susceptible to the creation of spurious long-distance short-cuts, which might obscure the architecture of strong connections and, thereby, important across-group differences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Rubinov2">[38]</xref>. It is therefore possible that the use of binary matrices in previous studies might have obscured the differences in characteristic path length that we have observed. Consistent with our findings, a recent study in the domain of sleep also uncovered loss of efficiency during unconsciousness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Uehara1">[16]</xref>. Third, as discussed in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> section, because of the known effects of motion on graph theoretic analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Satterthwaite1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Power1">[57]</xref>, our sample was reduced to 12 volunteers. Although this sample size is within the boundaries of previous work on this same topic (e.g., N = 11 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Schrter1">[25]</xref>, N = 20 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Liang1">[37]</xref>) it does fall at the low end of the spectrum. Therefore, even though our analyses leverage on a statistically more powerful 4-point repeated measures design (as compared to the more typical two groups across-subjects comparison and two-points within subject design), future studies will have to confirm their generality. Nonetheless, we do stress that the effect-size analysis, which is robust to small samples, shows that our effects are of large magnitude, and that our results are consistent with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Uehara1">[16]</xref>. Fourth, while we adopt the presently accepted mainstream interpretation of characteristic path length and global efficiency as measures of functional integration, we acknowledge that these interpretations have not been directly validated and are less trivial to make in networks where edges represent correlations and hence do not necessarily represent causal interactions or information flow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Rubinov1">[28]</xref>. Finally, it is important to stress that a recognized source of variance across results is the choice of ROIs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Zalesky1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Hayasaka1">[59]</xref>. In particular, we employed more ROIs than in similar previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Schrter1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Liang1">[37]</xref>, hence it is possible that some of the reported differences are due to the less granular parcellation schemes previously employed. Similarly, it is also possible that, if we had used an even greater number of ROIs, or based our networks on a voxel-wise analysis, results would have differed. However, it has been shown that simple binary decisions concerning the presence of certain network organizational parameters (e.g., small-worldness) are robust across different parcellation granularity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Zalesky1">[58]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Fornito1">[60]</xref>. Consistent with this finding, a recent study evaluating network properties during sleep reported a loss of efficiency during loss of consciousness that paralleles our own findings, despite the fact that their networks featured more than 3,700 nodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Uehara1">[16]</xref>. It should be stressed, however, that high granularity parcellations might yield quantitatively very different estimates of network properties, as compared to low granularity parcellations, and might allow topological features to be displayed more prominently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Zalesky1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Hayasaka1">[59]</xref>. There is, however, an important conceptual difference that separates region-based networks from voxel-based networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-vandenHeuvel1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Sepulcre1">[61]</xref>. In our report, as in all region-based analyses of brain connectivity, network locality is conceived at a specific scale, determined by the coarseness of the employed parcellation. Hence, when we investigate local network properties, we are investigating topological features calculated over proximal brain regions. Conversely, voxel-wise networks assess locality within regions of the brain, an approach which has the potential advantage of capturing differences across regions of the brain in within- and between-connectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-vandenHeuvel1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Sepulcre1">[61]</xref>. In this sense, region-based network analyses might be biased towards highlighting the properties of regions with widely distributed connections at a coarse scale, predominant in heteromodal association areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Felleman1">[62]</xref>, and blind to local hierarchical connections more predominant in sensory cortical areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Mesulam1">[63]</xref>. Voxel-based network analysis, instead, allow for examining inter-regional as well as intra-regional connectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-vandenHeuvel1">[34]</xref>. Nonetheless voxelwise parcellations might however pose conceptual difficulties with respect to computing global network properties because grid-like subdivisions do not generally respect boundaries or sizes of heterogeneous functional areas, an approach that might lead to mischaracterization of brain network function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Wig1">[64]</xref>. In conclusion, in interpreting our results (as any region-based network analysis with comparably sized, or larger, ROIs) it is thus important to keep in mind that our statements concerning changes in local topological features are intended as network-local, and do not necessarily reflect local changes at the brain physical level.</p>
<p>In sum, our findings show that changes in the level of consciousness induced by propofol affect basic organization principles and dynamics of information processing across the whole brain as well as within specific regions known to be involved in consciousness. In particular, we find that propofol-induced loss of consciousness is mostly associated with cortico-cortical mechanisms, as opposed to thalamo-cortical ones, and with a substantial decrease in the efficiency of information flow within the network. Future research will have to assess whether different anesthetic agents and pathology (e.g., brain trauma, seizures) induce loss of consciousness <italic>via</italic> the same mechanisms.</p>

<p>The whole dataset included twenty healthy right-handed volunteers (16 female) between the ages of 18 and 31 (M = 22.40, SD = 3.40). However, given the strong sensitivity of graph-theoretic measures to motion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Satterthwaite1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Power1">[57]</xref>, subjects presenting any displacement above 3 mm throughout any one scan (of the 4 each subject underwent) was dropped. In total, 8 subjects were excluded due to movement, reducing our sample size to 12 volunteers. For the remaining volunteers average absolute movement was well below half a millimiter (0.33, 0.34, 0.20, 0.26, for W, S, LOC and R, respectively) and did not significantly differ across condition (1-way repeated measures ANOVA; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e094" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). In addition, we remark that subject exclusion is, at present, a conservative strategy.

Finally, novel more aggressive correction approaches censoring time-points <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Power1">[57]</xref>, while correcting for motion and potential spurious correlations, are associated with the negative effects of reducing the number of time-points <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Fair2">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Yan1">[66]</xref> which has been shown to be associated with increases in the likelihood of high correlation, and to be a potential source of across condition or across subject bias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Yan1">[66]</xref>.

Nuisance signals, including motion parameters, white matter and CSF associated time-courses were partialled-out using a linear regression. Consistent with previous research <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Schrter1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Liang1">[37]</xref>, global signal was not removed since it has been shown to be liable to introducing artifactual anti-correlations that can bias correlations differently in different parts of the brain depending on the underlying true interregional correlation structure, potentially introducing structure even where there is none <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Murphy1">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Saad1">[69]</xref> and has been shown to suppress meaningful neural activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Zhang1">[70]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Schlvinck1">[71]</xref>, while regression of white matter and CSF signals has been shown to reduce many of the unwanted sources of noise that global signal regression is often used for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Jo1">[72]</xref>. Furthermore, with respect to graph theory analyses specifically, global signal regression has been reported to decrease reproducibility of both local and global topologically metrics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Schwarz1">[73]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Telesford1">[75]</xref>. The residuals of the regression were then co-registered to an MNI-space template (via 2-step registration using 6 degrees of freedom (dof) for within subject alignment of functional data to anatomical data and 12 dof to align the subject's anatomical image to the template). As part of this latter step, data were also resampled at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e102" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> isovoxel resolution.</p>

<title>Brain network constructions</title>
<p>For each subject and each condition we constructed a graph representing a mathematical description of the brain as a functional network. A graph consists of a set of points and a set of lines connecting pairs of points <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Freeman1">[31]</xref>. In our framework, each point, also referred to as a <italic>node</italic> or <italic>vertex</italic>, corresponds to a specific brain region, or region of interest (ROI). Each line, also referred to as an <italic>edge</italic> or <italic>link</italic>, specifies the presence/absence of a connection between any two vertices and, for weighted graphs, the magnitude of the connection. (In our analysis the connection is the Pearson correlation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e103" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> statistic between each pair of nodes.) In what follows graphs are typically visualized in a familiar matrix heat-map presentation, where each row/column of the square matrix represents an ROI, and element (<italic>i</italic>,<italic>j</italic>) specifies the functional correlation between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e104" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e105" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>Brain graphs were constructed in three steps. First, each individual data-set was parceled into 194 ROIs spanning cortex, sub-cortical nuclei, cerebellum and brainstem (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003271-g007">Figure 7</xref>). ROIs were defined independently, on the basis of a functional atlas that groups together spatially coherent voxels with homogeneous functional connectivity, at a desired resolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Craddock1">[76]</xref>. Specifically, we took the brain parcellation made available by Craddock and colleagues and employed that parcellation scheme to divide the brain in a set of 194 regions of interest. It is important to note that this procedure ensures that ROI selection is entirely independent of our data, thereby avoiding any form of bias in the analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Kriegeskorte1">[77]</xref>. With the exception of atlas choice, this procedure follows exactly what has been done in previous research <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Schrter1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Liang1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Bullmore2">[78]</xref>. Choice of this parcellation scheme over previously used atlases such as the AAL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-TzourioMazoyer1">[79]</xref> and the Harvard-Oxford Atlas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Kennedy1">[80]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Makris1">[81]</xref> is advantageous from several points of view. First, being functionally defined it clusters spatially proximal voxels by homogeneity of functional connections as opposed to clustering by anatomical position which, as exemplified by the case of the precentral gyrus ROIs in both the AAL and the Harvard-Oxford atlases, clusters together functionally very distinct subregions. Second, at our chosen level the Craddock ROIs have, collectively, almost twice the granularity as either structural atlas (i.e., 194 ROIs versus, 90 and 112 for the AAL and Harvard-Oxford atlases, respectively). Furthermore, when all atlases are equally resampled at 2 mm resolution, the ROIs obtained from the Craddock atlas appear much more homogeneous, in terms of size, than the other two (e.g., min to max voxel count range: 517, 5,005 and 8,076 for the Craddock, Harvard-Oxford and AAL atlases, respectively). After the functional parcellation of the brain into 194 ROIs, the average time-course associated with all voxels within each region was extracted. Finally, the average signal derived from each ROI was correlated to all other ROIs (using a Pearson's correlation coefficient; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) in order to obtain a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e107" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> square connectivity matrix (i.e., the graph). These connectivity matrices were the input for the following two analyses.</p>

<title>Network classification</title>
<p>Classifications were performed, on a pairwise basis, using the Pattern Recognition of Brain Image Data software package (PROBID; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/iop/depts/neuroimaging/research/imaginganalysis/Software/PROBID.aspx" xlink:type="simple">http://www.kcl.ac.uk/iop/depts/neuroimaging/research/imaginganalysis/Software/PROBID.aspx</ext-link>). PROBID employs a linear kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-MouroMiranda1">[82]</xref> algorithm to achieve classification; that is, it attempts to find a hyperplane that separates the matrices according to their class membership (e.g., W vs. S). This approach is particularly appealing in the domain of brain imaging because of its well-known benign properties in circumstances in which the number of input features (here, the number of elements of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e108" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> adjacency matrix) exceeds the number of samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Lemm1">[83]</xref>. Use of a linear SVM algorithm has two important advantages. First, it reduces the probability of over-fitting the data (as compared to non-linear algorithms, since the linear kernel has only one parameter that controls the trade-off between having zero training errors and allowing mis-classifications; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Lemm1">[83]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-MouroMiranda2">[84]</xref>); second, it allows direct extraction of the weight vector that defines the hyperplane, that is, a vector specifying which elements are most relevant for discriminating between the groups. In our context, the input to the classifier were the unthresholded correlation matrices, implying that ROI-to-ROI correlations were the features upon which classifications were performed. Following the requirements of the software, each subject's adjacency matrix was vectorized; conversely, the classification results were reshaped into the original <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e109" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> matrix form. Classification performance was evaluated using an exhaustive “leave-one-out cross validation” scheme, as implemented in PROBID, resulting in mean accuracy, mean sensitivity, and mean specificity percentages for each classification. In this approach, N different training datasets are built by leaving out, in each, a different subject. The estimated SVM hyperparameter (i.e., the hyperplane best separating the two classes) from each training set is then separately validated against the one dataset that has been left out of the training. Finally, the results from each separate iteration of the training-validation procedure are averaged. Overall, it is important to stress that our approach avoids the most frequent pitfalls known to potentially bias machine learning approaches (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Lemm1">[83]</xref> for a detailed <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">discussion</xref>). First, because feature extraction (i.e., computation of the adjacency matrices) was performed on a single subject basis, our subject-based cross validation strategy adheres to the independence assumption of training and validation set, thereby ensuring that (i) the estimate of the hyperparameter is indeed inferred solely on the properties of the training set, and has not been contaminated by the test set, and that (ii) the model evaluation is not biased by any information included in the training set. Second, because our rejection of artifacts (e.g., modeling of motion) is unconnected to class membership, there is no risk that the rejection schema might bias the classification results. Similarly, the decision to entirely reject a subject whenever one of the four sessions presented excessive motion also allows us to avoid the potential biases associated with unbalanced class frequencies. Finally, the use of an exhaustive leave-one-out validation strategy provides an almost unbiased estimate of the generalization error <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Lemm1">[83]</xref>, albeit at the expense of an increased variance of the estimator, thereby avoiding the possibility of excessively optimistic estimates of the generalization error. Overall, five classifications were computed. First, we attempted to classify the two states of wakefulness (W &amp; R) versus the two states of altered consciousness (S &amp; LOC). Then, we performed three pairwise classifications aimed at distinguishing contiguous states; namely, W vs. S; S vs. LOC; LOC vs. R. Finally, we compared the two states of wakefulness to each other (i.e., W vs. R). The statistical significance of each classification accuracy was assessed with a non-parametric approach based on repeated label permutation (10,000 times). The p-value from the permutation was derived by counting the number of times the true (that is, non-permuted) accuracy was greater than the accuracy derived after permuting the labels and dividing by 10,000. Familywise error rate was controlled for with a Bonferroni correction.</p>
<p>To visualize the results of the SVM classification for each comparison, we created “importance maps” (also referred to as “evidence maps”) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Johnson1">[85]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-McDuff1">[86]</xref>. These maps, depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003271-g003">Figure 3</xref>, were obtained in two steps. First, we separated the elements of the weighting matrix <italic>w</italic>, which defines the hyperplane best separating two classes (e.g., LOC <italic>versus</italic> S), into two sparse matrices. The first sparse matrix, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e110" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, included all the elements contributing to classifying the first condition (e.g., LOC); the second sparse matrix,<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e111" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, included all elements contributing to classifying the second condition (e.g., S). (It should be noted that while there is no absolute scale for quantitatively interpreting the importance maps, the greater the value for a given link, the greater its influence on the classification.) Second, we multiplied each sparse matrix by the average adjacency matrix across all subjects correctly classified. The resulting sparse matrices, which are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003271-g003">Figure 3</xref>, thus show the average value, across all subjects correctly classified, of each edge contributing to the classification of a given condition scaled by how much it contributed. Positive values therefore indicate positive correlations (i.e., edges) contributing to a classification, scaled by how much they contributed to the classification; similarly, negative values indicate negative correlations (i.e., edges) contributing to a classification, scaled by how much they contributed to the classification.</p>
<p>In parallel to the SVM algorithm, all classifications were also computed using PROBID's Gaussian Process Classifier (GPC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Marquand1">[87]</xref> algorithm, which yielded nearly identical results.</p>
<p>Finally, to assess whether the pattern of connections which allowed classifying the transition from wakefulness to sedation (i.e., S vs. W) differed from the pattern of connections which allowed correctly classifying the transition from sedation to loss of consciousness (i.e., LOC vs. S), we performed a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e112" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> test comparing the distribution of classifying connections in the two comparisons. More in detail, for each of the two classifications, we divided the top 1% of edges contributing to correct classification into 15 kinds of connections (e.g., cortico-cortical (positive), cortico-cortical (negative), thalamo-cortical, striato-cortical, etc; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003271.s002">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003271.s003">S2</xref>). Counts for the two conditions were then entered into a contingency table and thus submitted to a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> test comparing the two distributions.</p>

<title>Network analysis</title>
<p>To characterize local and global properties of the brain networks during normal wake, sedation, loss of consciousness and recovery, we employed a set of metrics derived from graph-theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Stam1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Bullmore1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Bullmore2">[78]</xref>. Prior to the analysis, connectivity matrices were thresholded to avoid the possibility that weak and non-significant links representing spurious connections may obscure the topology of strong and significant connections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Rubinov1">[28]</xref>. Thresholding was performed on a proportional basis thus retaining, for each individual matrix, only the strongest <italic>t</italic>% (positive) edges. To date there is no agreed algorithm to select a unique threshold at which to perform graph-analysis, hence we followed one of the many procedures employed previously. Specifically, the lower boundary was selected to ensure the averaged degree was not smaller than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where N is the total number of nodes in the graph (i.e., N = 194). This lower boundary guaranteed that the resulting networks were estimable networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Watts1">[30]</xref>. The upper boundary was selected to ensure that mean small-worldness (see below for the definition) in each condition was not smaller than 1.0. These two constraints yield an interval of density thresholds between 11% and 31%, which we sampled in steps of 5% (resulting in the following five density thresholds: 11%, 16%, 21%, 26%, 31%). The issue of thresholding is addressed in more detail in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>.</p>
<p>Several global and local metrics were computed for each connectivity matrix, employing the Brain Connectivity Toolbox (BCT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Rubinov1">[28]</xref>. First, we assessed large-scale network functional integration of brain networks, which captures the extent to which information from distributed regions can be rapidly combined, by measuring their characteristic path length and global efficiency. The <italic>characteristic path length (L)</italic> of a network is defined as the average length of the path uniting each pair of nodes within the network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Watts1">[30]</xref>. Since our networks are based on functional data, paths can be conceived as sequences of statistical associations (i.e., correlations) between nodes rather than physical existing/non-existing paths as might be the case with structural measures. The most common and mainstream interpretation of characteristic path length in networks is as a measure for global integration of information between topologically distant brain regions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref> for more details). To date, the vast majority of graph analysis of functional data have been performed on binary graphs, that is, connectivity matrices in which all elements that survive thresholding are set to 1, regardless of their original value, and all other elements are set to 0. In this procedure, however, once matrices are binarized weak edges exert the same influence on network measures than strong edges. In the context of path length, for example, where strongly correlated nodes can be intuitively interpreted as (functionally) “closer,” binarization might result in erroneous creation of long-distance shortcuts, which can obscure the architecture of strong connections and, ultimately, important across-group differences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Rubinov2">[38]</xref>. Thus, following the development of metrics that make use of weight information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Newman1">[88]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Onnela1">[89]</xref>, we employ “weighted” measures (denoted, in the following formulae by the superscript ‘<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>’). Characteristic path length was thus computed as follows:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003271.e116"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represents the set of all nodes within a network, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the number of nodes, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the shortest path uniting nodes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The average inverse of L is thus a measure of <italic>global efficiency (</italic><inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><italic>)</italic> of a network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Latora1">[39]</xref>. A different aspect of a network is the degree to which it exhibits functional segregation, which captures the extent to which subgroups of nodes densely interconnected with each other can carry out specialized processing. To quantify the presence of clusters of regions (e.g., modules) with strong statistical dependencies suggestive of segregated neural processing we computed the <italic>clustering coefficient (C)</italic>, a measure of the ‘cliquishness’ of networks' subdivisions defined as the average fraction of a node's neighbors that are also neighbors of each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Watts1">[30]</xref>. In its weighted version, clustering is defined as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Onnela1">[89]</xref>:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003271.e122"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e123" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the degree of a node (i.e., the sum of the weights of all nodes connecting to node <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represents the geometric mean of all triangles (i.e., triads of reciprocally connected nodes) surrounding node <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Similarly, <italic>modularity (Q)</italic> measures the extent to which a network can be optimally subdivided in a number of non-overlapping groups of regions which have high within-group connectivity and low across-group connectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Newman2">[90]</xref>. As for above, we employed the weighted version of the algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Newman1">[88]</xref>:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003271.e127"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the weight of the connection (i.e., correlation) between nodes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e129" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e130" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e131" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> designates the module <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e132" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> within which node <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is contained, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e134" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is equal to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e135" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> if nodes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e136" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e137" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are part of the same module <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e138" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e139" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> otherwise. To address the issue of degeneracy, we followed a three step procedure previously suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Rubinov1">[28]</xref>. Specifically, computation of modularity was refined by first applying a finetuning algorithm to the above calculation, and then running a final probabilistic tuning algorithm on the finetuned result. In addition, because the calculation of modularity is heuristic and variable across iterations, we performed the three steps above (modularity, fine-tuning and probabilistic-tuning) 50 times for each matrix, and then employed the mean modularity value across the 50 iterations for subsequent analyses (we note that we also performed the analyses on the median modularity, across the 50 iterations, and it yield qualitatively identical results).</p>
<p>It is important to note that it is often not possible to interpret the significance of the absolute values of the above metrics. Thus, the metrics derived for each network are typically normalized by the average metric derived from 100 random networks (with matched size and degree distribution). The normalized characteristic path length (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e140" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) is thus the ratio of the characteristic path length (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e141" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) of a brain network and the average characteristic path length of 100 random networks (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e142" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Normalized clustering coefficient (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e143" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), global efficiency (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e144" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and modularity (nQ) are defined analogously. In addition, the ratio of normalized clustering and normalized characteristic path length is often referred to as the small world property (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e145" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) of a network. Small-world networks are networks that are neither completely random nor completely regular; rather, they lie in-between these two extremes and exhibit a high degree of clustering, like regular networks, and a low characteristic path length, like random networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Watts1">[30]</xref>. Several studies to date have observed small-world characteristics in the human brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Bassett1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Sporns1">[91]</xref>.</p>
<p>In addition to the metrics above, we also characterized the brain networks on a node-wise basis. First, we computed the <italic>strength (</italic><inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e146" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><italic>)</italic> of each node, a basic measure of node centrality defined as:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003271.e147"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e147" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>Nodes with a high strength are nodes that are (functionally) close to many other nodes in the graph. In general, measures of centrality are based on the intuition that nodes participating in several short paths within a network are important controls of information flow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Freeman1">[31]</xref>. Node strength can therefore be interpreted as an index of communication activity within a network. Finally, we also calculated the <italic>local efficiency (</italic><inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e148" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><italic>)</italic> of each node to get a local measure of segregation. In its weighted version, local efficiency for node <italic>i</italic> is defined as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Rubinov1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Latora1">[39]</xref>:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003271.e149"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e149" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e150" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the length of the shortest (weighted) path between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e151" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e152" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that contains only neighbors of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e153" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This metric can be interpreted as measuring how “fault tolerant” the system is since it captures how efficient the communication is between the first neighbors of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e154" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> when <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e155" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is removed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Latora1">[39]</xref>. The present extension of the local efficiency to weighted networks differentiates the influence on presumed fault tolerance of strongly connected and weakly connected neighbors, and broadly parallels a generalization of the clustering coefficient to weighted networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Rubinov1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Onnela1">[89]</xref>.</p>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed in Stata (SE, Version 13, Stata Corp) and Matlab (Mathworks Matlab, version R2013a). The effect of condition on each metric was assessed using a repeated measures ANOVA model with condition (4 levels: W, S, LOC and R) and threshold (5 levels: 11%, 16%, 21%, 26%, 31%) as factors. Following convention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Girden1">[92]</xref>, where the Machuly's test indicated violation of the sphericity assumption, degrees of freedom were calculated with the Huynh-Feldt correction for moderate violations (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e156" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; denoted with the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e157" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> subscript) and the Greenhouse-Geisser for more severe violations (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e158" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; denoted with the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e159" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> subscript). Because of the relatively small size of our sample, we also report the partial omega-squared (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e160" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), a measure of effect size in the population that is resistant to sample size and therefore provides a better measure of the magnitude of the effect between conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Keren1">[93]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Ferguson1">[94]</xref>. Unlike other metrics of effect size that are significantly upwards biased (e.g., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e161" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e162" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> does not results in inflated estimates even for small sample sizes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Keren1">[93]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Pierce1">[95]</xref>. This statistic is usually interpreted as the percent of the dependent variable's variance accounted for by the effect in the population with other non-error sources of variance being partialled out, and is considered to indicate, for values of 0.01, 0.06, 0.14, small, medium and large effects, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Kirk1">[96]</xref>. Pairwise comparisons among the different conditions were performed on the basis of estimated means using a Sidak adjustment for multiple comparisons. The 2-way repeated measures ANOVA was followed-up with a set of 1-way repeated measures ANOVA, one per each threshold, with condition as the only factor. For global measures, significance was assessed against a conventional 0.05 p-value criterion. For local measures, due to the multiple comparisons issue, we employed an FDR-adjusted criterion of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003271.e163" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003271-Yekutieli1">[97]</xref>).</p>
