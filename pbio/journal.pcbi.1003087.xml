<p>The protein kinases are a large family of enzymes that play fundamental roles in propagating signals within the cell. Because of the high degree of binding site similarity shared among protein kinases, designing drug compounds with high specificity among the kinases has proven difficult. However, computational approaches to comparing the 3-dimensional geometry and physicochemical properties of key binding site residue positions have been shown to be informative of inhibitor selectivity. The Combinatorial Clustering Of Residue Position Subsets (<sc>ccorps</sc>) method, introduced here, provides a semi-supervised learning approach for identifying structural features that are correlated with a given set of annotation labels. Here, <sc>ccorps</sc> is applied to the problem of identifying structural features of the kinase <sc>atp</sc> binding site that are informative of inhibitor binding. <sc>ccorps</sc> is demonstrated to make perfect or near-perfect predictions for the binding affinity profile of 8 of the 38 kinase inhibitors studied, while only having overall poor predictive ability for 1 of the 38 compounds. Additionally, <sc>ccorps</sc> is shown to identify shared structural features across phylogenetically diverse groups of kinases that are correlated with binding affinity for particular inhibitors; such instances of structural similarity among phylogenetically diverse kinases are also shown to not be rare among kinases. Finally, these function-specific structural features may serve as potential starting points for the development of highly specific kinase inhibitors.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The kinases are a group of essential signaling proteins within the cell and are the largest family of enzymes encoded by the human genome. The high degree of binding site similarity shared across the protein kinases has made them difficult targets for which to design highly selective inhibitors, but kinome-wide binding site analysis can help predict unintended off-target inhibitions. Given the increasingly large number of available kinase structures, kinome-wide comparative analysis of binding sites is now possible. In this paper, the Combinatorial Clustering Of Residue Position Subsets (<sc>ccorps</sc>) method is introduced and used to synthesize kinome-wide structure datasets with a kinome-wide inhibitor affinity screening dataset consisting of 38 kinase inhibitors. <sc>ccorps</sc> identifies structural features of the kinase binding site that are correlated with an inhibitor binding and uses these features to predict if this inhibitor will be capable of binding to uncharacterized kinases. This paper demonstrates the ability of <sc>ccorps</sc> to accurately predict inhibitor binding and identify features of the kinase binding site that are unique to kinases capable of binding a given inhibitor.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The protein kinases constitute the largest enzyme family encoded by the human genome, with currently 518 known sequences, making up 1.7% of all human genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Cohen1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Manning1">[2]</xref>. Because these protein kinases are intimately involved in cellular communication and regulation networks, the loss of normal kinase regulation has been implicated in a wide variety of pathological conditions. The large number of disease states found to be associated with kinase dysregulation has motivated the development of kinase-specific inhibitor compounds and research to discover protein kinase inhibitors has come to constitute 20–30% of the drug development programs at many companies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Cohen1">[1]</xref>.</p>
<p>The bulk of this effort has been directed at identifying inhibitors that bind at the <sc>atp</sc> binding site. However, due to the large number of existing protein kinase domains and the high degree of (<sc>atp</sc>) binding site similarity among them, designing highly selective inhibitors has proven difficult. For example, type I kinase inhibitors that only target the <sc>atp</sc> site have typically been found to have low selectivity across the kinome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Liu1">[3]</xref>. To increase inhibitor selectivity, type II inhibitors bind both the <sc>atp</sc> site and the immediately adjacent allosteric site. By also binding to the allosteric site, type II inhibitors are able to make additional highly specific interactions, thereby allowing them to be more selective <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Liu1">[3]</xref>.</p>
<p>Identifying highly specific structural features that can be uniquely targeted by inhibitors can be facilitated by comparative analysis of multiple kinase structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Bikker1">[4]</xref>. Comparative analysis of multiple structures allows for the identification of kinase structural features that are available for inhibitor targeting as well as insight into the effect of activation conformation dynamics, such as structural features that are only available for targeting in the inactive, DFG-out conformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Liu1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Milletti1">[6]</xref>. Furthermore, combining structure and sequence is important when analyzing the kinases holistically due to the large degree of sequence divergence among the protein kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Scheeff1">[7]</xref>. A specific example of the insight derived from the comparative analysis of kinase structural features follows.</p>
<p>Many of the effective inhibitor selectivity strategies involve exploiting the differences in the size of the <sc>atp</sc> binding site and targeting residue variability at a few key positions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Liu1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Huang1">[8]</xref>. These structure-based comparison approaches have proven more useful than sequence-only measures of overall kinase similarity in evaluating the potential selectivity profile of inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Huang1">[8]</xref>. For example, the size of the gatekeeper residue directly moderates the availability of a hydrophobic pocket. Inhibitors having larger functional groups that bind this hydrophobic pocket may be able to select for the roughly 20% of protein kinases that have a relatively small gatekeeper residue (e.g., Gly, Val, Ala or Thr). This is because kinases with a larger gatekeeper residue (e.g., Phe) do not have a large enough hydrophobic pocket to accommodate the inhibitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Huang1">[8]</xref>. However, in order to select for an even more specific subset of the human kinome, it has proven necessary to take advantage of multiple structural features of the kinase binding site (both <sc>atp</sc> and allosteric sites) simultaneously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Liu1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Huang1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>A review of related work is given below. Recent work has illustrated that local structural similarity exists among phylogenetically diverse groups of kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Kuhn1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Kinnings1">[9]</xref> and has highlighted the importance of large-scale, multiple-structure analysis of structure-affinity relationships among the kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Kinnings1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-McGregor1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>The PharmMap method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-McGregor1">[10]</xref> incorporates an aligned set of receptor-ligand co-crystals in order to identify pharmacophores common to a set of inhibitors. It has been developed to identify kinase inhibitor pharmacophores useful for selecting molecules for kinase screening panels.</p>
<p>Huang et al. have utilized a knowledge-based approach to constructing a minimal binding site “fingerprint” that captures only a pre-specified set of well-studied, structurally selective features, such as the size and hydrogen-bonding ability of the gatekeeper residue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Huang1">[8]</xref>. The per-kinase fingerprint utilizes nine binding site features (e.g., residue type at gatekeeper position) that have been shown to encode for selectivity among type I inhibitors. Anecdotally, kinases with similar fingerprints were shown to also have similar inhibitor selectivity profiles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Huang1">[8]</xref>, illustrating the utility of structural features in predicting and understanding kinase selectivity.</p>
<p>Rather than relying upon pre-specified structural features, the recently developed Pocketfeature method decomposes a binding site into all possible “micro-environments” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Liu2">[11]</xref>. Pairs of kinase binding sites with highly similar sets of micro-environments were anecdotally shown to share a common inhibitor in 9 out of the top 50 most similar (as calculated by Pocket<sc>feature</sc>) kinase binding site pairs. The CavBase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Schmitt1">[12]</xref> cavity matching approach has been used to cluster kinase <sc>atp</sc> binding cavities from multiple families across the kinome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Kuhn1">[5]</xref>. The kinase binding cavity clusterings derived from CavBase have been shown to generally agree with the sequence-derived kinase families and sub-families <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Kuhn1">[5]</xref>, demonstrating that the overall kinase cavity is well-conserved within families.</p>
<p>Recent work by Jackson et al. demonstrated a related structural clustering approach to predicting kinase inhibitor binding affinities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Kinnings1">[9]</xref>. Their geometric hashing approach to whole-site comparison of the <sc>atp</sc> binding pocket was demonstrated to be effective at identifying possible instances of inhibitor cross-reactivity and further emphasized the importance of taking into account subtle conformational changes in the binding site.</p>
<p>However, despite the successes of existing approaches, several outstanding problems to identifying structural features of the kinase binding site that are predictive of inhibitor selectivity remain. The reliance upon a single, representative structure precludes the ability of existing methods to identify features common only to active conformations if an inactive structure is chosen as representative (and vice versa). Additionally, choosing one representative structure disregards the role that binding site flexibility and plasticity may play in inhibitor interactions. Furthermore, the availability of multiple structures for <italic>individual</italic> kinases, exhibiting a variety of binding site conformations and bound ligands, provides a vast quantity of structure data that remains unexploited by existing approaches. Much of the difficulty in incorporating multiple conformations per individual kinase sequence into existing analyses stems from the non-uniform distribution of available kinase structures, with kinases such as CDK2 having more than a hundred available crystallographic structures while other kinases have only a single (or no) available structure. Finally, the availability of multiple kinase structures known <italic>to bind</italic> a given inhibitor and other kinase binding sites known <italic>not to bind</italic> that same inhibitor provides a rich set of structural examples and counter-examples beyond a single instance of pairwise similarity. Existing receptor-based methods focus on identifying meaningful pairwise similarity to a characterized kinase known to bind a given inhibitor. These methods currently do not account for the similarity of a given kinase binding site to other kinase sites that have been characterized <italic>to not bind</italic> the inhibitor in question.</p>
<p>To this end we have developed the Combinatorial Clustering Of Residue Position Subsets (<sc>ccorps</sc>) method. <sc>ccorps</sc> solves the following problem: given a set of sequence-aligned kinase domains (each having <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> available PDB structures) and a per-sequence inhibitor binding <italic>label</italic> (either <bold>binds, does-not-bind or unknown</bold>), predict whether a given kinase domain binds the given inhibitor. Taking a set of kinase binding site residue positions as input, <sc>ccorps</sc> identifies clusters of kinases that share structurally and chemically similar subsets of residue positions. Given a particular kinase with unknown ability to bind a particular inhibitor, <sc>ccorps</sc> identifies kinase binding sites that share similar residue positions that are both known <italic>to bind</italic> and <italic>not to bind</italic> the inhibitor (i.e., it finds evidence both <italic>for</italic> and <italic>against</italic> binding a particular inhibitor). Finally, <sc>ccorps</sc> aggregates the residue position subset similarities for all possible <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-position subsets of the kinase binding site and predicts whether or not the given inhibitor will bind the given uncharacterized kinase binding site.</p>
<p>In addition to the development of <sc>ccorps</sc>, three major results from the analysis of the human kinome are presented here. First, the identification of structural features within the kinase <sc>atp</sc> binding site that are correlated with the ability of certain kinases to bind specific inhibitors is demonstrated. Second, the existence of affinity-correlated structural features that are shared among kinases from distinct families of the kinome are enumerated, shown to be not rare and also to differ depending upon the inhibitor being analyzed. Third, the ability of <sc>ccorps</sc> to predict the affinity for kinases lacking affinity annotations is quantified and compared to a recent structural binding site analysis approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Kinnings1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p><sc>ccorps</sc> is demonstrated to make perfect or near-perfect predictions for the binding ability of 8 of the 38 kinase inhibitors studied, while only having overall poor predictive ability for 1 of the 38 compounds. The performance of <sc>ccorps</sc> for predicting inhibitor binding is compared to the method of Jackson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Kinnings1">[9]</xref> and shown to meet or exceed the predictive ability for the subset of the 38 inhibitors also tested by Jackson et al. We also compare <sc>ccorps</sc> against a sequence-based approach and show that they have complementary strengths. Finally, <sc>ccorps</sc> is shown to identify shared structural features across phylogenetically diverse groups of kinases that are correlated with binding affinity for particular inhibitors; such instances of structural similarity among phylogenetically diverse kinases are also shown to not be rare among kinases. These function-specific structural features may serve as potential starting points for the development of highly specific kinase inhibitors and provide a basis for understanding patterns of inhibition by compounds such as sunitinib that target multiple kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Kim1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>In contrast to existing pairwise binding site comparison approaches, <sc>ccorps</sc> provides an automated way to incorporate the similarity of an uncharacterized binding site to <italic>all</italic> characterized binding site structures, <italic>without</italic> the need to manually select a reference binding site. <sc>ccorps</sc> also accounts for the similarity of an uncharacterized binding site to both kinases that <italic>bind</italic> and those that <italic>do not bind</italic> a particular inhibitor.</p>
<p>The high degree of <sc>atp</sc> binding site similarity shared across the protein kinases has made them a difficult target for which to design highly selective inhibitors. However, by identifying the patterns of local structural similarity among binding sites at the kinome scale, potential off-target interactions may be identifiable at earlier stages of pharmaceutical development and compensated for by further inhibitor modification. This would allow researchers to make predictions of binding affinity for a given ligand across the kinome with less experimental data. Furthermore, the emergence of kinase inhibitor resistance due to binding site position mutations may be better understood through the identification of kinases having similar structural features at the mutated positions. Structural features that are found to be unique to one or a small number of chosen kinases may provide the starting point for designing highly specific inhibitor interactions and therefore highly selective protein kinase inhibitors.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The Combinatorial Clustering Of Residue Position Subsets (<sc>ccorps</sc>) method is designed to solve a very general semi-supervised learning problem:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Find the structural features among the set of proteins that are correlated with a particular set of annotation labels.</italic></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3"><italic>Results</italic></xref> section we focus on the specific problem of predicting ligand binding affinity across the human kinome, we will first describe <sc>ccorps</sc> in its most general form. To solve the general semi-supervised learning problem stated above, <sc>ccorps</sc> requires the following interface:</p>
<p><bold>Input:</bold> an aligned set of protein substructures, where a substructure is defined as a collection of residues not necessarily contiguous in sequence but grouped together in 3D.</p>
<p><bold>Input:</bold> annotation labels for <italic>some</italic> of the protein substructures.</p>
<p><bold>Output:</bold> predicted annotation labels for the <italic>unlabeled</italic> protein substructures.</p>
<p>The per-substructure annotation labels may derived from a wide range of sources <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Ashburner1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Bashton1">[25]</xref>. While this paper focuses on the application of <sc>ccorps</sc> for the prediction of inhibitor binding affinity annotations for the human kinome, <sc>ccorps</sc> generalizes to a variety of annotation prediction problems. The ability of <sc>ccorps</sc> to also identify specificity-determining enzymatic substructures for the prediction of <sc>ec</sc> class annotations for 48 different protein families is outlined in <italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003087.s005">Text S2</xref></italic> and summarized at the end of this section.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Combinatorial clustering of residue position subsets</title>
<p>In order to identify locally similar features among substructures, all <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-sized combinations of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> residue positions (i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> combinations) are generated. For example, given <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, all <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 3-position subsets (1140 subsets) are generated. Then, each of these position subsets are examined one-by-one. Continuing the example, given the position subset <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, all the protein structures are compared by examining the pairwise similarity of <italic>only</italic> positions 7, 13, and 14 in isolation (i.e., disregarding the other 17 positions). 3-position subsets are used in this work because they allow for a unique 3-dimensional lrmsd superposition and are more computationally tractable than subsets of size <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, while still allowing for binding site position decomposition.</p>
<p>The dissimilarity between a pair of substructures is quantified by a combination of structural distance and chemical feature dissimilarity introduced in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Schalon1">[26]</xref>. Specifically, the distance between any two substructures <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is expressed as:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003087.e013"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> term is the pairwise-aligned side chain centroid lrmsd between the substructures. The remaining terms account for differences in the amino acid properties between the substructures <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as quantified by the pharmacophore feature dissimilarity matrix as defined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Schalon1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>For a given set of residue positions, we can calculate a matrix of pairwise distances between substructures using the distance measure defined above. Each row can be thought of as a feature vector that represents how different a protein is with respect to all other proteins in terms of the selected residues. The distance matrix is highly redundant. We use Principal Component Analysis (<sc>pca</sc>) to obtain a low-dimensional embedding. Our previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Bryant1">[27]</xref> showed that this dimensionality reduction typically results in negligible information loss. Some technical details on how we correct for overrepresentation are described in <italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003087.s006">Text S3</xref></italic>. The dimensionality-reduced feature vectors are then clustered to identify sub-groups that share strong structural similarity. The number of clusters is not known beforehand and the number of clusters will vary depending on the set of positions being compared. The Gaussian Mixture Model (<sc>gmm</sc>) clustering method implemented in the mclust package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Fraley1">[28]</xref> was used to identify both the number of clusters present and the cluster memberships for each of the feature vectors.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Selecting Highly-Predictive Clusters (HPCs)</title>
<p>The above feature vector computation and clustering steps are repeated for each possible 3-position subset in order to compare <italic>all</italic> possible local structural features across <italic>all</italic> proteins. Structural variation in most subsets is not expected to be informative, either because no significant variation is present, or because spurious patterns can occur due to chance. However, functionally relevant structural variation can be detected with many different subsets and therefore distinguished from random patterns, as will be shown below.</p>
<p>A cluster that is dominated by one annotation label can be used to predict the label for other structures in that cluster whose annotation is unknown. We therefore call such clusters “highly predictive” (HPC<sc>s</sc>). Identification of HPCs is performed by selecting a minimum threshold for the label purity of clusters, and then selecting all clusters with equal or greater label purity than this minimum as HPC<sc>s</sc>; we used the strictest purity threshold possible (1.0 or 100% purity) in this work (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). In general, purity is calculated for a multiset of labels, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the multiplicity function of a label within the multiset <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the most frequent label within <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. As with the dimensionality reduction mentioned above, we need to correct for overrepresentation bias, the details of which are described in <italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003087.s006">Text S3</xref></italic>. Purity alone does not account for the distinctness of the proteins in the cluster relative to the remainder of the dataset. For example, an hpc for label <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that partially overlaps a second hpc for label <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is less likely to be informative than an <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> cluster greatly separated from the remainder of the dataset. The “degree of separation” or “distinctness” of a cluster was quantified by calculating the cluster silhouette score <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Rousseeuw1">[29]</xref>. The mean silhouette score for a cluster was then used as a further selection criteria for identifying HPC<sc>s</sc> by removing potential HPC<sc>s</sc> with negative average silhouette scores (malformed clusters).</p>

<title>Support Vector Machine-based (SVM) decision boundary</title>
<p>Each time an unlabeled protein falls within an <sc>hpc</sc>, that protein receives a single vote in favor of the majority label associated with the <sc>hpc</sc>. Because a protein can be a member of at most one cluster per <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-position subset, the maximum number of votes any protein can receive is equal to the number of possible <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-position subsets. For any given <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-position subset, it is possible that all clusters are HPC<sc>s</sc> or that no clusters are HPC<sc>s</sc>, depending on how the labels are distributed among the clusters. It is also possible that a protein may never fall within any hpc and therefore would receive zero votes for any label; such proteins are excluded from further analysis after the voting step. In the experiments described below this case rarely occurred. After tallying the label votes across all <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-position subsets, the label predicted for a given structure is determined by an SVM-derived decision boundary as described below.</p>
<p>Given a set of label votes that have been determined for an unlabeled structure, the threshold(s) used to decide which of the two or more label classes to assign to the structure requires the definition of a decision boundary procedure. For example, given a set of annotation labels containing the label classes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (e.g., indicating whether a kinase is known to bind to a given ligand), a simple decision rule may be that given a structure with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> true vote, predict the true label for that structure. However, determining a single threshold for deciding the number of label votes required to classify a structure into one of several classes is difficult to generalize.</p>
<p>Because <sc>ccorps</sc> is a semi-supervised approach, the labels for the training structures are known and can be used to empirically estimate a vote count decision boundary. For example, given structure <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with known label, the number of times that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> appeared in a <bold>false</bold> <sc>hpc</sc> or a <bold>true</bold> <sc>hpc</sc>, across all <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-position subsets, can be calculated using the same approach as for unlabeled structures. The structure <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is then represented by an <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-dimensional vote vector, where each of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> dimensions corresponds to the number of votes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> received for label <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the case of kinase binding affinity, since we only have false and true labels). Application of this procedure to all labeled structures in the dataset provides an empirical basis for calculating a decision boundary in the vote space given the vote distribution for labeled structures. For example, the blue and red points shown in the scatter plot of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g002">Fig. 2</xref> denote the vote vectors for training set substructures with known <bold>true</bold> and <bold>false</bold> labels, respectively.</p>

<title>Decision boundary for label vote vectors computed by SVM.</title>
<p>In the above scatter plot, each point corresponds to the number of true/false votes accumulated by each substructure across all clusterings. Combining the above label vote vectors with the known labels for substructures to train an <sc>svm</sc> (using linear kernel) results in the decision boundary shown as the bold black line. The red and blue regions (right and left sides of the boundary, respectively) denote the values for which the predicted label will be <bold>false</bold> and <bold>true</bold>, respectively. Blue points indicate substructures known to have the <bold>true</bold> label while red points denote the <bold>false</bold> label.

<p>Given the vote vectors calculated for all labeled training set substructures in the dataset, it is then possible to train any number of classifiers in order to determine a decision boundary. To compute a decision boundary in the vote space for classifying unlabeled proteins, <sc>svm</sc>s were selected in this paper. First, an <sc>svm</sc> (linear kernel) is trained using the vote vectors of labeled training set substructures. For example, the decision boundary determined by training an <sc>svm</sc> on vote vectors is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g002">Fig. 2</xref> as the bold, black line. Next, for an unlabeled substructure with a given vote vector, the label for the substructure can be predicted by determining which side of the <sc>svm</sc> decision hyperplane the unlabeled structure falls within. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, test vote vectors falling within the blue region will be predicted as having the true label and those falling within the red region, the <bold>false</bold> label.

<title>Dataset</title>
<p>In order to enable the kinome-scale analysis of the protein kinase <sc>atp</sc> binding site presented here, a dataset of protein kinase binding site structures was assembled and then mapped to the affinity dataset of Karaman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Karaman1">[31]</xref>. Karaman et al. studied the affinity of 38 kinase inhibitors across 317 kinases and was one of the most comprehensive studies of kinase inhibitor selectivity at that time. Mapping a structure-affinity-phylogeny dataset by further incorporating the kinome family labeling of Manning et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Manning1">[2]</xref> has enabled the incorporation of all available crystallographic structures of the <sc>atp</sc> binding site and the analysis of shared structural features between major kinase families that is presented later in this paper.</p>

<p>The kinome structural dataset was constructed from all structures (domains) annotated as belonging to <sc>pfam</sc>:Pkinase and <sc>pfam</sc>:Pkinase_Tyr (all e pk domains, apks excluded) in release 25 of <sc>pfam</sc> (2154 total domains before filtering). After the binding site residue positions to analyze were selected, as detailed in the following section, and proteins having one or more gaps at those positions were excluded, a total of 1958 structures remained.

<p>Several informative observations regarding kinase structural diversity and its association to inhibitor binding affinity can be made by further examination of the substructure clustering shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>. Immediately upon examination of the substructure clustering it can be noted that multiple distinct clusters of kinases exist. This observation alone indicates that the 3-position substructure that resulted in this clustering is highly diverse among kinase binding sites. Conversely, the presence of a single large cluster would indicate that the 3-position substructure was structurally conserved, exhibiting little variance across the kinome; indeed instances of clusterings with a single dominating cluster were also observed for some 3-position subsets. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>, where one randomly selected representative substructure is shown for each of the 21 clusters identified by <sc>ccorps</sc>, both the geometry and residue types vary significantly for this 3-position subset.</p>
<p>By incorporating the affinity annotation labels for a particular inhibitor, further observations can be made about the association between the 3-position substructure shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g004">Fig. 4A</xref> and the kinases capable of binding that inhibitor. For example, mapping the affinity annotation labels for the inhibitor flavopiridol onto the substructure clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>) reveals that some of the clusters consist of only a single annotation label while others are a mixture of labels. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>, kinases capable of binding flavopiridol are colored red (<bold>true</bold> label), kinases incapable of binding flavopiridol are colored black (<bold>false</bold> label) and kinases lacking affinity annotation are colored white (undefined label). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>, multiple clusters of purely <bold>true</bold> labels exist and are considered to be HPC<sc>s</sc> by <sc>ccorps</sc>.</p>
<p>The existence of true-only clusters indicates that the 3-positions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g004">Fig. 4A</xref> are a distinguishing structural feature for identifying kinases that bind flavopiridol. More interestingly, however, is the fact that multiple, structurally distinct versions of the same 3-position substructure exist for different kinases that all are capable of binding flavopiridol. This result is significant because it indicates that across the kinome there are different structural motifs that are associated with binding flavopiridol, as opposed to a single, shared structural motif across all flavopiridol-binding kinases. The ability to identify multiple structural motifs that can each be associated with inhibitor binding is a strength of <sc>ccorps</sc>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the existence of clusters containing only kinases <italic>incapable</italic> of binding flavopiridol can also be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>. These HPC<sc>s</sc> are also informative because they identify particular structural versions of the 3-position substructure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g004">Fig. 4A</xref> that are all incapable of binding flavopiridol. Finally, clusters consisting of a mixture of kinases that are both capable and incapable of binding flavopiridol can be identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>. For kinases in these clusters, the 3-position substructure is not a distinguishing feature of flavopiridol-binding ability.</p>
<p>Finally, while flavopiridol is discussed in detail here for illustration, the same analysis was computed by <sc>ccorps</sc> for each of the 38 different inhibitors within the affinity dataset. For each of the inhibitors, the affinity labels can be mapped separately onto the same substructure clustering as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g005">Fig. 5</xref>. However, it should be noted that no information is shared between the results for different inhibitors in this work; that is, each inhibitor is computed in a fully separate <sc>ccorps</sc> computation (the substructure clusterings do not vary, just the annotation labels).</p>

<p>Examination of the affinity-annotated substructure clusterings shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g005">Fig. 5</xref> reveals that the set of clusters which are HPC<sc>s</sc> varies greatly depending on the inhibitor considered. While the flavopiridol-annotated substructure clustering contains multiple HPC<sc>s</sc> for both <bold>true</bold> and <bold>false</bold> labels, the correspondingly annotated clustering for other inhibitors, such as VX-745, PI-103 and imatinib, contain only <bold>false</bold> HPC<sc>s</sc>. This result demonstrates that the substructures that are informative of inhibitor binding are inherently inhibitor-specific. That is, a subset of binding site positions that are predictive for one inhibitor are not necessarily predictive for another inhibitor.</p>
<p>It is important to note that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g004">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g005">Fig. 5</xref> represent the same clustering for just <italic>one</italic> 3-residue substructure. However, <italic>all</italic> 2925 clusterings are computed and <italic>all</italic> HPC<sc>s</sc> detected in these clusterings are used to predict binding affinity. The particular three-residue subset shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g004">Fig. 4A</xref> was chosen because the resulting clustering exhibits a number of illustrative features. First, the clustering is relative “clean” with well-separated clusters. Second, it contains highly predictive clusters for both binding and not binding to flavopiridol (the ocher cluster in the top-left and the red cluster in the bottom right of figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, respectively). None of these features are essential for predicting binding affinity; all automatically selected HPC<sc>s</sc> in all clusterings are used to predict affinity, each casting one “vote.”</p>

<title>Phylogenetically diverse HPCs</title>
<p>Numerous instances of cross-family affinity for both type I and II kinase inhibitors have been identified, as was clearly illustrated by the kinome affinity maps created by Karaman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Karaman1">[31]</xref>. It is important to identify structural features shared among phylogenetically diverse kinases that share affinity for a particular inhibitor, because they provide a basis for reasoning about inhibitor cross-reactivity when overall sequence similarity will be low. Furthermore, by identifying these shared structural features, it may be possible to rationally re-engineer the specificity of inhibitors by avoiding the targeting of these features, since they are not unique to the intended kinase target. In order to identify the number of instances of cross-family structural features that can be associated with specific inhibitor binding, the distribution of substructure clusters across all 3-position subsets was analyzed.</p>
<p>Each individual cluster, across all 2925 clusterings and all 38 inhibitors, was evaluated to calculate the purity of both affinity labels and family-level phylogenetic labels. For example, a cluster containing 3 distinct kinase sequences with affinity labels <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and family labels {<sc>agc</sc>, <sc>camk</sc>, <sc>tk</sc>} would have an affinity purity of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and a phylogenetic purity of 0.33. By plotting the affinity and phylogenetic purity scores of each cluster (separately for each inhibitor) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g006">Fig. 6</xref>, the distribution of clusters across the spectrum of possible scores can be evaluated. Note that only the clusters having a true label majority are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g007">Fig. 7</xref> (i.e., a true label majority is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> purity in the true label). Additionally, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003087-t002">Table 2</xref> lists per inhibitor statistics for cluster distributions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g007">Fig. 7</xref>.</p>

<title>Distribution of phylogenetic and affinity purity cluster scores for all 38 inhibitors.</title>
<p>As can be seen in the case of drugs such as imatinib and lapatinib, very few clusters that have a majority of <bold>true</bold> labels were identified, yet clusters of phylogenetically diverse structures all having <bold>true</bold> labels can be identified. Staurosporine exhibits a reflected distribution relative to the other drugs, because due the nature of its non-selectivity across the kinome, instances of phylogenetically distant structures that exhibit Staurosporine affinity are common.

Conversely, a point at the coordinates <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> indicates a cluster that contains only structures from one phylogenetic (family-level) branch but contains an equal proportion of <bold>true</bold> and <bold>false</bold> affinity labels; that is, a case where structurally similar, closely related (phylogenetically) structures have different affinities for VX-680.

<p>In order to build intuition for interpreting the cluster distributions, the cluster distribution for VX-680 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g007">Fig. 7</xref>) is examined in more detail because it is representative of the distribution for many of the other inhibitors. As listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003087-t002">Table 2</xref>, 23,495 clusters were identified by <sc>ccorps</sc> that have <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e063" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> purity in the true label for VX-680 (hereafter referred to as <bold>true</bold>-majority clusters). Only these <bold>true</bold>-majority clusters are plotted in the cluster distribution shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g007">Fig. 7</xref>, meaning the minimum “affinity purity” displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g007">Fig. 7</xref> is 0.5 by definition (because only 2 different affinity labels exist, <bold>true</bold> and <bold>false</bold>).</p>
<p>As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g007">Fig. 7</xref>, the vast majority of clusters identified by <sc>ccorps</sc> have low affinity purity as well as low phylogenetic purity. This is to be expected because highly conserved portions of the kinase <sc>atp</sc> binding site are known to exist. Structural features that consist of conserved residue positions will be common to many kinases from different families due to the fact that these positions are so heavily conserved, which explains the low phylogenetic purity of these clusters. Furthermore, these conserved features are unlikely to be correlated with the affinity for a particular inhibitor because most inhibitors have been engineered to not have broad cross-reactivity across the kinome. Staurosporine is an exception as it is a very non-selective inhibitor due to its interaction with highly conserved binding site features; the cluster distribution corresponding to staurosporine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g006">Fig. 6</xref>) is markedly different from the other inhibitors with most clusters having high affinity purity across a range of phylogenetic purity values.</p>
<p>Examination of the extremes of the VX-680 cluster distribution reveals further insights into the frequency of structural similar features among kinases with different degrees of sequence similarity. Clusters having a phylogenetic purity of 1.0 (i.e., all proteins belong to the same family) but having low affinity purity exist, and for VX-680 276 such clusters were identified by <sc>ccorps</sc>. This observation is interesting because it illustrates that kinases sharing sequence similarity (relative to kinases outside the family) have multiple common structural features that are not informative of the ability of these kinases to bind VX-680 and are therefore unlikely to be good features to target in design studies. Because <sc>ccorps</sc> only incorporates clusters with high affinity purity (i.e., HPC<sc>s</sc>), these conserved structural features that are not indicative of VX-680 binding are ignored by <sc>ccorps</sc> when predicting affinity for unannotated kinases. This observation can also be made for each of the other inhibitors as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g006">Fig. 6</xref>.</p>
<p>Another interesting extreme of the VX-680 cluster distribution to examine is the existence of HPC<sc>s</sc> that are phylogenetically diverse. The HPC<sc>s</sc> selected by <sc>ccorps</sc> correspond to the right-most column of points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g007">Fig. 7</xref>; these clusters all have an affinity purity of 1.0 for VX-680 and therefore contain <italic>only</italic> structures with known VX-680 affinity. As can be noted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g007">Fig. 7</xref>, HPC<sc>s</sc> exist at a range of phylogenetic purity values. <sc>ccorps</sc> identified a total of 2707 HPC<sc>s</sc> for VX-680, and 1786 (66%) of these HPC<sc>s</sc> contain proteins belonging to two or more distinct kinase families. This result demonstrates that <sc>ccorps</sc> is capable of identifying cross-family structural features that are associated with VX-680 binding. Furthermore, this result is not unique to VX-680. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g006">Fig. 6</xref> and tabulated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003087-t002">Table 2</xref>, cross-family structural features associated with inhibitor binding were identified for all of the inhibitors tested with the exception of GW-2580, for which no true-majority clusters were identified.</p>
<p>Examination of the cluster distributions across each of the inhibitors reveals a wide range of observations. While many inhibitors have a cluster distribution similar to that of VX-680, for some inhibitors <sc>ccorps</sc> identified relatively fewer true-majority clusters. For example, only 133 clusters with affinity purity <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>0.5 were identified by <sc>ccorps</sc> for SB-431542 and all of these happen to be HPC<sc>s</sc>. However, even among this relatively low number of HPC<sc>s</sc>, 69 (52%) of the clusters contain kinases from two or more families. As demonstrated by the corresponding distributions for all 38 inhibitors in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g006">Fig. 6</xref>, such shared structural similarity is not rare.</p>

<title>Predicting kinase-inhibitor binding</title>
<p>The approach used by <sc>ccorps</sc> to classify an unlabeled kinase is to identify the cluster to which the unlabeled kinase belongs. If the associated cluster is an hpc, the label for the hpc is transferred to the unlabeled kinase. Non-informative clusters containing a mix of labels (non-HPC<sc>s</sc>) do not contribute to the label prediction process. This “co-clustering” analysis approach is repeated for all of the 2925 substructure clusterings and the final label prediction for an unlabeled kinase is then selected as detailed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2"><italic>Methods</italic></xref>.</p>
<p>The ability of <sc>ccorps</sc> to predict the binding of each inhibitor for proteins within the annotated structural dataset was assessed using the cross-fold validation approach described in the following section. For each of the 38 inhibitor annotation label sets, an independent evaluation of <sc>ccorps</sc> was performed. No information was shared among the evaluations in order to validate the predictive ability of <sc>ccorps</sc> to identify structural features predictive of the binding ability of each inhibitor independently.</p>
<sec id="s3d1">
<title>Cross-fold validation</title>
<p>To assess the utility of HPC<sc>s</sc> for identifying substructure positions indicative of functional specialization, cross-fold validation was performed for each family within our dataset. The structures within a protein family were first divided into 70% sequence identity groups (<sc>nr</sc>-clusters) so that no protein in a test set shares <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e065" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>70% sequence identity with any protein in the training set. The sequence identity is computed over the domain (i.e., not the whole sequence nor just the binding site). Because of the non-uniform distribution of structures across the <sc>nr</sc>-clusters, the number of structures in the test set varies with each fold. In each fold, structures that were part of the test set are marked with label unknown, and are disregarded when calculating the purity of clusters (defined in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2"><italic>Methods</italic></xref>) during the <sc>hpc</sc> selection step, just as the structures with truly unknown label. Finally, standard <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e066" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-fold cross validation was performed with each of the <sc>nr</sc>-clusters each being one fold (i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sc>nr</sc>-clusters<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e068" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Given the <sc>nr</sc>-clusters-based fold partitioning above, the training set is used to identify HPC<sc>s</sc> and train an <sc>svm</sc>-based classifier to predict labels for kinases in the test set.</p>

<title>Prediction performance</title>
<p>For each of the 38 inhibitors included in the affinity dataset, <sc>ccorps</sc> was used to predict the set of kinases able to bind to that inhibitor. The performance of <sc>ccorps</sc> was assessed for each inhibitor, independently, by computing the Receiver Operator Characteristic (<sc>roc</sc>) curve for the set of predictions, which evaluates the sensitivity (# true positives/(# true positives + # false negatives)) at each specificity (# true negatives/(# true negatives + # false positives)) value. The <sc>roc</sc> curves for the predictor constructed by <sc>ccorps</sc> are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g008">Fig. 8</xref> for each inhibitor and the Area Under Curve (<sc>auc</sc>) for each roc curve is listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003087-t003">Table 3</xref>. Additionally, the Precision-Recall (<sc>pr</sc>) curve for each inhibitor can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003087-g009">Fig. 9</xref>. The <sc>pr</sc> curve plots the precision (# true positives/(# true positives + # false positives)) versus the recall (equivalent to sensitivity).</p>

<p>In order to make a direct comparison of the performance of <sc>ccorps</sc> to the work of Jackson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Kinnings1">[9]</xref>, another performance measure, the enrichment factor, was also computed per inhibitor tested.

The enrichment factor at 5% (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) for each inhibitor is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003087-t003">Table 3</xref> and where available, the corresponding <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e094" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values from Jackson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Kinnings1">[9]</xref> are listed alongside. It should be noted that the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e095" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values are <italic>not directly</italic> comparable between <sc>ccorps</sc> and Jackson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Kinnings1">[9]</xref> as listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003087-t003">Table 3</xref>, due to the fact that the maximum possible enrichment (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e096" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) for a given inhibitor is dataset-dependent, and the dataset presented in this work is larger both in number of structures compared and the number of per-inhibitor affinity annotations. The ratio of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e097" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e098" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a slightly better basis for comparison, since it normalizes for differences in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e099" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003087-t003">Table 3</xref>, <sc>ccorps</sc> achieves high predictive performance across the 38 inhibitors tested. As quantified by <sc>roc</sc> <sc>auc</sc> <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e100" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <sc>ccorps</sc> achieved perfect or near-perfect predictive ability for 8 of the 38 inhibitors: AMG-706, CHIR-265, CP-690550, CP-724714, Lapatinib, PTK-787, Roscovitine and SB-431542. Furthermore, <sc>ccorps</sc> is demonstrated to be very competitive with the method by Jackson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Kinnings1">[9]</xref> as also shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003087-t003">Table 3</xref>. In the case of Lapatinib, <sc>ccorps</sc> significantly improved on Jackson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Kinnings1">[9]</xref>. Comparison of enrichment scores ignores another important difference: with our method no reference structure needs to be selected. As is clear from Jackson et al.'s result for imatinib, the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e101" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> enrichment value can change by a factor of 2 depending on which reference structure is chosen.</p>
<p>Finally, in order to evaluate the contribution of the local structural features over sequence information alone, a “binding site sequence”-based approach was implemented (see <italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003087.s006">Text S3</xref></italic>) and used to predict inhibitor binding for the full 38 inhibitor dataset presented here. The prediction performance for the binding site sequence-based approach is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003087-t003">Table 3</xref> in terms of roc and pr auc as well as enrichment score. The binding site sequence-based approach outperformed <sc>ccorps</sc> by a significant margin for several inhibitors: Staurosporine, Sunitinib, SU-14813, PKC-412, JNJ-7706621, VX-680. These 6 inhibitors on which <sc>ccorps</sc> significantly underperforms are 6 of the top 7 inhibitors in terms of number of kinases inhibited. That is, the aforementioned 6 inhibitors are relatively promiscuous and tend to interact with a large number of kinases across several kinase families. Furthermore these same 6 inhibitors also have the 6 highest hpc counts across the entire dataset. This result indicates that <sc>ccorps</sc> has difficulty predicting inhibitor binding for broad spectrum inhibitors and is discussed further in the following section. In the cases of JNJ-7706621 and VX-680, the performance difference is only significant in terms of the enrichment score. <sc>ccorps</sc> significantly outperforms the binding site sequence-based approach for several narrow spectrum inhibitors including, but not limited to: Lapatinib, CP-724714, CP-690550, SB-431542, VX-745. Overall, when <sc>ccorps</sc> performed better than the sequence-based approach the magnitude of the performance difference tended to be larger than when it performed worse. It should also be noted that the standard deviations of the <italic>differences</italic> between in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e102" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e103" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and enrichment score (0.21, 0.33, and 0.36, respectively) highlight that the two methods have complementary strengths. We repeated the cross-fold validation using 50% sequence identity (instead of 70%) to determine the folds. This makes the prediction problem harder for both <sc>ccorps</sc> and the sequence-based approach (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003087.s008">Table S2</xref>). The mean performance is slightly lower for both, but the standard deviations of the differences in performance remain the same, reinforcing the observation that <sc>ccorps</sc> and the sequence-based approach have complementary strengths.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Identifying structural features of the kinase binding site that directly or indirectly mediate the binding ability of inhibitors is a significant component in developing and optimizing kinase inhibitors. Given the increasingly large number of available kinase structures, kinome-wide comparative binding site analysis is now possible as has been demonstrated here. By combining available structure data with large-scale inhibitor affinity data, it becomes possible to automatically learn the features of the kinase binding site that predict the binding ability of a given inhibitor. This is useful for predicting whether kinases whose binding affinity is unknown will bind to a given drug, but, perhaps more importantly, knowing the structural basis for binding to a particular drug can be exploited in the design of analogs that bind more strongly and have fewer off-target interactions. This information could further improve well-established structure-based computer-aided drug design methods, where it is challenging to develop reliable models for the contributions of individual interactions or groups of interactions between inhibitor and protein to binding affinity.</p>
<p><sc>ccorps</sc> has been demonstrated here to be capable of learning the features of the kinase binding site that are informative of inhibitor binding across a set of 38 inhibitors. Furthermore, the binding site features selected by <sc>ccorps</sc> as informative of inhibitor activity/inactivity have been shown to be interesting in and of themselves, for example, the existence of residue triad clusters that are unique in kinases capable of binding a given inhibitor but that exist within kinases from different major branches of the kinase family tree. The identification of such shared binding site features among sequence-diverse kinases is an important contribution for structure-based methods because of the relative difficulty of identifying small subsets of sequence non-contiguous but spatially compact positions that are correlated with a given indicator, such as inhibitor binding ability. The complete set of 41,964 true-majority HPC<sc>s</sc> that contain kinases from two or more of the kinome families as defined by Manning et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Manning1">[2]</xref> is provided as <italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003087.s003">Dataset S1</xref></italic> to facilitate further analysis of these phylogenetically diverse structural features that distinguish kinases binding each of the 38 inhibitors.</p>
<p>As was demonstrated here, <sc>ccorps</sc> is capable of incorporating all of the available protein kinase structure data, so as to operate at the kinome scale, and then using this data to construct highly accurate predictors of kinase affinity for a variety of different small molecule inhibitors. While <sc>ccorps</sc> relies upon the aggregation of structural similarity that coincides with affinity similarity to build predictors, the individual instances may be informative in and of themselves. Further analysis of the vast number of structurally similar features shared among phylogenetically distant kinases may provide additional insights into the structural mechanisms of inhibitor recognition occurring across the kinome.</p>
<p>The existence of affinity datasets containing structurally similar inhibitors, that differ by only one or a small number of chemical substitutions, provides the opportunity to associate specific structural features identified by <sc>ccorps</sc> with specific inhibitor pharmacophores. A recent approach by Milletti and Hermann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Milletti1">[6]</xref> has been demonstrated to identify specific chemical transformations that can be associated with selectivity differences. In future work we will seek to further incorporate this cross-inhibitor level of analysis and broaden the scale of the structure dataset by further incorporating newly available kinase crystallographic structures.</p>
<p>Several potential optimizations of <sc>ccorps</sc> may increase its inhibitor binding prediction performance on broad spectrum inhibitors. For the 38 inhibitor dataset analyzed in this paper, the number of HPC<sc>s</sc> identified was well correlated with the number of kinases inhibited (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e104" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). That is, <sc>ccorps</sc> tended to perform less well on inhibitors for which large numbers of HPC<sc>s</sc> were identified. Developing an approach to weighting and ranking the large number of HPC<sc>s</sc> generated by broad spectrum inhibitors may aid in increasing the predictive performance of <sc>ccorps</sc> for these inhibitors. For example, ranking HPC<sc>s</sc> by the mean within-cluster affinity (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003087.e105" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) would more heavily weight structural features correlated with strong binders and decrease the impact of structural features only correlated weak binders. Such an approach would help to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of HPC<sc>s</sc> when the number of HPC<sc>s</sc> identified grows large. As our results showed, there are cases where <sc>ccorps</sc> significantly outperforms a sequence-based method, but there also cases where the reverse is true. While this paper focused on quantifying the extent at which structure alone can be used to predict binding affinity, for practical usage we envision that structure- and sequence-based methods are used in tandem.</p>
<p>A major advantage of the work presented is the generality of <sc>ccorps</sc> to detect structurally distinguishing features for a wide variety of applications beyond the kinase inhibitor affinity analysis presented here. No assumptions regarding the nature of the annotation labels nor of the alignment type are made at any point by <sc>ccorps</sc>. <sc>ccorps</sc> provides a general framework for automatically learning structural features that distinguish proteins having different annotation labels. This allows the incorporation of purely structure-based alignments, such as those available in databases like <sc>homstrad</sc> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Mizuguchi1">[33]</xref> or even local structure alignments such as those identified by motif/template search algorithms (e.g., <sc>soippa</sc> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Xie1">[34]</xref>, and LabelHash, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Moll1">[35]</xref>). Other sources of annotation labels, including Gene Ontology (GO, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003087-Ashburner1">[14]</xref>) terms, binding affinity for a given molecule and ligation state can be incorporated as-is with <sc>ccorps</sc> without modification to the method.</p>
