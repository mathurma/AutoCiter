<p>Gephyrin, the principal scaffolding protein at inhibitory synapses, needs to be palmitoylated in order to cluster and to assemble functional synapses.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Postsynaptic scaffolding proteins regulate coordinated neurotransmission by anchoring and clustering receptors and adhesion molecules. Gephyrin is the major instructive molecule at inhibitory synapses, where it clusters glycine as well as major subsets of GABA type A receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs). Here, we identified palmitoylation of gephyrin as an important mechanism of strengthening GABAergic synaptic transmission, which is regulated by GABA<sub>A</sub>R activity. We mapped palmitoylation to Cys212 and Cys284, which are critical for both association of gephyrin with the postsynaptic membrane and gephyrin clustering. We identified DHHC-12 as the principal palmitoyl acyltransferase that palmitoylates gephyrin. Furthermore, gephyrin pamitoylation potentiated GABAergic synaptic transmission, as evidenced by an increased amplitude of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents. Consistently, inhibiting gephyrin palmitoylation either pharmacologically or by expression of palmitoylation-deficient gephyrin reduced the gephyrin cluster size. In aggregate, our study reveals that palmitoylation of gephyrin by DHHC-12 contributes to dynamic and functional modulation of GABAergic synapses.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Efficient signal transmission at synapses is essential for higher brain functions. Inhibitory signaling in the brain takes place primarily at GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid)-ergic synapses. GABA type A receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) are clustered at the postsynaptic side by a scaffold composed of the peripheral membrane protein gephyrin. We demonstrate that gephyrin is modulated by palmitoylation, a reversible posttranslational fatty acid modification. Palmitoylation facilitates the membrane association of gephyrin and is therefore essential for normal clustering of gephyrin at GABAergic synapses. Reciprocally, palmitoylation of gephyrin is regulated by GABA<sub>A</sub>R activity. Of the 23 known palmitoyl transferases that catalyze the palmitoylation of proteins in human cells, we identified one enzyme, DHHC-12, to specifically modify gephyrin. Our results provide a new aspect to the posttranslational control of synaptic plasticity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Regulated signal transmission in the central nervous system is essential for higher brain function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Eichler1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Turrigiano1">[2]</xref>. Inhibitory signaling in the brain primarily takes place at glycinergic and GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid)-ergic synapses. Glycine receptors and a subset of GABA type A receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) are clustered at the synapse by a scaffold of the peripheral membrane protein gephyrin as a major postsynaptic component <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Tyagarajan1">[3]</xref>. Loss of gephyrin leads to the loss of postsynaptic glycine and GABA<sub>A</sub>R clustering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Kneussel1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Feng1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>Dynamic regulation of the number of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs at synapses provides a key mechanism for functional plasticity of inhibitory synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Luscher1">[7]</xref>. Recently, it was shown that gephyrin exerts a major influence on experience-dependent plasticity of inhibitory synapses <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Chen1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-vanVersendaal1">[9]</xref>. Gephyrin phosphorylation has been demonstrated to contribute to functional regulation of GABAergic synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Tyagarajan2">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Tyagarajan3">[11]</xref>. Phosphorylation of serine residues 268 and 270 modulate the density and size of gephyrin clusters in hippocampal neurons and hence contribute to synaptic plasticity. However, little is known about the mechanisms controlling the association of gephyrin with the postsynaptic membrane.</p>
<p>Lipid modification of proteins serves as a major mechanism controlling cellular localization and association of proteins with membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Resh1">[12]</xref>. In particular, reversible palmitoylation has emerged as the most frequent lipid modification of synaptic proteins, with diverse effects on protein trafficking, neuronal development, and synaptic plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Fukata1">[13]</xref>. Palmitoylation has most extensively been studied in the context of proteins that function at excitatory synapses. Among these, reversible palmitoylation of the scaffolding protein PSD-95 has been implicated in activity-dependent plasticity of excitatory synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-ElHusseini1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Fukata2">[15]</xref>. In mammalian cells, palmitoylation is catalyzed by a family of 23 palmitoyl transferases that share a conserved DHHC (Asp-His-His-Cys) motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Fukata3">[16]</xref>. One of these, DHHC-3/GODZ, has been identified as a palmitoyl transferase of the γ2 subunit of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs that regulates the formation and function of GABAergic synapse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Keller1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Fang1">[18]</xref>. However, little is known about the role of other palmitoylated substrates at inhibitory synapses.</p>
<p>A recent proteomic approach identified gephyrin as a potential palmitoylated substrate at inhibitory synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Kang1">[19]</xref>. Here, we confirm and extend this finding. In particular we show that gephyrin is palmitoylated <italic>in vivo</italic>, which determines whether gephyrin is membrane bound or soluble and thus regulates the size of postsynaptic gephyrin clusters. Functional studies in neurons identified DHHC-12 as the primary palmitoyl transferase. Palmitoylation levels are regulated by GABA<sub>A</sub>R activity. Our results identify palmitoylation of gephyrin as a key mechanism underlying functional plasticity of GABAergic synapses.</p>

<p>Gephyrin anchors major subsets of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in the postsynaptic membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Tyagarajan1">[3]</xref>. We performed ultracentrifugation-based subcellular fractionation of mouse brain lysates and found gephyrin mainly in the pellet fraction, demonstrating that it is mostly associated with membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g001">Figure 1a</xref>). Furthermore, gephyrin was able to “float” in Triton X-100 solubilized mouse brain synaptosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g001">Figure 1b</xref>). Detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) mainly consist of cholesterol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Schuck1">[20]</xref>. Upon solubilization of DRMs with the cholesterol-complexing agent saponin, gephyrin no longer floated in sucrose gradients, indicating that it is likely lipid-modified.</p>

(e) Gephyrin palmitoylation status in the cytosolic (S2) compared to synaptosomal (P2) fraction analyzed by the ABE assay. Lanes of the top panel have been spliced from the same membrane. Volumes of the S2/P2 fractions have been adjusted to similar amounts of gephyrin (right panel). Experiment was performed with two individual synaptosomal preparations with essentially the same results.</p>

<p>Protein palmitoylation is implicated in targeting proteins to DRMs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Levental1">[21]</xref>. Metabolic labeling of gephyrin-expressing Sf9 cells with the palmitate analogue 17-octadecynoic acid (17-ODYA) followed by the application of click-chemistry and affinity-purification revealed prominent gephyrin palmitoylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g001">Figure 1c</xref>). In addition, native neuronal gephyrin was found to be palmitoylated, as shown by acyl-biotin exchange (ABE) assays of cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g001">Figure 1d</xref>). Treatment of neurons with 50 µM of the DHHC enzyme blocker 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) significantly reduced the palmitoylation level of gephyrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g001">Figure 1d</xref>). To assess the subcellular localization of palmitoylated gephyrin, we fractionated crude brain homogenates into synaptosome-enriched and cytosolic fractions, adjusted the volume of samples to process similar amounts of gephyrin, and performed ABE assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g001">Figure 1e</xref>). Similar to PSD-95, gephyrin was found to be palmitoylated mainly in the synaptosomal fraction, indicating that it is lipid-modified at synapses.</p>

<title>Palmitoylation of Gephyrin Is Crucial for Normal Postsynaptic Clustering</title>
<p>We next investigated the role of gephyrin palmitoylation with respect to its localization and clustering at inhibitory synapses. Co-immunostaining of hippocampal neurons at 14 DIV indicated co-localization of gephyrin cluster immunoreactivity with punctate immunoreactivity for the presynaptic terminal marker vesicular, GABA transporter (VGAT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g002">Figure 2a</xref>). In control neurons, gephyrin clusters were extensively colocalized with VGAT, whereas upon inhibition of palmitoylation with 2-BP, we frequently observed nonsynaptic gephyrin clusters (control, 90.71%±3.73%; 2-BP, 57.61%±4.0% gephyrin co-localization with VGAT; <italic>n</italic> = 3 cultures; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g002">Figure 2a,b</xref>). Although the size of gephyrin clusters was significantly reduced (70.35%±6.32% of control gephyrin; <italic>n</italic> = 3 cultures; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001), 2-BP had no effect on the size of VGAT puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g002">Figure 2c,d</xref>). In line with these results, cell surface biotinylation of 2-BP–treated neurons revealed significantly decreased surface expression of GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunits representative of synaptic receptors (α1, β2/3, and γ2), whereas the α5 subunit, representative of mainly extrasynaptic receptors that do not associate with gephyrin, was unaffected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001908.s002">Figure S1</xref>). Gephyrin complexes in homogenates from control and 2-BP–incubated neurons remained around ∼400–700 kDa in size, as demonstrated by size exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001908.s003">Figure S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001908.s009">Text S1</xref>), suggesting that palmitoylation does not affect gephyrin oligomerization and thus does not explain the decrease in gephyrin cluster size upon inhibition of palmitoylation.</p>

<p>As gephyrin oligomers, which we previously characterized as hexamers and nonamers, seem to function as stable and individual units <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Herweg1">[22]</xref>, we wondered how much gephyrin is palmitoylated in neurons. Therefore, increasing amounts of lysate were taken before affinity purification of ABE-processed brain samples and quantitated along with affinity-purified bead eluates by Western blotting. Quantification of the band intensities revealed that 7.5%±0.5% of gephyrin was palmitoylated; by comparison, the proportion of palmitoylated PSD-95 that does not form oligomers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001908.s003">Figure S2</xref>) was significantly higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g002">Figure 2e</xref>).</p>

<title>Palmitoylation of Gephyrin at Cys212 and Cys284 Is Essential for Clustering at GABAergic Synapses</title>
<p>Gephyrin has a modular structure that is composed of an N-terminal G-, a central C-, and C-terminal E-domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Fritschy1">[23]</xref>. To identify functionally relevant residues in gephyrin that are palmitoylated, we focused on surface-exposed cysteine residues on the G- and E-domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Schwarz1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Kim1">[25]</xref> and the three Cys residues within the C-domain. This reduced the number of potentially palmitoylated residues from 12 to 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g003">Figure 3a</xref>). Among these, only Cys212 and Cys284 in the C-domain were predicted as potentially palmitoylated by the CSS-Palm 3.0 program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Ren1">[26]</xref>. All eight Cys residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g003">Figure 3a</xref>) were replaced by serine, either individually or in combination, using GFP-tagged gephyrin-GC and full-length gephyrin constructs—hereafter termed “number of residue”Geph(-GC). Upon expression of the Cys variants in HEK293 cells and analyses of palmitoylation by ABE assays, we found reduced gephyrin palmitoylation for 212Geph and 284Geph and the strongest reduction in gephyrin palmitoylation in the Cys212/Cys284 double mutant variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g003">Figures 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001908.s004">S3</xref>). To confirm that Cys212 and 284 are palmitoylated, we performed mass spectrometry analysis of ABE-processed gephyrin expressed in Sf9 cells. We identified biotin moieties selectively on Cys212- and Cys284-containing peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g003">Figure 3c</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we compared the synaptic clustering properties of the eight GFP-tagged cysteine-to-serine gephyrin variants and a wild-type (WT) construct in transfected primary hippocampal neurons. Among the eight mutant variants, only 212Geph and 284Geph showed a significant decrease in gephyrin cluster sizes, and the effect of these mutations was additive in the 212,284Geph variant (212Geph, 68.45%±1.76%; 284Geph, 84.58%±2.14%; 212,284Geph, 57.34%±1.79% of gephyrin-GFP; <italic>n</italic> = 5 cultures; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). All other variants were indistinguishable from the WT gephyrin construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g003">Figure 3d</xref>). The total fluorescence of 212,284Geph clusters was significantly reduced to 41.8%±1.5%, suggesting 212,284Geph clusters contained less than half the number of gephyrin molecules compared to clusters formed by WT gephyrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g003">Figure 3e,f</xref>). The fact that the cluster size of 212,284Geph was not further decreased by 2-BP treatment (58.11%±2.34% of gephyrin-GFP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g003">Figure 3d</xref>) suggests that (i) residues Cys212 and Cys284 are palmitoylated in neurons, (ii) clustering of transfected palmitoylation-deficient gephyrin remains unaffected by endogenous gephyrin, and (iii) gephyrin clustering is unaffected by palmitoylation-independent effects of 2-BP.</p>

<p>We hypothesized that mislocalized, nonsynaptic gephyrin clusters were not associated with the postsynaptic membrane and had instead accumulated in the soluble fraction. To test this idea, we fractionated 2-BP–treated and control primary neuron homogenates into soluble cytosolic and membrane-bound fractions. Compared to control cultures where gephyrin was mainly found in the insoluble pellet, 2-BP–incubated cultures revealed gephyrin enriched in the supernatant fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g004">Figure 4f</xref>). Additionally, we quantified the ratio of clustered to cytoplasmic gephyrin in gephyrin-GFP and 212,284Geph-transfected neurons by line scan analyses of confocal micrographs. 212,284Geph showed strong fluorescence in the dendritic cytoplasm, which was not seen for gephyrin-GFP or endogenous gephyrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g004">Figure 4g,h</xref>, compare also to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g002">Figures 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g003">3f</xref>).

<p>We next wanted to identify the primary gephyrin-palmitoylating enzyme(s).

<p>As the uneven expression pattern might misrepresent the importance of some DHHCs, and to validate the results in a more physiologically relevant environment, we additionally performed a DHHC screen in primary hippocampal neurons. As prepalmitoylated endogenous gephyrin could potentially mask the effect of transfected DHHC enzymes, we cotransfected gephyrin-GFP along with the individual DHHC enzymes. The gephyrin-GFP cluster size was quantified already 24 h posttransfection to minimize the influence of endogenous DHHC enzymes. Moreover, only neurons with adequate DHHC enzyme immunstaining were analyzed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001908.s006">Figure S5</xref>). We validated this approach by quantifying the size of PSD-95–GFP puncta at dendritic spines cotransfected with DHHC enzymes active (DHHC-3) or inactive (DHHC-22) towards PSD-95 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Fukata3">[16]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001908.s007">Figure S6</xref>). We found that expression of DHHC-12 but none of the other DHHC family members selectively increased the cluster size of gephyrin-GFP (123.31%±8.04% of control; <italic>n</italic> = 2 cultures; <italic>p</italic> = 0.018; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g005">Figure 5b</xref>). By contrast, the density of gephyrin clusters was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g005">Figure 5d</xref>). Conversely, co-expression of gephyrin-GFP with a dominant-negative DHH<underline>S</underline>-12 construct (encoding bicistronic mCherry to visualize transfected dendrites) resulted in significantly smaller gephyrin clusters compared to controls transfected with mCherry alone (70.32%±5.69% of control; <italic>n</italic> = 3 cultures; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g005">Figure 5e,g</xref>). Similar to palmitoylation-deficient gephyrin, gephyrin-GFP cluster density was significantly increased in the presence of DHHS-12 (control, 5.23%±0.23%; DHHS-12, 6.08%±0.20%; <italic>n</italic> = 3 cultures; <italic>p</italic> = 0.006; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g005">Figure 5f,g</xref>). As expected, DHHC-12 overexpression did not affect the cluster size of 212,284Geph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g005">Figure 5h</xref>). Endogenous transcripts of DHHC-12 were readily detectable in cultured neurons, consistent with relevance for palmitoylation of neuronal proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g005">Figure 5i</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm that endogenous DHHC-12 indeed palmitoylates gephyrin, we down-regulated the expression of DHHC-12 by means of transcript-specific cell-penetrating siRNAs in cultured neurons. As DHHC-16 was the second potent DHHC enzyme in terms of increasing gephyrin-GFP cluster size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g005">Figure 5b</xref>), we additionally used DHHC-16–specific siRNAs to test whether this enzyme also affects palmitoylation of gephyrin. Palmitoylation of gephyrin in DHHC-12 siRNA-treated neurons was significantly decreased compared to scrambled siRNA-treated neurons (siRNA DHHC-12, 54.89%±4.11% of scrambled siRNA; <italic>n</italic> = 4; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g005">Figure 5j,k</xref>). DHHC-16 siRNA treatment had no effect on gephyrin palmitoylation (100.4%±7.8% of scrambled siRNA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g005">Figure 5k</xref>), suggesting that endogenous DHHC-16 does not act directly on gephyrin in neurons. Due to the lack of appropriate antibodies, we were not able to measure endogenous DHHC protein levels after siRNA down-regulation. However, expression of HA-tagged DHHCs was significantly decreased in siRNA-treated HEK293 cells and siRNAs were delivered to virtually all neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001908.s008">Figure S7</xref>), suggesting that our approach resulted in efficient down-regulation of the respective DHHC enzyme. Importantly, palmitoylation levels of GABA<sub>A</sub>R γ2 and PSD-95 were not altered by knockdown of DHHC-12 and DHHC-16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g004">Figure 4h</xref>), which is consistent with direct effects of DHHC-12 on gephyrin clustering.</p>

<title>DHHC-12–Mediated Gephyrin Palmitoylation Increases mIPSC Amplitudes</title>
<p>To assess the functional impact of gephyrin palmitoylation on inhibitory synapses, we recorded miniature postsynaptic currents (mPSCs) of DHHC-12– and DHHS-12–transfected primary hippocampal neurons. AMPAR- and GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs and mIPSCs) were distinguished pharmacologically as well as by their decay kinetics (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g006">Figure 6a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).

Thus, the data suggest that gephyrin palmitoylation increased the postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R pool, in agreement with the increased size of postsynaptic gephyrin clusters upon DHHC-12 expression. Furthermore, the decay time constant of mIPSCs was slightly increased in DHHC-12–expressing neurons, possibly reflecting minor changes in GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g006">Figure 6f</xref>). In contrast to mIPSCs, the properties of mEPSCs were similar with respect to all measures, suggesting that DHHC-12 affected selectively the function of proteins localized at GABAergic synapses.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we demonstrate that gephyrin is palmitoylated and describe the mechanism by which this modification modulates the function of GABAergic synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g009">Figure 9</xref>). We found that postsynaptic clustering of gephyrin, an essential process for normal functioning of inhibitory synapses, is critically dependent on its palmitoylation. Lack of palmitoylation, by pharmacological inhibition or expression of palmitoylation-deficient gephyrin, led to nonsynaptic, mislocalized gephyrin clusters. Augmented palmitoylation by DHHC-12, on the other hand, increased the size of the gephyrin synaptic scaffold, thereby ultimately increasing the strength of GABAergic transmission. Together with our observation that palmitoylation is also linked to GABA<sub>A</sub>R activity, palmitoylation becomes a major regulatory factor in gephyrin-dependent GABAergic plasticity.</p>

<title>Model for palmitoylation-mediated regulation of gephyrin clustering and plasticity.</title>
<p>Gephyrin, palmitoylated on Cys212 and 284, forms stable clusters at the postsynaptic membrane. Activity of GABAergic synapses promotes (de)palmitoylation of gephyrin by yet unknown mechanisms. Silencing of GABAergic transmission leads to gephyrin depalmitoylation and membrane release, ultimately decreasing the size of gephyrin clusters. The palmitoyl transferase DHHC-12, localized in the Golgi in neurons including presumed Golgi outposts in primary dendritic shafts, is the principle gephyrin-palmitoylating enzyme and allows dynamic (re)palmitoylation of gephyrin.</p>

<p>We mapped Cys212 and Cys284 within the C-domain of gephyrin as the palmitoylation sites. As a “two-lipid modification” seems to be essential for stable plasma membrane interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Shahinian1">[30]</xref>, it is likely that within the tertiary structure of gephyrin, Cys212 and Cys284 are in close proximity. Compared to PSD-95, a smaller population of gephyrin was palmitoylated in brain. Considering a tight membrane association, the proportion of gephyrin that is palmitoylated might, however, be significantly greater at synapses. Gephyrin fulfills a second metabolic function by catalyzing the last step of the molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis, which in the brain takes place in glia cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Smolinsky1">[31]</xref>. Consequently, this fraction of metabolically active nonneural gephyrin is expected to be nonpalmitoylated and cytosolically localized. As gephyrin forms stable oligomers (hexamers and nonamers), we predict that only individual gephyrin molecules within an oligomer are palmitoylated. This idea is supported by ultrastructural data of synaptic gephyrins showing that gephyrin clusters have a nonuniform shape and are composed of certain microdomains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Specht1">[32]</xref>. Furthermore, immuno-EM studies with different monoclonal antibodies revealed that the gephyrin C-domain is closer to the synaptic membrane as compared to the N-terminal G-domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Triller1">[33]</xref>. In contrast, each molecule of nonoligomerized proteins such as PSD-95 likely needs to be palmitoylated to physically associate with the membrane.</p>
<p>Gephyrin molecules exchange continuously between synaptic and nonsynaptic populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Calamai1">[34]</xref>. Our data suggest that palmitoylation of gephyrin is crucial for normal clustering at postsynaptic sites. We observed a significantly increased density of palmitoylation-deficient gephyrin clusters at nonsynaptic sites. Furthermore, nonpalmitoylated gephyrin was less stably associated with the membrane and more diffusively distributed in the cytoplasm. Therefore, we suggest that palmitoylation-mediated membrane association is necessary to stabilize gephyrin clusters, hence leading to dissociation into smaller clusters when gephyrin is not palmitoylated. This fits well with the significantly decreased size and total fluorescence of clusters formed by palmitoylation-deficient gephyrin mutants in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, (de)palmitoylation cycles of gephyrin might be important for merging and splitting of gephyrin clusters as part of inhibitory synapse dynamics, as suggested earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Dobie1">[35]</xref>.</p>
<p>Besides gephyrin, palmitoylation was also shown to regulate the postsynaptic accumulation of γ2-subunit–containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Keller1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Fang1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Rathenberg1">[36]</xref>. In contrast to GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, targeting of gephyrin to synapses is not necessarily palmitoylation-dependent, as evidenced by postsynaptic clustering of the 212,284Geph variant or endogenous gephyrin in 2-BP–treated cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g003">3</xref>). As palmitoylation can regulate cellular localization and binding to the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Rocks1">[37]</xref>, rather the association and residence time of gephyrin at the postsynaptic membrane and stabilization of gephyrin clusters are palmitoylation-dependent.</p>
<p>Recent studies demonstrated dynamic, neuronal activity-dependent changes in gephyrin clustering <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Chen1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-vanVersendaal1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Vlachos1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Galante1">[39]</xref>. However, a specific molecular mechanism was not identified so far. Our study provides a novel mechanism whereby palmitoylation-dependent gephyrin clustering is linked to GABAergic transmission. Activation of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs increased the palmitoylation of gephyrin and consequently its membrane affinity, whereas blockade of GABAergic transmission had the opposite effects. This GABA<sub>A</sub>R activity-dependent modulation of gephyrin clusters allows dynamic and structural changes of the postsynaptic architecture.</p>
<p>Studies on PSD-95 have identified that palmitoylation is important for glutamatergic synaptic plasticity and function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-ElHusseini1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Noritake1">[40]</xref>. Mechanistically, glutamatergic transmission leads to depalmitoylation of PSD-95 and destabilization of the postsynaptic density <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-ElHusseini1">[14]</xref>. Our study extends this view and indicates that palmitoylation of postsynaptic scaffolding proteins is a key and general factor to adjust the synaptic strength. In fact, opposing actions of GABA<sub>A</sub>R and glutamate receptor activation on palmitoylation of gephyrin and PSD-95, respectively, implicate that this posttranslational mechanism can serve as a common regulator of GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic transmission.</p>
<p>We identified DHHC-12 as the major gephyrin-palmitoylating enzyme. The activity of DHHC-12 seems to be selective for GABAergic versus glutamatergic synapses and suggests that the enzyme is indispensable for normal inhibitory function, whereas excitatory transmission seems to be independent of DHHC-12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Indeed, to our knowledge, gephyrin is the first identified substrate of DHHC-12, whereas other members of the DHHC family have been identified to palmitoylate proteins that reside at glutamatergic synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Fukata1">[13]</xref>. Remarkably, neither dendritically localized palmitoyl transferases such as DHHC-2, -5, and -8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Noritake1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Thomas1">[41]</xref> nor enzymes with a broad substrate specificity like DHHC-3 and -7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Fang1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Hayashi1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Huang1">[43]</xref> were able to palmitoylate gephyrin in HEK293 cells or neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g004">Figure 4</xref>). This finding suggests a very specific substrate recognition mechanism underlying gephyrin palmitoylation by DHHC-12.</p>
<p>In agreement with previous results from neuroblastoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Mizumaru1">[44]</xref>, DHHC-12 was largely Golgi-localized in neurons, including presumed Golgi outposts in primary dendritic shafts. By analogy to glutamatergic neurotransmission-dependent palmitoylation of PSD-95 by dendritic DHHC-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Fukata2">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Noritake1">[40]</xref>, the presence of DHHC-12 in dendrites would allow dynamic gephyrin palmitoylation at synapses, which is supported by our PLA-based identification of gephyrin–DHHC-12 interactions in the vicinity of inhibitory synapses. Given that we observed residual gephyrin palmitoylation in DHHC-12 siRNA-treated cells, we cannot rule out that other DHHC enzymes can compensate for reduced DHHC-12 activity and/or use gephyrin as a substrate. However, as there are no closely related paralogues of DHHC-12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Fukata1">[13]</xref>, substrate recognition and palmitoylation would probably follow divergent modes of action.</p>
<p>Interestingly, palmitoylation at Cys212 and Cys284 surrounds the previously reported gephyrin phosphorylation sites at residues Ser268 and Ser270 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Tyagarajan2">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Tyagarajan3">[11]</xref>. The phospho-mimetic S268E variant shows an increased density of gephyrin clusters, whereas gephyrin phosphorylation at Ser268 was mainly identified in membrane-bound fractions. The authors concluded that the effect on gephyrin cluster density seen in Ser268 mutants is caused by the interrelation with another posttranslational modification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Tyagarajan3">[11]</xref>. Thus, there might be a crosstalk between gephyrin palmitoylation and phosphorylation on Ser268 or other phosphor-sites recently identified in the gephyrin C-domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Tyagarajan3">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Herweg1">[22]</xref>. Additionally, some gephyrin-interacting proteins bind to gephyrin's C-domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Fritschy1">[23]</xref>. Dynein light chain (DLC), a component of the motor protein complexes, was suggested to be involved in the subcellular localization of gephyrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Fuhrmann1">[45]</xref>. The interaction with gephyrin was mapped to residues 203–214 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-NavarroLerida1">[46]</xref>. Hence, it will be important to assess whether palmitoylation affects dynein-dependent functions on gephyrin.</p>
<p>Given that aberrant protein palmitoylation is implicated in a range of neurological diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Young1">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Greaves1">[48]</xref>, it will be interesting to see whether deregulated gephyrin palmitoylation contributes to pathogenesis in these disorders. In fact, the <italic>ZDHHC12</italic> gene is located in a region of chromosome 9 implicated in epilepsy and other neuropsychiatric disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Campbell1">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Mastrangelo1">[50]</xref>.

An EPC-7 amplifier and Patchmaster software (HEKA) were used for patch clamp recordings. Patch pipettes, made from borosilicate glass (Science Products), had resistances of 2–6 MΩ when filled with the intracellular solution containing (in mM): KCl (130), NaCl (5), CaCl<sub>2</sub> (0.5), MgCl<sub>2</sub> (1), EGTA (5), and HEPES (30). The standard extracellular solution (pH 7.4) contained (in mM): NaCl (140), KCl (5), MgCl<sub>2</sub> (1), CaCl<sub>2</sub> (2), HEPES-NaOH (10), and glucose (10). Cells were clamped at a potential of −50 mV. Series resistances (R<sub>s</sub>), monitored by −5 mV voltage pulses (50 ms) applied every 5 s, were between 5 MΩ and 30 MΩ. Experiments with a more than 25% change in R<sub>s</sub> throughout the recording were discarded. Data were acquired with a sampling rate of 10 kHz after filtering at 2.8 kHz. Transfected cells were identified using mCherry fluorescence. mPSCs were isolated pharmacologically by blocking NMDA receptors with DL-aminophosphonovaleric acid (APV, 100 µm; Sigma), glycine receptors with strychnine (1 µM; Sigma), and action potentials with tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 µM; Sigma). Analyses of the mPSCs were performed with an in-house software written in IGOR 6.32A (WaveMetrics) by M. Semtner. Extracted parameters for each PSC were time of occurrence, maximal peak amplitude, 10%–90% rise time, and tau value of the single exponential fit of the decay (τdecay). As described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001908-Singh1">[57]</xref>, mPSCs were divided into mEPSCs and mIPSCs according to their τdecay values—that is, mPSCs with τdecay ≤8 ms were classified as mEPSCs and those with τdecay &gt;8 ms as mIPSCs. Current traces (1 to 5 min long) from 16 different recorded neurons were analyzed for each condition (DHHC-12 or DHHS-12). We quantified 50 mEPSCs and 50 mIPSCs per recorded neuron.

<p>One brain from an adult mouse was washed in ice-cold homogenization buffer (HB; 320 mM sucrose, 4 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)). The washed brain was cut into small pieces with a scalpel, and tissue was further disrupted using a motor-driven homogenizer at 900 rpm/10 strokes (PotterS from Sartorius) in 12 ml HB. Cell debris and intact cells were removed by centrifugation at 800× <italic>g</italic> for 5 min. The supernatant (S1 fraction) was further centrifuged at 12,000× <italic>g</italic> for 15 min and the resulting pellet (P1) homogenized in 12 ml HB.

<p>Inhibition of palmitoylation leads to decreased surface-expressed levels of synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunits. (a) Primary hippocampal neurons from control and 2-BP–treated cultures were surface labeled with a primary amine reactive biotin reagent. (b) Upon Neutravidin beads purification, indicated GABA<sub>A</sub>R receptor subunits were visualized and quantified on a Western blot level. The quantification reveals a significant surface reduction of all synaptic subunits, whereas the extrasynaptic α5 subunit is not affected. Notably, reduction of GABA<sub>A</sub>R α1 and β2/3 subunit surface expression mirrored the reduction of gephyrin cluster size (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001908-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Loading controls show the overall steady-state levels of the proteins, which were not changed for GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunits. Gephyrin steady-state levels were substantially reduced after 2-BP treatment. All data are means ± SEM (GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunits, β2/3, 72.29%±3.73%; α1, 72.4%±0.79%; γ2, 36.92%±4.45%; α5, 104.0%±4.0% of control; **<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, ***<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001 using Student's <italic>t</italic> test; <italic>n</italic> = 3).</p>

<p>Oligomerization of gephyrin is not palmitoylation-dependent. Size exclusion chromatography was performed with control and 2-BP–treated lysates of primary hippocampal neurons. Fifteen fractions were collected and analyzed by immunoblot with gephyrin and PSD-95 antibodies. Corresponding elution fractions of reference proteins are shown above the immunoblots. Gephyrin (83 kDa) was eluted at a size of native hexamers and nonamers, whereas PSD-95 eluted at its monomeric size. Inhibition of palmitoylation did not change oligomerization of gephyrin or PSD-95.</p>
