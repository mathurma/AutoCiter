                <p>Echolocating bats use the echoes from their echolocation calls to perceive their
                    surroundings. The ability to use these continuously emitted calls, whose main
                    function is not communication, for recognition of individual conspecifics might
                    facilitate many of the social behaviours observed in bats. Several studies of
                    individual-specific information in echolocation calls found some evidence for
                    its existence but did not quantify or explain it. We used a direct paradigm to
                    show that greater mouse-eared bats (<italic>Myotis myotis</italic>) can easily
                    discriminate between individuals based on their echolocation calls and that they
                    can generalize their knowledge to discriminate new individuals that they were
                    not trained to recognize. We conclude that, despite their high variability,
                    broadband bat-echolocation calls contain individual-specific information that is
                    sufficient for recognition. An analysis of the call spectra showed that
                    formant-related features are suitable cues for individual recognition. As a
                    model for the bat's decision strategy, we trained nonlinear statistical
                    classifiers to reproduce the behaviour of the bats, namely to repeat correct and
                    incorrect decisions of the bats. The comparison of the bats with the model
                    strongly implies that the bats are using a prototype classification approach:
                    they learn the average call characteristics of individuals and use them as a
                    reference for classification.</p>

                <p>Animals must recognize each other in order to engage in social behaviour. Vocal
                    communication signals could be helpful for recognizing individuals, especially
                    in nocturnal organisms such as bats. Echolocating bats continuously emit special
                    vocalizations, known as echolocation calls, and perceive their surroundings by
                    analyzing the returning echoes. In this work we show that bats can use these
                    vocalizations for the recognition of individuals, despite the fact that their
                    main function is not communication. We used a statistical approach to analyze
                    how the bats could do so. We created a computer model that reproduces the
                    recognition behaviour of the bats. Our model suggests that the bats learn the
                    average calls of other individuals and recognize individuals by comparing their
                    calls with the learnt average representations.</p>

            <p>Voice is defined as the entirety of all acoustic signals produced by the vocal organs
                of an organism and its ability to produce them. Vocalizations are mostly used for
                communication. They can contain information about identity, gender, maturity,
                health, behavioural context, etc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000400-Bradbury1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000400-Kazial1">[3]</xref>. Specific properties of
                the sound production and articulation apparatus are responsible for the
                individual-specific spectral properties of vocalizations. The human voice, for
                instance, reveals the identity of individuals and lately it has been shown that
                other animals can also recognize individuals according to their social vocalizations
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000400-Sayigh1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000400-Fitch1">[10]</xref>. Social vocalizations
                constitute an important part of the vocal repertoire of bats. These vocalizations
                have been characterized for many species and contexts and were shown to contain
                individual signatures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000400-Barclay1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000400-Fenton2">[23]</xref>. In addition to social
                vocalizations, microchiropteran bats constantly emit echolocation calls and use the
                returning echoes to perceive their surroundings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000400-Griffin1">[24]</xref>. These echolocation
                calls are tonal signals that exhibit a structured change in frequency over time that
                is normally less variable than that of the social vocalizations. The ability to
                recognize individuals based on echolocation calls might explain many of the social
                behaviours observed in bats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000400-Racey1">[e.g., 16]</xref>. Several studies tried to find
                individual-specific cues in bat echolocation calls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000400-Masters1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000400-Boughman1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000400-Kazial3">[28]</xref>.
                Recently, the response of bats to the echolocation calls of different individuals
                has been tested and the results suggested that they could recognize individuals
                according to their echolocation calls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000400-Kazial4">[29]</xref>.</p>
            <p>The echolocation calls of the greater mouse-eared bats (<italic>Myotis
                myotis</italic>) used in this study are ∼3 ms long frequency-modulated (FM)
                down-sweeps ranging from ∼100 kHz to ∼30 kHz. The exact
                spectral-temporal structure of the calls changed depending on the task. We
                hypothesize that, despite this variability, the echolocation signals might contain
                individual-specific characteristics, generated by the bats' vocal
                apparatus, which are sufficient for individual recognition. We first tested whether
                bats can distinguish between individuals according to their echolocation calls using
                the most direct approach used until today: training greater mouse-eared bats to
                classify echolocation calls of other individuals played back to them in a two
                alternative forced choice (2-AFC) experiment. After showing that the bats can
                clearly recognize their conspecifics, we used a statistical approach, new in this
                field, to train statistical classifiers to reproduce the bats' behaviour,
                namely to make similar correct and incorrect decisions as the bats. Our approach
                offers two main advantages in comparison to former unsuccessful attempts to
                statistically identify individual bats according to their echolocation calls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000400-Siemers1">[30]</xref>.
                First, our method is almost unlimited in the number of parameters that can be fed
                into it. This enabled us to use the raw representations of the calls and not to
                limit ourselves to a set of parameters as was always the case before. Second, we
                used a large data set containing ca. 800 calls per bat. Such a large data set
                enables us to create a good model of the individual's call despite its
                large variability. We used the statistical classifier as a model of the
                bat's underlying decision process to show how classification is
                statistically possible and to understand how the bats might be able to recognize
                other individuals.</p>

                <p>All bats emitted calls typical for flying in confined spaces with a very
                    characteristic spectral-temporal structure. Despite this repeating pattern, the
                    spectral content of the calls varied largely among individuals for both
                    behavioral and technical reasons (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials

                    the differences in the time structure of the calls. Finally, it is worth
                    emphasizing that the SNR of the calls varied dramatically (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000400-t001">Table 1</xref>) as a result of the
                    varying distance from the microphone.</p>

                <p>Bats were able to generalize from the learned task to recognize S+ or
                    avoid S− (a single call of the bat that they learned to avoid) when
                    presented with calls of new bats that were never heard during training (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000400-t002">Table 2</xref>). Most of the bats
                    showed both a preference for S+ and an avoidance of S−. The
                    higher percentage of approaching S+ when presented with S0 (a single
                    call of a bat that they did not encounter during training) can be a result of
                    the fact that the S+ calls in these experiments were taken from the
                    training set and thus - the bats might have already heard them during training.
                    The lower avoidance of S− when presented with S0 could result from the
                    fact that they were familiar to the bats and the bats were even rewarded when
                    approaching them during the test phase.</p>

                <title>Comparison of the metrics</title>
                <p>Our main goal was to model the behavior of the bats. Therefore, more than the
                    overall performance, we were interested to find a classifier that behaves like
                    the bat in the sense that it makes more errors in trials that the model
                    considers to be more difficult and vice versa. We assessed the similarity
                    between the bat and its model by measuring the correlation between the
                    performance of the bat and the performance of the model on the same test set
                    (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The
                    performance of the model was indirectly measured by calculating the distances
                    between the pairs of calls in the test set. This reflects the metric of the
                    model. A high correlation between the two indicates that the bat made more
                    errors in trials that are considered to be difficult by the machine and vice
                    versa. Except for a single case (using the PSD for the classification task of
                    bat 6 vs. bat 1) the metrics (distances to the hyperplane) of the linear
                    classifiers are actually negatively correlated with the error rate of the bats,
                    implying that they were using different features than the model to classify the
                    calls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000400-t003">Table 3</xref>). We were,
                    however, able to train non-linear SVMs that correlated with the bat's
                    behavior in each of the classification tasks. This was true both for the
                    spectrograms and the PSDs, although the correlation seems a bit less salient in
                    the case of the PSDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000400-g003">Figure
                    3</xref>). The overall performance of the non-linear SVMs behaving most
                    similarly to the bats was very close to that of the bats, when using the
                    spectrograms and was a bit lower when using the PSDs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000400-t003">Table 3</xref>). In one case (classification of bat

                    (starting/terminal/maximum energy frequencies, bandwidth and call duration,

                    the percent of correct decisions if the bat would rely on one of the above
                    parameters, (e.g. always go to the call with a lower or higher terminal
                    frequency). In almost all cases, relying on any single cueresulted in a
                    performance at chance level (45–55%). For the

            <p>The voice of individual greater mouse-eared bats is specific enough that they can
                distinguish between the echolocation calls of conspecifics despite their extremely
                short duration and highly situation-dependent variability. The bats were able to
                generalize their knowledge to recognize the rewarded individual (S+) and
                avoide the unrewarded one (S−) when presented with the calls of new
                individuals that they had not heard during training (S0). A standard linear
                classifier (SVM) can be trained to fulfill the recognition task with an overall
                performance similar to that of the bats. The linear models, however, did not
                reproduce the decision metrics of the bats, implying that the discriminative
                features they were using were not the ones used by the bats. The linear model can be
                extended (after a nonlinear transformation of the data with an RBF kernel) to
                reproduce the behavior of the bats, in other words, the bats made more errors in
                trials that were considered difficult by the model. Thus, the analysis of these
                classifiers provides candidate discriminative features derived from the call
                statistics that might be used by the bats to distinguish between individuals.</p>
            <p>Examining the PSDs of the calls is a straight-forward approach of searching for
                spectral individual-specific features. The PSDs of two bats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000400-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) reveal a general bimodal pattern in
                both bats with energy peaks around ∼65 kHz and ∼45 kHz. bat 1
                (black), however, tends to have a higher average energy than bat 3 in the 65 kHz
                peak, while bat 3 (blue) tends to have higher energy in the ∼45 kHz peak.</p>

            <p>An extremely over-simplified classification rule could be: “The call with
                lower energy at ∼65 kHz and higher energy at ∼45 kHz belongs to Bat
                3 (S+).” An SVM, however, does not use a single feature, such as
                the energy at 65 kHz, to classify, but rather takes advantage of all possible cues
                and their combinations. Examining the PSDs according to the decision rule learned by
                the SVM can provide some insights about the relative importance of different
                features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000400-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The most
                obvious observation is that the average difference between the PSDs of calls near
                the hyperplane is most similar to the average difference between the misclassified
                calls. This is supported by a high correlation coefficient (0.62, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000400-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). This means that the
                calls that are difficult to classify for bats are also difficult for the machine and
                vice versa. An even more interesting observation is that the average difference
                between calls far from the hyperplane is very similar to the average difference
                between all calls, supported by a very high correlation coefficient (0.83). Actually
                it can be described as an emphasized version of the average difference between all
                calls.</p>

                <title>Prototype classification</title>
                <p>This last similarity implies that the decisions of the bats can be modeled as a
                    prototype classifier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000400-Reed1">[31]</xref> in the sense that the bat learns the mean
                    calls of the bat pair as a prototype for the two classes
                    (S+/S−). To test this hypothesis we applied a simple
                    prototype classifier to our data. We used the nearest mean-of class prototype
                    classifier, in which each class is represented by its mean and each call is
                    assigned to the class whose mean PSD is closer to its PSD using the Euclidean
                    distance. The means were calculated from the training data exclusively. Since
                    the bats heard two calls in each trial, we calculated the sum of distances
                    between the PSDs of these calls and the mean PSDs for both the correct and the
                    incorrect assignments. We considered any case for which the correct sum of
                    distances was smaller than the incorrect sum of distances as a correct decision
                    of the classifier. We repeated this for the spectrograms as well.</p>
                <p>Despite its simplicity, the prototype classifier achieved a classification
                    performance significantly higher than chance level for both the PSDs and the
                    spectrograms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000400-t004">Table 4</xref>).
                    The lower performance compared to the non-linear SVM is not surprising due to
                    the simplicity of this classifier. The overall performance however, is less
                    important in our case. It could probably be increased by a more sophisticated
                    prototype classifier, for instance one that only learns the means of features
                    that have a large inter-bat variability. Much more important is the very high
                    correlation between the distance metric of this classifier (sum of prototype
                    distances) and the bat performance, meaning that the bats tend to make more
                    errors when the calls presented to them are farther from the mean calls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000400-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).</p>

                        <p>(A) The mean normalized performance of the bats as a function of the sum
                            of prototype distances. The performance of each bat was normalized to a
                            maximum of 1, for the distance class with the highest performance. The
                            distance used was the sum of Euclidian distances from the pair of calls
                            to the means of the classes. The distance classes are organized
                            according to the distances from the prototype: 4 is the farthest class
                            from the prototype, while 1 is the closest. In contrast to the distances
                            from the SVM hyperplane, for the prototype classifier far means far from
                            the prototype and therefore difficult to classify. We thus expected to
                            find a negative correlation between performance and distance, which is
                            what happened. (B) The similarity between the test call pairs of bat 1
                            and bat 3 and the mean difference between spectrograms. X axis depicts
                            the distance between the calls according to the SVM metric. The strong
                            positive correlation (linear coefficient
                            C = ∼0.6) implies that the
                            pairs that are more similar to the mean are considered easier to
                            classify by the model.</p>

                            <p>The performance of a prototype classifier for the different tasks
                                when using the spectrograms (time+frequency information) or
                                PSDs (frequency only). The identical decisions are as in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000400-t003">table 3</xref>.</p>

                <p>An interpretation of the SVM decision rule regarding the spectrograms is not easy
                    due to their high dimensionality, but the above analysis suggests a prototype
                    classifier as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000400-g005">Figure.
                    5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000400-t004">Table 4</xref>). To
                    validate this idea we ranked the spectrograms of the presented call pairs of Bat
                    1 and Bat 3 according to distances between them (based on the non-linear SVM
                    metric). The closer the two spectrograms are to each other, the more difficult
                    they should be to classify. To test the prototype hypothesis we next measured
                    how similar each spectrogram pair is to the pair created by the two class means.
                    We calculated the linear correlation between a) the difference between the pairs
                    and b) the difference between the mean spectrograms. We found a strong positive
                    correlation between the two.which shows that the more similar the difference
                    between two spectrograms is to the mean difference, the easier it is to classify
                    by the trained SVM. As this SVM was trained to imitate the bat's
                    behavior, this once again supports the hypothesis that the bats are using some
                    sort of a prototype classifier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000400-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>
                <p>In summary, for both PSDs and spectrograms, we found evidence that the bats use a
                    prototype classifier in which they evaluate the mean difference between the
                    calls of the bat couple as a reference to which they compare the difference
                    between any new pair of calls they hear. This hypothesis is strengthened by the
                    results of the generalization experiments, which suggest that the bats are using
                    both S+ and S− to classify (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000400-t003">Table 3</xref>). We did not observe the exact PSDs
                    of all classification tasks, mainly because the amount of errors for the other
                    tasks was very small. The application of a prototype classifier (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000400-t004">Table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000400-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) however, implies
                    that all of them were using a sort of a prototype classifier.</p>

                <title>Conclusions</title>
                <p>Researchers were always fascinated by the social behaviors exhibited by bats.
                    There are, for instance, some reports of bats leaving the roost and flying to
                    and between foraging sites in groups of between two and six individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000400-Racey1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000400-Fenton1">[22]</xref>. Little is known
                    about how bats might perform the strenuous task of remaining in a group when
                    flying at high speeds in darkness, or about how they avoid interference between
                    each others' echolocation calls. The finding that bats can recognize
                    their conspecifics based on their echolocation calls might have some significant
                    implications in this context.</p>
                <p>Despite their stereotyped spectrograms, echolocation calls show a large
                    task-dependent variability that obscures possible features in the calls that
                    might facilitate the recognition of individual bats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000400-Siemers1">[30]</xref>. For this reason,
                    we had to use statistical classifiers as a new method of analysis in a context
                    that requires a minimal set of restrictive assumptions on candidate
                    discriminative features. The results pointed strongly towards a prototype
                    strategy. This now enables us to design additional behavioral experiments to
                    test this hypothesis. To test the prototype hypothesis one could, for instance,
                    divide the calls of one of the bats into 2 subgroups that are selected such that
                    their prototype (mean) is very different. The tested bat should then be trained
                    using calls from one subgroup and tested using calls from the other. If the
                    prototype hypothesis holds, the bat would be expected to have a very high error
                    rate. An alternative approach could be to use the hyperplane learnt by the SVM
                    to simulate artificial calls at known distances from the hyperplane and
                    therefore known difficulty <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000400-Yovel1">[see 32 for more details]</xref>.</p>
                <p>Comparing the performance of the tested classifiers on the PSDs or on the
                    spectrograms reveals that the performance when using the PSDs does not drop as
                    we would expect from taking into account the drop of information (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000400-t003">Table 3</xref>). This implies that
                    most of the information necessary for classification already exists in the
                    frequency domain. Along with the above analysis of PSDs, this suggests that the
                    filtering properties of the vocal tracts of the individuals, which reflect vocal
                    tract resonances (formants) provide sufficient acoustic cues for individual
                    recognition. These findings are in line with some recent evidence supporting the
                    presence of formants in animal calls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000400-Rendall1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000400-Fitch1">[10]</xref>,

                    situations that show a much higher variation of temporal-spectral relations, the
                    PSDs might even be advantageous compared to the spectrograms since they provide
                    a time-independent set of cues.</p>

                <p>We conducted the experiments using five adult male <italic>M. myotis</italic>
                    (Borkhausen, 1797), captured in Bulgaria (license from the Ministry of

                    24±2°C and 65±5% humidity). Bats were
                    fed on mealworms (larvae of <italic>Tenebrio molitor</italic>) only during
                    training and experimental sessions. The diet was supplemented with minerals
                    (Korvimin®, WDT) and vitamins (Nutrical©, Albrecht) and
                    freshwater was accessible all the time. The animals used in the experiments were
                    kept together for a few months in a flight cage that enabled them to fly
                    regularly.</p>

                <title>Data acquisition</title>
                <p>Five bats were recorded separately while freely flying in a flight room
                    (3.6×6.0×2.8 m) covered with acoustic foam to reduce echoes
                    from the walls and floor. The flight behavior consisted of two patterns: The
                    animals either circled in the room ca. 2 m above ground, or they flew to one of
                    the walls and hung on it. In the latter case we encouraged them to fly again by
                    clapping the hands or gently poking them with a butterfly net. The sound
                    recordings were performed with custom-made equipment (Universität
                    Tübingen, Germany) including an ultrasonic microphone (flat response
                    ±3 dB between 18 and 200 kHz) in a stationary position pointing
                    45° upwards at one end of the room and a digital recorder (PCTape), with
                    a sampling rate of 480 kHz. The order of the animals was selected using the
                    Latin squares method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000400-Zar1">[36]</xref> to mitigate undesired effects caused by the
                    order or time of the day.</p>
                <p>The recordings lasted 20 minutes in total, collected on two consecutive days.
                    This procedure provided us with a large data set of over 2000 calls per bat. The
                    characteristics of the calls varied greatly within each individual even though
                    they were emitted under the same conditions. This variability had at least two
                    causes: 1) Behavioral - the bats were constantly changing their distance from
                    the walls, especially when approaching them to land and adjusted their
                    echolocation accordingly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000400-Schnitzler1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000400-Melcn1">[38]</xref>. 2) Acoustical - the
                    calls were recorded when the bats were at different distances from the
                    microphone and with different aspect angles to it. This resulted in substantial
                    changes in the signal to noise ratio (SNR: see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> for more details). We
                    discarded all calls that were shorter than 2 ms since they were severely
                    affected by the directionality of the microphone (i.e. calls with a strong
                    attenuation at high frequencies). This procedure left us with approximately 800
                    calls for each bat.</p>

                <title>Behavioral classification experiments</title>
                <p>In the behavioral experiments each bat was trained to distinguish between two
                    other specific bats in a 2-AFC paradigm. Each experimental bat was assigned two
                    other bats between whose calls it had to distinguish. We will refer to the bat
                    it had to approach as S+ and to the other one as S−. The bats
                    had to sit on a Y-shaped platform and crawl to the side where the calls of
                    S+ were played. The stimuli consisted of alternately playing a single
                    call of S+ on one side of the platform and a single call of
                    S− on the other side with a 0.5 s pause between them until the bat
                    made a decision. All calls were normalized in the time domain to have the same
                    maximum amplitude. We used custom-made equipment (Universität
                    Tübingen, Germany) to play back the calls with a sampling rate of 480
                    kHz. The loudspeakers (Thiel Diamond Driver D<sup>2</sup> 20-6) were positioned
                    1.35 m from the platform and 1.35 m apart from each other, forming an
                    equilateral triangle together with the platform. The side on which S+
                    was presented varied randomly between the trials. The experiments were divided
                    into a training phase and a testing phase. In the training phase the bats were
                    trained to perform the task using a subset of the data composed of
                    80% of the calls (the training set) chosen randomly. During training,
                    when the bat crawled to S+, it was rewarded with a mealworm. The bats
                    needed ∼4 days of training to get used to sitting on the Y-platform
                    (they were fed on it). They needed another ∼3 days to learn to crawl to
                    one of the sides of the Y-platform to get the reward. To do this, we placed the
                    bat in the starting arm and played back S+ from one side and
                    S− from the other one, showing the mealworm at the end of the correct
                    arm and rewarding the bat for crawling towards it. The next step (the training
                    phase) consisted of the training on the task. S+ and S− were
                    played back as described above and the bats were rewarded for crawling to the
                    correct side. When they made an error the trial would be repeated up to 3 times.
                    If the bat continued misclassifying we moved to the next pair of calls. Once a
                    bat made more than 75% correct decisions\3 days in a row it was
                    transfered into the testing phase. The training phase lasted ∼20 days on
                    average so that each bat performed ∼25 trials per day so that in total
                    the bats heard ∼500 calls of each bat before starting the testing phase.
                    In the testing phase, we used the remaining 20% of the calls that had
                    never been heard by the bats before. Each pair of calls was played back during a
                    single trial. The decision of the bats was always rewarded, so that the
                    experimenter could not give the bats a hint about the correct answer (a double
                    blind paradigm). The assignment of bat pairs (S+ vs. S−) were
                    as following: bat1–bat2 vs. bat6, bat3–bat6 vs. bat1,
                    bat4–bat5 vs. bat2 and bat5–bat3 vs. bat1. We used four
                    different pair of bats (rather than testing all bats on the same task) assuming
                    that all tasks were more or less equally hard and thus a high performance in all
                    of them would imply high performance for any chosen pair of bats.</p>

                    calls were randomly selected from the training set, since the bats recently
                    heard all of the testing calls and were not exposed to training calls for at
                    least 2 weeks. The order of presentation of S+ or S− and S0
                    was random as well as the side on which they were played. The rest of the

                <p>We tested the performance of the classifier using two different representations
                    of the calls: spectrograms and power spectral densities (PSD). The spectrograms
                    are a time-frequency decomposition of the calls and therefore represent both
                    types of information the bats possess after the basic filtering in the ear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000400-Altes1">[41]</xref>. The
                    spectrograms were calculated using a Hann FFT window of 240 points with 0.9
                    overlap between consecutive windows, providing a frequency resolution of 2 kHz
                    and a time resolution of 0.5 ms. The part of the spectrogram containing the call
                    was segmented from the background noise using Otsu's method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000400-Otsu1">[42]</xref>. This
                    was done for each spectrogram separately and provided us with the call segments
                    that were clearly above noise. We should emphasize that this was done for the
                    machine classification only. The bats had to face noisy calls with a large
                    variability of background noise.</p>
                <p>We restricted the spectrograms to the frequency range between 21–140
                    kHz, which contains the entire frequency range of the calls. This left us with
                    very high-dimensional data (4200 dimensions: 60 frequencies times 70 time
                    points). We aligned all spectrograms in the time axis such that in all calls the
                    maximal energy at 30 kHz was at the same time instant of the spectrogram. We
                    used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the
                    data. Each data point (representing a single call) was projected on the 300
                    eigenvectors with the highest eigenvalues. This reduced the dimensionality of

                    directions of the greatest variance (using PCA) should therefore get rid of a
                    large amount of noise. In every experiment, the eigenvectors were exclusively
                    calculated from the covariance matrix of the training set (see below).</p>
                <p>The PSD contains only the frequency information of the calls, leading to a
                    classification that is independent of temporal information (e.g., call duration,
                    sweep rate) which tends to vary widely in nature. Throughout the paper they will
                    sometimes be referred to as spectra. The PSDs were calculated with
                    Welch's method with a 2 ms window with 0.5 overlap. We then
                    under-sampled the PSDs so that their frequency resolution was identical to that
                    of the spectrograms, ensuring that they contained the same spectral information
                    as the spectrograms but no temporal information. All data points (spectrograms
                    after PCA and PSDs) were normalized (divided by the maximum) so that each of
                    them had a maximum of 1 before they were used for classification.</p>

                <title>SVM classification</title>
                <p>SVMs are state-of-the-art learning algorithms based on statistical learning
                    theory. A linear SVM uses a training data set to learn a hyperplane (a
                    multidimensional decision boundary) that divides the data set into two classes.
                    It does so by minimizing the classification error and at the same time by
                    maximizing the distance between the hyperplane and the data points that are
                    closest to it. A non-linear SVM is used when the data cannot be separated
                    linearly. It first transforms the data non-linearly into a higher-dimensional
                    space (feature space) and then finds a hyperplane that divides the data into the
                    two classes in this space. In both cases the hyperplane is simply a geometrical
                    multidimensional plane either in the original or in the feature space. Since in
                    many cases a perfect separation of the data into two classes is not possible,
                    the learning algorithm is adjusted to enable a certain amount of
                    misclassification. This is controlled by a constant (C) that defines the penalty
                    for misclassified points. This constant is known as the free parameter of the
                    SVM.</p>
                <p>We applied SVM classifiers on both types of data (i.e., spectrograms and PSDs).
                    We used the same training set of calls that was used to train the bats in order
                    to train the classification machines and the same test set to test them. We
                    tested both linear and non-linear SVMs. For the non-linear SVMs, we trained
                    non-linear machines using the radial basis Gaussian kernel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000400-Cristianini1"/>[RBF],<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000400-Scholkopf1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000400-Haykin1">[40,43]</xref> to transform the
                    data nonlinearly before computing the separating hyperplane. This is a standard
                    choice in machine learning that usually performs well in a wide range of
                    applications. The use of the RBF kernel introduces a second parameter
                    (σ) that sets the width of the Gaussian. In order to optimize the
                    classifier to perform like the bat (see below) we tested 8 different values for
                    each of the two parameters (0.1, 1, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 10000) and trained
                    linear SVMs with all possible C values and non-linear SVMs with all possible
                    combinations of the two in order to find a classifier with a performance that is
                    most similar to that of the bats.</p>

                <title>Model selection</title>
                <p>There are several possibilities to optimize the model such that it behaves like a
                    bat. The overall performance (error rate) is not a sufficient criterion since it
                    does not provide any information about the classification strategy - e.g., the
                    bat and model could do the exact opposite right and wrong decisions but still
                    have the same error rate. An exact comparison between the decisions of the bat
                    and the decisions of the model (percent of identical right/wrong decisions) is a
                    better criterion, but it is also limited since it divides the trials into
                    identical decisions and non-identical decisions but provides no information
                    about how difficult each decision was. We therefore chose a different criterion,
                    one which is, to our understanding, more informative. For each model
                    (linear/non-linear SVM) we computed the distances between the pairs of test
                    calls the bat had to classify according to the model. This can be done by
                    computing the distance of each call from the hyperplane. The distance from the
                    hyperplane can be thought of as an estimation of how difficult the call is to
                    classify. The closer a call is to the hyperplane, the more difficult it is to
                    classify, since it is closer to the boundary between the two classes. We refer
                    to this measure as the metric of the model and it reflects how difficult/easy
                    each trial is considered to be according to the model. We assumed that if the
                    machine captured the features used by the bats for classification, the distance
                    between the calls should positively correlate with the performance of the bats,
                    meaning that the farther apart the two calls presented to the bat were, the
                    easier it should be for the bats to classify them correctly. In practice we
                    divided the entire distance range into 4 distance classes, each containing an
                    equal number of calls and plotted the error rate of the bats for each of these
                    distance ranges. We then calculated the correlation between the performance of
                    the bat and the difficulty of the trials it performed, represented by the
                    average distances of the group of trials. We searched for the parameters that
                    yielded a classifier that maximizes this correlation. To choose the best
                    parameters we divided the test set into 3 equally sized sub-sets of data. We
                    then used only two thirds of the test set to choose the best model (this set is
                    called the validation set) and we measured the results on the un-used third.
                    This process was repeated three times and ensures that the test set did not
                    influence our decision. This procedure also provided us with an estimation of
                    the variance of the model's performance.</p>
