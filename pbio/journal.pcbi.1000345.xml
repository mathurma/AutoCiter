                <p>When coordinating movements, the nervous system often has to decide how to
                    distribute work across a number of redundant effectors. Here, we show that
                    humans solve this problem by trying to minimize both the variability of motor
                    output and the effort involved. In previous studies that investigated the
                    temporal shape of movements, these two selective pressures, despite having very
                    different theoretical implications, could not be distinguished; because noise in
                    the motor system increases with the motor commands, minimization of effort or
                    variability leads to very similar predictions. When multiple effectors with
                    different noise and effort characteristics have to be combined, however, these
                    two cost terms can be dissociated. Here, we measure the importance of
                    variability and effort in coordination by studying how humans share force
                    production between two fingers. To capture variability, we identified the
                    coefficient of variation of the index and little fingers. For effort, we used
                    the sum of squared forces and the sum of squared forces normalized by the
                    maximum strength of each effector. These terms were then used to predict the
                    optimal force distribution for a task in which participants had to produce a
                    target total force of 4–16 N, by pressing onto two isometric
                    transducers using different combinations of fingers. By comparing the predicted
                    distribution across fingers to the actual distribution chosen by participants,
                    we were able to estimate the relative importance of variability and effort of
                    1∶7, with the unnormalized effort being most important. Our results
                    indicate that the nervous system uses multi-effector redundancy to minimize both
                    the variability of the produced output and effort, although effort costs clearly
                    outweighed variability costs.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>When performing actions, we often have many options of how to combine muscles or
                    limbs to achieve a desired outcome. Despite this freedom, certain effector
                    combinations are used consistently. Why? To examine this question, we asked
                    participants to press one button with a finger from the left hand and another
                    button with a finger from the right hand simultaneously. Participants'
                    goal was to generate a combined force that would match a target force as
                    accurately as possible. Different fingers have distinct strength and noise
                    characteristics, allowing us to examine if participants combined the two fingers
                    to minimize the overall effort or the overall variability. Prior studies have
                    been unable to dissociate these two factors, because they have focused on
                    movements without multi-effector redundancy, where noise always increases with
                    increasing levels of force. With our simple protocol, we show that subjects
                    coordinate the two fingers to minimize mainly effort, but also variability, in a
                    proportion of 7∶1. This result suggests that the nervous system learns
                    to coordinate different muscles or limbs by considering both effort and noise
                    information simultaneously. These results have important implications for
                    understanding how the brain relearns to coordinate movements following injury or
                    stroke.</p>

            <p>The motor system is highly redundant: the same task can always be accomplished by
                many different sequences of motor commands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000345-Bernstein1">[1]</xref>. Part of this
                redundancy is caused by the fact that there are often multiple muscles or effectors
                that can produce the same desired effect. Thus, in the case of multi-effector
                redundancy, the brain has to choose how to distribute a given task across the set of
                muscles.</p>
            <p>Despite the infinite number of possibilities, the motor system appears to prefer
                particular solutions. For example, when moving the wrist, we combine the action of
                different forearm muscles in a predictable, cosine-tuning-like fashion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000345-Hoffman1">[2]</xref>. To
                explain these regularities, we can ask why the brain is coordinating movements this
                way <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000345-Kording1">[3]</xref>,
                i.e. we can propose a hypothetical cost function that the biological system
                minimized over the course of learning. By determining the form of this cost
                function, and by assuming that the nervous system had sufficient exploration of the
                task dynamics to find an optimal solution, we can make testable predictions about
                how biological movements should be produced under a given task constraint.</p>
            <p>A number of different cost functions for biological movements have been proposed
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000345-Flash1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000345-Fagg1">[6]</xref>. Most of these studies
                have addressed movements for which the redundancy is temporal: here there may be
                only one muscle with the desired effect, but there are still many different ways of
                distributing the motor commands over the movement period. For example, of all the
                possible shapes of arm or eye movement, the motor system consistently chooses a
                bell-shaped velocity profile <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000345-Morasso1">[7]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Different components of cost functions can generally be divided into two classes:
                effort and variability costs. Effort costs usually take a form of the sum of the
                squared muscle activations or motor commands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000345-Todorov1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000345-Guigon1">[9]</xref>. Alternatively, both
                Harris and Wolpert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000345-Harris1">[5]</xref> and Burdet and Milner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000345-Burdet1">[10]</xref> proposed that the
                nervous system chooses the sequence of motor commands that minimizes the variability
                at the endpoint of a movement. Under the assumption of signal-dependent noise, i.e.
                noise that increases monotonically with the motor command, this model can predict
                important characteristics of the control of both arm and eye.</p>
            <p>While effort and variability costs have different theoretical implications for the
                learning mechanism that is involved in the optimization of motor behaviours, they
                make very similar predictions concerning the temporal shape of the optimal movement.
                Indeed, it can be shown that the requirement to reduce variability under signal
                dependent noise leads to a term in the cost function that penalizes the sum of the
                squared motor commands over the movement, identically to the term commonly
                associated with effort <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000345-Todorov2">[11]</xref>. Thus, for motor behaviours with mainly temporal
                redundancy, variability and effort costs are hard to dissociate.</p>
            <p>For motor behaviours with multi-effector redundancy, however, the minimization of
                variability costs and the minimization of effort costs can lead to substantially
                different predictions concerning the distribution of work across effectors, because
                the noise and effort characteristics of different effectors can be partly
                independent. Here we study how humans distribute work across different fingers when
                they have to produce a given target force. By measuring the independent noise
                characteristics and the maximal force of the finger, we can dissociate the influence
                of variability and effort costs on coordination.</p>

                    The goal of the task was to produce a certain total force to match a cursor to a

                    transducers. Participants used 4 possible finger combinations of index and
                    little fingers of the left and right hands. Participants had to maintain a
                    summed force level of 4, 8, 12 or 16 N for 7 s and were given points after each
                    trial, inversely proportional to their produced mean squared error. As a
                    variable of main interest, we analyzed the distribution of forces (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) across the two fingers for the last 5 s.</p>

                <p>Each participant produced a replicable distribution of force for each finger

                    distribution could be measured quite reliably
                    (SE = 0.015), there was considerable
                    between-person variability in the chosen solution. Furthermore, for lower force
                    levels, participants distributed the forces more evenly across the fingers, as
                    evidenced by the significant finger-combination x force-goal interaction,

                    first considered the idea that participants optimized their motor output to
                    simply minimize the expected squared error between the sum of produced forces (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and the goal (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). This term can be broken down into the systematic and
                    variable error.<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e005" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula></p>
                <p>We here assumed that the force produced by each finger (<italic>x</italic>) is
                    equal to the motor command (<italic>u</italic>) plus a noise component with a SD
                    of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We also assumed that the noise sources for the two fingers
                    are independent. The optimal distribution (for a full derivation see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) of forces for the finger combination
                        <italic>i, j</italic> is<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e007" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula></p>
                <p>To test this model, we measured the coefficient of variation (<italic>k</italic>)
                    for each of the fingers involved. We asked participants to produce a range of
                    force levels with each finger alone and measured the SD of the force produced
                    over a 5 s period. As shown for an exemplary finger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000345-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), the SD increased linearly with
                    force, allowing us to estimate the coefficient of variation as the slope of the
                    regression line (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Systematic
                    deviations from linearity were observed for small forces, where the coefficient
                    of variation was higher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000345-Slifkin1">[12]</xref>. Overall, the coefficients of variation (k)
                    were 1.11% (between subject
                    SD = 0.4) and 0.82%
                    (SD = 0.26) for left and right index fingers,
                    and 1.61% (SD = 0.66) and
                    1.31% (SD = 0.46) for left and right
                    little fingers, respectively.</p>
                <p>Based on these measurements, we can predict the theoretically optimal
                    distribution for each participant and finger combination and compare these to
                    the actual distribution produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000345-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). As can be seen by the deviation from the unity-line,
                    this parameter-free model predicted a much more asymmetric force distribution
                    than was observed. The model captures qualitatively, however, the correct
                    difference between the different finger combinations; for example, when a little
                    finger is combined with an index finger, the model correctly predicts a greater
                    contribution from the index. Furthermore, regression analysis within each finger
                    combination across participants (lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000345-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) showed some relationship between
                    the individual's ratio of noise coefficients (Eq. 2) and the
                    individuals chosen distribution of forces,
                    t(55) = 1.37,
                    p = .0871. Thus, although the variability-only
                    cost function clearly failed to predict the chosen distribution accurately,
                    these results indicate that variability may play a role in the choice of
                    distribution for each participant.</p>

                <title>Relative influence of effort and variability costs</title>
                <p>We therefore considered a cost function that also included terms to represent
                    effort. Effort is often conceptualized as the overall sum of the squared motor
                    commands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000345-Fagg1">[6]</xref>. Inclusion of such a term would predict a
                    symmetric distribution of forces across the fingers; when wanting to produce 10
                    N total, 5<sup>2</sup>+5<sup>2</sup> is the smallest sum of squares
                    possible. Biological systems that seek to minimize fatigue and energy
                    expenditure, however, will likely recruit the stronger effector more. Thus, it
                    has been suggested to normalize the motor commands by the maximum voluntary
                    contraction (MVC) of each muscle or effector before squaring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000345-Buchanan1">[13]</xref>.
                    Because we have no a-priori knowledge of which effort term is appropriate, we
                    allow here any mixture of the non-normalized effort (weighted by <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), normalized effort (weighted by <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), and the squared error (weighted by <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>):<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e011" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula></p>
                <p>With the introduction of the collective terms <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the optimal distribution can be expressed as:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e013" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula></p>
                <p>To estimate the weight of the normalized effort cost, we also measured the MVC
                    for each finger and participant (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). The mean MVC was 34.33 N
                    (SD = 10.50) and 36.94 N
                    (SD = 8.72) for the left and right index, and
                    17.74 N (SD = 7.58) and 19.93 N
                    (SD = 5.59) for left and right little finger
                    respectively. Thus, the MVC showed a similar difference between fingers as the
                    coefficient of variation <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Indeed, there was a clear relationship between MVC and
                    variability of each finger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000345-g002">Figure
                        2A</xref>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Thus, it is possible that any influence of variability onto
                    force sharing is caused indirectly by the fact that the less noisy fingers are
                    also stronger. We also observe, however, fingers that are relatively weak, but
                    nonetheless able to fairly accurately produce forces over the required force
                    range. Given this partial independence, we can ask whether the variability term
                    will contribute to the fit over and above the two effort terms.</p>

                <p>We therefore fit the full model to the data and used Markov Chain Monte Carlo
                    (MCMC, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) sampling to find
                    confidence bounds of the parameter estimates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000345-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). To make the size of the
                    parameters comparable - cost functions are inherently unit-less - we
                    standardized terms to give each a prior equal weighting and constrained the
                    parameters to sum to 1 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).
                    Therefore, the model had 2 free parameters. For all force levels, the
                    unnormalized effort (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) had the highest influence, whereas the two terms based on the
                    maximal strength (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and the coefficient of variation (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) were less important. However, both latter parameters were
                    significantly different from zero for all force levels (p&lt;0.05). The full
                    model predicts 55% of the remaining variance over a model that
                    includes only <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000345-g002">Figure
                    2B</xref>).</p>
                <p>To test whether the variability term contributed significantly to the fit, we
                    tested the full model against a model that only included the two effort terms.
                    To correct for the different numbers of free parameters, we used MCMC sampling
                    to estimate the marginal likelihood of each model (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). The full model provided a better explanation for
                    the data by a Bayes factor of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (strong evidence, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000345-Congdon1">[14]</xref>). All other models
                    including any one or two of the three possible cost terms were less likely than
                    this closest competitor (and the results were confirmed using AIC and
                    cross-validation, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000345.s001">Table S1</xref>). Thus, our data clearly shows the
                    influence of both effort and variability terms in determining the distribution
                    of work across effectors in a redundant motor task. Variability, however, only
                    contributed roughly 13% of the overall cost.</p>
                <p>For the given parameter estimates of effort and accuracy costs, the model also
                    predicts a very small systematic undershoot of the target (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) of 0.065%. The mean
                    observed undershoot was 0% in mean
                    (SD = 0.34%), not significantly
                    different from the prediction (p = .142). Thus,
                    a model in which participants attempt to minimize effort and the mean-squared
                    error can account for the data quite well.</p>

            <sec id="s2c">
                <title>Feedback control and independence of noise sources</title>
                <p>Our model relies on two simplifications. First, our model is purely feed-forward,
                    without consideration of feedback control. To test the influence of feedback, we
                    constructed a linear model in which the system could sense the sum of the forces
                    of the left and the right hand (delayed by 100 ms) and change the motor commands
                    in response. The motor commands influenced the forces via a double-exponential
                    low pass filter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000345-Todorov2">[11]</xref>. When solving the cost functions (Eq. 1,3)
                    for this system, the optimal solution comes no longer in form of optimal motor
                    commands (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), but in terms of optimal feedback gains (L). The motor
                    commands then become a linear function of the estimated state of the system <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000345-Todorov3">[15]</xref>.
                    When simulating this system in presence of noise, the average produced mean
                    force for each finger is identical to the solution of the simpler feed-forward
                    model used here.</p>
                <p>The second simplification is our assumption that the noise sources of the left
                    and the right finger are independent. This assumption is relatively hard to
                    test, as the correlation between the fingers is also influenced by the presence
                    of feedback corrections. Indeed, for the redundant task used here, optimal
                    feedback control predicts a negative correlation between the left and the right
                    hand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000345-Todorov1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000345-Diedrichsen1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000345-Domkin1">[17]</xref>.
                    This is because the optimal feedback gains allow variability in the
                    task-irrelevant dimension (the difference between the finger forces) to
                    accumulate, while minimizing the variability in the task-relevant dimension (the
                    sum of the finger forces). In accordance with this prediction, we found on
                    average a within-trial correlation between the two forces of
                    r = −.277 (between-subject
                    SD = .092).</p>
                <p>To determine whether this correlation was task-dependent, we used an independent
                    bimanual force production task, in which participants had to bring separate
                    lines, one for each finger, to two separate goals. Under a cost function that
                    penalized the squared deviation from the right and left targets independently,
                    the optimal feedback control law becomes independent for the two fingers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000345-Diedrichsen1">[16]</xref>. Therefore the produced forces in the task should
                    be uncorrelated. If, however, the noise of the two fingers was positively
                    correlated, we found in simulations that the correlation of the produced forces
                    should be correlated with roughly the same size. We then tested four
                    participants, producing all 16 combinations of 3,4,5, or 6 N with the left and
                    the right index fingers. In this independent force production task, we found no
                    significant within-trial correlation between the finger forces; the observed
                    mean correlation was r = .017 (between-subject
                    SD = .056). These results therefore indicate
                    that the noise source for the two fingers are close to independent and that
                    correlation between the fingers arises from task-dependent feedback control.</p>

                    bimanual trials. Using the same assumptions, we also determined the predicted
                    coefficient of variation for the actually produced force distribution (pred).
                    This calculation indicates that the solution that participants chose should have
                    only led to a 7.2% increase in SD compared to the lowest
                    theoretically achievable coefficient of variation.</p>
                <p>The actually produced coefficient of variation during bimanual trials (obs),
                    however, was another 6.8% higher than the latter predicted value,
                    t(59) = 2.55,
                    p = 0.013. This indicates that there is some
                    loss of accuracy due to simultaneous feedback control of two fingers. The
                    produced bimanual variability, however, was 8% smaller than that
                    produced by the better of the two fingers alone (left or right, whichever was
                    better for a particular finger combination),
                    t(59) = −2.49,
                    p = 0.015. Thus, while participants did not
                    fully achieve the predicted level of performance, our results demonstrate that
                    sharing the force between two fingers reduces overall motor variability.</p>

            <title>Discussion</title>
            <p>Our experiments show how effort and variability costs influence the way the brain
                distributes work across different effectors when different combinations can be used
                to accomplish the same task (multi-effector redundancy). It has been shown that the
                contribution of different arm muscles to the movement of the wrist joint can be
                explained using a cost function that includes the sum of squared motor commands
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000345-Fagg1">[6]</xref>.
                This work, however, could not determine the source of the costs. Here, we relied on
                the natural differences in noise and effort characteristics across different
                effectors to distinguish the influence of costs arising from effort and from
                variability of the produced outcome. Our results demonstrate that variability
                significantly influences coordination. If, however, the behaviour of participants
                was entirely determined by the minimization of variability, participants should have
                combined the fingers according to the ratio of the squared coefficient of variation
                of the two fingers. We observed a much more even distribution across fingers,
                indicating a substantial influence of effort in the optimization process. Using a
                formal model, we were able to estimate the weight given to variability and effort
                separately. To our surprise variability accounted for only 13% of the
                total cost function, although participants were clearly rewarded based on the
                squared error. The increase in variability that participants took into account
                through the high weighting of effort, however, was relatively small. This is partly
                because using the stronger finger more (minimizing the normalized effort costs) also
                reduced the variability, as stronger finger on average also had lower coefficient of
                variations.</p>
            <p>It is noteworthy that effort costs, the sum of squared motor commands, are not
                directly related to the minimization of energy. The energy expended by a muscle is
                related most closely related to the mechanical work (Nm), and under isometric
                condition to the sum of the produced forces over time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000345-Szentesi1">[18]</xref>. The main
                justification for using the squared motor commands is that this term, but not the
                simple sum of the forces, predicts motor behaviour well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000345-Fagg1">[6]</xref>. In our task, addition of
                a term that penalizes the sum of motor commands, would not have influenced the
                predictions concerning the force distribution, as any force distribution would be
                equivalent.</p>
            <p>The contrast of effort and variability costs has been extensively discussed in the
                literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000345-Harris1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000345-Guigon1">[9]</xref>. The relative importance of these two terms,
                however, has not been determined. This is because previous work has mostly focussed
                on movements, in which there are many ways to distribute motor commands across time
                (temporal redundancy). For this class of movements - under the assumption of
                signal-dependent noise - effort and variability costs predict the same or very
                similar temporal sequences of motor commands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000345-Todorov2">[11]</xref>.</p>
            <p>There is evidence, however, that a combination of variability and effort costs also
                determines the shape of temporally redundant movements. For example, participants
                increase impedance (stiffness) of the arm to compensate for unstable dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000345-Burdet2">[19]</xref>, thus
                indicating that variability can be minimized at the expense of effort. When dynamics
                become stable, impedance decreases again under the pressure of effort costs,
                sacrificing accuracy. A neurological disassociation between effort and variability
                costs has been recently observed with Parkinson's disease patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000345-Mazzoni1">[20]</xref>. The
                patient group showed no losses in accuracy, when matched for movement speed with a
                control group. When instructed, they were able to move as fast as control
                participants, however, their motor system appeared to be much more reluctant to do
                so, indicating that effort costs were set abnormally high. These results raise the
                possibility that variability and effort costs may be estimated in different
                structures of the nervous system.</p>
            <p>While a constant noise-to-signal ratio and quadratic cost function would predict that
                the distribution of force across the fingers was independent of the size of the
                goal, our data showed a more symmetric distribution of force across fingers for low
                force levels. This finding can be explained when taking into account that the SD for
                low force levels is higher than predicted by a simple linear relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000345-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000345-Slifkin1">[12]</xref>. This means that the
                derivative of the SD in respect to the motor command is lower for lower force
                levels, such that the importance of the measured constant k in determining force
                sharing should be reduced. Congruent with this prediction, we found lower estimates
                of the parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for lower force levels. Thus, our data provides evidence that
                participants have taken these nonlinearities into account when determining how to
                share forces between effectors.</p>
            <p>In summary, our results shows that both effort and variability costs are taken into
                account when solving the problem of multi-effector redundancy. By exploiting the
                natural variability of noise and force characteristics of different fingers, we
                provide insight into the dissociation of two determinants of motor behaviour that so
                far have been closely intertwined.</p>

                    participant was removed, as the person had difficulties to perform the unimanual
                    task with the little finger. We assessed handedness using 10 questions from the
                    Edinburgh Inventory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000345-Oldfield1">[21]</xref>. Three participants were left-handed. We
                    therefore also analyzed the data in terms of dominant/non-dominant hand with
                    qualitatively very similar results. Because the MVC and noise coefficients were

                <p>Participants sat in front of a computer monitor with forearms supported on a flat

                    Participants received continuous visual feedback about the total force produced
                    through a 20-mm white horizontal cursor line, shown on an LCD display. It moved

                    the transducer, starting 25 mm from the base of the screen (no force). The

                <p>At the start of each trial, a message on the screen indicated the fingers to be

                    at a height representing the required force level. The task was to apply the
                    required force level as accurately as possible for 7 seconds, after which the
                    target returned to the bottom of the screen. Feedback on the mean squared error,
                    calculated over the last 6 s was given as feedback at the end of each trial. A
                    running score for the current block of trials, with the number of points
                    inversely related to the mean squared error, was presented throughout the
                    experiment.</p>
                <p>The experiment was split into 12 blocks of 48 trials run over 2 sessions
                    separated by 1–9 days. Blocks alternated between the unimanual (see
                    noise measurements) and bimanual conditions. In every bimanual block, all 4
                    possible finger combinations were tested sequentially. The sequence of
                    combination within each block was determined pseudo-randomly. Each combination
                    was tested 3 times with force goals set at 4, 8, 12 or 16 N; the sequence of
                    goal levels was fully randomized.</p>
                <p>A set of separate participants was studied in an independent force production

                    on each finger to the goal on that side. Every of the 16 force combinations of
                    the levels 3,4,5 and 6 N was repeated 8 times during the experiment, only using

                    were tested at 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, or 12.5 N. Due to the force limitations, for
                    the little fingers, the 12.5 N target was not included. Each target was tested
                    twice for each finger. The SD for the force produced was calculated over the

                <p>Therefore, we first considered a cost function in which participants simply
                    attempted to achieve the lowest squared error (Eq. 1).

                <p>Secondly, we constructed a cost function that included both variability and

To
                    make the weighting factors comparable across the 3 different terms, we added
                    normalization factors<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e040" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(6)</label></disp-formula>with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. While the scaling of each component does not change the

                    numerical estimate for each parameter would be the same if the terms had equal
                    influence on the chosen solution. Because cost functions are unit-less, and an
                    overall scaling factor does not matter, we constrained the sum of the free

                    predictions, we constrained the sum of all involved weighting parameters to be
                    1, thereby reducing the number of free parameters. Assuming Gaussian noise with
                    variance <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the log-likelihood of the observed force distributions <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, under the model <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the model parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the corresponding prediction <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (Eq. 4) becomes<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e051" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(8)</label></disp-formula></p>
                <p>For each model we found the maximum-likelihood estimates for the free parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by maximising Eq. 8 numerically. To approximate the posterior
                    distribution of the parameters for each model <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (assuming equal prior probability of all models), we drew
                    10000 MCMC samples of parameter values <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000345-Congdon1">[14]</xref> using the
                    exponential of Eq. 8 as a non-normalized posterior distribution, and discarded
                    the first 200 samples. From the remaining samples, we calculated 95%
                    confidence intervals of the parameters, depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000345-g002">Figure 2C</xref>. For model comparison we also
                    estimated the marginal likelihood <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, by averaging the exponential of Eq. 8 over all MCMC samples.
                    The Bayes-factor <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> between model <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is then the likelihood ratio of the two models, allowing for a
                    model comparison that takes into account the number of free parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000345-Congdon1">[14]</xref>.<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000345.e057" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(13)</label></disp-formula></p>
