</abstract><abstract>
<p>Vertebrate body designs rely on hydroxyapatite as the principal mineral component of relatively light-weight, articulated endoskeletons and sophisticated tooth-bearing jaws, facilitating rapid movement and efficient predation. Biological mineralization and skeletal growth are frequently accomplished through proteins containing polyproline repeat elements. Through their well-defined yet mobile and flexible structure polyproline-rich proteins control mineral shape and contribute many other biological functions including Alzheimer's amyloid aggregation and prolamine plant storage. In the present study we have hypothesized that polyproline repeat proteins exert their control over biological events such as mineral growth, plaque aggregation, or viscous adhesion by altering the length of their central repeat domain, resulting in dramatic changes in supramolecular assembly dimensions. In order to test our hypothesis, we have used the vertebrate mineralization protein amelogenin as an exemplar and determined the biological effect of the four-fold increased polyproline tandem repeat length in the amphibian/mammalian transition. To study the effect of polyproline repeat length on matrix assembly, protein structure, and apatite crystal growth, we have measured supramolecular assembly dimensions in various vertebrates using atomic force microscopy, tested the effect of protein assemblies on crystal growth by electron microscopy, generated a transgenic mouse model to examine the effect of an abbreviated polyproline sequence on crystal growth, and determined the structure of polyproline repeat elements using 3D NMR. Our study shows that an increase in PXX/PXQ tandem repeat motif length results (i) in a compaction of protein matrix subunit dimensions, (ii) reduced conformational variability, (iii) an increase in polyproline II helices, and (iv) promotion of apatite crystal length. Together, these findings establish a direct relationship between polyproline tandem repeat fragment assemblies and the evolution and the design of vertebrate mineralized tissue microstructures. Our findings reveal that in the greater context of chordate evolution, the biological control of apatite growth by polyproline-based matrix assemblies provides a molecular basis for the evolution of the vertebrate body plan.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The microstructure of vertebrate bones and teeth is controlled by polyproline-rich protein matrices (such as amelogenin) that serve as a scaffold to control the assembly of biological apatites. In tooth enamel, amphibians have large amelogenin subunits and thin enamel while mammals have smaller amelogenin subunits in tandem with elongated crystals and complex prismatic organization. Using specific peptides and frog amelogenin overexpressed in mice, we confirmed the effect of the length of the elongated polyproline repeat on reduced matrix subunit dimensions and enhanced apatite crystal length. Three-dimensional structures solved by NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) and surface modeling algorithms indicate that elongated polyproline repeat stretches in amelogenins affect the dimensions of the supramolecular matrix through an increase in polyproline II helices, resulting in a compaction of supramolecular subunit dimensions. We propose that the availability of readily shaped apatites and innovative mechanisms based on amelogenin-repeat motifsthat compartmentalize and shape biological minerals was essential for the rise of early vertebrates, enabling the manufacture of strong teeth and backbones that might have given vertebrates a decisive survival advantage in the competition for food and in the sophistication of locomotion.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Proline-rich regions occur in a wide variety of functionally significant proteins, including mucins, snow flea antifreeze proteins, prolamine storage proteins, pancreatic polypeptide hormones, neuropeptides, Alzheimer amyloid, prion proteins, and tooth enamel proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Stapley1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Lin1">[2]</xref>. Many proline-rich proteins contain repetitive motifs and adopt left-handed polyproline II helical conformations (PPII) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Fraser1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Williamson1">[4]</xref>. These PPII helices are more mobile than other periodic structures, e.g. α-helices or β-sheets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Adzhubei1">[5]</xref>, but nevertheless exhibit well-defined molecular backbone conformation due to the rigidity of the proline ring. The well-defined yet mobile and flexible structure of polyprolines has led to the hypothesis that such proteins may function as mineral-binding domains, protein-protein docking domains, or internal molecular spacers during the formation of biological minerals and other biocomposites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Zhang1">[6]</xref>. Remarkably, proline-rich, tripeptide tandem repeat proteins participate on all levels of biological mineralization and include members as diverse as the <italic>Haliotis rufescens</italic> protein Lustrin A involved in the extracellular deposition of shell and pearl, the <italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic> protein SM50 contributing to the mineralization of sea urchin teeth and spicules from magnesium calcite and protodolomite, as well as vertebrate collagen I and the tetrapod tooth enamel protein amelogenin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Zhang1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Zheng1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>The rise of vertebrates coincides with the emergence of revolutionary body designs that rely on hydroxyapatite as the principal mineral component of bones and teeth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Simkiss1">[8]</xref>. Vertebrates use apatites to form relatively light-weight, articulated endoskeletons and sophisticated tooth-bearing jaws, facilitating rapid movement and efficient predation. A large degree of flexibility (Greek: apatite = deceit) allows apatites to be readily shaped by proline-rich proteins such as collagen I and the tooth enamel protein amelogenin.</p>
<p>Apatite mineral growth and habit in vertebrate enamel are controlled by a unique proline-rich protein, amelogenin, which forms the majority of the developing enamel matrix (about 95%) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Diekwisch1">[9]</xref>. A recent study has shed new light on the organization of this relatively unstructured protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Delak1">[10]</xref>. Other studies have indicated that amelogenin self-assembly might be mediated by a complementary relationship between the hydrophobic and PPII helical regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Lakshminarayanan1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Lakshminarayanan2">[12]</xref>. Difficulties in obtaining protein crystals suitable for X-ray crystallography have prompted a series of studies using circular dichroism (CD), NMR, Raman spectroscopy, and molecular modeling studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Margolis1">[13]</xref>. Earlier CD, FTIR, and Raman spectroscopy experiments suggested mixed β-sheet/β-turn/helix and random coil structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Zheng1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Renugopalakrishnan1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Sogah1">[15]</xref> with extended β-spiral/poly-L-proline type II (PPII) helical structures in the midsection of amelogenin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Margolis1">[13]</xref>. The importance of the amelogenin N-terminus for amelogenin self-assembly has been confirmed by yeast-two-hybrid studies and biochemical analysis of the two serine residues in positions 16 and 25 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-MoradianOldak1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Paine1">[17]</xref>. Based on solid state NMR data, the amelogenin carboxy-terminal domain appears to be oriented next to the hydroxyapatite crystal surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Shaw1">[18]</xref>. Loss of the carboxy-terminus as it occurs during amelogenin proteolytic processing has been associated with a reduced affinity to hydroxyapatite and a reduction in the ability to inhibit crystal growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Aoba1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-MoradianOldak2">[20]</xref>. Recent crystal growth studies suggest that the carboxy-terminus is important for the alignment of crystals into parallel arrays while the remainder of the molecule plays a role in the inhibition of crystals growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Beniash1">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>With the emergence of prismatic enamel in mammals, the length of amelogenin polyproline tri-peptide repeats increases significantly, suggesting that the augmentation of amelogenin proline-rich regions is governed by evolutionary trends. The augmentation in polyproline repeat length occurs within the proline-rich amelogenin peptide (PRAP, i.e. the region from AA46–AA166), which is comprised of an evolutionary “hotspot” containing a series of PXX tandem repeats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Bonass1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Delgado1">[23]</xref>. The rapid evolution of the PRAP from amphibian to mammals was primarily accomplished by insertions of PXX tripeptide motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Sire1">[24]</xref>, with PXQ as the most frequent tripeptide sequence element. In these extended polyproline repeat structures, both proline and glutamine cause structural rigidity of the newly added tripeptide complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Anishetty1">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>The unique occurrence of elongated polyproline stretches and amelogenin protein assembly in the evolution of the vertebrate dentition prompted us to ask the question of whether repeat length and self-assembly dimensions were related and whether there was any association between polyproline repeat motif length and structural changes in mineral shape and matrix organization. In order to ask this question, we compared polyproline repeat length and amelogenin nanosphere dimensions between vertebrates and generated a number of biomimetic peptides. We then tested the relationship between mammalian and amphibian polyproline repeat length, nanosphere assembly, and crystal growth in a frog amelogenin overexpressing mouse model. Finally, we determined the 3D NMR structure of the amelogenin repeat region to identify unique structural motifs explaining the correlation between amelogenin self-assembly and polyproline repeat length. In the present study we are demonstrating that the unique ability of polyproline motifs to shape biological minerals lies in their ability to alter protein matrix self-assembly. We are arguing that in the greater context of chordate evolution, the biological control of apatite growth by polyproline-based matrix assemblies provides a molecular basis for the evolution of the vertebrate body plan.</p>

<title>Non-Mammalian Amelogenins Contain Fewer Proline Tripeptide Repeat Sequences Than Mammals</title>
<p>PXX repeat element organization is highly conserved between mammals (e.g., Homo, Mus), reptiles (e.g., Elaphe, Paleosuchus), and amphibians (e.g., Xenopus, Rana) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000262-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). There were fewer PXX repeat elements in amphibians, while several mammalian species (e.g., ruminants and marsupials) featured PXX repeat numbers exceeding those found in humans or mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000262-g001">Figure 1A, 1B</xref>). A comparison with known amelogenin sequences indicated that the number of PXX repeats in the frog <italic>Rana pipiens</italic> was significantly shorter than the PXX repeat number in mice, goats, or steers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000262-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). This comparison indicates a potential trend toward increased polyproline repeat length with increasingly sophisticated enamel structures in vertebrates.</p>

<p>(A) Conservation and evolution of the tooth enamel protein amelogenin. Note the high conservation of PXX repeat elements among mammals (e.g., Homo, Mus), reptiles (e.g., Elaphe, Paleosuchus), and amphibians (e.g., Xenopus, Rana) (light and dark grey shaded areas). The conserved PXX majority repeat region served as a blueprint for our designer peptides PXX12, PXX24, and PXX33. In addition, a fourth designer peptide (PQA) was synthesized in which glutamine was replaced by alanine. (B) Increase in PXQ PXX repeat region length from amphibians to rodents and then once more to ruminants. (C) Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of extracted enamel proteins from diverse vertebrate species. Note the increase in aggregate (nanosphere) dimensions from bovine to goat to mouse and to frog.

<title>Species with Long Amelogenin PXX Repeat Stretches Have Smaller Nanospheres Than Those with Short Polyproline Repeat Regions</title>
<p>In order to determine whether changes in PXX repeat length were associated with changes in supramolecular enamel protein assembly dimensions in nature, we compared repeat length and supramolecular assembly dimensions from four selected vertebrate species using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000262-g001">Figure 1B–D</xref>). Native enamel matrix proteins from frog (<italic>Rana pipiens</italic>), mouse (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>), goat (<italic>Capra hircus</italic>), and bovine (<italic>Bos taurus</italic>) were chosen to represent increasing PXX repeat length in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000262-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Both the AFM and the DLS analysis demonstrated that enamel protein supramolecular assembly dimensions gradually decreased by 60% from frog to bovine, while PXX length gradually increased by 250% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000262-g001">Figure 1B–D</xref>), suggesting an inverse correlation between polyproline repeat length and enamel protein 3D-assembly dimensions in the evolution of vertebrate enamel proteins.</p>

<title>PXX Designer Peptide Length Determines Apatite Crystal Growth</title>
<p>In order to determine the effect of polyproline designer peptides of increasing length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000262-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) on apatite crystal growth, crystals were grown in the presence of PXX polyproline designer peptides or amelogenins. Addition of PXX designer peptides to the crystallization solution resulted in the formation of needle-shaped crystallites, and longer PXX repeat motifs corresponded with increased crystal length (PXX12: 21.6±6.5 nm, PXX24: 42.9±8.5 nm, PXX33: 102.1±36.3 nm). Addition of recombinant full-length amelogenin (rM180) resulted in the formation of elongated crystals of 106.2±19.3 nm length. Hydroxyapatite crystals grown without any addition of protein measured 8.2±3.9 nm in length while the 33 mer glutamine/alanine replacement polypeptide PQA yielded flake-like particles with broad diffraction rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000262-g002">Figure 2A, 2D</xref>). There were distinct differences in diffraction patterns between crystals grown under the control of various additives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000262-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The control only showed diffuse diffraction patterns indicative of amorphous calcium phosphate. Both the PXX12 and the PQA sample also revealed only diffuse diffraction rings. The PXX24 treated sample featured a preferred orientation in the 002 plane and a diffuse reflection ring in the 210 plane. Both the PXX33 and the amelogenin treated samples displayed sharp rings in both the 002 and the 210 plane. There was also a very faint reflection ring in the 104 plane of the PXX24, the PXX33, and the amelogenin samples. These findings demonstrate that PXX designer peptides with increased length yield significantly longer apatite crystals with diffraction patterns similar to those of developing enamel apatite crystals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Diekwisch3">[29]</xref>. Specifically, 12 mer polyproline repeat stretches were associated with amorphous apatite while stretches of 24 mer and above featured a crystalline mineral phase. They also document that PXX polyproline peptides alone exert a profound control on apatite crystal growth. We interpret these results to indicate that the polyproline backbone of elongated PXX repeat peptides enhances protein matrix structural rigidity, resulting in an inhibition of epitaxial apatite crystal growth on a- and b-axis surfaces while promoting apatite crystal growth in c-axis direction.</p>

<title>Hydroxyapatite crystal growth control and self-assembly of polyproline designer peptides.</title>
<p>(A and D) Effect of polyproline designer peptides on hydroxyapatite (HAP) crystal growth. Increasing length of designer peptides from PXX12 to PXX33 resulted in elongated HAP crystal (A). HAP crystals grown with PXX33 were similar in length to those grown with full-length amelogenin. The PQA glutamine/alanine replacement peptide resulted in thin plates unlike the needles grown with PXX repeat peptides. HAP control solutions incubated without protein formed spherical deposits. Crystal dimensions are documented in (D). Bar = 200 nm. Electron diffraction analysis of PXX24, PXX33, and amelogenin treated samples resulted in sharp and distinct reflection rings in the 002 and 210 planes and an additional faint ring in the 104 plane, similar to those found in developing enamel crystals. Control crystals and those grown in the presence of PXX12 and PQA only showed faint diffraction patterns. (B, C, and E) Effect of polyproline designer peptide length on supramolecular matrix assemblies. Both TEM and AFM analyses indicated that matrix subunit dimensions were significantly reduced with increasing designer peptide length (from PXX12 to PXX33). Full-length amelogenins formed sizable nanospheres measuring 27 nm by AFM and 13 nm by TEM in diameter. Matrix dimensions and assembly patterns of the PQA glutamine/alanine replacement peptide were significantly different from their PXX33 counterparts. Buffer control solutions did not assemble into nanosphere-like structures. All measurements in this study were statistically evaluated and displayed using standard deviation (s.d.). Bar (TEM) = 25 nm, (AFM) = 50 nm.</p>

<title>PXX Designer Peptide Length Determines Supramolecular Matrix Assembly</title>
<p>In order to further understand the mechanisms by which polyproline repeat peptides affect crystal growth, we decided to test the effect of polypeptide length on protein matrix organization. In previous studies we demonstrated that the extracellular protein matrix of developing tooth enamel provides a complex supramolecular biomineralization template that directly controls enamel crystal formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Diekwisch1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Diekwisch2">[26]</xref>. Here we once more used our PXX12, PXX24, and PXX33 peptides to ask the question whether the length of these polypeptides affects organic matrix organization. In order to address this question, protein assemblies on coated carbon grids were studied using transmission electron micrographs (TEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000262-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition, AFMs of proteins in solution were generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000262-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Our results demonstrated that protein matrix nanosphere diameters were 17.9±2.7 nm<sup>AFM</sup> (10.1±1.2 nm<sup>TEM</sup>) for PXX12, 13.9±2.6 nm<sup>AFM</sup> (6.1±0.8 nm<sup>TEM</sup>) for PXX24, and 9.2±1.9 nm<sup>AFM</sup> (4.0±0.5 nm<sup>TEM</sup>) for PXX33. Nanosphere diameters of the two controls were 27.3±4.6 nm<sup>AFM</sup> (13.3±1.5 nm<sup>TEM</sup>) for the recombinant full-length mouse amelogenin control (rM180) and 15.1±2.8 nm<sup>AFM</sup> (8.8±1.9 nm<sup>TEM</sup>) for the 33 mer glutamine/alanine replacement polypeptide PQA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000262-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). In average, TEM nanosphere dimensions were about 50% of their AFM counterparts, a difference that might be explained by the differences in sample preparation between the dissolved protein used for AFM and the dried TEM sample. Sample buffers did not yield any significant substructures. Both AFM and TEM data demonstrated that nanosphere diameters decreased with increasing peptide length, i.e. PXX33 nanospheres measured about half the size of PXX12 nanospheres and were double as densely packed. This apparent readiness of extended PPII helices to assume a high level of compaction might be explained by a dramatic reduction in conformational entropy in such an assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Ferreon1">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>A comparison of mouse and frog amelogenin sequences indicated that the number of prolines was 34 and 27 in mouse and <italic>Rana pipiens</italic> PRAPs, respectively, and that the major difference between mouse and frog amelogenins was a 33% higher number of PXX repeat motifs in mice versus frogs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000262-g001">Figure 1A, 1B</xref>). Glutamine is the second most likely residue to appear in a PPII helix segment (second to proline) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Williamson1">[4]</xref> and thus a likely partner to interact with prolines in the function of PPII helices. We were thus interested in testing the effect of glutamines on the macromolecular assembly of polyprolines. Remarkably, when the 5 glutamines in PXX33 were exchanged with alanine substitutes (PQA peptide), nanosphere diameters about doubled and electron density distribution on micrographs was drastically altered. The 33 mer glutamine/alanine replacement polypeptide PQA did not yield any HAP crystals of measurable length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000262-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The loss of HAP crystal extensions underscores the importance of glutamine insertions in the overlying polyproline repeat sequence for crystal growth. The glutamine substitutions with alanine, effectively reversing the effect of extended polyproline macromolecular compaction found in PXX stretches, also indicate that glutamines play a pivotal role in the compaction of PPII helices as they occur in many biological systems, including biominerals.</p>

<title>Disturbed Enamel Formation and Greater Supramolecular Enamel Matrix Dimensions in Frog Amelogenin Expressing Mice</title>

On a molecular level, the emergence of prismatic enamel organization during the amphibian/reptile to mammal transition has been paralleled by a significant increase in amelogenin PXX repeat length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000262-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Toyosawa1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Wang2">[36]</xref>. We have thus hypothesized that the unique arrangement of elongated mammalian apatite crystals into prisms is a result of PXX repeat length in the PRAP. In order to examine the effect of a shortened polyproline repeat amelogenin on mouse enamel formation, <italic>Rana pipiens</italic> amelogenin expressing mice (fAmel-x-null mice) were generated by cross-breeding amelogenin null mice with <italic>Rana pipiens</italic> amelogenin transgenic overexpressors to prevent the normal mouse amelogenin background from interfering with the transgenic phenotype. In this model, frog amelogenins were cleaved in a very similar fashion to their murine counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000262-g003">Figure 3J</xref>). Enamel of first mandibular molar from five amelogenin null, fAmel-x-null, and wild-type mice each was analyzed and compared between groups. The phenotype in frog amelogenin overexpressors that were not crossed with null mice (fAmel) was less severe and thus not used for further analysis. Amelogenin null mice, which were used as a control, only featured a rudimentary mineral deposit on the surface of the underlying dentin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000262-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Comparison between first mandibular molar enamel of fAmel-x-null mice and wild-type controls demonstrated 50.3% reduced enamel thickness and grossly altered enamel prism structure including massive patches of fused crystallites, especially in the coronal half of the fAmel-x-null enamel layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000262-g003">Figure 3C, 3E</xref> versus 3D, 3F). We attribute this change in enamel prism pattern to a drastic reduction of PXX repeat stretches in the frog amelogenin compared to its mouse counterpart, resulting in an impairment of protein assemblies to coat and package individual elongated crystallites. The prism-less organization of fAmel-x-null enamel also somewhat resembled the prism-less structure of frog enamel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000262-g003">Figure 3E</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000262-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting that amelogenins with elongated polyproline stretches might be one requirement for prismatic enamel. Enamel matrix nanosphere diameters were 20.9±2.6 nm in fAmel-x-null mice and 14.0±1.9 nm in their wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000262-g003">Figure 3G–3I</xref>). As a result, enamel matrix nanosphere dimensions in fAmel-x-null mice exceeded those of controls by 50.1%. These findings are corroborated by DLS-based comparisons demonstrating significantly larger frog amelogenin nanospheres compared to mouse amelogenin nanospheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000262-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Together, these studies document that the presence of increased length of polyproline repeat stretches in mammalian amelogenins is associated with both reduced macromolecular assembly dimensions and sophisticated mammalian enamel crystal/prism structure. Alterations in prism organization as seen as a result of elongated polyproline stretches may also entail additional mechanisms not highlighted in the present study. Cellular effects such as changes in cell movement pattern or in ameloblast morphology might also contribute to the phenotype observed and other portions of the amelogenin molecule are likely to be involved in amelogenin nanosphere assembly as well, even though their exact contributions remain to be established.</p>

<p>Note the prism-less organization of frog enamel (A) and the complete loss of structured enamel in the amelogenin null mice (B). In these scanning electron micrographs, enamel (en) and dentin (de) were labeled for orientation purposes. Frog amelogenin overexpressing offspring crossed with amelogenin null mice (fAmel-x-null) demonstrated reduced enamel thickness (C/E versus D/F) and grossly altered enamel prism structure with fused individual crystallites, especially in the coronal half of the transgenic enamel layer (C/E versus D/F). Notably, fAmel-x-null mouse enamel lacked the regularly intercrossed prism pattern found in wild-type mouse molars (C/E versus D/F). In order to compare the effect of frog amelogenins on enamel matrix structure when compared to mouse amelogenins, enamel matrix nanosphere diameters were determined on transmission electron micrographs from the enamel matrix of developing mouse first mandibular molars (G–I). Subunits measured 20.9±2.6 nm in frog enamel chimera and 13.9±1.9 nm in their wild-type controls (G–I). Enamel matrix nanosphere dimensions in fAmel-x-null enamel exceeded those of regular mouse enamel by about 50%.

<title>Elongated Amelogenin-Based PXX Repeat Peptides Feature Left-Handed PPII Helices, Reduced Structural Variability, and Reduced Electrostatic Potential</title>
<p>In order to identify unique structural features and to explore the effect of repeat motif elongation on enamel matrix organization, we have performed a series of structural analyses based on the longest PRAP-derived designer peptide PXX33. In the absence of amelogenin X-ray crystallography data, CD, FTIR, and Raman spectroscopy studies have suggested mixed β-sheet/β-turn/helix and random coil structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Zheng1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Lowenstam1">[37]</xref> with extended β-spiral/poly-L-proline type II (PPII) helical structures in the PRAP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Delak1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Lakshminarayanan2">[12]</xref>. In order to determine structural features of the PRAP-derived PXX33 polypeptide, NMR analysis was performed and chemical shifts of 20 out of 33 amino acid residues of the PXX33 peptide were completely or partially assigned (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000262.s002">Table S1</xref>), providing a basis for subsequent NOE (Nuclear Overhauser Effect) analysis. Using Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY), a total of 151 (NOE) definitive restricts were obtained, including 20 intra-amino acid residues and 100 neighbor amino acids [dN(i, i+1)], 24 dN(i, i+2), 5 dN(i, i+3), and 2 dN(i, i+4) NOEs. No long distance NOEs were detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000262.s003">Table S2</xref>). Analysis of chemical shifts and NOE patterns did not reveal any typical α-helix or β-strand secondary structures.</p>
<p>In order to calculate and analyze the three-dimensional structure of the PXX33 peptide at atomic resolution, NOE constrains were entered into the DYANA software package to calculate a total of 200 candidate structures. There was a fairly high backbone root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 7.51±1.51 Å and a heavy atom RMSD of 8.56±1.54 Å between the 200 candidate structures investigated. The absence of long distance NOEs suggest that PXX33 forms extended structures in aqueous solution while the high RMSD values imply a lack of well-defined conformations. In order to illustrate the similarities and slight variation between individual candidate structures, five structures representing lowest energy conformations were plotted together and superimposed using the MolMol software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000262-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Our analysis revealed significantly higher structural variability at the PXX33 N-terminus representing the PXX12 polypeptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000262-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The high structural variability between various conformations in the PXX12 region might be one of the reasons for the larger size and irregular boundaries of the PXX12 nanospheres compared to their PXX24 and PXX33 counterparts. Further analysis of individual lowest energy conformations revealed three left-handed extended PPII helices (PPII-1, P13–P16; PPII-2, P19–P22; PPII-3, P28–P31) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000262-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), which were identified using the following criteria: (i) left-handedness, (ii) 3 amino acid residues per turn, and (iii) 3.1 Å per residue advance (9.3 Å per turn). Individual PPII turns measured 8.8 Å (PPII-1), 9.3 Å (PPII-2), and 9.45 Å (PPII-3). These were four residue-length PPII helices in which the proline rings at the positions i and i+3 were oriented in the same direction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Stapley1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Zagrovic1">[38]</xref>. The presence of three PPII helices in the amino acid region 13–33 and the absence of PPII helices in the PXX12 stretch might be another reason for the enormous compaction observed in PXX33 supramolecular assemblies compared to PXX12 and PXX24 counterparts as PPII helices have been associated with unusual structural compactness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Zagrovic1">[38]</xref>.</p>

<p>Several other factors may also explain the dramatic compaction of PXX33 supramolecular assemblies compared to aggregates formed by shorter polypeptides. It is widely accepted that hydrophobic free energy is a major force driving peptide-peptide interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Baldwin1">[39]</xref>. The surface of the larger PXX33 peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000262-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) is at least as hydrophobic as the smaller PXX12 peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000262-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), and its increased surface area provides more contacts for interaction and more van der Waals attraction. An increased attraction between the larger peptides would be consistent with the formation of aggregates with higher density, which was observed experimentally. Another factor contributing to the reduced size of PXX33 assemblies might be their reduced mobility, especially in light of the flexibility of polyproline structures in solution. The mean thermal velocity of a peptide due to Brownian motion is inversely proportional to the square root of its mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-McQuarrie1">[40]</xref>, resulting in smaller peptides in an aggregate to impact each other with higher frequency, which in turn would weaken the strength of the aggregate and reduce its density.</p>

<title>Perspective</title>
<p>Already Hellenistic culture knew of the enormous adaptability, variability, and flexibility of apatites, using the word απαταω (to deceive) in reference to the similarities between apatites and other minerals. Five hundred million years earlier, during the Ordovician, the first vertebrates took advantage of these versatile minerals as building blocks for newly designed endoskeletal backbones and teeth. The incorporation of apatites into early vertebrate body designs was likely facilitated by SPARC and SPARCL1 as ancestors of SCPP mineralization proteins that arose at the same time by tandem duplication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Kawasaki1">[41]</xref>. These early SPARC proteins might have served as templates for insertion-based repeat length expansion as it is associated with the generation of intrinsically unstructured proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Tompa1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Fondon1">[43]</xref>. The significant variation in enamel structure and polyproline repeat length among mammals (e.g. between ruminants, dolphins, and rodents) indicates that polyproline length not only increases from amphibians to mammals but also varies significantly among mammals, perhaps in response to various functional loads. While neither the use of apatites nor the presence of proline-repeat polypeptides are unique for vertebrate mineralized tissues, vertebrates were nevertheless first in using polyproline repeat proteins to orchestrate the deposition of apatites into endoskeletal mineralized tissues. Microstructured apatites incorporated into innovative, highly flexible body plans not only gave these comparatively diminutive creatures a survival advantage over heavily armored organisms from the same period but also provided a mineral substrate for the evolution of teeth as powerful tools facilitating predation and food apprehension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000262-Gans1">[44]</xref>–.</p>
<p>The ability of polyproline fragments alone to self-assemble and to guide apatite crystal growth in C-axis dimension raises the question about the role of the N-terminal and C-terminal amelogenin flanking domains. Here we propose that the flexible yet rigid structure of polyproline-rich assemblies provides a dynamic molecular packaging material between elongating mineral crystals. The evolution of elaborate mammalian enamel prisms as well as the design of the first vertebrate endoskeletons might thus be a result of sophisticated supramolecular polyproline matrices that insulate, guide, and package individual apatite crystals. Mirroring nature, the suitability of polyproline designer peptides to modulate apatite crystal growth emerges as a novel design concept for biomimetic enamel scaffolds and enamel tissue engineering.</p>
