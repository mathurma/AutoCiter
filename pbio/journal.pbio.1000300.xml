Specific depletion of Nmnat2 is sufficient to induce Wallerian-like degeneration of uninjured axons which endogenous Nmnat1 and Nmnat3 cannot prevent. Nmnat2 is by far the most labile Nmnat isoform and is depleted in distal stumps of injured neurites before Wallerian degeneration begins. Nmnat2 turnover is equally rapid in injured <italic>Wld</italic><sup>S</sup> neurites, despite delayed neurite degeneration, showing it is not a consequence of degeneration and also that Wld<sup>S</sup> does not stabilize Nmnat2. Depletion of Nmnat2 below a threshold level is necessary for axon degeneration since exogenous Nmnat2 can protect injured neurites when expressed at high enough levels to overcome its short half-life. Furthermore, proteasome inhibition slows both Nmnat2 turnover and neurite degeneration. We conclude that endogenous Nmnat2 prevents spontaneous degeneration of healthy axons and propose that, when present, the more long-lived, functionally related Wld<sup>S</sup> protein substitutes for Nmnat2 loss after axon injury.

</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>In a normally functioning neuron, the cell body supplies the axon with materials needed to keep it healthy. This complex logistical activity breaks down completely after injury and often becomes compromised in neurodegenerative diseases, leading to degeneration of the isolated axon. Whilst there are probably many important cargoes delivered from the cell body that isolated axons cannot exist without indefinitely, proteins that are short-lived will be depleted first, so loss of these proteins is likely to act as a trigger for degeneration. Using clues from a mutant mouse whose axons are protected from such degeneration, we have identified delivery of Nmnat2, a protein with an important enzyme activity, as a limiting factor in axon survival. Importantly, Nmnat2 is very labile and its levels decline rapidly in injured axons before they start to degenerate. Even uninjured axons degenerate in a similar way without it. These properties are consistent with loss of Nmnat2 being a natural stimulus for axon degeneration, and it might therefore be a suitable target for therapeutic intervention.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The endogenous molecular trigger for Wallerian degeneration remains unknown. Recent progress towards understanding how the slow Wallerian degeneration fusion protein (Wld<sup>S</sup>) delays degeneration of injured and sick axons has not addressed this wider question <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Araki1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Yahata1">[8]</xref>, and this aberrant protein is only expressed in a few strains of mouse, rat, and fly. Knowledge of the normal regulation of axon survival in wild-type animals should not only lead to greater mechanistic insight but could also have important therapeutic implications for axon protection since pharmacological manipulation of endogenous processes is likely to be more achievable than overexpression of exogenous proteins.</p>
<p>Many stresses that induce Wallerian or Wallerian-like degeneration involve a partial or complete block of axonal transport. Since transport is bi-directional, degeneration could be triggered by failed anterograde delivery of essential survival factors or by failed removal of harmful substances by retrograde transport. Defective anterograde transport seems more directly associated with axon loss than dysfunctional retrograde transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-ChevalierLarsen1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Zhao1">[13]</xref>. Therefore, extending an old model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Lubinska1">[14]</xref>, we propose a “survival factor delivery hypothesis” of axon degeneration. We suggest that axon integrity requires continuous anterograde delivery of one or more labile, cell body–synthesized survival factors. Other axonal components should be dispensable, more long-lived, or synthesized locally. Once supply is disrupted, following injury or other insult, levels of the limiting survival factor(s) will drop below a critical threshold due to natural turnover, activating an intrinsic axon degeneration program.</p>
<p>This model has several attractions. First, the initial latent phase of Wallerian degeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Lubinska1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Beirowski2">[15]</xref> would reflect the rate of survival factor turnover before the critical threshold is reached. Second, altered turnover would explain how low temperature and proteasome inhibition extend this latent phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-MacInnis1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Zhai1">[18]</xref>. Finally, redistribution of the remaining survival factor(s) in the distal stump by axonal transport could underlie the progressive nature of Wallerian degeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Lubinska1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Beirowski3">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Kerschensteiner1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>No such endogenous survival factor has been identified, but the <italic>Wld</italic><sup>S</sup> protective mechanism offers important clues. Wld<sup>S</sup> contains the N-terminal 70 amino acids of multiubiquitination factor Ube4b fused, in frame, to NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesizing enzyme Nmnat1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Conforti3">[21]</xref>. Both regions are required for full Wld<sup>S</sup> function in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Conforti1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Conforti2">[5]</xref>. The N-terminal VCP binding region probably targets the essential Nmnat activity to a specific subcellular location <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Avery1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Conforti2">[5]</xref>. Despite being predominantly nuclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Mack1">[6]</xref>, recent studies indicate a cytoplasmic and potentially axonal site of action for Wld<sup>S</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Avery1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Beirowski1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Sasaki1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Yahata1">[8]</xref>, rekindling interest in its relationship to the earlier model of a putative endogenous survival factor(s) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Lubinska1">[14]</xref>. Wld<sup>S</sup>, an aberrant protein, cannot be one of these factors, but Nmnat1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Emanuelli1">[22]</xref> and the other mammalian Nmnat isoforms (Nmnat2 and Nmnat3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Raffaelli1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Zhang1">[24]</xref>) are candidates since they all possess the same critical enzyme activity and can all delay axon degeneration in primary neuronal culture when expressed exogenously at high levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Araki1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Sasaki2">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Yan1">[26]</xref>. Only Nmnat3 has so far been shown to confer robust protection to injured axons in vivo when wild-type proteins (except for a tag used for detection) are overexpressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Avery1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Conforti1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Yahata1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>In support of the “survival factor delivery hypothesis” we show that briefly suppressing protein synthesis in cell bodies of uninjured primary neuronal cultures induces Wallerian-like degeneration. The ability of a single protein (Wld<sup>S</sup>) to block this suggests that only one or a few critical factors are directly involved. We hypothesized that Wld<sup>S</sup> substitutes for one or more mammalian Nmnat isoforms, so we compared their properties against those predicted for a critical axon survival factor. We reasoned that depletion should trigger Wallerian-like degeneration without injury, its natural half-life should be consistent with the latent phase of Wallerian degeneration (Wld<sup>S</sup> should be much more stable to extend this period), the survival factor should be degraded by the proteasome to explain why proteasome inhibition extends axonal survival, it should be present in axons, and it should significantly prolong injured axon survival when highly overexpressed (to outweigh its short half-life). Nmnat2 uniquely fits this profile, indicating that its depletion after injury is a trigger for Wallerian degeneration and that “dying-back” pathology is likely to reflect defects in Nmnat2 axonal transport or synthesis.</p>

<title>Somatic Protein Synthesis Suppression Induces Wallerian-Like Degeneration</title>
<p>Our main hypothesis predicts that blocking synthesis of one or more putative axon survival factors should trigger Wallerian-like degeneration without injury, similar to that induced by blocking axonal transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Ferri1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Wang1">[28]</xref>. To test this we initially inhibited all protein translation in mouse superior cervical ganglia (SCG) explant cultures, using two unrelated inhibitors, cycloheximide (CHX) and emetine, to rule out nonspecific effects. One µg/ml CHX, which suppresses global protein synthesis by more than 95% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Martin1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Kirkland1">[30]</xref>, not only stopped neurite outgrowth as expected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Kirkland1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Estridge1">[31]</xref> but also induced widespread blebbing of distal neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g001">Figure 1A and 1C</xref>). Ten µg/ml CHX or 10 µM emetine caused more rapid and extensive blebbing of neurites, presumably due to more complete suppression of protein synthesis, followed by fragmentation and detachment shortly afterwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g001">Figure 1A and 1C</xref>), similar to the degeneration of transected neurites. To test whether the degeneration is Wallerian-like, we used cultures from slow Wallerian degeneration (<italic>Wld</italic><sup>S</sup>) mice and found a delay of over 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>). Similar results with rat SCG cultures and mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cultures indicate that these events are not restricted to one species or neuron type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000300.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Delayed degeneration in <italic>Wld</italic><sup>S</sup> cultures after inhibition of translation also shows that local translation of mRNAs in neurites is unlikely to underlie Wld<sup>S</sup>-mediated axon protection as hypothesized previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Fainzilber1">[32]</xref>. Similarly, localized translation is not required in injured neurites for Wld<sup>S</sup>-mediated protection, and it is also not needed for Wallerian degeneration itself (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000300.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

<p>Rapid cleavage of neurofilament heavy chain (NF-H) is an early molecular change that occurs as injury-induced Wallerian degeneration is initiated after the latent phase both in vitro and in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Mack1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Zhai1">[18]</xref>. We found that this also occurs after protein synthesis suppression in wild-type cultures but not in <italic>Wld</italic><sup>S</sup> cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, molecular assays also indicate this degeneration is Wallerian-like.</p>
<p>Importantly, degeneration induced by protein synthesis suppression is not due to loss of neuronal viability but is a much earlier event independent of cell death. Even 7 d after treatment with 1 µg/ml CHX, long after complete degeneration of neurites, many SCG cell bodies retain the ability to re-grow neurites when this reversible inhibitor is removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Most cell bodies in 7-d CHX-treated dissociated cultures also excluded Trypan Blue, further indicating neuron viability (unpublished data).</p>
<p>To test directly whether a critical axon survival factor(s) has to be synthesized and delivered from cell bodies, we used compartmented cultures where distal neurites can be treated separately from cell bodies and proximal neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Neurites degenerated only when inhibitors were applied to the compartment containing neuronal cell bodies and proximal neurites. Consistent with a previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Eng1">[33]</xref>, translation inhibitors applied only to distal neurites caused no significant degeneration within this timeframe. Indeed, neurites continued to grow (unpublished data). Thus, suppression of protein synthesis in the cell body triggers Wallerian-like neurite degeneration, providing strong support for the survival factor delivery hypothesis and suggesting the survival factor(s) is proteinaceous.</p>

The fold increase in blebbing at 24 h relative to 0 h (of the same neurites) was quantified from three independent experiments combining data from multiple fields (error bars = ±S.E.M.) and is shown on the right. Treatment of cell bodies (CB) alone induces significantly more blebbing of distal neurites than treatment of the distal neurites (N) themselves (*<italic>p</italic> = 0.026, <italic>t</italic> test).

<title>Nmnat2 Knock-Down Induces Wallerian-Like Degeneration</title>
<p>We then investigated the molecular basis of these findings. Because Nmnat1 contributes essential Nmnat enzyme activity to the Wld<sup>S</sup> fusion protein, we reasoned that Wld<sup>S</sup> might protect axons by substituting for injury-induced loss of an endogenous Nmnat activity. Transcripts of all three mammalian Nmnat isoforms are expressed in mouse SCG neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000300.s003">Figure S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Yan1">[26]</xref>), suggesting each is a reasonable candidate. Moreover, although their predominant localizations are nuclear (Nmnat1), Golgi-associated (Nmnat2) and mitochondrial (Nmnat3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Berger1">[34]</xref>, the recent finding that Wld<sup>S</sup> acts at a non-nuclear site despite its nuclear abundance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Beirowski1">[3]</xref> reminds us that low levels of protein can act elsewhere, especially if enzyme activity amplifies the effect. We therefore decided to test whether any of the Nmnat isoforms possess the predicted properties of an endogenous axon survival factor in our model.</p>
<p>The first key prediction is that survival factor depletion should induce Wallerian-like neurite degeneration without injury as levels drop below a critical threshold. We used pools of siRNAs (si<italic>Nmnat1</italic>, <italic>2</italic>, or <italic>3</italic>) to knock down expression of the murine Nmnat isoforms and confirmed specificity for the appropriate isoform by assessing their ability to prevent expression of N-terminal FLAG-tagged Nmnat (FLAG-Nmnat) proteins in transfected HEK 293T cells and SCG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<title>The <italic>Nmnat</italic> siRNA pools are specific for their intended targets.</title>
<p>(A) Each <italic>Nmnat</italic> siRNA pool specifically blocks expression of a FLAG-tagged version of its intended target in transfected HEK 293T cells. Representative FLAG immunoblot of cells 24 h after co-transfection with expression vectors for each FLAG-Nmnat isoform together with a non-targeting pool of siRNA (si<italic>Control</italic>) or one of the si<italic>Nmnat</italic> siRNA pools as indicated. Quantification of band intensities relative to bands in the si<italic>Control</italic> lane in three independent experiments is shown on the right (error bars = ±S.E.M.). Each siRNA pool specifically and significantly reduces expression of its target (***<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, <italic>t</italic> test of respective si<italic>Nmnat</italic> versus si<italic>Control</italic>). Each FLAG-Nmnat acts as internal control of transfection efficiency for the others. Only 3/4 of the pooled <italic>Nmnat2</italic> siRNAs and 2/4 of the pooled <italic>Nmnat3</italic> siRNAs target sequences in the respective expression vectors (compared to 4/4 for the <italic>Nmnat1</italic> siRNA pool). All should target the endogenous mRNAs. (B) Each <italic>Nmnat</italic> siRNA pool specifically blocks expression of a FLAG-tagged version of its intended target in injected SCG neurons. Representative fluorescent images of SCG neurons 48 h after co-injection with one FLAG-Nmnat expression vector, pEGFP-C1, and the relevant si<italic>Nmnat</italic> pool or non-targeting siRNA pool (si<italic>Control</italic>). eGFP fluorescence identifies injected neurons, FLAG immunostaining shows expression levels of each FLAG-Nmnat, and DAPI labels nuclei. Each si<italic>Nmnat</italic> siRNA pool significantly reduces expression of its target isoform compared to si<italic>Control</italic> as indicated on the right by quantification of FLAG immunostaining relative to eGFP fluorescence in individual neurons (**<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, ***<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, <italic>t</italic> test of respective si<italic>Nmnat</italic> versus si<italic>Control</italic>). Data are from three independent experiments in which at total of 36–55 injected neurons were analyzed (error bars = ±S.E.M.) Localization of each tagged isoform is consistent with their expected distribution; Nmnat1 in nuclei and Nmnat2 and Nmnat3 in cytoplasmic compartments.</p>

<p>To assess the effect of Nmnat isoform knock-down in SCG neurons, we used a microinjection-based strategy (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000300.s004">Figure S4</xref>), enabling us to consistently introduce similar amounts of siRNA. Neurons in wild-type dissociated cultures were first injected with each siRNA pool, with DsRed2 expression allowing visualization of injected neurons and their neurites. Of the three <italic>Nmnat</italic> siRNA pools, only injection of si<italic>Nmnat2</italic> caused a significant reduction in the percentage of healthy neurites compared to the non-targeting siRNA pool (si<italic>Control</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>). Some of the neurites of the si<italic>Nmnat2</italic>-injected neurons already appeared abnormal 24 h after injection, when the entire lengths of the DsRed2-labeled neurites could first be clearly visualized, and almost all showed abnormal morphology or had completely degenerated 72 h after injection. In contrast, injection of si<italic>Control</italic>, si<italic>Nmnat1</italic>, and si<italic>Nmnat3</italic> all caused relatively little degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>), and neurites continued to grow (unpublished data). Combined injection of all three <italic>Nmnat</italic> siRNA pools did not significantly accelerate neurite degeneration relative to si<italic>Nmnat2</italic> alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, Nmnat2 knock-down is sufficient to induce neurite degeneration, whereas knock-down of the other Nmnat isoforms has no clear effect on neurite survival.

(E–G) Representative fluorescent images showing the typical characteristics of the neurite degeneration caused by si<italic>Nmnat2</italic> injection. Multiple DsRed2-positive neuritic swellings are only observed after si<italic>Nmnat2</italic> injection (E) and these precede a characteristic progressive distal-to-proximal “dying-back” neurite degeneration (F). Neurites showing “dying-back” degeneration can be followed back to morphologically normal cell bodies. This contrasts the more rapid, catastrophic neurite degeneration that coincides with cell body death (G) and is seen following injection of all siRNA pools (including si<italic>Control</italic>). Images in (E) were captured 48 h after injection and show injected cell bodies at the top of each panel.</p>

<p>To rule out a contribution from any off-target effect of the four individual siRNAs within the si<italic>Nmnat2</italic> pool, we tested whether they could cause neurite degeneration when injected individually or in non-overlapping sub-pools (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000300.s005">Figure S5</xref>). One siRNA alone (J-059190-11) and two others in combination (J-059190-10 and J-059190-12) triggered significant neurite degeneration that was similar to that induced by the complete pool. A clear combinatorial effect was also seen as J-059190-11 injected at the concentration it contributes to the si<italic>Nmnat2</italic> pool caused significantly less neurite degeneration than the pool itself. Together, these observations show that si<italic>Nmnat2</italic>-induced neurite degeneration is due to knock-down of Nmnat2.</p>
<p>The si<italic>Nmnat2</italic>-induced neurite degeneration is distinctive, characterized by the appearance of multiple neuritic DsRed2-containing swellings and a distal-to-proximal “dying-back” progression that appears to be independent of neuronal viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g004">Figure 4E and 4F</xref>). In contrast, the small amount of background neurite degeneration seen with all the siRNA pools (including si<italic>Control</italic>) coincides with cell death and is faster and morphologically distinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g004">Figure 4G</xref>).</p>
<p>Some loss of neuronal viability occurred in these experiments, irrespective of the siRNA injected, but a small, additional decrease in neuronal viability following si<italic>Nmnat2</italic> knock-down was also apparent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000300.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Even though this reduction in neuronal viability, relative to si<italic>Control</italic>, was proportionately much smaller than the reduction in neurite survival (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000300.s006">Figure S6F</xref>), we sought to completely exclude the possibility that cell death might be responsible for the si<italic>Nmnat2</italic>-associated neurite degeneration. We were able to almost completely eliminate neuronal cell death in the si<italic>Nmnat2</italic> injection experiments in two ways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g005">Figure 5</xref>). First, we reduced expression of the fluorescent marker after finding that toxicity was causing the (caspase-independent) background cell death. Second, we found that the small si<italic>Nmnat2</italic>-associated decrease in neuronal viability could be prevented by the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), indicating that this death is caspase-dependent. Importantly, the amount of si<italic>Nmnat2</italic>-induced neurite degeneration was unchanged when cell death was reduced in these ways (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g005">Figure 5C and 5D to F</xref>igures 4A, 4B, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000300.s006">S6</xref>). This clearly shows that neurite degeneration precedes any associated loss of neuron viability in these experiments. It is also consistent with <italic>Wld</italic><sup>S</sup>-mediated protection of neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g004">Figure 4D</xref>) being able to reduce si<italic>Nmnat2</italic>-associated neuronal loss to control levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000300.s006">Figure S6C</xref>), despite the fact that Wld<sup>S</sup> cannot directly prevent neuronal cell death in SCG cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Deckwerth1">[35]</xref>. In addition, failure of z-VAD-fmk to prevent si<italic>Nmnat2</italic>-induced neurite degeneration provides further evidence that it is Wallerian-like as Wallerian degeneration has been shown to be unaffected by a range of anti-apoptotic interventions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Burne1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Whitmore1">[38]</xref>.</p>

The number of neurons with normal gross morphology remaining at each time point is shown as a percentage of those present at 24 h and was quantified from three independent experiments (error bars = ±S.E.M.). There is a small but significant decrease in the percentage of viable neurons 48 and 72 h after injection with si<italic>Nmnat2</italic> (+DMSO) relative to si<italic>Control</italic> (***<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, <italic>t</italic> test si<italic>Nmnat2</italic> versus si<italic>Control</italic> at equivalent time points), but this is reduced to control levels following treatment with z-VAD-fmk. (B) Assessment of neuronal viability based on gross morphology matches that based on other indicators of viability. At the end of experiments in (A), neurons were counter-stained with propidium iodide (PI), a DNA stain that can only penetrate the membranes of non-viable cells, and DAPI. Abnormal gross morphology seen with bright-field and eGFP imaging correlated precisely with PI staining and nuclear condensation/fragmentation (revealed by DAPI staining) typical of cell death. An arrowhead indicates an abnormal neuron (rarely seen in these experiments) and an arrow a healthy neuron. (C) Quantification of neurite survival corresponding to the analysis of neuronal viability in (A). The number of healthy eGFP-labelled neurites remaining at each time point (quantified from multiple fields in each experiment) is shown as a percentage of the total number (both healthy and abnormal) 24 h after injection (error bars = ±S.E.M.).

<p>Thus, constitutive expression of endogenous Nmnat2 in SCG neurons is required to prevent spontaneous “dying-back” Wallerian-like neurite degeneration. Importantly, these data also indicate that endogenous Nmnat1 and Nmnat3 cannot compensate for loss of Nmnat2, despite the ability of these proteins to protect injured neurites when sufficiently overexpressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Araki1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Sasaki2">[25]</xref>.</p>

<title>Nmnat2 Is the Most Labile Nmnat Isoform</title>
<p>In our model, axon degeneration is initiated when survival factor levels drop below a critical threshold after synthesis or delivery is blocked. If Nmnat2 depletion acts as a trigger for Wallerian degeneration, Nmnat2 half-life should be compatible with the short latent phase of 4–6 h before transected SCG neurites degenerate. Wld<sup>S</sup>, on the other hand, should be more stable to directly substitute for loss of endogenous Nmnat2. A direct comparison of the relative turnover rates of the FLAG-tagged murine Nmnat isoforms and Wld<sup>S</sup> in co-transfected HEK 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) showed that FLAG-tagged Nmnat2 is turned over rapidly when protein synthesis is blocked with an in vitro half-life of less than 4 h. In contrast, there was minimal turnover of FLAG-tagged Wld<sup>S</sup>, Nmnat1, and Nmnat3 up to 72 h. Similar results were also obtained with C-terminal FLAG-tagged proteins (unpublished data). We also found that proteasome inhibition with MG-132 largely prevented turnover of FLAG-tagged Nmnat2 in these cells for at least 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Importantly, turnover of endogenous Nmnat2 in SCG explants following protein synthesis inhibition was found to be similarly rapid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g006">Figure 6C</xref>).</p>

<title>Nmnat2 is the most labile Nmnat isoform and is degraded by the proteasome.</title>
<p>(A) Relative stabilities of FLAG-tagged Nmnat isoforms and Wld<sup>S</sup> in HEK 293T cells co-transfected with expression vectors for each and treated 24 h after transfection with 10 µM emetine to block translation for the times indicated. A representative FLAG immunoblot is shown (top panel). The same blot was re-probed with an Nmnat2 antibody (bottom panel) to show that loss of anti-FLAG signal is primarily due to protein turnover rather than cleavage of the FLAG epitope from the protein. Quantification of band intensities for each protein from three independent experiments is shown below as a percentage of untreated (0 h) band intensities (error bars = ±S.E.M.). Co-transfection allows direct comparison of stabilities of each protein in the same cells. (B) FLAG-Nmnat2 turnover in transfected HEK 293T cells is prevented by proteasome inhibition. Cells were transfected as in (A) and treated with 10 µM emetine for 0 or 24 h, ±20 µM MG-132. A FLAG immunoblot representative of three independent experiments is shown. (C) Endogenous Nmnat2 is rapidly turned over in SCG explant cultures after blocking translation with CHX (1 µg/ml) or emetine (10 µM). Representative immunoblots are shown comparing steady-state levels of Nmnat2 (0 h) with levels after 4 h of protein synthesis suppression. ß-Tubulin acts as a loading control. Nmnat2 band intensity at 4 h is shown as a fraction of that at 0 h after normalization to ß-Tubulin and was quantified from two independent experiments each (error bars = ±S.E.M.). These values are consistent with the different rates at which CHX (1 µg/ml) and emetine induce neurite degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
</caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000300.g006" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>The half-life of Nmnat2 is also consistent with the time when wild-type SCG neurites become committed to degenerate after inhibition of translation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000300.s007">Figure S7A</xref>). Neurites exposed to CHX for just 4 h remain healthy and continue to grow for over 5 d, but they become irreversibly committed to degenerate when exposed to CHX for just 8 h, despite only minimal evidence of degeneration when CHX is removed. Intermediate treatment for 6 h gave a mixed outcome. This suggests that degeneration of these neurites can be prevented by reestablishing synthesis of the labile survival factor(s) providing levels have not dropped below a critical threshold. The precise threshold can only be determined when the duration of downstream events leading to activation and execution of degeneration are better understood. Importantly, Wld<sup>S</sup> expression not only delays the onset of neurite degeneration following protein synthesis suppression, it also delays their commitment to degenerate at least 3-fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000300.s007">Figure S7B</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, the half-life of Nmnat2, but not Nmnat1 and Nmnat3, is compatible with its turnover being a trigger for Wallerian degeneration. Furthermore, the longer half-life of Wld<sup>S</sup> is consistent with it substituting for Nmnat2 loss for a prolonged period.</p>

<title>Endogenous Nmnat2 Degrades Rapidly and Spontaneously in Injured Neurites</title>
<p>According to our model, the putative axon survival factor should also be present in neurites under normal conditions, and its level in transected neurites should drop significantly prior to initiation of degeneration at 4–6 h. Therefore, we assessed Nmnat2 levels in neurite-only extracts from SCG explant cultures at the time of transection and 4 h afterwards when the gross morphology of the transected neurites still appears relatively normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Neurite extracts contained significant amounts of Nmnat2 at the time of transection and this fell to ∼30% of steady-state levels within 4 h. Furthermore, loss of endogenous Nmnat2 occurs before cleavage of NF-H, which accompanies physical break-down of SCG neurites after injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Zhai1">[18]</xref> or protein synthesis suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), and before β-Tubulin degradation. An increase in Nmnat2 levels in the corresponding cell body/proximal neurite extracts 4 h after separation of their transected distal neurites is also seen. This probably represents accumulation of Nmnat2 in a greatly reduced cellular volume (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>).</p>

<p>(A–C) Relationship between Nmnat2 turnover in neurites and other parameters of neurite health in wild-type cultures (A), wild-type cultures ±20 µM MG-132 (B), and <italic>Wld</italic><sup>S</sup> cultures (C). Representative immunoblots show detection of Nmnat2, Wld<sup>S</sup> (where applicable), NF-H, 16 kDa core Histones, and ß-Tubulin just after cut (0 h) and 4 and/or 8 h later. Material collected from SCG explant cultures derived from 15–20 ganglia was needed to detect Nmnat2 in each lane. Loss of the NF-H band is an early consequence of axon degeneration and absence of the 16 kDa core Histones band in neurite extracts confirms there is no detectable contamination with SCG cell bodies or non-neuronal cells. ß-Tubulin represents a loading control. Relative Nmnat2 band intensities in neurite-only lanes are shown as a fraction of levels at 0 h after normalisation to ß-Tubulin and were quantified from two or three independent experiments (error bars = ±S.E.M.). Nmnat2 is significantly depleted in untreated wild-type and <italic>Wld</italic><sup>S</sup> neurites shortly after separation from their ganglia (*<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, **<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, ***<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, <italic>t</italic> test 4 or 8 h versus 0 h).

<p>Proteasome inhibition modestly extends the latent phase of Wallerian degeneration in SCG explant cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Zhai1">[18]</xref>, so we tested whether this correlates with reduced turnover of endogenous Nmnat2 given that FLAG-tagged Nmnat2 is degraded via the proteasome in HEK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Neurites treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 appear relatively normal 8 h after transection, with no associated NF-H cleavage, whereas untreated neurites show extensive physical and molecular signs of degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). We found that loss of Nmnat2 was also significantly reduced by MG-132 at this time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g007">Figure 7B</xref>), consistent with depletion of endogenous Nmnat2 being a critical trigger for axon degeneration. The fact that Nmnat2 turnover was not completely prevented might explain why the duration of neurite protection by MG-132 is fairly limited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Zhai1">[18]</xref>, although prolonged proteasome inhibition is also toxic to axons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Laser1">[39]</xref>.</p>
<p>Nmnat2 loss within 4 h in transected wild-type neurites seems unlikely to be a consequence of axon degeneration, as cytoskeletal proteins and neurite morphology are little altered at this time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). However, to rule this out conclusively, we assessed Nmnat2 turnover in transected <italic>Wld</italic><sup>S</sup> neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g007">Figure 7C</xref>), which do not degenerate for several days. Nmnat2 levels in <italic>Wld</italic><sup>S</sup> neurites fell with a remarkably similar time course to those in wild-type neurites. In contrast, cleavage of NF-H was prevented, showing that proteins that degrade as a consequence of degeneration are stabilized in <italic>Wld</italic><sup>S</sup> neurites. As predicted, Wld<sup>S</sup> levels in neurites also remained relatively constant. Indeed, levels of Wld<sup>S</sup> protein are only moderately reduced in neurites 48 h after transection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000300.s008">Figure S8</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, Nmnat2 is rapidly depleted in distal stumps of injured neurites, as a result of natural turnover rather than a consequence of degeneration. This is consistent with Nmnat2 loss triggering Wallerian degeneration. The continued presence of Wld<sup>S</sup> in transected <italic>Wld</italic><sup>S</sup> neurites long after Nmnat2 is lost shows that Wld<sup>S</sup> does not act by stabilizing Nmnat2 but instead supports a model in which Wld<sup>S</sup> substitutes for the functionally related Nmnat2.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2e">
<title>Net Anterograde Delivery of Nmnat2 by Fast Axonal Transport</title>
<p>We also found that an Nmnat2–enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) fusion protein localizes to SCG neurites in highly defined particles shortly after being expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000300.s010">Video S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). In contrast, eGFP alone showed uniform distribution in neurites (unpublished data). Particles containing Nmnat2-eGFP travel bi-directionally, but the majority move in an anterograde direction (72.2%±3.8% based on particle movements in 18 neurites). The average and maximal velocities of particles moving anterogradely (0.58±0.09 and 1.52±0.12 µm/sec) and retrogradely (0.29±0.06 and 1.18±0.10 µm/sec) are consistent with fast axonal transport. This indicates that Nmnat2 undergoes rapid net anterograde delivery from the cell body to neurites. This is another important prediction of our model, as rapid delivery is needed to replenish constant turnover of Nmnat2 in distal neurites (above).</p>

<title>Nmnat2 Protects Transected Neurites When Highly Overexpressed</title>
<p>Finally, if Nmnat2 is an endogenous axon survival factor, overexpression should protect transected neurites by preloading them with increased amounts of the protein. However, due to its relatively short half-life, protection should be highly dose-dependent and prolonged protection might only be achieved with very high levels of Nmnat2. In contrast, relatively long-lived Wld<sup>S</sup> should also confer protection at much lower levels.</p>
<p>We tested the ability of exogenous expression of tagged Nmnat2 and Wld<sup>S</sup> to protect transected neurites in a microinjection-based assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000300.s009">Figure S9</xref>). Dilution of the injected construct allowed controlled amounts to be reproducibly introduced into neurons. At low vector concentration (1 ng/ml), Wld<sup>S</sup> conferred robust protection to neurites for 24 h after cutting, whereas Nmnat2 provided almost no protection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g008">Figure 8A and 8B</xref>). In contrast, at 50-fold higher construct concentrations, both Nmnat2 and Wld<sup>S</sup> conferred protection to almost all cut neurites at 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g008">Figure 8A and 8B</xref>). Although we used identical expression cassettes to give the best chance of equal expression of the two proteins in this assay, the shorter half-life of FLAG-Nmnat2 probably manifests as a lower steady-state level at the time of cut relative to FLAG-Wld<sup>S</sup>. Indeed, in transfected HEK 293T cells, we found that 2.5 times more FLAG-Nmnat2 construct was required to give steady-state protein levels approximately equal to FLAG-Wld<sup>S</sup> (and the other Nmnat isoforms). Importantly, whilst we found that injection of the FLAG-Nmnat2 construct at 2.5 ng/ml gave slightly increased protection 24 h after cut relative to 1 ng/ml, this was still greatly reduced protection compared to the FLAG-Wld<sup>S</sup> construct at the lower concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). Thus exogenous Nmnat2 only confers significant protection of cut neurites when expressed at high levels, consistent with its short half-life, whilst more stable Wld<sup>S</sup> protects even at low levels.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results provide direct support for the hypothesis that constant delivery of a labile, cell body–synthesized survival factor is required to stop healthy mammalian axons undergoing Wallerian degeneration. Defects that prevent its delivery, including axon injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Mack1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Lunn1">[40]</xref>, axonal transport impairment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Ferri1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Wang2">[41]</xref>, cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Deckwerth1">[35]</xref>, or disruption of protein synthesis in the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g002">2</xref>), all trigger Wld<sup>S</sup>-sensitive axon degeneration. We identify Nmnat2 as one such critical axon survival factor, required to maintain normal axon integrity and sufficient to preserve injured ones at high doses. Nmnat2 half-life, uniquely among the three Nmnat isoforms, is consistent with the timing of the latent phase of Wallerian degeneration and commitment to degenerate in primary culture. We also show for the first time that endogenous Nmnat2 is present in neurites, where levels drop rapidly after injury. Importantly, this is not a consequence of neurite degeneration but represents natural turnover prior to activation of degeneration. These findings have significant implications for our molecular understanding of Wallerian degeneration and “dying-back” axonopathies, and for the mechanism by which Wld<sup>S</sup> and other Nmnat isoforms delay axon degeneration.</p>
<p>The most compelling evidence that Nmnat2 is required for maintenance of healthy axons is our observation that siRNA-mediated knock-down of Nmnat2 alone induces neurite degeneration in the absence of injury and that this precedes any effect on neuronal viability. The initiation and progression of this degeneration is clearly slower than that caused by protein synthesis suppression, but this is consistent with the mechanisms involved. The critical rate-limiting factor following translation inhibition is protein half-life, but for siRNA-mediated knock-down additional time is needed for mRNA degradation. Pharmacological inhibition of translation could also result in more efficient and homogenous knock-down. It is also possible that depletion of other axon survival factors after global suppression of protein synthesis may contribute to this difference in timing. Nmnat1 and Nmnat3 seem unlikely to be among them in this experimental system because of their long half-lives, the absence of any clear effect of their siRNAs, and the fact that endogenous levels of both proteins cannot compensate for loss of Nmnat2.</p>
<p>Nmnat2 is a labile protein in HEK cells, in whole SCG explants, and in transected neurites. The rate of Nmnat2 turnover is consistent with the trigger for axon degeneration being depletion below a critical threshold. Nmnat2 falls to barely detectable levels in transected wild-type SCG neurites prior to any significant physical signs of degeneration, which suggests that the critical threshold level of Nmnat2 is quite low. However, the precise threshold level is difficult to determine because the duration of downstream steps needed to bring about degeneration is unknown. Steady-state levels of Nmnat2 in SCG neurites also seem quite low and this could account for the short latent phase between neurite transection and degeneration in these cultures.</p>
<p>Of the three mammalian Nmnat isoforms, Nmnat2 did not initially appear the most obvious candidate for an endogenous axon survival factor, despite being the most abundantly expressed isoform in the nervous system at the mRNA level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Raffaelli1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Berger1">[34]</xref>. First, its predominant Golgi localization seemed inconsistent with an axonal location. However, a recent report shows axons in primary neuronal cultures contain Golgi components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Merianda1">[42]</xref> and, as with Wld<sup>S</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Beirowski1">[3]</xref>, predominant localization may not reflect the site of its axon protective role. We have now clearly detected endogenous Nmnat2 in SCG neurites by immunoblotting and have shown that an Nmnat2-eGFP fusion localizes to distinct, rapidly transported particles in these neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g007">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000300.s010">Video S1</xref>). It will be interesting to determine the precise nature of these particles. Second, the inability of Nmnat2 to protect 5-d lesioned axons in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, unlike the other Nmnat isoforms and Wld<sup>S</sup>, initially suggested it was either ineffective or by far the least potent isoform <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Avery1">[2]</xref>. However, it has more recently been shown that exogenous expression of Nmnat2 can protect injured mammalian axons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Yan1">[26]</xref>. We propose that the short half-life of Nmnat2 could provide an explanation for this discrepancy, with the degree of protection being related to the levels of Nmnat2 expression achieved in the different systems. It is also possible that some protection of lesioned <italic>Drosophila</italic> axons might be evident at a less stringent time point (wild-type fly axons begin to degenerate just 1 d after injury). Thus, a short half-life, one of the most critical inherent properties of the endogenous survival factor in our model, might mask the capacity of exogenous Nmnat2 to protect in some situations. Conversely, greater stability probably underlies the ability of exogenous Nmnat1 and Nmnat3 to protect injured axons/neurites more robustly in this and other in vivo and/or in vitro situations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Araki1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Avery1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Yahata1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Sasaki2">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our data suggest that Wld<sup>S</sup> may protect axons by directly substituting for loss of endogenous Nmnat2 after injury or other stresses. This is based on three principal observations. First, Wld<sup>S</sup> is inherently more stable than Nmnat2, decaying less in 48 h than Nmnat2 does in 4 h after neurite transection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g006">Figures 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g007">7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000300.s008">S8</xref>). Importantly, continued degradation of Nmnat2 in <italic>Wld</italic><sup>S</sup> neurites rules out an alternative hypothesis, that Wld<sup>S</sup> could delay axon degeneration by stabilizing Nmnat2. Second, Wld<sup>S</sup> and Nmnat2 share the same enzyme activity, which is required for their ability to protect axons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Conforti2">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Yan1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Sasaki3">[43]</xref>. Third, both are present in axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g007">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000300.s010">Video S1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Beirowski1">[3]</xref>), and the presence of Wld<sup>S</sup> in microsome fractions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Beirowski1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Yahata1">[8]</xref> is consistent with a possible shared localization with Nmnat2 in Golgi, or Golgi-derived structures in axons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Merianda1">[42]</xref>.</p>
<p>The ability of exogenous nuclear Nmnat1 and mitochondrial Nmnat3 to confer axon protection in a number of situations outwardly seems to contradict the claim that Nmnat localization is actually important, but there is increasing evidence to support it. First, endogenous Nmnat1 and Nmnat3 (which do appear to be expressed in SCG neurons; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000300.s003">Figure S3</xref>) cannot compensate for loss of Nmnat2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g004">Figure 4</xref>), probably as a result of strict compartmentalization. Alternatively, this could simply reflect the relative contributions of each isoform to total basal Nmnat activity in these axons. Second, redistribution of predominantly nuclear Wld<sup>S</sup> and Nmnat1 into the cell body and axon enhances their ability to delay Wallerian degeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Beirowski1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Sasaki1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Yahata1">[8]</xref>. Finally, Nmnat1 and Nmnat3 only confer protection when overexpressed. This appears to be accompanied by significant mis-localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, unpublished observations, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Yahata1">[8]</xref>), which may cause a serendipitous increase in effective Nmnat levels in the relevant axonal location. The ability of barely detectable extra-nuclear Wld<sup>S</sup> to protect injured <italic>Wld</italic><sup>S</sup> mouse axons suggests that minimal mis-localization of relatively stable Nmnat1 and Nmnat3 may be sufficient to confer strong protection. The absence of significant axon protection in transgenic mice expressing Nmnat1 in neurons at similar levels to Wld<sup>S</sup> in <italic>Wld</italic><sup>S</sup> neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Conforti1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Yahata1">[8]</xref> suggests either that Nmnat1 localization is more rigorously controlled in vivo or that Nmnat1 overexpression is greater in vitro. Importantly, Nmnat1 can only protect mammalian axons in vivo when specifically mutated to cause mis-localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Sasaki1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>The main known function of the mammalian Nmnat isoforms is NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis, and the ability of Nmnat1, Nmnat2, and Wld<sup>S</sup> to delay Wallerian degeneration requires Nmnat enzyme activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Araki1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Conforti2">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Yan1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Sasaki3">[43]</xref>. NAD<sup>+</sup> production may therefore underlie the ability of endogenous Nmnat2 to prevent spontaneous axon degeneration. However, there is much disagreement over the ability of NAD<sup>+</sup> to protect axons directly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Araki1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Conforti1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Yahata1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Suzuki1">[44]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Wang3">[45]</xref>, or even its involvement at all <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Sasaki3">[43]</xref>. Indeed, siRNA-mediated knock-down of Nampt, the rate-limiting enzyme upstream of Nmnat in the NAD<sup>+</sup> salvage pathway, does not itself trigger axon degeneration despite a substantial 70%–90% reduction in NAD<sup>+</sup> levels, leading to the suggestion that an alternative Nmnat metabolite may be involved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Sasaki3">[43]</xref>.</p>
<p>Regarding downstream events, the rapid initiation and progression of Wallerian degeneration is more consistent with an active degeneration program than passive degeneration resulting simply from loss of an essential metabolic activity. Recently, dual leucine kinase (DLK) and JNK signalling have been implicated in regulating Wallerian degeneration of DRG neurites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Miller1">[46]</xref>. We have found the same JNK inhibitor (SP600125) used in that study also significantly delays Wallerian degeneration of SCG neurites (unpublished data). The localization of Nmnat2 in defined particles in axons and the role it plays in them could now be key to identifying additional downstream events.</p>
<p>Whilst neurite degeneration in primary neuronal cultures is a useful model of in vivo axon degeneration, high levels of protein overexpression can give misleading outcomes (discussed above) and other differences need to be considered. For example, there is a much longer latent phase before fragmentation of axons in transected sciatic nerves in vivo (36–40 h <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Beirowski2">[15]</xref>) than for transected SCG neurites in culture (∼8 h). This could reflect differences in the half-life of Nmnat2 in vivo and in culture (for which there is some precedent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Spencer1">[47]</xref>), steady-state levels of Nmnat2, or the involvement of additional factors that are more critical for axon survival in vivo. However, it would be somewhat surprising if Nmnat2 did not play a critical role in vivo based on its rapid turnover and it being required for neurite survival in vitro. Other Nmnat isoforms remain candidates in vivo, particularly Nmnat3 as its mitochondrial localization makes its presence in axons likely. Indeed, a contribution from other molecules could help to explain the longer latent phase in vivo.</p>
<p>It will also be interesting to see whether endogenous Nmnat proteins are involved in axon survival in non-mammalian organisms such as <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Whilst loss of the single <italic>Drosophila Nmnat</italic> homolog causes degeneration of photoreceptors, this appears to be a more general effect on neuronal viability, rather than axon health, and does not require its NAD<sup>+</sup>-synthesizing activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Zhai2">[48]</xref>. This contrasts with the protection against axon degeneration by mammalian Nmnat isoforms and Wld<sup>S</sup>, which does require enzyme activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Araki1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Conforti2">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Yan1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Sasaki3">[43]</xref>. Neuronal viability could therefore be dependent on a reported Nmnat-associated chaperone activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Zhai3">[49]</xref>, with axons having a more specific dependency on enzyme activity. Thus, it is possible that the small decrease in neuron survival associated with Nmnat2 knock-down in SCG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) could be due to loss of chaperone activity, although it is not yet known whether Nmnat2 possesses this activity like the other mammalian isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Zhai3">[49]</xref>.</p>
<p>Loss of Nmnat2 could also underlie “dying-back” axon degeneration in disease. Due to its rapid turnover, Nmnat2 might fail to reach distal axons in sufficient quantities when axonal transport is either pathologically compromised <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Reid1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Ferri1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-DeVos1">[50]</xref> or slows during normal ageing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Minoshima1">[51]</xref>. Impairment of protein synthesis would be predicted to have a similar outcome, which could explain axon degeneration accompanying viral infections as the cellular protein synthesis machinery is overwhelmed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Wong1">[52]</xref>. More subtle effects on protein synthesis resulting from cell body defects, such as vacuolization, could underlie Wallerian-like “dying-back” axon degeneration and/or neuromuscular junction loss in slowly developing, chronic diseases like ALS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Bendotti1">[53]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Fischer1">[54]</xref>, even in the absence of neuronal loss. Our model would additionally explain why the longest axons are often most susceptible in disease. The ability of some larger mammals to support very long axons (up to several meters in some cases) raises the intriguing possibilities that Nmnat2 is inherently more stable in larger species or that chaperones stabilize it during transport.</p>
<p>We propose that increasing Nmnat2 stability or its delivery to axons could have important therapeutic implications for these and other disorders characterized by Wallerian-like degeneration. Both treatments should delay the point at which axons become committed to degenerate (like Wld<sup>S</sup>). Such therapies might be particularly effective when axonopathy results from a short-term impairment (e.g., of cell body metabolism, axonal transport, glial support, etc.) lasting just a few hours to a few weeks. Examples include Taxol-induced neuropathy, relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, some viral disorders, and stroke. Axons could be saved permanently if the degeneration commitment point is delayed long enough for the causative defect to be removed or to abate naturally. Although <italic>Wld</italic><sup>S</sup> mice have already been shown to be resistant to Taxol-induced neuropathy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Wang2">[41]</xref>, developing therapies based on the Wld<sup>S</sup> neuroprotective mechanism has been limited by the technical challenge of introducing exogenous Wld<sup>S</sup> (or other stable Nmnat isoforms). In contrast, pharmacological manipulation of endogenous Nmnat2 should be more feasible.</p>
<p>Finally, the increase in Nmnat2 levels in SCG cell bodies/proximal neurite stumps that we observed shortly after transection of their neurites is also intriguing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). The simplest explanation is that this represents accumulation of Nmnat2 in a reduced cellular volume following neurite removal while synthesis continues at pre-injury levels. However, the possibility that this could represent a stress response cannot be completely excluded at this time, especially in light of the recent report that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Nmnat isoform can act as a chaperone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000300-Zhai3">[49]</xref>. Irrespective of the mechanism involved, this increase in Nmnat2 levels might nevertheless facilitate subsequent neurite regeneration.</p>
<p>In summary, we propose a model in which sustained expression and anterograde delivery of Nmnat2 is required to prevent activation of an intrinsic axon degeneration program. Degeneration is triggered when synthesis and/or delivery of Nmnat2 is disrupted and rapid turnover causes its level to drop below a critical threshold. We additionally propose that the relatively stable Wld<sup>S</sup> fusion protein delays axon degeneration by directly substituting for loss of Nmnat2 and that localization may be an important factor. Endogenous Nmnat2 represents an exciting target for therapeutic manipulation.</p>

Microinjection of a row of cell bodies in dissociated SCG cultures enabled neurites to be cut so that all injected cell bodies and their proximal neurites were located on the opposite side of the cut site to the distal stumps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000300.s009">Figure S9</xref>).</p>

<p>Extracts were separated by standard SDS-PAGE on SDS polyacrylamide gels (6%–13% depending on the proteins being detected) and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) using the Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN III wet transfer system. Blots were blocked and incubated with primary antibodies overnight (in 1× TBS p.H. 8.3, with 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% milk powder or 5% BSA) followed by the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1 h at 1∶2000–1∶5000 dilution) and detection by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with washes between each stage. The following primary antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (1∶2000–1∶5000, Sigma, M2), rabbit polyclonal anti-Wld<sup>S</sup> (1∶4000, Wld18), mouse monoclonal anti-NF-H (1∶2000, Sigma, N52), mouse monoclonal anti-Nmnat2 (2.0 µg/ml, Abcam, ab56980), mouse monoclonal anti-neuronal class βIII-Tubulin (1∶2000–1∶10,000, Covance, MMS-435P), and mouse monoclonal anti-Histones (1∶1000, Millipore, MAB052).

Wherever possible, images of the same field of neurites or neuronal cell bodies were captured at the indicated time points after initial manipulation. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0. The intensity of FLAG immunostaining relative to eGFP fluorescence in individual injected neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g003">Figure 3</xref>) was quantified using ImageJ software. Images were captured for analysis using identical microscope settings between samples for each channel.

Cultures were maintained at 37°C in a Solent Scientific environment chamber. Wide-field epifluorescence images were captured at 2 Hz for 1 min.

The number of neurons with normal gross morphology remaining at each time point is shown as a percentage of those present at 24 h (error bars = ±S.E.M.).

Individual siRNAs from the si<italic>Nmnat2</italic> pool had equivalent effects on neuronal viability (D). (E) Neuron viability was scored based on gross morphology (in bright-field and DsRed2 imaging) of the injected neuron cell bodies. Two of the three injected neurons shown with normal morphology in the top panel appear abnormal 24 h later (arrowheads, bottom panel). Assessment based on gross morphology closely matches other indicators of cell viability (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000300-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). (F) Comparison between the amounts of neuron and neurite loss induced by si<italic>Nmnat2</italic>.

The significant reduction in neurite health following injection of si<italic>Nmnat2</italic> is proportionately far greater than the small but significant reduction in neuronal viability (*<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, ***<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, <italic>t</italic> test si<italic>Nmnat2</italic> versus si<italic>Control</italic> at equivalent time points; <sup>§§§</sup><italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, <italic>t</italic> test si<italic>Nmnat2</italic> neurite survival versus si<italic>Nmnat2</italic> neuron survival at equivalent time points). In contrast, neuron loss exceeds neurite degeneration with all other siRNA pools. This is presumably due to preferential loss of neurons that do not project neurites into areas where degeneration is assessed. This may be because neurons with shorter neurites are more susceptible to the DsRed2 toxicity that causes background cell death in these experiments (see main text).</p>
