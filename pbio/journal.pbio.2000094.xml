<abstract>
<p>Nuclear receptors were originally defined as endocrine sensors in humans, leading to the identification of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Despite intensive efforts, most nuclear receptors have no known ligand, suggesting new ligand classes remain to be discovered. Furthermore, nuclear receptors are encoded in the genomes of primitive organisms that lack endocrine signaling, suggesting the primordial function may have been environmental sensing. Here we describe a novel <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> nuclear receptor, HIZR-1, that is a high zinc sensor in an animal and the master regulator of high zinc homeostasis. The essential micronutrient zinc acts as a HIZR-1 ligand, and activated HIZR-1 increases transcription of genes that promote zinc efflux and storage. The results identify zinc as the first inorganic molecule to function as a physiological ligand for a nuclear receptor and direct environmental sensing as a novel function of nuclear receptors.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Zinc is an essential nutrient for all life forms, and maintaining zinc homeostasis is critical for survival. However, little is known about how animals sense changes in zinc availability and make adjustments to maintain homeostasis. In particular, logic dictates there must be a mechanism for zinc sensing, but it has not been defined in animals. We discovered that the nuclear receptor transcription factor HIZR-1 is the master regulator of high zinc homeostasis in the roundworm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. In response to high dietary zinc, HIZR-1 activates transcription of multiple genes that encode a network of proteins that store and detoxify excess zinc. Furthermore, our results suggest HIZR-1 itself is the high zinc sensor, since it directly binds zinc ions in the ligand-binding domain that regulates transcriptional activation. These findings advance the understanding of zinc homeostasis and nuclear receptor biology. Nuclear receptors were initially characterized as receptors for hormones such as estrogen, indicating complex animals use these transcription factors to monitor their internal environment. However, nuclear receptors are present in simple organisms that lack endocrine signaling, suggesting these transcription factors might have a primordial function in sensing the external environment. Our results identify a new class of nuclear receptor ligands, the inorganic ion zinc, and a new function for nuclear receptors in directly sensing levels of a nutrient. We speculate that nutrient homeostasis mediated by direct binding of nutrients to the ligand-binding domain is a primordial function of nuclear receptors, whereas endocrine signaling in complex animals mediated by direct binding of hormones to the ligand-binding domain is a derived function of nuclear receptors that appeared later in evolution.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Zinc is an essential nutrient for all life, including plants, animals and microbes, because zinc is involved in many different cellular events. Zn<sup>2+</sup> binds tightly to many proteins and thereby contributes to their tertiary structure or catalytic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref001">1</xref>], and Zn<sup>2+</sup> has been proposed to function as a second messenger signaling molecule during synaptic transmission, development, and immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref004">4</xref>]. Zinc homeostasis is vital for human health. Inadequate dietary intake is a prevalent cause of human zinc deficiency, whereas genetic disorders that disrupt zinc uptake occur rarely. Zinc deficiency causes pathological changes in a wide range of tissues, reflecting the many uses of zinc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref007">7</xref>]. Zinc excess also causes human pathology, and it may occur systemically or in specific tissues. For example, ischemic injury has been proposed to cause zinc release that mediates cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref009">9</xref>]. Several human diseases, including diabetes, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases, are correlated with genetic variations that affect zinc metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref012">12</xref>]. Elucidating zinc homeostasis is important for understanding an ancient biological process and may contribute to improving human health.</p>
<p>Because excess zinc is toxic, organisms require mechanisms to sense and detoxify high levels of zinc. One fundamental and evolutionarily conserved mechanism is transcriptional regulation of genes involved in zinc detoxification, such as zinc exporters and zinc sequestering proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref016">16</xref>]. However, the regulation of high-zinc–activated transcription remains poorly understood in animals. Critical questions in this field include the following: What is the direct sensor of high zinc? And how does this sensor activate transcription of zinc homeostasis genes?</p>
<p>The nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is a useful model system for studies of zinc homeostasis because its simple body plan, its transparency, and the availability of powerful genetic techniques facilitate experimental analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref021">21</xref>]. Studies of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> are relevant to mammalian biology, since the genome encodes evolutionarily conserved zinc transporters and metallothioneins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref023">23</xref>]. The transcription of these genes is regulated by dietary zinc levels in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, which is also similar to yeast and mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref025">25</xref>]. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> contains two metallothionein genes, <italic>mtl-1</italic> and <italic>mtl-2</italic>, that are induced at the level of transcription in intestinal cells by high dietary zinc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref026">26</xref>]. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> contains 14 cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) genes that encode transporters for zinc and possibly other metal ions. The CDF genes <italic>cdf-2</italic> and <italic>ttm-1b</italic> are transcriptionally up-regulated in intestinal cells by high dietary zinc, and these transporters promote zinc storage and excretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref019">19</xref>]. Transcriptional activation of these genes is mediated by the high zinc activation (HZA) element, a DNA enhancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref015">15</xref>]. However, the HZA-binding factor has not been identified.</p>
<p>Here we describe an unbiased forward genetic screen used to identify mediators of high-zinc–activated transcription that resulted in the discovery of the HZA-binding factor, which we named the <underline><italic>hi</italic></underline>gh-<underline><italic>z</italic></underline>inc–activated nuclear <underline><italic>r</italic></underline>eceptor (HIZR-1). <italic>hizr-1</italic> encodes a nuclear receptor transcription factor that has an evolutionarily conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD) and ligand-binding domain (LBD). We demonstrated that HIZR-1 is both necessary and sufficient to activate transcription of endogenous zinc-homeostasis genes in response to high dietary zinc. Thus, HIZR-1 is the master regulator of high-zinc homeostasis in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>. We used genetic and biochemical approaches to analyze HIZR-1 function. The LBD directly bound zinc, which promoted nuclear accumulation and activation of the protein, indicating the LBD regulates protein activity and zinc is a physiological ligand; the DBD directly bound the HZA enhancer, which mediates transcriptional activation of multiple genes involved in zinc homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref015">15</xref>]. These findings advance the understanding of zinc biology by identifying a sensor for high zinc in animals and elucidate homeostatic systems by defining a positive feedback loop embedded in a negative feedback circuit.</p>
<p>Nuclear receptors (NRs) were discovered and characterized as sensors of endocrine signals in mammals. These transcription factors contain a regulatory ligand-binding domain that interacts with hormones and a DNA-binding domain that interacts with target genes. Despite decades of effort, only about half of human NRs have identified ligands, raising the possibility that novel classes of ligands remain to be discovered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref027">27</xref>]. NRs exist in simple organisms such as sponges that lack endocrine signaling, suggesting NRs might have primordial function in sensing external molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref028">28</xref>]. However, external ligands have yet to be identified. The analysis of HIZR-1 expands the understanding of the NR superfamily by (1) identifying transition metals as a new class of physiological ligand that is distinct from previously described classes such as steroids and lipids and (2) identifying direct nutrient sensing as a new function that may represent a primordial role of NRs.</p>

<title>A Genetic Screen for Abnormal High-Zinc–Activated Transcription</title>
<p>Homeostasis in response to high zinc is mediated by transcriptional activation of multiple genes in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, including the zinc transporter genes <italic>cdf-2 and ttm-1b</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref014">14</xref>]. To identify genes that mediate this response, we screened for mutant animals that displayed abnormal regulation of <italic>cdf-2</italic>. To visualize <italic>cdf-2</italic> transcription, we used the method of bombardment to generate transgenic animals with an integrated, multicopy array containing a plasmid with the <italic>cdf-2</italic> promoter fused to the coding region for green fluorescent protein (GFP) (<italic>cdf-2p</italic>::<italic>gfp</italic>) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec015">Materials and Methods</xref>). Transgenic <italic>cdf-2p</italic>::<italic>gfp</italic> animals displayed low-level fluorescence in standard medium and high-level fluorescence in intestinal cells in medium supplemented with zinc (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000094.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref></bold>). We identified one semidominant mutation (<italic>am285</italic>) that caused increased fluorescence in standard medium, a phenotype we named <underline><italic>z</italic></underline>inc-<underline><italic>a</italic></underline>ctivated <underline><italic>t</italic></underline>ranscription-<underline><italic>c</italic></underline>onstitutive (Zat-c).

All six mutant strains displayed growth rates similar to wild type when cultured on standard medium. All five Zat-d mutations failed to complement one another, indicating they affect the same gene. The Zat-c and Zat-d complementation groups were positioned in the center of linkage group X (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000094.g001">Fig 1E</xref></bold>).</p>

GFP fluorescence was observed with a compound microscope, and representative images are shown. Animals were oriented with the long axis horizontally—the intestine is a prominent tubular structure spanning the length of the animal, and it is outlined with a dotted white line. Animals cultured in medium with no supplemental zinc displayed low-level fluorescence that is a combination of autofluorescence due to gut granules and low level expression of the <italic>cdf-2</italic> promoter. By contrast, intestinal fluorescence is prominent in animals cultured in zinc-supplemented medium. Scale bars are approximately 100 μm. <bold>(C)</bold> A flow chart of the forward genetic screen.

<title>Zinc Directly Bound the Ligand-Binding Domain of HIZR-1</title>
<p>We hypothesized that zinc is a ligand for HIZR-1, leading to the predictions that zinc will directly bind the LBD of purified HIZR-1 and high zinc will promote nuclear accumulation of HIZR-1 in animals.

<title>Zinc directly bound the HIZR-1 ligand-binding domain.</title>
<p><bold>(A)</bold> Glutathione S-transferase (GST) alone and the ligand-binding domain of HIZR-1 (residues 101–412) fused to GST were expressed in bacteria and partially purified by affinity chromatography. Increasing concentrations of either GST::HIZR-1(101–412 WT) or GST alone were incubated with a fixed concentration of radioactive zinc-65, and the amount of zinc-65 bound to protein was quantified by filter binding and scintillation counting. Values are the average +/- S.D. in counts per minute (CPM). At least two technical replicates were performed for each unique protein concentration. GST::HIZR-1(101–412 WT) displayed saturable binding, and a nonlinear regression was used to calculate a dissociation constant of 1.7 +/- 0.3 μM. X-ray crystallography studies indicate that GST binds one zinc molecule per protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref032">32</xref>]; our data are consistent with saturable, low-level zinc binding by GST alone. <bold>(B)</bold> GST alone and the ligand-binding domain of DAF-12 isoform A (residues 440–753) fused to GST were expressed in bacteria, partially purified by affinity chromatography, and analyzed for zinc binding using the method described above. GST again displayed saturable, low-level zinc binding. GST::DAF-12(440–753 WT) LBD displayed binding similar to GST alone, indicating that the LBD of DAF-12 does not bind an appreciable amount of zinc. <bold>(C)</bold> Partially purified GST::HIZR-1(101–412 WT) was incubated with radioactive zinc-65 and no additional metal (none) or 500 μM nonradioactive zinc, copper, nickel, or manganese. Bars indicate the amount of zinc-65 bound to protein +/- S.D. (<italic>n</italic> = 3) quantified by filter binding and scintillation counting. The values were normalized by setting the value of the sample with no additional metal equal to 1.0, defined as maximal binding. Low values indicate the nonradioactive metal competes effectively with radioactive zinc-65. For GST::HIZR-1(101–412 WT), compared to nonradioactive zinc, nickel and manganese displayed significantly lower effectiveness as competitors (*, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The value for copper was not significantly different than the value for zinc (<italic>p</italic> = 0.13), indicating copper effectively competes with zinc for binding.</p>

<p>These data can be used to estimate the stoichiometry of binding; however, this estimation is subject to important caveats. The crystal structure of GST indicates the protein binds one molecule of zinc, suggesting the stoichiometry of binding is 1 zinc:1 GST protein molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref032">32</xref>]. If we assume this stoichiometry in our binding reactions, which has not been demonstrated directly, then we estimate the zinc:HIZR-1 LBD stoichiometry is 3:1 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000094.g003">Fig 3A</xref></bold>) and 4:1 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000094.s003">S3 Fig</xref></bold>). The amino acids that typically coordinate zinc in proteins are histidine and cysteine, and zinc is typically coordinated by four such residues. The predicted LBD of HIZR-1 contains 15 histidine and cysteine residues, suggesting it might have the capacity to coordinate three or four zinc ions with these residues. However, the data presented here do not address the role of these residues in zinc binding.</p>
<p>These data can be used to estimate a dissociation constant, although this value is subject to important caveats. The calculated dissociation constant was 2.6 +/- 0.2 μM when the concentration of zinc was varied (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000094.s003">S3 Fig</xref></bold>) and 1.7 +/- 0.3 μM when the concentration of protein was varied <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000094.g003">Fig 3A</xref>)</bold>, which are in good agreement. However, several caveats must be considered in interpreting these calculated dissociation constant values: (1) The calculation assumes that all added zinc is available for protein binding; however, the binding reaction contained glutathionine, which is known to have zinc binding affinity and is predicted to reduce the concentration of zinc available to bind the protein. (2) The calculation assumes that every protein molecule is “active” and able to bind zinc, whereas some might have been inactive or denatured. (3) The calculation assumes that zinc and protein are bound in a 1:1 stoichiometry—as described above, HIZR-1 appears to bind more than one zinc per protein molecule. These data indicate that zinc directly binds the LBD of HIZR-1 with high affinity and metal selectivity. However, further biochemical studies are necessary to accurately define the dissociation constant, stoichiometry, and specific amino acid residues that mediate zinc binding.</p>

<title>HIZR-1 Activated Transcription of Its Own mRNA in Response to High Zinc, Defining a Positive Feedback Circuit</title>
<p>In <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, high zinc homeostasis is mediated by a parallel negative feedback circuit; high levels of cytoplasmic zinc increase expression of CDF-2 and TTM-1B, which detoxify zinc by sequestration and excretion, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref014">14</xref>]. Here we show that HIZR-1 plays a pivotal role in this negative feedback circuit by sensing zinc levels, binding the HZA enhancer, and promoting transcriptional activation of these genes. We noticed that the promoter of <italic>hizr-1</italic> contains a predicted HZA element (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000094.g007">Fig 7A</xref></bold>), leading to the hypothesis that HIZR-1 activates transcription of its own promoter. Consistent with this model, the level of <italic>hizr-1</italic> mRNA was significantly increased about 4-fold by high dietary zinc in wild-type animals (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000094.g007">Fig 7B</xref></bold>). This regulation appears to occur at the level of transcription, since a construct containing the <italic>hizr-1</italic> promoter driving expression of GFP (<italic>hizr-1p</italic>::<italic>gfp</italic>) was also induced by high dietary zinc (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000094.g007">Fig 7C–7E</xref></bold>). By contrast, <italic>hizr-1(am286lf)</italic> transgenic animals containing this construct did not display increased GFP expression in response to high dietary zinc, indicating that <italic>hizr-1</italic> is necessary for this transcriptional activation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000094.g007">Fig 7D and 7E</xref></bold>). These results identify a positive feedback circuit, since HIZR-1 protein increases levels of <italic>hizr-1</italic> mRNA, which in turn increases levels of HIZR-1 protein. This positive feedback circuit is embedded in and promotes the parallel negative feedback circuits—increased levels of HIZR-1 protein will enhance the activation of <italic>cdf-2</italic> and <italic>ttm-1b</italic> mRNA, promoting zinc homeostasis (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000094.g008">Fig 8</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>A New High Zinc Sensor in Animals</title>
<p>Sensing high and low levels of zinc is critical for homeostasis. Here we identify the nuclear receptor HIZR-1 as a high zinc sensor in an animal. The DNA-binding domain of HIZR-1 interacted directly with the HZA enhancer in purified extracts, and <italic>hizr-1</italic> functioned through the HZA enhancer in vivo to mediate transcriptional activation in response to high zinc. Thus, HIZR-1 appears to be the HZA-binding factor that was postulated by Roh et al. (2015) when the HZA was identified as the enhancer that mediates transcriptional activation in response to high dietary zinc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref015">15</xref>]. Nuclear receptors are typically regulated by ligand binding, which promotes nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref027">27</xref>]. We propose that a ligand for HIZR-1 is zinc, and this model is supported by two lines of evidence. First, HIZR-1 accumulated in the nucleus and activated transcription in response to high dietary zinc. Second, the ligand-binding domain of HIZR-1 interacted directly with zinc with high affinity in purified extracts. This zinc affinity of the ligand-binding domain is specific for HIZR-1, since the related ligand-binding domain of DAF-12, which uses dafachronic acid as a ligand, did not bind zinc. Furthermore, our genetic studies demonstrate that the ligand-binding domain of HIZR-1 plays a key regulatory role, since a missense mutation in the domain causes a gain-of-function phenotype characterized by constitutive nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activation. The DNA-binding domain of HIZR-1 contains two predicted zinc finger motifs that are likely to bind zinc and promote DNA binding. While the results indicate the ligand-binding domain plays a critical regulatory role, the data do not exclude the possibility that zinc interactions with the DNA-binding domain also regulate HIZR-1 activity. These results establish the function and mechanism of action of <italic>hizr-1</italic> as the direct sensor of high zinc and the effector of high-zinc–activated transcription.</p>
<p>Our results raise the possibility that HIZR-1 might respond to multiple metal ions. Metal binding by the HIZR-1 LBD binding was relatively metal-specific, as nickel and manganese did not compete effectively with zinc for binding. Interestingly, copper was able to compete for binding to the HIZR-1 LBD, similar to zinc. However, multiple lines of evidence suggest that copper is not a functional ligand for HIZR-1: (i) <italic>hizr-1(lf)</italic> animals were not hypersensitive to high copper toxicity, (ii) high copper did not stimulate nuclear accumulation of HIZR-1, and (iii) high copper did not induce the transcription of <italic>cdf-2</italic>, <italic>ttm-1b</italic>, or <italic>mtl-1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref015">15</xref>]. Cadmium is similar to zinc, but it is an environmental pollutant rather than a physiological metal. Cadmium activates gene transcription in worms, including some genes that contain HZA elements and also respond to zinc. Further studies are necessary to determine the role of HIZR-1 in cadmium-activated transcription.</p>
<p>Transcription factors that play a role in zinc homeostasis have been characterized in several eukaryotic organisms. In the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> the response to low zinc is mediated by the zinc-responsive activator protein 1 (ZAP1). The ZAP1 transcription factor binds directly to a conserved DNA element in promoter regions called the zinc-responsive element (ZRE) and thereby induces target gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref034">34</xref>]. ZAP1 target genes include the zinc importers ZRT1 and ZRT2 that are induced by ZAP1 to promote zinc uptake; ZRT3 is induced to mobilize zinc stored in the vacuole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref035">35</xref>]. ZAP1 activity is repressed by high zinc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref024">24</xref>] and activated by low zinc; this transcription factor contains multiple zinc finger domains that may play a regulatory role. In the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, gene repression in zinc-replete cells is mediated by the Loz1 transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref037">37</xref>]. The response to high zinc has been characterized in animals based on studies of the metallothionein genes. In mammals, a zinc-finger containing transcription factor called the metal-responsive-element-binding transcription factor-1 (MTF-1) directly binds the metal response element (MRE) in the promoters of metallothionein genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref039">39</xref>]. MTF-1 is necessary for the transcriptional response to a wide range of stresses including high cadmium, high zinc, hypoxia and oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species. The mechanisms of MTF-1 regulation are controversial, and it is unclear whether MTF-1 senses zinc directly or is part of a system that includes another high zinc sensor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref041">41</xref>]. HIZR-1 is a new type of zinc sensor, and its discovery and characterization represent important advances in understanding mechanisms of high zinc homeostasis.</p>

<title>A Homeostatic System for High Zinc: A Positive Feedback Loop Embedded in a Parallel Negative Feedback Circuit</title>
<p>In response to fluctuating zinc levels, organisms maintain zinc homeostasis by regulating the abundance and activity of metallothioneins and zinc transporters. In <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, exposure to high levels of zinc causes induction of CDF-2, which sequesters zinc in lysosome-related organelles, and TTM-1B, which excretes zinc into the intestinal lumen. CDF-2 and TTM-1B function in a parallel negative feedback circuit, since single mutants display moderate or undetectable hypersensitivity to high zinc, respectively, whereas double mutants display dramatic hypersensitivity to high zinc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref014">14</xref>]. Here we elucidate new aspects of the homeostatic system by showing that <italic>hizr-1</italic> mediates the transcriptional response of <italic>cdf-2</italic> and <italic>ttm-1b</italic>. Furthermore, HIZR-1 activates transcription of its own mRNA, thereby establishing a positive feedback loop: high dietary zinc increases the activity of HIZR-1 protein, which increases the levels of <italic>hizr-1</italic> mRNA and protein, resulting in a further increase in HIZR-1 activity. Because this positive feedback loop is embedded in a negative feedback circuit, it serves to enhance the overall negative feedback circuit.</p>
<p>The transcription factor ZAP1 is a key part of a similar feedback circuit in response to low zinc in yeast. Zinc deficiency causes activation of ZAP1 protein, which binds the promoter and activates transcription of the Zap1 gene; this autoregulation is a positive feedback loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref042">42</xref>]. Activated ZAP1 protein also increases the transcription of key zinc importers such as ZRT1 and ZRT2, representing the negative feedback component of this system[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref044">44</xref>]. The similarities between the circuits controlled by HIZR-1 in response to high zinc in animals and ZAP1 in response to low zinc in yeast highlights the utility and importance of embedding a positive feedback loop within negative feedback circuits to maintain homeostasis.</p>

<title>Zinc Represents a New Class of Ligand for Nuclear Receptors</title>
<p>The discovery of HIZR-1 establishes a new intersection between two important fields that were previously separate: nuclear receptors and zinc biology. Nuclear receptors were originally defined as endocrine sensors in humans, including the glucocorticoid receptor and estrogen receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref046">46</xref>]. Genome analysis identified a nuclear receptor superfamily consisting of about 49 members in mammals. Despite decades of intensive efforts focused on ligand discovery, about half of the nuclear receptors remain “orphans” with unknown physiological ligands. This raises the possibility that novel classes of ligands remain to be discovered. Indeed, the demonstration that zinc functions as a ligand for the HIZR-1 nuclear receptor represents the first example of a new class of physiological metal ligands. All previously described physiological ligands for nuclear receptors are small hydrophobic molecules; established ligand classes include retinoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref048">48</xref>], steroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref049">49</xref>], sterols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref050">50</xref>], fatty acid derivatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref051">51</xref>], and other organic molecules, such as heme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref052">52</xref>]. Interestingly, several metals have also been reported to bind to the LBD of the estrogen receptor and appear to alter its activity; however, these metalloestrogens are typically classified as endocrine disruptors rather than physiological ligands for the estrogen receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref053">53</xref>]. The demonstration that a transition metal ion is the physiological ligand establishes a new structural class of nuclear receptor ligand molecules. Furthermore, this finding raises the possibility that nuclear receptors may be sensors of high levels of other essential metal ions, such as iron, copper, and manganese.</p>

<title>Direct Nutrient Sensing Is a New Physiological Function for Nuclear Receptors</title>
<p>Nuclear receptors are not present in single-celled eukaryotes, such as yeast, and appear to have evolved in primitive multicellular organisms. Ancestral nuclear receptor genes exist in sponges, animals of the phylum Porifera, which lack higher-level body organization such as tissues and organs and thus lack hormone signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref054">54</xref>]. Therefore, nuclear receptors were proposed to have ancestral roles as environmental sensing proteins that later evolved to sense intraorganismal endocrine signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref028">28</xref>]. However, no such functions have been rigorously demonstrated. Our results document a nuclear receptor that responds to a nutrient, consistent with the theory that the ancestral function of nuclear receptors might have been sensing dietary and environmental stimuli, including metals such as zinc. This represents a distinct paradigm from canonical endocrinology in which a hormone like estrogen is synthesized in endocrine cells, is secreted into the bloodstream, and enters distant cells, where it binds and activates the estrogen receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref055">55</xref>]. Furthermore, this is a novel demonstration that a dietary nutrient is a direct ligand for a nuclear receptor. This establishes a new paradigm for nuclear receptors as direct sensors of environmental nutrients.</p>

<p>To generate plasmid constructs for protein purification of the ligand-binding domains of HIZR-1 and DAF-12, we PCR-amplified the ligand-binding domains of HIZR-1 (encoding amino acids 101–412) and DAF-12 (encoding amino acids 440–753 of the A isoform) from synthesized DNA (IDT gBlocks). These fragments were ligated into pGEX-4T-1 (GE Healthcare). These plasmids encode an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) affinity purification tag fused to either the ligand-binding domain of HIZR-1 (pKW14) or DAF-12 (pKW15).</p>

<title>Positioning Mutations in the Genome</title>
<p>To position Zat mutations on the genetic map, we utilized single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref018">18</xref>]. To facilitate this strategy, we introduced the integrated <italic>cdf-2p</italic>::<italic>gfp</italic> reporter from WU1391 into Hawaiian CB4856 by performing seven backcrosses to CB4856 with selection for zinc-activated GFP fluorescence. All six Zat-c and Zat-d mutations displayed tightest linkage to the SNP <italic>amP117</italic>, positioned at approximately the 9,552 kilobase pair on linkage group X (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000094.g001">Fig 1E</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>To determine how many genes were affected by the five recessive Zat-d mutations, we performed complementation experiments. All five mutations failed to complement one another for the Zat-d phenotype, indicating that all five mutations affect the same gene.</p>
<p>To define intervals that contain the Zat-c mutation (<italic>am285)</italic> and the Zat-d complementation group (represented by <italic>am286)</italic>, we conducted three-factor mapping experiments with mutations that cause visible phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref056">56</xref>]. We chose the X-linked genes <italic>unc-115</italic>, <italic>egl-15</italic>, and <italic>sma-5</italic> that are located at approximately the 10,147, 11,016, and 12,005 kilobase pairs on linkage group X, respectively. The <italic>cdf-2p</italic>::<italic>gfp</italic> reporter was introduced into the double mutant mapping strains to generate <italic>cdf-2p</italic>::<italic>gfp</italic>; <italic>unc-115(e2225) egl-15(n484)</italic> or <italic>cdf-2p</italic>::<italic>gfp</italic>; <italic>egl-15(n484) sma-5(678)</italic> using standard genetic techniques. For the <italic>am285</italic> Zat-c mutation, 0/13 Egl nonUnc and 5/5 Unc nonEgl recombinants segregated the Zat-c phenotype, indicating <italic>am285</italic> is positioned right of <italic>egl-15</italic>. 9/20 Egl nonSma recombinants segregated the Zat-c phenotype, indicating <italic>am285</italic> is positioned between <italic>egl-15</italic> and <italic>sma-5</italic>. For the <italic>am286</italic> Zat-d mutation, 0/12 Egl nonUnc and 3/3 Unc nonEgl recombinants segregated the Zat-d phenotype, indicating <italic>am286</italic> is positioned right of <italic>egl-15</italic>. 9/30 Egl nonSma recombinants segregated the Zat-d phenotype, indicating <italic>am286</italic> is positioned between <italic>egl-15</italic> and <italic>sma-5</italic>. The results that 18/50 recombination events (36%) occurred between <italic>egl-15</italic> and <italic>hizr-1</italic> and 32/50 recombination events (64%) occurred between <italic>hizr-1</italic> and <italic>sma-5</italic> are consistent with the molecular distances of approximately 302 kilobase pairs between <italic>egl-15</italic> and <italic>hizr-</italic>1 (31%) and 687 kilobase pairs between <italic>hizr-1</italic> and <italic>sma-5</italic> (69%).</p>
<p>To identify the gene affected by the newly isolated Zat mutations, we performed whole genome sequencing using DNA from the <italic>am279</italic>, <italic>am280</italic>, <italic>am285</italic>, and <italic>am286</italic> mutant strains. Candidate mutations within the mapping interval were identified by comparing the mutant DNA sequence to wild-type DNA sequence. <italic>am279</italic>, <italic>am280</italic>, <italic>am285</italic>, and <italic>am286</italic> all contained candidate mutations in the gene <italic>hizr-1/</italic>(<italic>ZK455</italic>.<italic>6</italic>) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000094.g001">Fig 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000094.s005">S1 Table</xref></bold>). Next, the sequence of the <italic>hizr-1</italic> genomic locus was determined by standard sequencing techniques using DNA from <italic>am287</italic> and <italic>am288</italic> mutant strains, which revealed mutations in the <italic>hizr-1</italic> locus.</p>

<p>Plasmids encoding full-length HIZR-1(1–412) proteins with the wild-type (WT) or mutant sequence (G23E, S30L, or R63C) fused to an N-terminal 6XHis tag were transformed into BL21 <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells. The empty vector pTrcHisA was transformed as a control. Cells were grown in Luria-Bertani media at 37°C, and expression was induced with 5 mM IPTG when the absorbance at 600 nm reached between 0.5–0.7. Expression was induced for 16–18 h at 16°C. Cells were then collected by centrifugation and suspended in 50 mM MOPS (pH 7.0). Cells were lysed by sonication in the presence of 0.16 mg/mL of lysozyme. Lysed cell material was pelleted by centrifugation and the supernatant was collected. HIZR-1 protein was purified from the supernatant using Clontech TALON Metal affinity resin. GST alone and the ligand-binding domains of HIZR-1 and DAF-12 fused to GST were expressed and harvested using the techniques described above; these proteins were purified using Genscript Glutathione Resin according to the manufacturer’s instructions and eluted with 10 mM L-glutathionine.</p>

<title>Zinc Binding Assays</title>
<p>To analyze zinc binding to proteins, we used zinc-65 radionuclide (PerkinElmer, stock date 2/12/2015, specific activity 3.29 mCi/mg, concentration 5.90 mCi/mL, and radionuclidic purity 99.00%) and the purified proteins GST::HIZR-1(101–412 WT), GST::DAF-12(440–753 WT), and GST alone. Protein concentrations were quantified by Bradford assay. Equilibrium binding experiments were performed according to established guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000094.ref064">64</xref>]. Briefly, a constant amount of zinc-65 (0.01 μCi) was incubated with variable protein concentrations in 50 mM MOPS buffer with 10 mM L-glutathionine (pH 7.0) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000094.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref></bold>). Based on the specific activity, we calculated that addition of 0.01 μCi zinc-65 results in a final concentration of zinc-65 of about 0.4 nM and a final concentration of total zinc (radioactive and nonradioactive) of about 1 μM. The half life of zinc-65 is 244 d, and it decays to copper-65. The number of decay half lives between production of the zinc-65 solution and binding experiments was less than one. Therefore, the amount of copper-65 was negligible compared to the amount of nonradioactive zinc in the source. Although purified proteins were eluted in buffer with no added zinc, we cannot exclude the possibility that the purified proteins contributed some nonradioactive zinc to the reaction mixture. Alternatively, a constant amount of protein (0.77 μM) was incubated with variable zinc concentrations (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000094.s003">S3 Fig</xref></bold>). Therefore, reactions consisted of (1) protein in 50 mM MOPS buffer with 10 mM L-glutathionine (pH 7.0) and (2) zinc dissolved in water. Reactions were allowed to equilibrate for 40 min, protein was vacuum blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, membranes were briefly washed, and bound zinc-65 was quantified using a Beckman LS600 scintillation counter. At least two technical replicates were performed for each unique protein or zinc concentration. The dissociation constant was determined using GraphPad Prism software, assuming a 1:1 binding stoichiometry between zinc and the protein of interest.</p>
<p>To conduct the metal selectivity experiments, the binding interaction between a constant amount of GST::HIZR-1(101–412 WT) protein and zinc-65 was competed using no competitor or 500 μM of either nonradioactive zinc sulfate (ZnSO<sub>4</sub>), copper chloride (CuCl<sub>2</sub>), nickel chloride (NiCl<sub>2</sub>), or manganese chloride (MnCl<sub>2</sub>) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000094.g003">Fig 3C</xref></bold>). Binding values were normalized by defining the binding interaction between the protein and zinc-65 with no nonradioactive competitor as maximal binding and setting that value equal to 1.0. Fraction maximal binding was calculated as the bound zinc-65 (CPM) for a given nonradioactive metal divided by the bound zinc-65 for no competitor (CPM).</p>

The two recessive nonsense mutations are predicted to generate truncated proteins that end at residue 86 (lacking the entire ligand-binding domain) and residue 226 (lacking part of the ligand-binding domain). The molecular analysis suggests that Zat-d mutations are strong loss-of-function or null alleles. The amino acid affected by the Zat-c missense mutation is boxed in green. The position is well conserved—an aspartic acid in worms and flies and a glutamic acid in humans.
