<p>Cycling of gene expression in individual cells is controlled by dynamic chromatin remodeling.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>In individual mammalian cells the expression of some genes such as prolactin is highly variable over time and has been suggested to occur in stochastic pulses. To investigate the origins of this behavior and to understand its functional relevance, we quantitatively analyzed this variability using new mathematical tools that allowed us to reconstruct dynamic transcription rates of different reporter genes controlled by identical promoters in the same living cell. Quantitative microscopic analysis of two reporter genes, firefly luciferase and destabilized EGFP, was used to analyze the dynamics of prolactin promoter-directed gene expression in living individual clonal and primary pituitary cells over periods of up to 25 h. We quantified the time-dependence and cyclicity of the transcription pulses and estimated the length and variation of active and inactive transcription phases. We showed an average cycle period of approximately 11 h and demonstrated that while the measured time distribution of active phases agreed with commonly accepted models of transcription, the inactive phases were differently distributed and showed strong memory, with a refractory period of transcriptional inactivation close to 3 h. Cycles in transcription occurred at two distinct prolactin-promoter controlled reporter genes in the same individual clonal or primary cells. However, the timing of the cycles was independent and out-of-phase. For the first time, we have analyzed transcription dynamics from two equivalent loci in real-time in single cells. In unstimulated conditions, cells showed independent transcription dynamics at each locus. A key result from these analyses was the evidence for a minimum refractory period in the inactive-phase of transcription. The response to acute signals and the result of manipulation of histone acetylation was consistent with the hypothesis that this refractory period corresponded to a phase of chromatin remodeling which significantly increased the cyclicity. Stochastically timed bursts of transcription in an apparently random subset of cells in a tissue may thus produce an overall coordinated but heterogeneous phenotype capable of acute responses to stimuli.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Timing of biological processes such as gene transcription is crucial to ensure that cells and tissues respond appropriately to their environment. Until recently it was assumed that most cells in a tissue responded in a similar way, and that changes in cellular activity were relatively stable. However, studies of messenger RNA and protein levels in single cells have shown the presence of considerable heterogeneity. This suggested that transcription in single cells may be highly dynamic over time. Using a combined experimental and theoretical approach, with time-lapse imaging of reporter gene expression over 25 h periods, we measured the rate of prolactin gene transcription in single pituitary cells and detected clear cycles of transcriptional activity. Mathematical analysis, using a binary model that assumed transcription was on or off, showed that these cycles were characterized by a minimum refractory period that involved chromatin remodeling. The timing of transcription from two different reporter constructs driven by identical promoters in the same cell was out-of-phase, suggesting that the pulses of gene expression are due to processes intrinsic to expression of a particular gene and not to environmental effects. We further show that the pulses of transcription are independent chromatin cycles at each gene locus. Therefore, heterogeneous patterns of gene expression may facilitate flexible transcriptional responses in cells within intact tissue, while maintaining a well-regulated average level of gene expression in the resting state.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gene expression in living cells is dynamic and unstable, and fluctuations in transcription may be subject to stochastic regulation of processes including transcription factor and polymerase recruitment, and chromatin remodeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Pedraza1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Blake1">[5]</xref>. Cell-to-cell variation in the amount of protein a gene encodes is generally thought to arise from the typically small number of molecules (e.g. gene copies), which are involved in gene expression. The factors leading to this variation have been defined by studies in prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes as either <italic>extrinsic</italic> (deriving from variations in global, cellular factors, such as varying amounts of transcriptional activators) or <italic>intrinsic</italic> (i.e. inherently random molecular events, such as the transcription of mRNA or translation of proteins) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Elowitz1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Raser1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-NeildezNguyen1">[7]</xref>. Previous studies addressing the characterization of intrinsic and extrinsic noise have mainly focused on bacteria and yeast models, often using pairs of reporter genes to assess heterogeneity in protein levels as an indirect readout of expression level at a fixed time-point <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Elowitz1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Raser1">[6]</xref>. One study has reported a similar fixed time-point analysis in single human cells using dual fluorescent protein read-out <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-NeildezNguyen1">[7]</xref>. Short-term transcriptional pulses (bursts) have been observed in both prokaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Ozbudak1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Yu1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Golding1">[8]</xref> and eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Blake1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Raser1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Chubb1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Raj1">[10]</xref>. Chromatin remodeling has been suggested as one possible intrinsic source of variation that may lead to the intense stochastic transcriptional bursts that have been shown to occur in eukaryotic gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Blake1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Raser1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Raj1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>In mammalian cells, the variation in transcription between cells has been most quantitatively studied by using fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Raj1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Zenklusen1">[12]</xref>. However, these studies do not provide long-term time-course analysis in single cells. One approach to provide real-time semi-quantitative analysis of transcription is the imaging of reporter gene expression—for example, using firefly luciferase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Norris1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-White1">[15]</xref>. Such studies support the view that gene expression is very dynamic over long time periods and occurs in transcriptional bursts of varying duration that are not coordinated between different cells. To date, the key aim of understanding real-time dynamics by directly quantifying transcription rates of multiple genes over time in single cells has not been achieved.</p>
<p>One gene that displays dynamic transcription and marked heterogeneity between cells is prolactin (PRL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Takasuka1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Semprini1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-McFerran1">[18]</xref>. Prolactin is a hormone secreted by pituitary lactotrophic cells that is important for reproductive function, lactation, and control of fertility. Pituitary tumors secreting prolactin are common in man, and the hormonal regulation of prolactin secretion and gene expression has therefore been extensively studied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Freeman1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-BenJonathan1">[22]</xref>. In the present study, we used single cell reporter gene imaging to explore the pulsatile and cyclical nature of the transcription of PRL. Using measurements of mRNA and protein stability, we were able to quantify transcription rates from separately integrated reporter genes within the same cells and compare the kinetics of transcription over time. Analysis of the response to acute signals and the manipulation of histone acetylation suggested that dynamic chromatin changes control cycle timing.</p>

<title>Uncorrelated Transcription Cycles from Two Identical Promoters in a Single Cell</title>
<p>Pulses in gene expression in individual cells could arise from the transcription process itself or from signaling events reflecting the cellular environment. To discriminate between these possibilities, a dual-transgene cell line was constructed expressing separate luciferase and d2EGFP (destabilized enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein) reporter genes under the control of identical 5 kb <italic>hPRL</italic> promoters, integrated as independent gene copies (GH3-DP1 cell line; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g002">Figure 2A</xref>; one or at most two copies; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000607.s002">Figure S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000607.s003">Figure S3</xref>). The luciferase and d2EGFP reporter genes were selected due to their reported short protein half-lives. The use of these very different reporter genes (which have different chemistries for formation of the signal) was considered an advantage because we could measure them entirely independently.</p>

<p>Signal was detected from both reporter genes, but the intensity of the expression of the reporter genes within single cells failed to correlate when measured at a single time-point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000607.s004">Figure S4</xref>). To measure the profiles of expression from each reporter gene, fluorescence and luminescence intensities were captured from the same field of single cells over several hours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000607.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Due to the different mRNA and protein half-lives of these two reporter genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000607.s002">Figure S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000607.s010">Figure S10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000607.s018">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000607.s020">Text S1</xref> Section 3) direct comparison between the timing of expression could not be made. Therefore, in order to make quantitative comparisons between the timing of expression of these two different reporter genes within the same single cell, a mathematical model was developed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Finkenstadt1">[23]</xref>) which used statistical analysis to reconstruct estimates of the time-dependent transcription rate from the reporter imaging data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000607.s011">Figure S11</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000607.s014">Figure S14</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000607.s020">Text S1</xref> Section 3).</p>
<p>Autocorrelation analysis was performed on the reconstructed transcription rates from the <italic>hPRL-Luc</italic> and the <italic>hPRL-d2EGFP</italic> reporter genes in the dual-reporter GH3-DP1 cell line. This showed that transcription cycles were occurring at each gene with a dominant period of 11.3±3.3 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g003">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000607.s009">Figure S9</xref>). This value was measured from the dual reporter experiments and possibly provided an underestimate due to the limited timeframe of the experiments. Cycles of <italic>hPRL</italic> transcription were also observed from both luciferase and d2EGFP reporter genes in individual clonal pituitary cells from dual BAC-reporter transgenic rats grown in primary culture (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Semprini1">[16]</xref>), with a slightly longer period (15.2±4.8 h; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g003">Figures 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000607.s001">S1</xref>, and S8).</p>

<p>The ability to obtain quantitative data for the time-dependent transcription rates from the two reporter genes enabled us to ask whether the transcription cycles observed at individual loci were temporally coordinated or were out-of-phase within a single cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000607.s006">Figure S6</xref>). We analyzed the rank correlation coefficient <italic>C(T)</italic> between the transcription time-series for the two reporter genes over a time window of length <italic>T</italic> for increasing values of <italic>T</italic> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000607.s020">Text S1</xref> Section 3.3). In unstimulated conditions there was no significant correlation (<italic>p</italic>&lt;.05) in the timing of transcription cycles between the dual reporters in the same single cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g004">Figure 4A and B</xref>). In order to show that this was not an artifact of the genomic integration site we investigated independently derived cell lines: no significant correlation between the two promoters was detected in two different clones of the stably transfected cell lines or in dual-reporter transgenic primary cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000607.s012">Figure S12</xref>). These data demonstrate that cycles of <italic>hPRL</italic>-promoter activity did not depend on promoter length or on transgene integration site. Most importantly, the lack of correlation between the timing of <italic>hPRL</italic> transcription from promoters within the same cell in time-lapse imaging experiments showed that the expression cycles from distinct loci in a single cell were not synchronized or temporally coordinated. The fact that the cycles at individual loci in unstimulated single cells were uncorrelated (and that this phenomenon occurred in both cell lines and post-mitotic primary pituitary cells) suggested that the pulses in PRL gene expression were independent of cell cycle stage. This is in agreement with our previous study that suggested that variation in hPRL-luciferase reporter expression was independent of cell cycle in the GH3 cells (which have a cell cycle timing of approximately 40 h) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-McFerran1">[18]</xref>. Overall, these data therefore suggest that the transcriptional pulses were not a reflection of the cellular status, environment, or autocrine cell signaling but rather were due to an intrinsic property of the transcription process itself.</p>

<title>Evidence of a Refractory Phase between Transcription Cycles</title>
<p>In order to further understand and quantify the dynamics of transcriptional switching between “on-” and “off-”phases, we developed a stochastic binary switch model of transcriptional timing and used statistical algorithms to assess the distribution of times of transcriptional switching between the on and off states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000607.s020">Text S1</xref> Section 3). Transcription of the mRNA and translation and activation of the corresponding protein were modeled using a stochastic differential equation with binary on-off transcription and were fitted to time-series imaging data using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). This produced relatively tight distributions on the levels and the timing of transcription in the on and off periods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000607.s020">Text S1</xref> Section 3.4, example in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000607.s015">Figures S15</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000607.s017">S17</xref>). This model was used to estimate the average and distribution of the times of luciferase transcriptional switching in the GH3-DP1 stable cell line and gave a dominant overall cycle period of 11.0±3.3 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), which was in close agreement with the independent autocorrelation analysis described above (11.3 h; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, we estimated that there was an average on-phase duration of 4.0±1 h (which was slightly longer than the timing previously described for transcriptional bursts in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Metivier1">[24]</xref>). The average off-phase duration was 6.5±2 h per transcription cycle. No relationship was detected between the duration of the transcription on-phase and the preceding or subsequent off-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g005">Figure 5C and D</xref>).</p>

<p>There was strong evidence for a refractory period of approximately 3 h, in which cells cannot respond to a stimulus with a further transcriptional pulse. For each cell studied, the mean length of the off periods never fell below 3 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g005">Figure 5C and D</xref>). Thus, two distinct types of mathematical analyses indicated a similar duration for transcriptional cycles, and the stochastic binary switch model further suggested that the transcriptional on- and off-phases were independent, with each having defined average and minimum durations that may account for the kinetics of these cycles.</p>

<p>Analysis of gene expression kinetics from the <italic>hPRL-Luc</italic> reporter gene in GH3-DP1 cells showed that the transcriptional cycles persisted following FBK treatment. However, they were only seen in less than 20% of cells treated with TSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g008">Figure 8A and B</xref>). Analysis with the binary switch model showed that when the cells were treated with FBK, the median time to activation was longer and more variable than with TSA or TSA+FBK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). This supports the hypothesis of a refractory period of transcription inactivation in which chromatin remodeling may play an important role. Treatment with TSA increased the duration of the on-phase and the initial rate of transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g008">Figure 8D and E</xref>). Combined TSA+FBK treatment increased the transcription rate during the on-phase following activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g008">Figure 8E</xref>), resulting in a pronounced increase in maximum reporter gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). The response of cells to treatments that included TSA was more rapid and coordinated, suggesting that histone acetylation has a key role in the coordination of the temporal kinetics of transcription. Transcription of the <italic>hPRL</italic> gene might therefore require a long period of chromatin remodeling that is the source of the observed refractory phase.</p>

<title>Cycles of Prolactin Transcription Are Enhanced by a Non-Random Refractory Period in the Off-Phase</title>
<p>The rate at which mRNA is transcribed can be affected by different molecular mechanisms, including binding and dissociation of transcription factors, spatial reorganization, and/or chromatin remodeling. Previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Blake1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Raj1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Paulsson1">[26]</xref> have considered a model in which the fluctuations of transcription rates are caused by overall dynamics that can be described by a “random telegraph process,” where the gene switches between an active and an inactive state:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000607.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>The mean residence times for the active and inactive states are <italic>t<sub>active</sub></italic> = 1/<italic>k</italic><sub>−</sub> and <italic>t<sub>inactive</sub></italic> = 1/<italic>k</italic><sub>+</sub> and switch on- and off-times are drawn from an exponential distribution with means <italic>t<sub>active</sub></italic> and <italic>t<sub>inactive</sub></italic>. For the on-times our results fit this hypothesis and the estimated distribution of on-times is exponential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). Such a system would be memoryless in that the time already spent waiting in that state would not affect how much longer one would have to wait until the switch (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000607.s020">Text S1</xref> Section 3.5). The distribution of off-times in our data strongly contradicted this and was not distributed exponentially. This is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g009">Figure 9B</xref> in which the exponential distribution (black line) is a poor fit of the data. We found that the system had a definite memory, where the length of time already spent in the inactive state affected the length of time remaining in that state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g009">Figure 9C</xref>). Thus the dynamics of these transcription cycles are not compatible with the mathematical models previously derived from analysis of single cell RNA counting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Raj1">[10]</xref>.</p>

The superimposed black lines show the fit of an exponential distribution with the same mean value as the data. (C, F, and I) The off-phases in the system are not memoryless. The probability of having to wait for t hours in the off state given that the off-time has already lasted for s hours is plotted for a range of values of t for the distributions in (B, E, and H), respectively. The dashed lines represent the exponential probabilities, and the solid lines are the sample probability estimates. The uppermost lines are calculated when t = 0, the lines beneath that are calculated for t = 0.5, and so on in increments of 0.5. In a memoryless system such as that described by the telegraph process this is independent of s (hence s is constant for a given value of t), but for our system this probability decreases significantly with s during the refractory period (F). The decrease of this probability for higher values of s is due to the finite length of our time-series.

<p>An MCMC algorithm was applied which gave a distribution of estimates for the off-phase durations for single cells. When these estimates were amalgamated into a population distribution, the most likely off duration was at 3 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g009">Figure 9B</xref>), which is consistent with the individual estimates in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g005">Figure 5</xref>. Thus, the most likely explanation of the memory effect was the existence of a refractory period of approximately 3 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g005">Figure 5C and D</xref>). If this refractory period is enforced, by removing any chance of an off duration of less than 3 h, then the excess off durations were distributed approximately exponentially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g009">Figure 9E</xref>). This refractory period means that the system still has a memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g009">Figure 9F</xref>). Removing the refractory period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g009">Figure 9H</xref>) meant that the system became memoryless (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g009">Figure 9I</xref>).</p>
<p>One effect of this memory or refractory period is to cause more cyclicity than would be seen in a telegraph process. In a system with a 3 h refractory period where the excess off-time is exponentially distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g009">Figure 9E</xref>), a higher proportion of the off-times would be just over 3 h and the system would appear more cyclic. To quantify the regularity of the transcription cycles, we simulated 1,000 cells with on and off durations drawn from the corresponding distributions. We then performed autocorrelation analysis on this simulated data set and the variance in the timing of the first peak was taken to be our measure of cyclicity. The variance in first peak timing was higher when there was no refractory period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g009">Figure 9D and J</xref>) than when a refractory period was enforced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g009">Figure 9G</xref>). This analysis revealed that the presence of a defined refractory phase increases the regularity of the transcription cycles.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Physiologically important hormones such as PRL may be subject to both acute short-term regulation and long-term seasonal control. This could be achieved at the individual cell level by graded gene expression with feedback control of PRL expression. Such a model would suggest that each cell would express similar levels of PRL. Alternatively individual cells could dynamically switch between on- and off-phases producing a stable population average level of prolactin expression across the whole tissue. Studies of PRL promoter activity in intact pituitary tissue showed the whole tissue response was synchronized, although adjacent cells were not coordinated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Harper1">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>We have previously shown that expression from the PRL promoter is heterogeneous over time in individual cells from cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Takasuka1">[14]</xref> and more recently in intact pituitary tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Harper1">[27]</xref>. The latter study suggested that isolated cells show greater heterogeneity than cells in tissue but that tissue-level cellular heterogeneity is still important. In a different study we recently described data that suggested that cellular heterogeneity may be genetically encoded by the timing of negative feedback loops in the NF-κB signaling system and that this may lead to out-of-phase oscillations in NF-κB signaling between cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Paszek1">[28]</xref>. This study raised the hypothesis that cellular heterogeneity may in fact be advantageous, leading to more robust tissue-level responses. (Studies in other systems are in support of the idea that cellular variability is advantageous; e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Blake2">[29]</xref>.) The present study quantifies the level of heterogeneity in the dynamics of PRL gene expression in single cells. This heterogeneity may ensure stability in gene expression at the tissue level, while ensuring the readiness of the tissue as a whole to respond rapidly to signals.</p>
<p>These data suggest that the overall level of <italic>hPRL</italic> transcription in pituitary tissue may be determined by three variables: (1) the frequency of transcriptional bursts, (2) the duration of the on-phase, and (3) the rate of transcription during the on-phase. Our studies suggest that within a population of cells there is a continuous transition from an activated “on” state to a basal “off” or “low” state, with an overall cycle of around 11 h. This cycle is longer than previously described transcriptional cycles/pulses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Raj1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Zenklusen1">[12]</xref>, with a different structure due to the presence of a defined refractory period of transcriptional inactivation. Because of the much longer time-scales involved, the source of the stochasticity would not be expected to derive directly from that due to random molecular processes involving small molecule numbers. However, within this cycle, the average transcriptional on-phase is ∼4 h, which is closer to previously defined transcriptional bursts and cycles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Metivier1">[24]</xref>. The majority of the overall cycle time described here is therefore dominated by the off-phase. This could be due to a repressive chromatin state or alternatively could be regulated by chromosome topology with the timing dependent on the movement of the genes into and out of transcription factories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Fraser1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Iborra2">[32]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although the transcription cycle maintains relatively defined dynamics, the timing of transcription cycles from two independent promoters within a cell were heterogeneous, indicative of a system where intrinsic noise generated by local chromatin dynamics dominates extrinsic noise. Strong correlation between promoters could only be achieved following disruption of chromatin, suggesting that the cycles of <italic>hPRL</italic> transcription might involve epigenetic cycles of histone acetylation and deacetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g010">Figure 10</xref>). Thus, an independent chromatin-regulated cycle of gene activity may occur at each locus. Cycles in the binding of transcription factors and polymerase at certain genes in the nucleus have been observed following oestrogen stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Metivier1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Kangaspeska1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Metivier2">[34]</xref>.

<p>The current study illustrates the importance of new integrated experimental and mathematical approaches for dynamic single cell analyses. Providing high-frequency time-lapse imaging data of the same cells over long time periods enabled the identification of dynamic transcription processes, phenomena which are invisible to the single cell RNA counting snapshots used for previous analyses of transcriptional bursting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Spiller1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Ankers1">[36]</xref>.

<p>The data described in this study and by others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Lemaire1">[37]</xref> suggest that transcription cycles might emerge de novo from the intrinsic kinetics of the processes of transcription initiation, elongation, and termination. In our study we find that a transcriptional refractory period can have a dominant effect that leads to increased regularity in the timing of transcriptional cycles. This is in marked contrast with other cellular oscillatory systems such as NF-κB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Ashall1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Nelson1">[39]</xref>, p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Lahav1">[40]</xref>, Erk2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Shankaran1">[41]</xref>, and the circadian clock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Liu1">[42]</xref> where negative feedback loops are believed to lead to the oscillatory dynamics with varying frequencies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-White2">[43]</xref>.

Although the secreted hormone PRL is stored in secretory granules and displays both pulsatile and circadian patterns, is it not yet clear how transcription relates to secretory events in individual cells.</p>
<p>This system may be a new paradigm for understanding gene expression dynamics in vivo and may be important for understanding natural cell-to-cell variation in protein levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Sigal1">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Sigal2">[47]</xref>. We have previously shown that gene promoter activity in lactotroph cells within pituitary tissue is non-uniform, with varying expression levels from adjacent cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Harper1">[27]</xref>. However, these stochastic patterns together provide tissue-wide long-term coordinated behavior. If we include the new information gained in this present article we can start to build up a picture of a mosaic tissue structure, where, at any one time, a subset of cells are expressing <italic>PRL</italic>, a subset are in an inactive and refractory state, and a further subset are in an activatable state, ready to respond to a stimulus. A transient hormonal stimulus to the tissue would recruit this last subset of cells immediately, whereas sustained stimulus would progressively recruit additional cells exiting the refractory phase, resulting in a more sustained increase in <italic>PRL</italic> expression. If these stochastic and cyclical patterns of gene expression occur normally in intact tissue, such a mechanism would facilitate highly flexible transcriptional responses, allowing tissues to mount either acute or chronic responses to environmental cues, while maintaining a controlled average level of gene expression in the resting state.</p>

<title>Generation of Dual Reporter Transgenic Primary Rat Pituitary Cells</title>
<p>Generation of BAC-transgenic rats expressing luciferase and d2EGFP under the control of identical <italic>hPRL</italic> 160 kb genomic fragments was described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Semprini1">[16]</xref>. Transgenic line 37 was a luciferase-BAC transgenic rat line which was found to have two single reporter insertion sites. Further breeding of this line was undertaken to create two separate transgenic lines each with single integration sites. Line 37A had a single autosomal integration site, and line 37B an X-chromosomal integration site. (These lines were the source of the pituitary cells used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000607-g001">Figure 1</xref>.) Independently, a destabilized EGFP reporter transgenic rat line was constructed, termed line 455, which also had a single insertion site. The copy number of the luciferase-BAC transgene in line 37A was measured as ≤2 and that of the d2EGFP line 455 was ≤5. In order to generate the dual reporter rat cell line (previously referred to as PRL-Luc/d2eGFP in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Semprini1">[16]</xref>), line 37A was crossed with line 455.</p>

<title>Luminescence Imaging</title>
<p>GH3-DP1 cells were seeded in 35 mm glass coverslip-based dishes (IWAKI, Japan) 20 h prior to imaging. Luciferin (1 mM) was added at least 10 h before the start of the experiment, and the cells were transferred to the stage of a Zeiss Axiovert 200 equipped with an XL incubator (maintained at 37°C, 5% CO2, in humid conditions, carefully monitored to ensure equivalent conditions to a standard cell incubator) maintained within a dark room. Luminescence images were obtained using a Fluar ×20, 0.75 NA (Zeiss) air objective and captured using a photon-counting charge coupled device camera (Orca II ER, Hamamatsu Photonics, U.K.). Bright field images were taken before and after luminescence imaging to allow localization of cells. Sequential images, integrated over 30 min, were taken using 4 by 4 binning and acquired using Kinetic Imaging software AQM6 (Andor, Belfast, U.K.). In the relevant experiments, 5 µM forskolin and 0.5 µM BayK-8644 (FBK), 30 ng/ml TSA, or both stimuli were added directly to the dish at the indicated times.</p>

<title>Inference of Transcription Models</title>
<p>We use the following ordinary differential equations model for the reconstruction of transcription profiles from protein data (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Finkenstadt1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000607.s020">Text S1</xref> Section 3.2).<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000607.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula><disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000607.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <italic>M</italic> and <italic>P</italic> denote concentration of reporter mRNA and protein, respectively. The first equation describes the dynamics of mRNA molecules with transcription function τ<italic>(t)</italic> and degradation rate δ<italic><sub>M</sub></italic>. Protein is synthesized at a rate proportional to the abundance of mRNA and is degraded at rate δ<italic><sub>P</sub></italic>. The various parameters will be different for the d2EGFP and Luc reporters. The transcription profile can be reconstructed via<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000607.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where the unobserved mRNA profile is expressed as a function of the observed solution path of <italic>P(t</italic>), i.e. α<italic>M(t)</italic> = d<italic>P</italic>/d<italic>t</italic>+δ<italic><sub>P</sub>P(t)</italic>. Since <italic>M</italic> is not observed, prior knowledge of the rates δ<italic><sub>M</sub></italic> and δ<italic><sub>P</sub></italic> is necessary for the identification of the transcription profiles. We estimated these from two separate experiments where translation of reporter protein was inhibited by adding cycloheximide and transcription was inhibited by adding Actinomycin D (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000607.s020">Text S1</xref> Sections 1 and 3.2.2). The rates estimated for δ<italic><sub>M</sub></italic> and δ<italic><sub>P</sub></italic> associated with d2EGFP and Luc are treated as known parameters. For inference on the transcription profile, the solution path <italic>P(t)</italic> is approximated by a flexible continuous function, here a spline representation, fitted to the observed protein data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000607.s020">Text S1</xref> Section 3.2.3). The transcription profile is then reconstructed using the discrete Euler approximation to the differential equations for a small time interval, replacing <italic>P(t)</italic> by the fitted continuous function. In order to study the correlation in transcription of the dual reporter constructs within a cell, we compute the rank correlation coefficient between the two reconstructed transcription profiles of the two reporters d2EGFP and Luc within a cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000607.s020">Text S1</xref> Section 3.3). As this may vary over time (in particular for stimulated experiments), all correlations are computed as a function of the length of time since a stimulus (TSA, FBK) was added starting from 1.5 h (to allow for a reasonable minimal length over which any correlation is computed) to 8 h. For unstimulated experiments we computed correlations after 2 h into the experiment to avoid any initial bias. The question of estimating and including protein maturation times is addressed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000607-Komorowski1">[48]</xref>. In calculating the correlations, the relevant quantity is the difference in maturation times between the two reporters. We have therefore included this process with a constant difference of up to 1 h. We have verified that such delays do not change our correlation results. It is clear from this that if we instead assumed an exponentially distributed delay with a similar difference in means, then this would not affect the correlation results.</p>

<p>List of dual reporter experiments. For the correlation analysis, data from unstimulated experiments were pooled according to cell type into DP1, DP2, and primary. Data were also pooled according to stimulus into unstim, FBK, TSA, and TSA+FBK. Column 4 gives time of stimulation for stimulated experiments. Column 5 gives number of cells per experiment used for analysis after discarding cells with very low amplitude (number before discarding in brackets). The final column gives number of data points measured at hourly intervals. Data for the two reporters are not taken at identical time points, but this is corrected for in the analysis.</p>
