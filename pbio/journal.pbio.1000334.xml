<p>An engineered protein prevents aggregation of the Aβ peptide and facilitates clearance of Aβ from the brain in a fruit fly model of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>Protein aggregation, arising from the failure of the cell to regulate the synthesis or degradation of aggregation-prone proteins, underlies many neurodegenerative disorders. However, the balance between the synthesis, clearance, and assembly of misfolded proteins into neurotoxic aggregates remains poorly understood. Here we study the effects of modulating this balance for the amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide by using a small engineered binding protein (Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>) that binds with nanomolar affinity to Aβ, completely sequestering the aggregation-prone regions of the peptide and preventing its aggregation. Co-expression of Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> in the brains of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> expressing either Aβ<sub>42</sub> or the aggressive familial  associated E22G variant of Aβ<sub>42</sub> abolishes their neurotoxic effects. Biochemical analysis indicates that monomer Aβ binding results in degradation of the peptide in vivo. Complementary biophysical studies emphasize the dynamic nature of Aβ aggregation and reveal that Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> not only inhibits the initial association of Aβ monomers into oligomers or fibrils, but also dissociates pre-formed oligomeric aggregates and, although very slowly, amyloid fibrils. Toxic effects of peptide aggregation in vivo can therefore be eliminated by sequestration of hydrophobic regions in monomeric peptides, even when these are extremely aggregation prone. Our studies also underline how a combination of in vivo and in vitro experiments provide mechanistic insight with regard to the relationship between protein aggregation and clearance and show that engineered binding proteins may provide powerful tools with which to address the physiological and pathological consequences of protein aggregation.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Alzheimer's disease is thought to be a result of neuronal damage caused by toxic aggregated forms of the Aβ peptide in the brain. There is no cure and existing treatments are ineffective in reversing or preventing disease progression. Here we describe a novel strategy that makes use of an engineered “Affibody” protein to study the disease and potentially combat its underlying causes. The Affibody occludes the aggregation-prone regions of Aβ peptides, preventing their aggregation into toxic forms, and it also acts to dissolve pre-formed Aβ aggregates. It is functional in vivo, as its co-expression with Aβ peptides in transgenic fruit flies prevents the neuronal damage and premature death that result from expression of Aβ peptides alone. Moreover, we show that the origin of this protection is the enhanced clearance of Aβ peptides from the brain. These findings open up new opportunities for using engineered binding proteins to probe the origins of Alzheimer's disease and potentially to develop a new class of therapeutic agents.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Of the neurodegenerative disorders that have been linked to protein misfolding and aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Chiti1">[1]</xref>, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Blennow1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Hardy1">[3]</xref>. Transgenic animal models have shown that aggregation of the Alzheimer β-peptide (Aβ) causes memory impairment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Lambert1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Lesne1">[5]</xref> and cognitive deficits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Cleary1">[6]</xref> similar to those seen in patients suffering from AD. Aβ aggregation precedes neuritic changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-MeyerLuehmann1">[7]</xref>, and there is a quantitative correlation between the propensities of mutant forms of Aβ to aggregate and their neurotoxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Luheshi1">[8]</xref>. In vitro aggregation of Aβ proceeds from the initial association of monomers into oligomeric, but still soluble, assemblies that ultimately form highly structured and insoluble amyloid fibrils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Chiti1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Bitan1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Bucciantini1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Spillantini1">[11]</xref>. Evidence suggests that the primary neurotoxic species are the soluble oligomeric aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Lambert1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Lesne1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Haass1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Whalen1">[13]</xref> and that a fundamental building block may be dimeric Aβ species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Shankar1">[14]</xref>. However, despite this progress, the details of Aβ aggregation in vivo, the structure of toxic aggregates, the mechanism of toxicity, and in particular, the relationship between aggregate formation and peptide clearance are not known.</p>
<p>We set out to investigate a novel approach to study the dynamics of Aβ aggregation in vitro and neurotoxicity or degradation in vivo by using a conformation-specific Aβ binding protein, the Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> Affibody <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Grnwall1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Hoyer1">[16]</xref>. Affibody molecules are engineered binding proteins, which are selected by phage display from libraries based on the three-helix Z domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Nord1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Nygren1">[18]</xref>. The Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> Affibody was selected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Grnwall1">[15]</xref> to bind specifically to Aβ monomers with nanomolar affinity (dissociation constant K<sub>d</sub>≈17 nM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Hoyer1">[16]</xref>. It forms a disulfide-linked dimer to which Aβ binds and folds by induced fit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Hoyer2">[19]</xref> into a hairpin conformation such that its two aggregation-prone hydrophobic faces become buried within a tunnel-like cavity in the Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> dimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Hoyer1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Hoyer2">[19]</xref>. The specificity and well-characterized structural features of Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> binding to Aβ make it an ideal candidate for studying the effects of Aβ monomer binding in vivo. We find that the presence of the Affibody molecule, achieved by co-expression, can eliminate Aβ neurotoxicity in a fruit fly (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>) model of AD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Crowther1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Crowther2">[21]</xref>, and we used biochemical and biophysical experiments to identify the molecular mechanism by which this process occurs.</p>

<title>Elimination of Aβ Neurotoxicity In Vivo</title>
<p>We first generated <italic>Drosophila</italic> strains transgenic for Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>. As Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> is most effective in binding Aβ when it is in its dimeric form, we also generated <italic>Drosophila</italic> in which two copies of Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> are connected head-to-tail—(Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>—to enable the disulfide-linked dimer to form more readily. <italic>Drosophila</italic> transgenic for the wild-type Z domain were used as controls. These three Affibody fly lines were then each crossed with <italic>Drosophila</italic> transgenic for Aβ<sub>42</sub>, Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Nilsberth1">[22]</xref>, or Aβ<sub>40</sub>, and the co-expression of both transgenes together in the brain or in the eye was initiated by crossing with appropriate driver flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Crowther1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Crowther2">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>Expression of Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc> in the brain of <italic>Drosophila</italic> causes rapid neurodegeneration resulting in a drastic reduction in lifespan from 38 (±1.8) to 9 (±0.5) days, consistent with the findings of previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Luheshi1">[8]</xref>. Co-expression of Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> with Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc>, however, increases the lifespan to 20 (±0.2) days. Strikingly, if the-head-to-tail dimer (Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> is co-expressed with Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc>, the toxic effects of the peptide are yet further reduced and the lifespan increases to 31 (±0.8) days, which is almost as long as in wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000334-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000334.s008">Table S1</xref>) and indicates that the neurotoxicity of Aβ has been almost entirely abolished. Co-expression of the Z domain, which has no affinity for Aβ, does not affect Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc> toxicity, demonstrating that the rescue of Aβ toxicity in vivo is specific to Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>. Co-expression of Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> with wild-type Aβ<sub>42</sub> also significantly prolongs the lifespan of these flies (from 28, ±0.4, to 32, ±0.7, days). Again, the (Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> head-to-tail-dimer is even more effective, completely eliminating the toxicity associated with Aβ<sub>42</sub> (lifespan 40, ±1.2, days), whereas the Z domain control has no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000334-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Expression of the less aggregation-prone Aβ<sub>40</sub> has no effect on lifespan, and none of the Affibody molecules or the control significantly affected the lifespan of flies expressing Aβ<sub>40</sub> or wild-type <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000334-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>Each curve represents 100 flies divided equally into groups of 10. Expression of all Aβ peptides and Affibody proteins was under the control of the <italic>UAS-GAL4 system</italic>.

<title>Clearance of Aβ from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Brain</title>
<p>To determine the mechanism by which Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> mediates suppression of Aβ toxicity, we assessed the levels of Aβ<sub>42</sub> in the brains of flies co-expressing Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc> and either Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>, (Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, or the Z domain by Western blotting.

<title>Clearance of Aβ from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain.</title>
<p>(A) Electrophoretic (SDS PAGE) analysis of soluble Aβ in fly brain extracts. A clear Aβ immunoreactive band is seen at 8 kDa (consistent with an Aβ dimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Shankar1">[14]</xref>) in flies expressing Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc> and flies co-expressing Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc> and the Z domain. The 8 kDa Aβ immunoreactive band is absent in flies co-expressing Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc> and either Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> or (Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. β-actin immunodetection (bottom row) served as a loading control. (B) ELISA analysis of total (soluble and insoluble) Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc> concentration in the brains of flies expressing the different Affibody constructs. The levels of Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc> measured in the presence of the different Affibody molecules are expressed as a percentage of the concentration in the Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc> alone control. Differences between genotypes were analyzed by ANOVA and post hoc <italic>t</italic> tests. ** <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01. (C) Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy analysis of Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc> aggregates in intact brains from flies expressing Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc> alone or in combination with different Affibody constructs. Anti-Aβ immunostaining is shown in red, with a nuclear counterstain (TOTO-3) shown in blue. White boxes in brain images to the left are magnified to the right. Aβ immunoreactive aggregates are observed as puncta and are abundant in the brains of flies expressing Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc> alone or in combination with the Z domain. Immunoreactive Aβ deposits are sparse in brains where Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> is co-expressed with Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc> and absent in brains where (Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> is co-expressed with Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc>. (D) SDS PAGE analysis of Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> and (Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> levels in the presence and absence of Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc>. Twelve kDa anti-c-Myc immunoreactive bands (consistent with a disulfide linked Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> dimer) of equal intensity are detected in Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>-expressing flies in the presence or absence of Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc>. Twelve kDa anti-Affibody immunoreactive bands of equal intensity are also detected for the head-to-tail linked (Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> dimer.

<p>The Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>:Aβ complex is stable in 1% SDS (B. Macao, unpublished), and Aβ remaining in complexes or in SDS insoluble aggregates in the fly brain might therefore not be detectable by Western blot. In order to address this possibility, fly brains expressing Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc> with or without (Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> or the Z domain were homogenized in 5 M GdmCl, conditions known to dissociate both Aβ aggregates and Aβ:Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> complexes. The total level of Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc> in these extracts was then measured by a sensitive ELISA assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000334-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Flies expressing both (Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc> show a 97% (±3%) reduction in the concentration of Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc> compared to flies co-expressing Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc> and the inert Z domain (the most appropriate control for the non-specific effects of expressing a second transgene on the levels of Aβ). Decreased Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc> levels in the presence of different Affibody constructs correlate well with corresponding reduction in neurotoxicity measured by the survival assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000334-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The prevention of Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc> aggregation by Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> and (Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> is demonstrated by immunohistochemical detection of Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc> in whole mount brain preparations analyzed by confocal microscopy. Flies expressing Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc> under the control of the OK107-<italic>Gal4</italic> driver, which drives expression in a subset of adult neurons, contain abundant deposits in the brain recognized by the anti-Aβ 6E10 antibody, whereas flies co-expressing Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc> and (Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> have almost no visible 6E10 immunoreactive deposits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000334-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). In good agreement with the results of the ELISA analysis, co-expression of Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> results in a significant reduction in the burden of aggregates but does not result in their complete removal, whereas co-expression of the Z domain gives levels of Aβ deposits similar to those present in flies expressing Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc>.</p>
<p>In order to determine whether the presence of Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc> had altered the levels of Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> or (Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> present in the fly brain, brain homogenates were analyzed using either anti-cMyc antibodies to detect Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> or anti-Affibody antibodies to detect (Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>; both dimeric Affibody molecules can be observed as 12 kDa dimers under non-reducing conditions. The levels of these Affibody species are not detectably altered in flies co-expressing Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000334-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) despite the marked reduction of the levels of soluble Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000334-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). While this experiment suggests that Aβ clearance could be occurring without the corresponding clearance of its binding partner Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>, the quantities seen by Western blot represent the equilibrium levels of these two proteins, and so would not detect any turnover in Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> that may also be occurring.</p>
<p>We have established that the reductions in the levels of Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc> peptide in the fly brain are not due to altered gene regulation in flies co-expressing Z, Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>, or (Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, because the levels of Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc> transcription are not significantly reduced in any case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000334-g003">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> causes a reduction in Aβ<sub>42</sub><sc>e</sc>22<sc>g</sc> levels by actively promoting its clearance from the brain. The clearance does not involve any specific antibody-mediated process, since <italic>Drosophila</italic> lacks an adaptive immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Kim1">[23]</xref>. In order to determine at which stages of the Aβ aggregation process the Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> Affibody can intervene, we analyzed the effects of Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> on the dynamic interconversion of monomeric, oligomeric, and fibrillar Aβ species in vitro.</p>

<title>Kinetics of Amyloid Fibril Dissolution</title>
<p>We noted, however, during the course of the experiments that the ThT fluorescence signal tends to fall after the addition of Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> at advanced stages of the fibril formation reaction, suggesting that Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> may also act to reverse the aggregation process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000334-g004">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000334.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). To determine the kinetics of fibril dissolution by Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> in vitro, we set up experiments in which Aβ<sub>40</sub> monomers dissociating from pre-formed fibrils are captured by Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>. We used <sup>15</sup>N-labelled Aβ<sub>40</sub> for these experiments so that monomeric Aβ<sub>40</sub> in complex with Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> could be identified by solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy at low micromolar concentrations. The large fibrillar aggregates of <sup>15</sup>N-Aβ<sub>40</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000334-g004">Figure 4E</xref>) did not generate an observable NMR spectrum even after 24 h of data collection, as expected, due to slow molecular tumbling and no highly mobile residues. The addition of Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>, however, generated resonances from Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>-bound monomeric <sup>15</sup>N-Aβ<sub>40</sub>, indicating a gradual dissolution of the fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000334-g004">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000334.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Only a small fraction of the Aβ<sub>40</sub>, however, dissociates from the fibrils over the first three weeks; thereafter the dissolution process becomes very slow, even for fibrils fragmented by sonication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000334-g004">Figure 4G</xref>). Still, under these conditions the observed level of dissolution does not represent the equilibrium state, as the pre-formed Aβ<sub>40</sub>:Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> complex is stable in the presence of Aβ<sub>40</sub> fibrils (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000334.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Hence, even though binding of the Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> Affibody to monomeric Aβ<sub>40</sub> can act to dissolve fibrils, the dissociation kinetics are too slow, at least in vitro, for dissolution to be achievable in practice under ambient conditions.</p>

<title>Inhibition and Dissolution of Aβ Oligomers</title>
<p>In order to determine the critical issue of whether or not Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> can prevent the formation of smaller Aβ aggregates (oligomers), we examined their formation in vitro by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) in the presence and absence of Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000334-g005">Figure 5A to 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000334.s006">Figure S6</xref>).

By contrast, in the presence of the Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>, oligomer formation is completely inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000334-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), a result that can be attributed to the sequestration of Aβ<sub>42</sub> within the complex formed with the Affibody.</p>

<p>Isolated Aβ<sub>42</sub> oligomers contain elements of well-defined β-sheet structure as measured by circular dichroism (CD), but the β-sheet content is lower than in mature fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000334-g005">Figure 5E</xref>).

Addition of the Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> Affibody results in dissolution of the oligomers after a few days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000334-g005">Figure 5D, 5F, and 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000334.s007">Figure S7</xref>). This is because binding of monomeric Aβ acts to shift the dynamic monomer-oligomer equilibrium such that the oligomer population is reduced, and NMR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000334-g005">Figure 5H</xref>) and SEC analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000334.s006">Figure S6</xref>) consequently also reveal monomeric Aβ<sub>42</sub> in complex with Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The presence of the Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> Affibody in vivo results in the effective inhibition of Aβ toxicity and the promotion of Aβ degradation. These effects can be attributed to the ability of the Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> Affibody to act in three distinct ways on the Aβ aggregation process. First, monomeric Aβ will be sequestered by Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>, the result of which is that toxic Aβ aggregates will not be able to form in the brain. Second, if Aβ aggregation were to occur, it can be slowed, halted, and even reversed by the action of Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> on the dynamic Aβ monomer-aggregate equilibria. Furthermore, the presence of Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> not only prevents or reverses Aβ aggregate formation, it also promotes clearance from the brain. We envisage that this could occur either by intracellular lysosomal or proteasomal degradation, or alternatively by the secretion and uptake by phagocytic cells of the Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>:Aβ complex.</p>
<p>The results furthermore demonstrate how engineered binding proteins, such as Affibody molecules, that target specific protein conformations can be used to gain important insights into the dynamics of the Aβ aggregation process and its toxic consequences both in vivo and in vitro.</p>

<p>Oligomer formation was induced by adjusting the pH of alkaline (pH∼10.5) solutions of Aβ<sub>42</sub> (concentration ≤100 µM) in 20 mM sodium phosphate and 50 mM sodium chloride to pH 7.2 (with 1 M HCl) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Necula1">[25]</xref>. The samples were incubated at 21°C and oligomer formation was monitored with SEC and ThT fluorescence. Fifty µl (for analytical runs) or 1 ml (for preparative oligomer isolation) aliquots were injected onto an ÄKTA Explorer system (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) equipped with a Superdex 75 10/300 column, and the elution was monitored by UV absorbance at 220 nm. Preparative oligomer isolation was carried out 4–20 h after induction of oligomer formation and yielded oligomer solutions at 10–20 µM total Aβ<sub>42</sub> concentration. The elution volumes of the Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>:Aβ<sub>42</sub> complex and free Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> were determined in separate runs of the isolated complex or free Affibody, respectively, and conformed to previous SEC studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000334-Hoyer2">[19]</xref>. The amounts of Aβ<sub>42</sub> in the monomeric, oligomeric, or Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>-bound fraction were determined from the elution peak areas obtained by integration using the Unicorn software provided with the chromatography system. The data were normalized by setting to unity the sum of the oligomer and monomer peak areas in the first SEC profiles (at <italic>t</italic> = 0.2 h for oligomer formation in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000334.s006">Figure S6A</xref>, and at <italic>t</italic> = 0.5 h for oligomer dissolution in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000334.s006">Figure S6C</xref>). The fraction of high molecular weight aggregates that did not enter the column bed was calculated as the difference between unity and the sum of the monomer and oligomer fractions. The fraction of Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>-bound Aβ<sub>42</sub> shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000334-g005">Figure 5D</xref> was obtained by comparison of the integrated Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>:Aβ<sub>42</sub>/free Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> peak area with those obtained in calibration runs of free Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> (set to 0) and Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>:Aβ<sub>42</sub> complex (set to 1) using the same protein concentrations as in the dissolution experiment. The fraction of Aβ<sub>42</sub> bound to Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> was determined by <sup>15</sup>N HSQC NMR employing an internal concentration standard.</p>

<p><bold>Stability of the Aβ<sub>40</sub>:Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> complex in the presence of Aβ<sub>40</sub> amyloid fibrils.</bold> (A) <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC NMR spectrum of 100 µM <sup>15</sup>N-Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> bound to 100 µM unlabeled Aβ<sub>40</sub> before addition and (B) after addition of 100 µM <sup>15</sup>N-Aβ<sub>40</sub> in amyloid fibrils and incubation for 5 days at 37°C. Buffer, 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.1% sodium azide. Fibrillar <sup>15</sup>N-Aβ<sub>40</sub> is not detected by solution NMR because of its large size, for which slow tumbling results in line broadening. The spectrum of <sup>15</sup>N-Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> in the bound state (A) is retained in (B), and resonances of <sup>15</sup>N-Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> in the free state do not appear. This demonstrates that Aβ<sub>40</sub> does not leave the complex to be incorporated into the fibrils, i.e. the complex is stable in the presence of Aβ<sub>40</sub> amyloid fibrils. Moreover, resonances of <sup>15</sup>N-Aβ<sub>40</sub> bound to Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> do not appear in (B), i.e. <sup>15</sup>N-Aβ<sub>40</sub> monomers do not dissociate from the fibrils to exchange with unlabeled Aβ<sub>40</sub> monomers in the Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> complex. This finding is in agreement with the high kinetic stability of Aβ amyloid fibrils reported in this study. The lifetime of the Aβ<sub>40</sub>:Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> complex was determined as 2.6 (±0.3) h at 21°C. Dissociation of the complex cannot therefore be rate-limiting in this experiment. Lifetime determination was carried out by successive recording of the <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC NMR spectrum of <sup>15</sup>N-Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>:<sup>15</sup>N-Aβ<sub>40</sub> complex after addition of an excess of unlabeled Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> and monitoring the decrease in the intensity of the resonances assigned to bound <sup>15</sup>N-Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>.

Aβ<sub>42</sub> oligomers elute at the void volume (8.3 ml) and Aβ<sub>42</sub> fibrils cannot enter the column. (A) A solution of 100 µM Aβ<sub>42</sub> was incubated without stirring at 20°C. SEC analysis of samples removed at different times reveals the decrease in concentration of monomeric Aβ<sub>42</sub> with time and the transient formation of oligomeric species, followed by formation of HMW aggregates (fibrils). (B) Analysis of an equivalent Aβ<sub>42</sub> solution also containing a 1.2-fold excess of the Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> Affibody shows that the Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>:Aβ<sub>42</sub> remains stable without oligomer or HMW aggregate formation. (C,D) Oligomer dissolution: isolated oligomer Aβ<sub>42</sub> fractions isolated subjected to a second incubation followed by SEC analysis. In the absence of Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> (C), these dissolve on a timescale of several hours and monomeric Aβ<sub>42</sub> appears transiently prior to fibril formation. Oligomer dissolution in the presence of an 1.2-fold excess of Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> (D) results in Z<sub>Aβ3</sub>:Aβ<sub>42</sub> complex formation manifested in a small but significant shift in the elution volume of the Z<sub>Aβ3</sub> Affibody.
