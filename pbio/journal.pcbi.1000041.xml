Each cycle is comprised of two interconvertable forms of a particular protein. A classic signaling pathway is structured by a chain or cascade of basic cycle units in such a way that the activated protein in one cycle promotes the activation of the next protein in the chain, and so on. Starting from a mechanistic kinetic description and using a careful perturbation analysis, we have derived, to our knowledge for the first time, a consistent approximation of the chain with one variable per cycle. The model we derive is distinct from the one that has been in use in the literature for several years, which is a phenomenological extension of the Goldbeter-Koshland biochemical switch. Even though much has been done regarding the mathematical modeling of these systems, our contribution fills a gap between existing models and, in doing so, we have unveiled critical new properties of this type of signaling cascades. A key feature of our new model is that a negative feedback emerges naturally, exerted between each cycle and its predecessor. Due to this negative feedback, the system displays damped temporal oscillations under constant stimulation and, most important, propagates perturbations both forwards and backwards. This last attribute challenges the widespread notion of unidirectionality in signaling cascades. Concrete examples of applications to MAPK cascades are discussed. All these properties are shared by the complete mechanistic description and our simplified model, but not by previously derived phenomenological models of signaling cascades.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Cellular signaling is carried out by a complex network of interactions. A structure that is found commonly in signaling pathways is a sequence of on-off cycles between two states of the same protein, referred to as a cascade. By analyzing and reducing the basic kinetic equations of this system, we have constructed a new mathematical model of an intracellular signaling cascade. It is widely accepted that information travels both outside-in and inside-out in signaling pathways. Conversely, cascades, even while being main components of those pathways, have been so far understood as structures where signal transmission occurs in a manner analogous to a domino effect: the information flows in only one direction. Adding explicit connections linking a particular level with an upstream location has been the way bidirectional propagation has been explained so far. In other words, up to now, unidirectional cascades would allow bidirectional propagation only when embedded in more complicated circuits. The proposed model shows that a cascade can naturally exhibit bidirectional propagation without invoking extra re-wiring. This result inspires novel interpretations of experimental data; since signaling pathways are usually reconstructed from such data, this outcome could have far-reaching implications in the understanding of cell signaling.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the Department of Defense Breast Cancer Research Program (ACV), The Burroughs Wellcome Fund (SDM), the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (SDM) and the NIH (RO1 CA77612).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Covalent modification cycles are one of the major intracellular signaling mechanisms, both in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Alberts1">[1]</xref>. Complex signaling occurs through networks of signaling pathways made up of chains or cascades of such cycles, in which the activated protein in one cycle promotes the activation of the protein in the next link of the chain. In this way, an input signal injected at one end of the pathway can propagate traveling through its building-blocks to elicit one or more effects at a downstream location.</p><p>Examples of covalent modification are methylation-demethylation, activation-inactivation of GTP-binding proteins and, probably the most studied process, phosphorylation-dephosphorylation (PD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Alberts1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Kholodenko1">[2]</xref>. In such cycles, a signaling protein is activated by the addition of a chemical group and inactivated by its removal. This protein is modified in turn by two opposing enzymes, such as a kinase and a phosphatase for PD cycles. In the absence of external stimulation, a cycle exists in a steady state in which the activation and inactivation reactions are balanced. External stimuli that produces a change in the activity of the converting enzymes, shifts the activation state of the target protein, creating a departure from steady state which can propagate through the cascade.</p><p>The advantages of these cascades in signal transduction are multiple and the conservation of their basic structure throughout evolution, suggests their usefulness. A reaction cascade may amplify a weak signal, it may accelerate the speed of signaling, can steepen the profile of a graded input as it is propagated, filter out noise in signal reception, introduce time delay, and allow alternative entry points for differential regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Blthgen1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Thattai1">[5]</xref>.</p><p>Intracellular signaling through cascades of biochemical reactions has been the subject of a great number of studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Kholodenko1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Sauro1">[6]</xref> for reviews). Theoretical investigations have been motivated by the increased need for developing an abstract framework to understand the vast amounts of experimental data now available. This whole field of research is further motivated by the hope of characterizing pathways that are deregulated in diseases such as cancer and to define targets to combat these diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Hornberg1">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Since the stimuli a cell receives are varied and complex, cascades do not operate in isolation, but rather the integration of stimuli depends on crosstalk between pathways. Another crucial property of signaling cascades is their ability to integrate information by transmitting the effects downstream and also feedback upstream. In spite of a few decades of intense work on signaling cascades, no models have ever been built that exhibit crosstalk with backwards and forwards transmission of a lateral input from another cascade, except when <italic>ad hoc</italic> feedback is explicitly added to the cascade model. Our model, built from first principles, naturally exhibits these characteristics and therefore inspires novel interpretations of experimental data.</p><p>A well studied example of a cascade of activation-inactivation cycles is the cascade of protein kinases. In this case, the basic signaling unit is a PD cycle, whose activating kinase is the phosphorylated protein of the previous cycle. Many proteins contain several phosphorylation sites, allowing for great versatility of regulation. Such is the case, for example, for the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, which is widely involved in eukaryotic signal transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Blthgen1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Huang1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Blthgen2">[10]</xref>. For the sake of simplicity, in this article we will mostly consider cascades composed of simple, 2-state activation-inactivation cycles. However, the equations corresponding to the MAPK cascade are also derived and some of their properties compared with those of the simpler cascades. Even though our results are valid in general, for covalent modification cycles, we will employ the nomenclature associated with PD cycles, <italic>i.e</italic>. the converting enzymes will be referred to as kinase/phosphatase.</p><p>The focus of our study is to refine the mathematical modeling of cascades of covalent modification cycles, such us the one depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000041-g001">Figure 1</xref>. Several mathematical descriptions have been developed to describe such cascades using ordinary differential equations. Typically, those descriptions are built up starting with a model for a single cycle, which is then phenomenologically incorporated into a cascade of cycles. A well known model for describing the single cycle was introduced by the pioneering work of Goldbeter and Koshland (GK) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Goldbeter1">[11]</xref>. The GK model considers the concentration of the target protein to be in large excess over those of the converting enzymes, thereby reducing the description to a single equation per cycle. The model obtained in this way was then phenomenologically extended to a cascade of individual GK cycles. Here, by the designation “phenomenological” we mean that, in the cascade, the forward coupling between the GK cycles is chosen as simply as possible, but not strictly deduced from first principles. This phenomenological framework extension of the GK model will be denoted as the <italic>GK-like</italic> model. The GK-like model has been used by several authors to describe the dynamics of signal transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Kholodenko2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Goldbeter2">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-CsikszNagy1">[16]</xref>. For particular limiting cases, the GK-like model can be simplified further, which results in a model where the inter-converting reactions follow linear rate laws with first-order rate constants. This description was studied in several key papers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Heinrich1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Marhl1">[19]</xref>, and we will refer to it as the <italic>linear rates</italic> model.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000041-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000041.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of a cascade of covalent modification cycles.</title><p>The <italic>i<sup>th</sup></italic> cycle is composed of two states of the same protein: the inactive and the active states, labeled <italic>Y</italic><sub>i</sub> and <italic>Y<sub>i</sub><sup>*</sup></italic>, respectively.

What is especially appealing is the possibility of defining the cascade state by only one variable per module. As mentioned above, since the building blocks of the GK-like model are the well-studied GK cycles, they involve only one equation per cycle. A different approach however, is to deal with the dynamics of the cascade of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000041-g001">Figure 1</xref> by considering the complete set of biochemical reactions and by writing the corresponding equations without any upfront approximations. This was accomplished, for example, for the case of the MAPK cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Huang1">[8]</xref>. We will refer to this approach as the <italic>mechanistic</italic> model. For the purposes of this paper, we will consider that the mechanistic model represents a complete description of the system under study (event though we recognize that, in reality, it is not a hypothesis-free model).</p><p>In this article, starting from the mechanistic description of a cascade composed of an arbitrary number of cycles, we derive a consistent approximation under which the cascade is described with one variable per cycle. It turns out that in this derivation, referred to as a <italic>reduced mechanistic</italic> description, the phenomenological GK-like model is not recovered. At first sight, our new approximation differs slightly from the previously derived description for signaling cascades. However, it involves qualitatively different dynamics from the GK-like model, yet it is in very good agreement with the complete mechanistic description when the approximation conditions are fulfilled.</p><p>The main difference between our simplified mechanistic description and the phenomenological one is the appearance of an intrinsic feedback from each unit to the preceding one, caused by the fact that in each cycle there is sequestration of part of the activated protein of the previous step. The new description of the cascade predicts the existence of damped oscillations along the chain, a phenomenon that cannot be observed using the previous phenomenological description. Interestingly, a corollary of our model is that if a particular unit in the middle of the chain receives an input–a common event, given the high degree of crosstalk between signaling pathways–then our reduced mechanistic description predicts that this perturbation is able to travel both forwards and backwards. This “bicistronic” propagation, which may be critical for effective eukaryotic signaling, is not possible within the GK-like description either. Our model provides a suitable framework for future experiments that investigate crosstalk and bicistronic propagation of signals.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>How to Model a Signaling Cascade</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>A mechanistic description</title><p>We consider a cascade of biochemical cycles, as illustrated on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000041-g001">Figure 1</xref>, in which the two variables <italic>Y<sub>i</sub></italic> and <italic>Y<sub>i</sub></italic><sup>*</sup> represent two interconvertible forms of one protein, such as the dephosphorylated and the phosphorylated forms of a kinase; the activated form <italic>Y<sub>i</sub></italic><sup>*</sup> acts as a catalyst for the next reaction.

In this setting, the kinetic equations of the cascade can be written using the law of mass action (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000041.s001">Text S1</xref>), resulting in what we will call the mechanistic model.</p><p>Working in the framework of the mechanistic model offers the advantage that no mathematical approximations are needed (even though, overall, this is obviously not a hypothesis-free model), and this could be the optimal choice for comparing experimental data with numerical simulations of the model.

It is appealing then, to find out under which set of hypotheses can the mechanistic model be approximated by a simpler one, for example a model with a single variable per cycle. Arriving to such reduced description is the main contribution of the present paper. Before providing that description, we briefly review some approaches followed in the literature to study signaling cascades by means of only one equation per cycle (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000041.s002">Text S2</xref> for a summary).</p></sec><sec id="s2a2"><title>A model with linear rates</title><p>One possible simplification of the chemical reactions in Equation 1 is to neglect the formation of the complexes <italic>C<sub>i</sub></italic> and <italic>C′<sub>i</sub></italic>. This can be justified for instance, in the case where the rates <italic>k<sub>i</sub></italic> and <italic>k′<sub>i</sub></italic>′s are much larger than the other kinetic constants. Another point of view is to assume that the concentration of each enzyme-substrate complex is very small compared to the total concentration of the reaction partners <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Heinrich1">[17]</xref>. Neglecting those complexes in the reactions and then using the law of mass action, one can write the equations for the chain dynamics as follows:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000041.e002" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>with the definitions <italic>y<sub>i</sub></italic> = [<italic>Y<sub>i</sub></italic>]<italic>/Y<sub>iT</sub></italic> and <italic>y<sub>i</sub><sup>*</sup></italic> = [<italic>Y<sub>i</sub><sup>*</sup></italic>]<italic>/Y<sub>iT </sub>, Y<sub>iT</sub></italic> denoting the total available protein. <italic>y</italic><sub>0</sub><italic><sup>*</sup></italic> is the normalized input signal and the parameters are <italic>α<sub>i</sub></italic> = <italic>a<sub>i</sub>Y<sub>T</sub></italic> and <italic>β</italic><sub>i</sub> = <italic>a′<sub>i</sub>E′<sub>i</sub></italic>. Equation 2 must be complemented by the conservation equation <italic>y<sub>i</sub></italic>+<italic>y<sub>i</sub><sup>*</sup></italic> = 1, so here there is indeed a single degree of freedom in the cycle. The nonlinear system in Equation 2 has been dealt with by several authors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Heinrich1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Marhl1">[19]</xref>. We refer to this model as the linear rates model.</p></sec><sec id="s2a3"><title>An enzymatic model</title><p>The linear rates model does not account for the fact that the transformations from <italic>Y<sub>i</sub></italic> into <italic>Y<sub>i</sub><sup>*</sup></italic> and from <italic>Y<sub>i</sub><sup>*</sup></italic> into <italic>Y<sub>i</sub></italic>, are catalyzed by enzymes. This means that an intermediate enzyme-substrate complex is formed. Therefore, a second class of equations has been considered in the literature to model a covalent modification cycle, taking into account explicitly the enzymatic mechanisms involved. This approach was followed for the first time in the seminal work of Goldbeter and Koshland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Goldbeter1">[11]</xref>. Starting with a mechanistic model (but just for a single cycle), one can reduce the description to a single variable by considering that the concentration <italic>Y<sub>T</sub></italic> is in large excess over those of the converting enzymes. In this way, the enzyme-substrate complexes can be neglected from the conservation equation and they are expressed as a function of the substrates only in the kinetic equations. As usual, this Michaelis-Menten type mechanism is based on a quasi-steady state assumption for the rate of change of the complexes.

Blüthgen et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Blthgen1">[3]</xref> claim that, in several cases, current experimental data do not support neglecting the enzyme-substrate complexes from the conservation equation. If the affinity of kinase <italic>Y<sub>i</sub><sup>*</sup></italic> for the protein <italic>Y<sub>i</sub></italic><sub>+1</sub> is high, but its catalytic activity is rather slow, then <italic>Y<sub>i</sub><sup>*</sup></italic> will remain “sequestered” in the complex <italic>C<sub>i</sub></italic><sub>+1</sub>, causing a decrease in available free <italic>Y<sub>i</sub><sup>*</sup></italic>. This phenomenon has been called “sequestration” and it was shown that it can strongly reduce the ultrasensitivity of the chain. If sequestration is important, then the dynamics predicted by the model of Equation 4 is quite different from the one shown by the mechanistic model. Similar arguments are discussed in other work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Millat1">[20]</xref>. Moreover, it has been pointed out that the sequestration of part of the activated enzyme of one cycle by the next one has the effect of an “implicit feedback” in the chain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Millat1">[20]</xref>.

Three key dimensionless parameters are defined to facilitate the analysis:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000041.e005" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(5)</label></disp-formula><italic>ε<sub>i</sub></italic> and <italic>η<sub>i</sub></italic> are ratios of total amounts of proteins. <italic>ε<sub>i</sub></italic> is the ratio of total phosphatase over total targeted protein. <italic>η<sub>i</sub></italic> is defined as the total targeted protein in one cycle over the corresponding amount in the next cycle in the cascade, or, equivalently, the ratio of total kinase over total targeted protein. The parameter <italic>µ<sub>i</sub></italic> is the ratio of the kinetic rates of product formation in both the activation and the inactivation reactions (see reactions in Equation 1).</p><p>Using a standard singular perturbation analysis, we have found that the state of each biochemical cycle can be described by a single variable defined as <italic>x<sub>i</sub> = y<sub>i</sub><sup>*</sup>+c<sub>i</sub></italic><sub>+1</sub>, which is the natural slow variable describing the total kinase <italic>i</italic> available at a given time for the phosphorylation in cycle <italic>i</italic>+1. This reduction is only valid if the total phosphatase in the cycle is much lower than the total targeted protein, <italic>i.e.</italic>, in the limit <italic>ε<sub>i</sub>«</italic>1. The other parameters must satisfy <italic>µ<sub>i</sub> η<sub>i</sub>∼ε<sub>i</sub></italic>. The dynamics of <italic>x</italic><sub>i</sub> is described by the differential equation:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000041.e006" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(6)</label></disp-formula>with the following conservation equation from which <italic>y</italic><sub>i</sub> has to be extracted:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000041.e007" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(7)</label></disp-formula><italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub><italic> = S</italic> is the normalized input signal and <italic>y<sub>n</sub></italic><sub>+1</sub> = 0.

In the conservation equation (Equation 7), the notation <italic>O</italic>(<italic>ε<sub>i</sub></italic>) is just a reminder that this equation is written in the lowest order in <italic>ε<sub>i</sub></italic>, as is also the case for the differential equation for <italic>x<sub>i</sub></italic>. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000041.s001">Text S1</xref>, we discuss an improvement of this conservation equation which takes into account the first correction in <italic>ε<sub>i</sub></italic>. Although this extension does not alter the new properties discussed below, its numerical integration is easy and it increases the accuracy of the approximation.</p><p>The reduced system given by Equations 6–7 seems to be, in principle, equivalent to the GK-like model given by Equation 4. However, two main features make it significantly different. First, in our novel system, termed the reduced mechanistic model, the conservation equation depends on the variable of the previous cycle. Second and more interesting, the denominator of the negative term in Equation 6 is now a function of the next variable <italic>y<sub>i</sub></italic><sub>+1</sub>, in contrast to the GK-like model. This function has the appearance of an effective Michaelis-Menten coefficient <italic>K′<sub>eff,i</sub> = K′<sub>i</sub></italic> (1+<italic>y<sub>i</sub></italic><sub>+1</sub><italic>/K<sub>i</sub></italic><sub>+1</sub>), which is a typical way to indicate competitive inhibition in enzyme kinetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-ClelandW1">[22]</xref>. In the context of activation-inactivation cycles, a similar type of equation was obtained by Salazar and Höfer in the systematic study of a single cycle taking into account the competition between kinase and phosphatase to bind the same target protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Salazar1">[23]</xref>. In that case, an effective Michaelis-Menten coefficient appears also in the negative term of Equation 4, but with the form <italic>K′<sub>eff,i</sub> = </italic>(1+<italic>y<sub>i</sub>/K<sub>i</sub></italic>). In our study, however, the competition is induced by the next substrate <italic>y<sub>i</sub></italic><sub>+1</sub>, and this precisely describes a negative feedback from cycle <italic>i</italic>+1 on cycle <italic>i</italic>: the higher the level of <italic>x<sub>i+</sub></italic><sub>1</sub>, the smaller <italic>y<sub>i</sub></italic><sub>+1</sub> and, therefore, the larger the value of the negative term in Equation 6. This modified denominator reflects the influence of the downstream step on the state variables of one given cycle. It is not a detail of the formalism. It has consequences upon the dynamics and on the properties of the signaling pathway, as it will be demonstrated in the following sections. Moreover, we will see that, since our system arises from a controlled approximation of the mechanistic model, the dynamics of both models can be made comparable.</p><p>In the limit <italic>η<sub>i</sub>∼ε<sub>i</sub>«</italic>1, one retrieves the simple conservation law <italic>x</italic><sub>i</sub>+<italic>y</italic><sub>i</sub>≈1. However, we note that even in that limit and due to <italic>K′<sub>eff,i</sub></italic>, our resulting system is not equivalent to the GK-like model. Notice that <italic>η<sub>i</sub>∼ε<sub>i</sub>«</italic>1 is the closest we can be to the hypothesis behind the GK-like model, where it is considered that the concentration of the targeted protein is in large excess over those of the converting enzymes. In our description, the converting enzymes for unit <italic>i</italic> are <italic>E′<sub>iT</sub></italic> (phosphatase) and <italic>Y<sub>i−</sub></italic><sub>1,<italic>T</italic></sub> (kinase). Taking the limit <italic>η<sub>i</sub>«</italic>1 together with the fact that the targeted protein of each cycle is the activating protein of the next one, results in increasing protein concentrations as the cascade proceeds. Even though this is not the usual condition in signaling cascades, examples could arise where this limit is suitable. As a possible relevant example, the concentrations reported for the MAPK cascade go from <italic>nM</italic> in the first unit to <italic>µM</italic> in the second and third ones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Huang1">[8]</xref>.</p><p>In addition to the limit <italic>η<sub>i</sub>∼ε<sub>i</sub>«</italic>1, our perturbation scheme encompasses situations where the total protein does not necessarily increase along the cascade. We then allow <italic>η<sub>i</sub>∼</italic>1, for all or for some index <italic>i</italic>, as long as <italic>µ<sub>i</sub> η<sub>i</sub>∼ε<sub>i</sub>,</italic> which results in the limit <italic>µ<sub>i</sub>∼ε<sub>i</sub>«</italic>1. Since <italic>µ</italic><sub>i</sub> = <italic>k<sub>i</sub>/k′<sub>i</sub></italic>, this limit requires that the phosphatase of that cycle be much more active that the corresponding kinase. In this limit however, the conservation law remains as expressed in Equation 7 and no further simplification can be made. As a result, in this limiting case, the first term in Equation 6 depends on the variable describing the previous step in a different (and more complicated) way compared to Equation 4.</p><p>Finally, we notice that our description enables a reduction of the cascade equations with mixed hypothesis concerning the enzymatic reactions. For example, we could have <italic>µ</italic><sub>1</sub><italic>∼ε</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>η</italic><sub>1</sub><italic>∼</italic>1 for the first cycle, <italic>µ</italic><sub>2</sub><italic>∼</italic>1 and <italic>η<sub>2</sub>∼ε<sub>2</sub></italic> for the second cycle, etc. Or even <italic>µ<sub>i</sub>∼ε<sub>i</sub><sup>½</sup></italic> and <italic>η<sub>i</sub>∼ε<sub>i</sub><sup>½</sup></italic> for all or for some index <italic>i</italic>.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000041.s003">Text S3</xref>, we present the extension of the reduced mechanistic model for a cascade involving double-phosphorylation. Notwithstanding that these equations are more complicated than Equations 6–7, the distinguishing feature is maintained: each level in the cascade is subject to influence from the following level which, in the appropriate <italic>x<sub>i</sub></italic> variable, can be identified as a negative feedback. In the current study we analyze mostly static properties of these more complicated equations and compare them to those of Equations 6–7, while a more exhaustive characterization will be presented in a future article.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Characterizing the New Model</title><p>In this section we report on dynamic and static properties of the new chain equations (Equations 6–7), when studied by numerical simulations, and compare them to those of previous cascade models.

In the published experiments, the MAPK cascade is not isolated but embedded in the complex cellular machinery; therefore, the measured connectivities could involve proteins external to the cascade itself and it would be premature to establish the connection with our simplified model. Nevertheless, the work in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Santos1">[30]</xref> suggests a direction for the type of experiments that could validate our results.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The main contribution of this work is to propose a new one-variable per cycle model for signaling cascades of covalent modification cycles, consistent with a mechanistic complete description. Our model reveals new and biologically relevant properties of such cascades. These properties are characterized completely for the case of single-phosphorylated cascades. Furthermore, single and doubly-phosphorylated cases are compared regarding their stimulus-response curves, while a more exhaustive characterization of the scheme involving double phosphorylation will be presented in a future article.</p><p>The scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000041-g001">Figure 1</xref>, which has been employed by many groups, is suggestive of the concept of a “cascade”. From a systemic point of view, a cascade is a system composed of units, the output of which is successively an input to the next unit. Based on this structure, powerful concepts from control theory can be applied successfully to the study of signaling cascades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Angeli1">[14]</xref>. Although these concepts have proven its utility in many contexts, this kind of schematic representation implicitly conveys the idea that a signaling cascade is only a feed-forward chain in which signal transmission is analogous to a domino effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Gonze1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Murray1">[33]</xref>. Our study sheds a different light on this system, showing that this schematic representation can be misleading, since it turns out that each unit is actually coupled not only to the following one but also to the previous one, and interesting dynamics can arise from these interactions.</p><p>Our initial motivation for developing a new one-variable description of signaling cascades, was the following observation. The main assumption underlying the GK description of a single cycle is that the concentration of the target protein is in large excess compared to those of the converting enzymes. Holding the same assumption over a cascade of units would mean that the target proteins are in higher and higher concentration as the cascade progresses, since they act as the transforming enzyme for the following cycle. To our knowledge, this important issue has not been remarked upon in the literature, except for a brief comment in the work of Millat et. al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Millat1">[20]</xref>, page 11).</p><p>In order to get more insight into this point, we have sought special limiting cases for which the mechanistic and the GK-like model are in good agreement. However, it turns out that the dynamics of the signaling cascade described by the mechanistic and the GK-like models cannot be compared consistently. The fundamental reason for this mismatch is that a careful perturbation analysis applied to the mechanistic model provides a different set of equations.</p><p>We note that in search for an adequate set of hypothesis leading from the mechanistic equations to the model given by Equations 4, we have studied an alternative scheme in which the modified protein <italic>Y<sub>i</sub></italic><sup>*</sup> is not directly the kinase of the next reaction. Instead, we studied the case where <italic>Y<sub>i</sub></italic><sup>*</sup> activates that kinase. This scheme was suggested by the work of Goldbeter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Goldbeter2">[12]</xref>. The resulting equation (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000041.s007">Text S7</xref>) is fundamentally different from the GK-like model. In reality, no set of assumptions can give rise to the GK-like model as a limiting case of our model.</p><p>Our mathematical method relies on the standard quasi-steady state assumption (QSSA), which can be applied under well defined conditions to elicit a clear separation between the slow and fast dynamics of the mechanistic model. Under this standard QSSA framework, our analysis shows that a good slow variable for which evolution equations can be written is the sum of the free activated enzyme which is available in the <italic>i<sup>th</sup></italic> cycle plus the amount of this protein which is captured by the next inter-converting cycle. The idea of working with a mixed variable <italic>x<sub>i</sub></italic> can be further generalized by considering the “total” variable corresponding to the total amount of activated enzyme found not only as free molecules or bound to the next substrate, but also complexed with the reverse enzyme <italic>E′<sub>i</sub></italic>. In fact, this choice is the key ingredient of the method called the “total” quasi-steady state approximation (tQSSA) which has been proved to be a simple but most efficient extension of the standard QSSA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Borghans1">[34]</xref>. The application of this extended framework to the description of the signaling cascade of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000041-g001">Figure 1</xref> is concerned with our current research. In the same context, other authors have recently applied the tQSSA method to the study of small networks of GK cycles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Ciliberto1">[35]</xref>. These systems do not form cascades, but involve a more complicated coupling between the units. Nevertheless, their results show that indeed the tQSSA method is successful in obtaining a reduced set of equations, with one variable per cycle, which faithfully reproduces the dynamics of the network for a large range of system parameters.</p><p>Even in the less extended QSSA framework, the conditions under which the model is valid are made clear. Under such conditions, our new model is indeed in perfect agreement with the complete mechanistic model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000041-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Those conditions are expressed in terms of three key parameters (Equation 5) we have defined to simplify the study. Even though the phenomenological equations, Equation 4, are appealing because of their simpler form and modular nature, we could not find any set of assumptions that would enable us to recover those descriptions. Our simplified model reveals properties of signaling cascades that were either hidden by the complex structure of the complete mechanistic model or lost in the simplified phenomenological descriptions.</p><p>It was stated that the reduced mechanistic model is valid whenever these two conditions are satisfied: <italic>ε<sub>i</sub>«</italic>1 and <italic>µ<sub>i</sub> η<sub>i</sub>∼ε<sub>i</sub></italic>. The study of the performance of the new approximation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000041-g002">Figure 2</xref> and the corresponding computed errors) makes it clear that even when those conditions are satisfied only moderately, the new model is still robust in approximating the complete description. As an example, we have computed a 5% error for <italic>ε</italic> = 0.1, <italic>η</italic> = 1, and <italic>µ</italic> = 0.5 (meaning <italic>µη∼</italic>5<italic>ε</italic>). Moreover, we have observed that the steady state predictions of the reduced model are highly accurate. Therefore the properties of signaling cascades we are unveiling thanks to the new reduced model, are not restricted by a tight relationship between concentrations and reaction rates hard to achieve in <italic>in vivo</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions.</p><p>All the novel properties of a signaling cascade reported in this paper are linked, as previously mentioned, to the negative feedback from each unit to the previous one. This backward negative feedback can produce damped temporal oscillations in the chain, or it can create amplified “pathway” oscillations in the steady states of the cascade. Interestingly, it can also transduce a signal both forward and backwards. Given the multi-branched complex nature of many signal transduction pathways, this finding could have wide implications and can help focus further experimental investigation.</p><p>It has recently been reported that the 3-level MAPK cascade has autonomous oscillations without any kind of added explicit feedback <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Qiao1">[36]</xref>. Following a systematic numerical exploration of the corresponding mechanistic model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Huang1">[8]</xref>, the authors provide a qualitative description of the mechanism responsible for these sustained oscillations. Their explanation strongly suggests the necessity of a bistable behavior at the second or third levels of the cascade, thus requiring double-phosphorylation at these stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Markevich1">[37]</xref>. Consistent with their findings, we have observed only damped oscillations in the dynamics of the single-phosphorylated cascade (Equations 6–7), which has been the main focus of the present work. Interestingly, preliminary numerical simulations of our reduced doubly-phosphorylated cascade model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000041.s003">Text S3</xref>), indicates that these autonomous oscillations are recovered in the simplified description.</p><p>The stimulus-response curves of the new model were also investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000041-g005">Figure 5</xref>). They have the usual sigmoidal shape characteristic of ultrasensitive responses; however, they exhibit lower steepness when compared with the output of the GK-like model. This result corroborates the conclusions stated in the work of Blüthgen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Blthgen1">[3]</xref>, where an analysis of the effect of sequestration was conducted. This effect is partially mitigated by double-phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000041-g006">Figure 6</xref>), as expected from the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000041-Ferrell1">[27]</xref>.</p><p>To further characterize the new model within realistic conditions, we have studied it subject to different sets of published parameters corresponding to a well-known signaling pathway, such as the MAPK one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000041-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000041-g007">7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000041.s006">Text S6</xref>). We have found that the ability of the model to transduce a signal both forward and backwards is widespread and that the effect is of enough magnitude to allow experimental verification.</p><p>Finally, we have applied a modular response analysis to determine the network architecture of the cascade described by the new model equations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000041-g008">Figure 8</xref>). This well-known approach enables not only to test the bidirectional structure of the cascade, but also to estimate the relative strength of the backward interaction.</p><p>In summary, our findings do not at all weaken the importance of previous models like the GK-like models and those with linear rates. To the contrary, the results of our model provide a different approach to deal with a simple one-variable per cycle model to describe signaling cascades. We hope that our contribution will help in the understanding of existing models for signaling cascades, will improve the description of available data, and will inspire both theoretical and experimental investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Methods</title><p>All the ODEs were integrated in MATLAB 7 (Mathworks, Natick, MA).
