<p>Autoregulation of transcription factors and cross-antagonism between lineage-specific transcription factors are a recurrent theme in cell differentiation. An equally prevalent event that is frequently overlooked in lineage commitment models is the upregulation of lineage-specific receptors, often through lineage-specific transcription factors. Here, we use a minimal model that combines cell-extrinsic and cell-intrinsic elements of regulation in order to understand how both instructive and stochastic events can inform cell commitment decisions in hematopoiesis. Our results suggest that cytokine-mediated positive receptor feedback can induce a “switch-like” response to external stimuli during multilineage differentiation by providing robustness to both bipotent and committed states while protecting progenitors from noise-induced differentiation or decommitment. Our model provides support to both the instructive and stochastic theories of commitment: cell fates are ultimately driven by lineage-specific transcription factors, but cytokine signaling can strongly bias lineage commitment by regulating these inherently noisy cell-fate decisions with complex, pertinent behaviors such as ligand-mediated ultrasensitivity and robust multistability. The simulations further suggest that the kinetics of differentiation to a mature cell state can depend on the starting progenitor state as well as on the route of commitment that is chosen. Lastly, our model shows good agreement with lineage-specific receptor expression kinetics from microarray experiments and provides a computational framework that can integrate both classical and alternative commitment paths in hematopoiesis that have been observed experimentally.</p>

<p>Complex biomolecular interaction pathways in signaling networks can lead to non-intuitive behaviors that can prove critical for the regulation and robustness of biological processes. In this work, we present a signaling topology that can generate dynamic responses that are particularly pertinent to cell commitment in hematopoiesis. Our minimal model explores fundamental questions of instructive signaling that have persisted in cell-fate decisions. We show that even when lineage commitment decisions are inherently noisy, external cytokine signals, amplified by receptor upregulation, can bias the lineage choices of a progenitor cell. The multipotent progenitor, based on its differentiation potential, can exhibit several layers of memory to provide stability to both intermediate and mature states and can potentially bypass canonical intermediate states in generating mature cell types. Thus, our model provides a computational framework that can accommodate both classical and non-classical commitment paths in hematopoiesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Multipotent stem cells have the ability to both self-renew and differentiate, thus sustaining the stem cell pool and giving rise to mature, specialized cells, respectively. The hematopoietic stem cell (HSC), located in the adult bone marrow, is well characterized and has served as a popular model system for understanding self-renewal, lineage commitment, and differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Eckfeldt1">[1]</xref>. HSCs are responsible for producing the entire repertoire of blood cells through the process of hematopoiesis. During hematopoiesis, HSCs lose the capacity to self-renew and differentiate into common myeloid progenitors (CMP) and common lymphoid progenitors (CLP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Kondo1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Akashi1">[3]</xref>. Multipotent progenitors undergo further lineage-restricted differentiation to give rise to mature cells via bipotent progenitors. In addition to this classical commitment paradigm in hematopoiesis, alternative pathways are emerging. For example, it has also been observed that HSCs and multipotent progenitors can bypass canonical intermediate states during commitment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Kondo1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Adolfsson1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Kondo2">[5]</xref>. The exact molecular events that direct lineage commitment at the stem cell stage or at the multipotent progenitor level remain elusive, but it is well appreciated that lineage-specific transcription factors and cytokine receptors play critical roles.</p>
<p>Lineage-specific transcription factors have been identified as master regulators of commitment and differentiation. They drive the expression of pertinent lineage-specific genes, thereby initiating the phenotypic change in the progenitor cell down a specific differentiation path <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Rosenbauer1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Iwasaki1">[7]</xref>. Developmental potency of a multipotent progenitor is reflected by the co-expression of multiple lineage-specific transcription factors at low levels, a phenomenon known as transcriptional priming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Laslo1">[8]</xref>. This promiscuous gene expression pattern in the progenitor cell necessitates that, during cell differentiation, a specific transcription factor is upregulated, chiefly by positive autoregulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Chen1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Tsai1">[10]</xref>, and other lineage transcription factors are downregulated, primarily through cross-antagonism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Cantor1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Liew1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>In addition to lineage-specific transcription factors, cell differentiation is also believed to be tightly regulated by cytokines. Cytokines signal via their cognate receptors whose cytoplasmic domains activate various pathways involved in survival, proliferation, and differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Robb1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Murphy1">[16]</xref>. It has been extensively debated whether cell fate during differentiation is a stochastic or an instructive process. The stochastic theory claims that the differential expression of lineage-specific transcription factors due to intrinsic noise in progenitor cells dictates the commitment decision <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Abkowitz1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Losick1">[19]</xref>, whereas the instructive theory argues that the absolute dependence on lineage-specific cytokine receptor signals during differentiation shows that cell-fate decisions are regulated by extrinsic growth factor cues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Robb1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Metcalf1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Rieger1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Metcalf2">[21]</xref>. An underlying question evoked by both of these theories is whether cytokines provide instructive cues or select lineage-committed progenitors by providing permissive survival and proliferation signals. The instructive model does not account for the occurrence of certain mature cell types even when their lineage-specific receptors are knocked out <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Murphy1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Enver1">[18]</xref>. The predetermined distribution of the heterogeneous progenitor population into mature cells, as suggested by the stochastic model fails to explain how specific cell types can be enriched during stress or how homeostasis is restored after infections or therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Metcalf1">[15]</xref>. A recent landmark study utilizing bioimaging techniques at the single-cell level suggests that there is validity to both of these theories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Rieger1">[20]</xref>. These authors showed that lineage-specific cytokines can strongly instruct lineage choice, although differentiation was still possible in the absence of lineage-specific cytokines.</p>
<p>A more comprehensive understanding of lineage commitment may emerge by analyzing the biochemical associations that coordinate cell-extrinsic and cell-intrinsic events. The promiscuous gene expression pattern during differentiation is observed not only in lineage-specific transcription factors, but also in lineage-specific receptors. A critical commitment signal during differentiation is the upregulation of the transcription factor, which aids in expressing the lineage-specific genes; however, the need to upregulate the lineage-specific receptor, an event also integral to commitment, is still unclear. This is particularly confounding since the low number of lineage-specific receptors present in a progenitor cell is sufficient for providing permissive survival cues. During lineage commitment, the expression of the cytokine receptor mirrors the expression of the transcription factor, often due to the presence of transcription factor binding domains in the promoter region of the receptor gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Chiba1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Smith1">[25]</xref>. The advantage of regulating the lineage-specific receptor expression through the lineage-specific transcription factor is not apparent. Recent biochemical evidence also suggests that cytokines can provide signals to functionally activate lineage-specific transcription factors through post-translational modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Zhao1">[26]</xref> and can also regulate the expression of transcription factors during cell differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Dahl1">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>Cell differentiation is believed to be an all-or-none “switch-like” event rather than a gradual transition of a precursor cell to a stable, mature cell. Mathematical modeling and analysis have been successfully used to provide insights into the biological networks that give rise to such switch-like behaviors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Callard1">[28]</xref>. Typically, the networks involved in lineage specification seem to engender cellular memory through nonintuitive behaviors, such as bistable response profiles. The components that generate bistability, the toggling of the system between two stable steady states, include nonlinear feedback loops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Ferrell1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Ferrell2">[30]</xref>, external noise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Samoilov1">[31]</xref>, and multi-site covalent modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Markevich1">[32]</xref>. Previous lineage commitment models have suggested that transcriptionally primed multipotent progenitors are capable of exhibiting bistability purely via cell intrinsic events of autoregulation and cross-antagonism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Laslo1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Roeder1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Huang1">[34]</xref>, but these models have assumed the existence of cooperative positive feedback loops to achieve bistability and do not consider the role of extracellular cues.</p>
<p>While cooperativity is a widely recognized biological mechanism that may play an important role in lineage commitment, alternative mechanisms can generate similar switch-like behavior in networks where cooperativity has not been observed. For example, we have previously shown that cytokine-regulated, positive feedback of receptor can generate robust bistability to stimulus without cooperativity in a deterministic model for unilineage commitment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Palani1">[35]</xref>. Furthermore, even in networks with cooperativity, receptor-mediated feedback may provide additional robustness to the system behavior and, perhaps more importantly, offer an external mode of regulation of cell-fates.</p>
<p>Here, we present a minimal model that integrates the bidirectional regulation between lineage-specific cytokines and transcription factors with previously explored autofeedback loops and cross-antagonism to understand the interplay between cell-extrinsic and cell-intrinsic factors in fate decisions of hematopoietic progenitors. Our model shows that the strength of cross-antagonism can be a critical determinant in achieving multistability. The analyzed network exhibits a “bilayer” of memory with respect to external stimuli to provide robustness to both the bipotent and committed states. The model suggests that noise in the network can enable stochastic switching between the stable states; however, the distribution of the uncommitted population among the various states during differentiation can still be strongly biased by external cues (as has now been experimentally observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Rieger1">[20]</xref>). Furthermore, this modeling framework captures both classical and alternative modes of lineage commitment seen in hematopoiesis. Although discrete cell fates are likely to represent high-dimensional attractors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Huang1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Chang1">[36]</xref>, our minimal model may provide an initial step towards understanding how extrinsic factors integrate with intrinsic factors and may elucidate new mechanisms that underlie cell-fate decisions.</p>

<title>Model formulation</title>
<p>Different cell states in our model are identified by the relative expression levels of lineage-specific receptors and transcription factors. An uncommitted (or ‘off-state’) cell, such as a common myeloid progenitor (CMP), is one that expresses lineage-specific receptors and transcription factors for multiple lineages at low levels. It is primed to differentiate into several lineages, but not yet committed to any specific lineage. A bipotent (or ‘intermediate-state’) cell, such as a megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitor (MEP), is one that is restricted to exactly two lineages, but not yet committed to either of them. Lineage-specific receptors and transcription factors for the two lineages are expressed at intermediate levels. A committed (or ‘on-state’) cell, such as a proerythroblast, is one that expresses the receptor and transcription factor of a single lineage at a high level and will eventually terminally differentiate into the corresponding mature cell.</p>
<p>The topology of our minimal model for multilineage commitment was informed by various experimental studies on lineage-specific receptors and transcription factors. The cytokines Epo, Tpo, GCSF, and MCSF have been shown to offer instructive cues to uncommitted and bipotent cells to differentiate into committed cells, which then terminally differentiate into erythrocytes, megakaryocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Akashi1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Metcalf1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Rieger1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Bruno1">[37]</xref>. Lineage-specific transcription factors GATA-1, PU.1, T-bet, and GATA-3 orchestrate the differentiation program of erythrocytes, neutrophils, Th1, and Th2 cells, respectively, by regulating the expression of their lineage-specific genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Rosenbauer1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Amsen1">[38]</xref>. Transcription factors GATA-1 and PU.1 have been shown to autoregulate their gene expression by binding to the promoter region of their own genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Chen1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Tsai1">[10]</xref>. Erythrocytic transcription factor GATA-1 has been shown to transactivate the Epo receptor (EPOR) gene and the neutrophilic transcription factor PU.1 has been observed to regulate the expression of the GCSF receptor (GCSFR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Chiba1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Smith1">[25]</xref>. A transcription factor can prevent another transcription factor from binding to DNA either by competitively binding to response elements (as in the case of GATA-1 and GATA-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Grass1">[12]</xref>) or by binding to the DNA-binding domain of the transcription factor itself (for example, GATA-1 and PU.1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Liew1">[13]</xref>).</p>
<p>The topology shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g001">Figure 1</xref> represents a generalized minimal network of these observed connections between the cytokine and lineage-specific transcription factor during lineage commitment. The model assumes that the fate decision of an uncommitted cell to either lineage A or lineage B is determined solely by the concentrations of the active forms of the respective lineage-specific transcription factors, ATF<sub>A</sub> and ATF<sub>B</sub>. The components that drive the formation of each ATF are the inactive transcription factor (ITF), which serves as the substrate, and the ligand (L)-receptor (R) complex (C), which serves as the enzyme. The strong upregulation of ATF during lineage commitment is achieved through two positive feedback loops that upregulate ITF and R, respectively. Transcription factor feedback is a cell-intrinsic autofeedback loop and receptor feedback is an externally (ligand) regulated positive feedback loop. F<sub>1A</sub> and F<sub>2A</sub> (expressed in molecules/min) denote the strengths of the transcription factor and receptor feedback loop for lineage A, respectively; F<sub>1B</sub> and F<sub>2B</sub> represent the corresponding feedback strengths for lineage B. During commitment, a lineage-specific transcription factor gets upregulated and other lineage transcription factors get downregulated due to cross-antagonism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Cantor1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Liew1">[13]</xref>. The mechanism of cross-antagonism between the transcription factors is modeled to be competitive inhibition in binding to response elements present upstream of the transcription factor and receptor genes, thereby affecting the strengths of the two positive feedback loops. While cell fates are likely to represent high dimensional attractors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Huang1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Chang1">[36]</xref> and this higher level of complexity is not considered here, our minimal model framework may be useful in elucidating the interplay among extrinsic and intrinsic factors in lineage commitment and differentiation. The deterministic (ordinary differential equations) and the stochastic (probability functions) versions of the model along with the kinetic parameters and initial conditions are provided in Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000518.s003">Tables S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000518.s004">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000518.s005">S3</xref>.</p>

<title>A minimal model of multilineage commitment.</title>
<p>A multipotent progenitor expresses lineage-specific receptors (R<sub>A</sub> and R<sub>B</sub>) and inactive transcription factors (ITF<sub>A</sub> and ITF<sub>B</sub>) at low levels with the potential to differentiate into lineage A or B. Addition of ligand (L<sub>A</sub>, L<sub>B</sub>) leads to complex formation (C<sub>A</sub>, C<sub>B</sub>), which activates the corresponding lineage-specific transcription factor. Active TF (ATF<sub>A</sub>, ATF<sub>B</sub>) binds to the response elements present upstream of the transcription factor and receptor genes and induces two positive feedback loops (dashed green arrows). To account for cross-antagonism between the lineages, the active transcription factors are modeled to competitively inhibit the activation of the positive feedback loops in the other lineage (dashed red lines). F<sub>1A</sub> and F<sub>2A</sub> denote the respective strengths of the transcription factor and receptor feedback loops for lineage A; similarly, F<sub>1B</sub> and F<sub>2B</sub> represent the corresponding feedback strengths for lineage B. Inhibitor dissociation constants K<sub>IA</sub> and K<sub>IB</sub> denote the inhibitory effect of A on B and B on A, respectively.</p>

<title>Double positive feedback loops, coupled with moderate transcriptional cross-antagonism, can lead to multistability</title>
<p>To explore the role of the two positive feedback loops in lineage commitment, we first considered the case with no competitive inhibition between the transcription factors. The inhibitor dissociation constants K<sub>IA</sub> (inhibitory effect of A on B) and K<sub>IB</sub> (inhibitory effect of B on A) are kept infinite. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g002">Figure 2A</xref> shows the steady-state values of ATF<sub>A</sub> as the strength of two autofeedback loops, F<sub>1A</sub> and F<sub>1B</sub>, are changed. The strengths of the receptor-mediated feedback loops and the ligand levels are kept constant (F<sub>2A</sub> = F<sub>2B</sub> = 3 molecules/min, L<sub>A</sub> = L<sub>B</sub> = 100 molecules). We can see that the system rests in the uncommitted state when F<sub>1A</sub> = 0 for the chosen F<sub>2</sub> and L values. As we increase F<sub>1A</sub>, the system switches to the on-state (committed state) for lineage A. Since F<sub>1</sub> constitutes the strength of the autofeedback loop in A, increasing F<sub>1A</sub> over the threshold value will increase the set point of ATF<sub>A</sub> in the on-state, provided F<sub>2A</sub> is not limiting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Palani1">[35]</xref>. To consider the effect of receptor-mediated feedback on the steady-state values of ATF<sub>A</sub>, the strength of the autofeedback loops and ligand are kept constant (F<sub>1A</sub> = F<sub>1B</sub> = 3 molecules/min, L<sub>A</sub> = L<sub>B</sub> = 100 molecules). Similar to F<sub>1A</sub>, there seems to be a critical value for F<sub>2A</sub> at which the system switches to the on-state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). As F<sub>2</sub> controls the activation loop, increasing F<sub>2A</sub> beyond the critical level will not change the on-state set point value of ATF<sub>A</sub>, provided F<sub>2A</sub> is not limiting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Palani1">[35]</xref>. As expected, F<sub>1B</sub> and F<sub>2B</sub> have no effect on ATF<sub>A</sub> since we have assumed no crosstalk between the two pathways.</p>

<title>Effect of the positive feedback loops on the on-state ATF<sub>A</sub> levels.</title>
<p>A. Strengths of the autofeedback loops (F<sub>1A</sub> and F<sub>1B</sub>) are varied for both lineages and the steady-state values of ATF<sub>A</sub> are plotted for the no inhibition condition (K<sub>IA</sub> = K<sub>IB</sub> = ∞), keeping the strengths of the receptor feedback (F<sub>2</sub>) constant. B. Strengths of the receptor feedback loops (F<sub>2A</sub> and F<sub>2B</sub>) are varied and the values of ATF<sub>A</sub> are plotted for the no inhibition condition, keeping the strengths of the autofeedback (F<sub>1</sub>) constant. C. Same as part A except with moderate inhibition (K<sub>IA</sub> = K<sub>IB</sub> = 400 molecules). D. Same as part B except with moderate inhibition. E. Cross-sectional plot from C for various values of F<sub>1A</sub>. F. Cross-sectional plot from D for various values of F<sub>2A</sub>. G. Same as part A except with strong inhibition (K<sub>IA</sub> = K<sub>IB</sub> = 50 molecules). H. Same as part B except with strong inhibition. No inhibition and strong inhibition give rise to only on or off populations, whereas moderate inhibition can generate a third intermediate population.</p>

<p>The above analysis was repeated with moderate inhibition (K<sub>IA</sub> = K<sub>IB</sub> = 400 molecules). Similar to the no inhibition case, there appear to be critical values for F<sub>1A</sub> and F<sub>2A</sub> at which the system switches to the on-state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g002">Figures 2C and 2D</xref>). However, increasing F<sub>1B</sub> and F<sub>2B</sub> increases the switching values of F<sub>1A</sub> and F<sub>2A</sub>, due to the negative feedback from ATF<sub>B</sub> on ATF<sub>A</sub>. It is interesting to note that for high values of F<sub>1B</sub> and F<sub>2B</sub>, the system reaches a stable, intermediate state at which the concentration of ATF<sub>A</sub> is higher than that in the uncommitted state, but less than that in the committed state (by symmetry, the same effect is observed for ATF<sub>B</sub>; see Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000518.s002">Figure S1</xref>). As in the committed state, the set point in this intermediate state increases with F<sub>1</sub>, but not with F<sub>2</sub>. To better visualize the intermediate state, cross-sections of F<sub>1B</sub> and F<sub>2B</sub> from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g002">Figures 2C and 2D</xref> for various values of F<sub>1A</sub> and F<sub>2A</sub> are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g002">Figures 2E and 2F</xref>, respectively. For strong inhibition (K<sub>IA</sub> = K<sub>IB</sub> = 50 molecules), the system achieves commitment to lineage A for F<sub>1A</sub> and F<sub>2A</sub> values above the threshold levels. When F<sub>1B</sub> and F<sub>2B</sub> are increased over the critical value, the system requires concomitantly larger increases in F<sub>1A</sub> and F<sub>2A</sub> values to switch from the uncommitted state compared to the moderate inhibition condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g002">Figures 2G and 2H</xref>). Also, strong mutual inhibition between the transcription factors destroys the stable intermediate state, so the cells can rest only in the uncommitted or committed state. Since the model is symmetric with respect to lineages A and B, the steady-state responses of ATF<sub>B</sub> with respect to changes in F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> are analogous to the results shown for ATF<sub>A</sub> (see Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000518.s002">Figure S1</xref>). It should be noted that the system is capable of achieving multistability for a given F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Palani1">[35]</xref> and results not shown); however, only the stable solution attained without the memory of strong feedback is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g002">Figure 2</xref> (i.e., the simulations were always started from the off-state).</p>

<title>“Bilayer” memory in a tristable system</title>
<p>External regulation provides a practical way to control the dynamics of the network without the need to alter the internal control elements of the system.

As seen from the phase plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g003">Figure 3</xref>, increasing L<sub>A</sub> when L<sub>B</sub> is low commits the uncommitted cell to lineage A (red region in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), increasing L<sub>B</sub> for low L<sub>A</sub> commits the cell to lineage B (red region in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), and for high values of both L<sub>A</sub> and L<sub>B</sub> the system rests at a third, bipotent state that is primed but not committed to either of the lineages (overlapping yellow regions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g003">Figures 3A and 3B</xref>).

Phase plot showing the steady-state ATF<sub>B</sub> levels when L<sub>A</sub> and L<sub>B</sub> values are varied. Low L<sub>A</sub> and low L<sub>B</sub> do not commit the uncommitted cell to either lineage (overlapping blue region in panels A and B). Low L<sub>A</sub> and high L<sub>B</sub> values commit the cell to lineage B (blue region in panel A and red region in panel B). High L<sub>A</sub> and low L<sub>B</sub> values commit the cell to lineage A (red region in panel A and blue region in panel B). High L<sub>A</sub> and high L<sub>B</sub> commit the cell to the bipotent state (overlapping yellow region in panels A and B). Steady-state response plots: C. Increasing L<sub>A</sub> from 0, with L<sub>B</sub> constant at 300, abruptly switches the cell from the committed B state to the bipotent state (increase in ATF<sub>A</sub> to intermediate level) after reaching a threshold concentration (solid red line). After achieving the bipotent state, decreasing L<sub>A</sub> to sub-threshold values does not immediately switch the cell state, suggesting significant memory in the system (dotted red line). D. Increasing L<sub>A</sub> from 0, with L<sub>B</sub> constant at 300, decommits the cell to the bipotent state (decrease in ATF<sub>B</sub> to intermediate level) after reaching the threshold concentration (solid blue line). After achieving the bipotent state, decreasing L<sub>A</sub> to sub-threshold values does not immediately switch the cell state, again suggesting significant memory (dotted blue line). E. Increasing L<sub>A</sub> from 0, with L<sub>B</sub> constant at 100, abruptly switches the committed B cell to the bipotent state (increase in ATF<sub>A</sub> to intermediate level) and then again to the committed A state (increase in ATF<sub>A</sub> to high level) after reaching the corresponding threshold concentrations (solid red line). After achieving the bipotent state or the committed state, decreasing L<sub>A</sub> to sub-threshold values does not immediately switch the cell response, suggesting significant memory in both states (dotted and dot-dash red line). F. Increasing L<sub>A</sub> from 0, with L<sub>B</sub> constant at 100, decommits the cell to the bipotent state (decrease in ATF<sub>B</sub> to intermediate level) and then again to the committed lineage A state (decrease in ATF<sub>B</sub> to low level) after reaching the corresponding threshold concentrations (solid blue line). After achieving the bipotent state or the committed lineage A state, decreasing L<sub>A</sub> to sub-threshold values does not immediately switch the cell response, suggesting significant memory in both states (dotted and dot-dash blue line).

<p>To explore the robustness of the bipotent and committed states, we tested the system for memory to external stimulus. From the phase plots, we chose L<sub>B</sub> = 300 to analyze the robustness of the bipotent state. The steady-state response plots of ATF<sub>A</sub> and ATF<sub>B</sub> for L<sub>B</sub> = 300 are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g003">Figures 3C and 3D</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, increasing L<sub>A</sub> switches the system from the committed B state to the bipotent state (solid red line). After reaching the bipotent state, the ligand concentration can be decreased far below the initial switching concentration while still maintaining the system in the bipotent state (dotted red line). However, complete removal of L<sub>A</sub> switches the system back to the committed B state. For the ligand concentrations spanned by the dotted red line, the system is bistable. Considering the steady-state response of ATF<sub>B</sub> in the same simulation, we see that for low L<sub>A</sub> values, the system is already committed to lineage B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). However, increasing L<sub>A</sub> can decommit the cell to a bipotent state (solid blue line). Decreasing L<sub>A</sub> after reaching the bipotent state maintains the cell in that state for values of L<sub>A</sub> much lower than the decommitment concentration (dotted blue line). So, the system is also bistable for ATF<sub>B</sub> expression (inversely correlated to ATF<sub>A</sub> expression) and can exist either in the committed state for lineage B or in the bipotent state based on the memory of L<sub>A</sub>.</p>
<p>To analyze the switching of the system across three states, we chose L<sub>B</sub> = 100 based again upon the phase plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g003">Figures 3A and 3B</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g003">Figure 3E</xref>, a modest increase in L<sub>A</sub> switches the system to the bipotent state and a further increase in L<sub>A</sub>, switches the system to the committed A state (solid red line). If the ligand concentration is lowered after the system reaches either the bipotent state or the committed state, the system remains in the current state (dotted and dot-dash red lines). This hysteresis is greater for the committed state than for the bipotent state, suggesting that the committed state is more robust to changes in the ligand concentration. For L<sub>B</sub> = 100 and for 10&lt;L<sub>A</sub>&lt;75, the system exhibits tristability (i.e., it can exist in committed state A, committed state B, or the bipotent state). The steady-state response plot of ATF<sub>B</sub> for L<sub>B</sub> = 100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g003">Figure 3F</xref>) shows that a committed B cell decommits to the bipotent state and then further to lineage A with an increase in L<sub>A</sub> (solid blue line). As in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g003">Figure 3E</xref>, the bipotent and lineage A states are robust with respect to decreases in L<sub>A</sub> (dotted and dot-dash blue lines) and the system exhibits tristability for the same concentration range of L<sub>A</sub> as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g003">Figure 3E</xref>. It should also be noted that the ligand-dependent multistability seen for a lineage-specific transcription factor is the same for the corresponding lineage-specific receptor, thus simultaneously generating memory in cell-extrinsic and cell-intrinsic signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Palani1">[35]</xref>.</p>

<title>Extrinsic cues can regulate stochastic switching</title>
<p>We developed a stochastic version of the ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based deterministic model to analyze how noise in the network might affect the fate decision of an uncommitted cell (i.e., one that initially contains no ATF<sub>A</sub> or ATF<sub>B</sub>) and how external signals might regulate these stochastic transitions. The stochastic model was initialized with several L<sub>A</sub>|L<sub>B</sub> combinations (0|350; 100|250; 175|175; 250|100; 350|0) for the no inhibition, moderate inhibition, and strong inhibition conditions. In each of 10,000 simulations, the system was allowed to reach steady-state (see Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000518.s001">Text S1</xref>) and steady-state ATF<sub>A</sub> and ATF<sub>B</sub> levels for the first three ligand combinations listed above are shown as 3D histograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g004">Figure 4</xref> (since the model is symmetric, the 250|100 and 350|0 plots are virtual mirror images of the 100|250 and 0|350 plots, respectively, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Unlike the deterministic model, which only provided a population average of the four attainable steady states (uncommitted, bipotent, lineage A, lineage B) for any L<sub>A</sub>|L<sub>B</sub>, the stochastic simulations elucidated the relative populations of these multiple steady states for a given L<sub>A</sub>|L<sub>B</sub>. For the no inhibition condition, an uncommitted cell can reach any of four distinct stable states given the appropriate extracellular cues: uncommitted, A, B, and a committed AB state with high ATF<sub>A</sub> and ATF<sub>B</sub> values (though this last state is simply a consequence of having no inhibition and likely has little relevance in biological mechanisms specific to cell commitment decisions). When ATF<sub>A</sub> and ATF<sub>B</sub> can moderately inhibit each other, the uncommitted, A, B, and bipotent states can all be populated, even for a single L<sub>A</sub>|L<sub>B</sub> combination (e.g., middle plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g004">Figure 4</xref>). However, when the transcription factors exhibit strong cross-antagonism, this bipotent state is no longer realizable and cells only commit fully to one lineage or the other or stayed uncommitted. The stochastic simulations with various combinations of conflicting ligand concentrations and for different levels of competitive inhibition show that all of the populations obtained from the deterministic model are stable and distinct even with the introduction of noise. For conditions in which only one ligand was present (e.g., 0|350), the cells committed only to the induced lineage for all levels of inhibition. A small fraction of the initial population remained uncommitted for all conditions for the chosen steady-state time point. When external cues of equal strength were provided (175|175), cells in the absence of inhibition primarily reached the committed AB state; with strong inhibition, they attained nearly equal levels of the committed A and B states; and with moderate inhibition, the cells were roughly evenly distributed across the bipotent, A, and B states. When high but unequal ligand levels were used (e.g., 100|250), cells in the no inhibition model commit almost exclusively to the AB state since the effects of L<sub>A</sub> and L<sub>B</sub> are entirely uncoupled. However for the strong and moderate inhibition conditions, the initial population committed predominantly to the lineage corresponding to the higher ligand value. This shows that, while the noise in the system is capable of distributing the initial population to all available steady states for any ligand concentration above a minimum threshold, a dominant external signal can still strongly bias the system to its specific lineage.</p>

<title>External regulation of stochastic transitions.</title>
<p>Three different L<sub>A</sub>|L<sub>B</sub> combinations (0|350, 100|250, and 175|175) were run using the stochastic version of the model with no, moderate, or strong inhibition conditions and the system was allowed to reach steady state. ATF<sub>A</sub> and ATF<sub>B</sub> values from 10,000 runs for each condition are plotted here as three-dimensional histograms. With strong inhibition, the system cannot achieve the intermediate, bipotent state that is seen with moderate inhibition. When induced with only one ligand (e.g., 0|350), the initial population, for all inhibition conditions, commits predominantly to the lineage corresponding to that ligand. When the uncommitted state is stimulated with equal values of ligand (175|175), the no inhibition condition primarily results in a state that corresponds to high activation of both transcription factors (unlikely to be a biologically relevant state for cell-commitment decisions); the strong and the moderate inhibition conditions result in significant population of all of the available states except the uncommitted state. When one ligand value is higher (e.g., 100|250), in the presence of inhibition, the majority of the cells committed to the lineage corresponding to the higher ligand concentration. The number next to each individual population denotes the percentage of the total population when treated with the given combination of L<sub>A</sub> and L<sub>B</sub>.</p>

<title>Time trajectories during lineage commitment</title>
<p>From 100 individual stochastic trajectories, we calculated the average time for an uncommitted cell to reach lineage A, lineage B, or the bipotent state and, in separate simulations, the average time for a bipotent progenitor to reach lineage A or B. A phase plot of the total transcription factors (tTF = ITF+ATF) shows that it takes ∼36 hours for the uncommitted cell to reach lineage A, lineage B, or the bipotent state; however, when ligand concentrations that destabilize the bipotent progenitor are applied, it only takes ∼24 hours for the bipotent progenitor to reach either of the committed states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). This effect is even more pronounced when we look at the phase plots for ATF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g005">Figure 5B</xref>); the time to reach the high level of active transcription factor(s) from the uncommitted cell is still ∼36 hours, however it takes much less time (∼14 hours) for the bipotent progenitor to reach lineage A or B. The kinetics of reaching new steady-state levels for total receptor (tR = R+C) and complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g005">Figures 5D and 5E</xref>) are faster than those for tTF and ATF, respectively, but the trend of reaching commitment faster from the bipotent state compared to the uncommitted state is similar to the transcription factor plots. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g005">Figures 5C and 5F</xref> respectively show the mean C<sub>A</sub> and ATF<sub>A</sub> values with respect to time (in hours) for transitions from the uncommitted state to lineage A (blue line), uncommitted state to bipotent state (orange line), and bipotent state to lineage A (green line). The error bars represent the standard deviation of the trajectories from the mean values. The red lines show the decreases in C<sub>B</sub> and ATF<sub>B</sub> as the bipotent cell follows the trajectory to commit to lineage A. A primed bipotent cell reaches either committed state faster than an uncommitted cell does, primarily due to the fact that accumulation of new transcription factor molecules (protein synthesis) is a much slower process than deactivation of existing active transcription factor molecules. Furthermore, cytokine signaling has been shown to accelerate differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Rieger1">[20]</xref>, so the dynamics of activated receptors and transcription factors are likely to influence the kinetics of differentiation.</p>

<p>To qualitatively compare the receptor dynamics predicted by our model to those seen in experiments, we compared our simulations to lineage-specific receptor expression from microarray data (graciously provided from Bruno et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Bruno1">[37]</xref> by Tariq Enver, University of Oxford); the data were collected at multiple time points during differentiation of multipotent myeloid progenitors (FDCP-mix, which are CMP-like progenitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Bruno1">[37]</xref>) across three lineages (neutrophil, erythrocyte, and megakaryocyte). The relative mRNA expression levels of the lineage-specific receptors – erythropoietin receptor (EPOR), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (GCSFR), and thrombopoietin receptor (TPOR) – were extracted from the processed microarray data. Since the phenotypic heterogeneity was also quantified at each time point in these microarray experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Bruno1">[37]</xref>, we were able to perform a simple deconvolution to estimate the contribution of each distinct cell type to the overall signal (see Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000518.s006">Table S4</xref>). Therefore, the receptor expression trajectory for a given lineage in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g006">Figures 6D–F</xref> represents the average of only those multipotent, bipotent, and committed cells that lie along that specific lineage path (as is also the case for the average computational trajectories shown in bold lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g006">Figures 6B–C</xref>) and excludes those cells that belong to other commitment paths (for example, the TPOR trajectory includes blasts and megakaryocytes, but excludes erythroblasts, erythrocytes, and neutrophils which were also present in the <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures used for microarray analysis). The level of receptor was normalized to the basal levels in the CMP state. The error bars show the standard error of the mean from three independent experiments.</p>
<p>We constructed phase plots of EPOR and GCSFR showing the receptor trajectories (t = 0 to 7 days) as CMPs differentiate into either erythrocytes or neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Induction of CMPs with EPO or GCSF drives cell commitment to the erythrocytic (red line) or the neutrophilic (green line) lineage, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Bruno1">[37]</xref>. During neutrophil commitment, GCSFR expression is significantly upregulated, but EPOR expression stays at or below basal levels; conversely, during erythrocyte commitment, EPOR expression is increased and GCSFR expression is unchanged or slightly reduced. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g006">Figure 6E</xref> shows the experimental phase plot of TPOR and GCSFR expression when CMPs are induced to differentiate into megakaryocyte or neutrophil lineages by stimulating with TPO (blue line) and GCSF (green line), respectively. As in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g006">Figure 6D</xref>, receptor expression corresponding to the induced lineage is upregulated and the receptor expression corresponding to the other lineage is unchanged or even slightly downregulated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g006">Figure 6F</xref> shows the phase plot from the differentiation experiments to erythrocytic and megakaryocytic lineages. Induction of CMPs with Epo or Tpo drives CMPs to either the erythrocytic (red line) or the megakaryocytic (blue line) lineage. Interestingly, during erythrocyte and megakaryocyte commitment, EPOR and TPOR are co-upregulated; however, the observed increase was higher for the receptor corresponding to the specific lineage that was predominantly generated. Statistical analysis was performed to deduce positive receptor correlation for the receptor pairs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g006">Figures 6D, 6E, and 6F</xref> by comparing the overall slope of each trajectory (inverted to lie along the x-axis, if appropriate) at both the 3-day and 7-day time points to a value of zero (no correlation) by a one-sample, one-tailed t-test. The correlation in receptor expression for EPOR-GCSFR and TPOR-GCSFR was either negative or not statistically significant.

<p>Comparing experimental results to the model simulations, we note that the trajectories in the erythrocyte-neutrophil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g006">Figure 6D</xref>) and neutrophil-megakaryocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g006">Figure 6E</xref>) plots compare well with the strong inhibition model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) and the trajectories from the erythrocyte-megakaryocyte plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g006">Figure 6F</xref>) show agreement with the moderate inhibition model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). This inference is validated by the widely accepted observation that the transcription factors for the erythrocytic and megakaryocytic lineages are strongly cross-antagonistic to the transcription factor for the neutrophil lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Cantor1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Liew1">[13]</xref>. Other than evolutionary constraints, the model suggests that the strength of the transcriptional cross-antagonism can dictate whether two distinct lineage-specific receptors (and the corresponding lineage-specific transcription factors) can be co-upregulated, which in turn can influence the nature of the instructive, possibly conflicting, cues that the cell receives. This paradigm may highlight different modes of receptor regulation, and corresponding transcriptional activity, in various stages and branches of hematopoiesis (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Mathematical models of lineage commitment during hematopoiesis have generally analyzed cell-fate decisions from an intrinsic standpoint. Here, we show how extrinsic regulation can play a role in instructing lineage choice and, furthermore, how a cell might process and respond to conflicting extracellular cues. It has been extensively debated whether cytokines play an instructive or permissive role during lineage commitment. In this work, we show that cell-fate decisions can be stochastic but that external cues can strongly bias this stochasticity and instruct cells to specific lineages. A recent publication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Rieger1">[20]</xref> definitively demonstrated an instructive role for cytokines in hematopoiesis. This strongly underscores our need to understand how extracellular cues, either in isolation or in combination, influence hematopoiesis. Our model also suggests a possible alternative mode of commitment, whereby an uncommitted multipotent progenitor may commit directly to a mature lineage without transitioning through a bipotent state. This potential plasticity has been seen experimentally in HSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Adolfsson1">[4]</xref> and multipotent progenitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Kondo1">[2]</xref>.</p>
<p>The initial cell state that is modeled here is a common multipotent progenitor that expresses multiple lineage-specific receptors and transcription factors at low levels and is capable of differentiating along several lineages. In particular, two lineages that may exhibit different levels of transcriptional cross-antagonism are analyzed. The lineage commitment decision is modeled to be driven by the accumulation of the functionally active form of the lineage-specific transcription factor. This event is driven through two positive feedback loops, a synthesis loop that produces the transcription factor and a regulatory loop that aids in the activation of the transcription factor. This two-step positive feedback mechanism provides a means to externally regulate the classical autofeedback loop and can be of general significance in cell-fate decision models. In our lineage commitment model, the regulatory loop targets the cell-surface receptor, but analogous topologies may be seen in systems where the regulation is achieved extracellularly (upregulating the ligand) or intracellularly (upregulating a rate-limiting enzyme in the signaling pathway). Also, it should be noted that even though we have considered the external stimuli to be cytokines, they may also be cell-cell interactions, cell-matrix interactions, mechanical cues, or other diffusible factors.</p>
<p>Through steady-state response plots, we have shown that the system exhibits ultrasensitivity to ligand and can achieve multistability in active transcription factor levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Here, ultrasensitivity to ligand confers switch-like behavior in cell-fate specification. Multistability provides memory to both the intermediate (bipotent) and committed cell states, enabling the system to robustly sustain its current state even when external stimuli are reduced to sub-threshold levels. Although the system modeled here represents a reversible switch, irreversibility during differentiation can be achieved by epigenetic means such as chromatin remodeling.</p>
<p>In support of the stochastic theory of commitment, our model suggests that, irrespective of the strength of external factors, intrinsic noise in transcriptional networks can switch a significant percentage of cells to a committed state or the bipotent state; however, in support of the instructive theory, extrinsic cues can still strongly bias the majority of the uncommitted cell population to the final state induced by the higher ligand signal, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g004">Figure 4</xref>. This figure also highlights how the same network topology can generate both binary and ternary cell-fate decisions. For example, strong inhibition enables only a binary cell-fate choice; however, simply relaxing the strength of the inhibition to moderate levels enables three possible fates from the uncommitted state.</p>
<p>Our model suggests a new paradigm that integrates classical and alternative modes of lineage commitment and also accommodates both stochastic and instructive roles in hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g007">Figure 7</xref>). It is generally appreciated that upstream commitment events are more stochastic in nature while downstream events are more instructive. Stochastic events in HSCs and multipotent progenitors can potentially lead to the generation of all mature cell types, explaining ‘normal’ hematopoiesis even when a lineage-specific receptor is knocked out <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Murphy1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Enver1">[18]</xref> (although other non-canonical extrinsic cues may also play compensatory roles). In parallel, instructive cytokine signaling in multipotent progenitors and bipotent progenitors, which can strongly bias and accelerate lineage commitment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Rieger1">[20]</xref>, may drive stress responses and restore homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Metcalf1">[15]</xref>. Furthermore, emerging alternative commitment paths suggest that decision-making in hematopoietic progenitors need not be purely binary. HSCs have been shown to bypass multipotent progenitors and directly produce bipotent MEPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Adolfsson1">[4]</xref> and common lymphoid progenitors appear to directly generate T cells, B cells, and NK cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Kondo1">[2]</xref>. The model presented in this work suggests a framework in which both binary and ternary decisions may be possible in multipotent CMPs. Such bypass mechanisms in commitment may also provide important redundancies that ensure mature cell production if a specific intermediate state becomes dysregulated.</p>

<p>Many of the predictions from our minimal, multipotent commitment model can be experimentally verified. Multipotent and bipotent progenitors can be identified and isolated with multi-color fluorescence-activated cell sorting, using specific cell-surface markers for the lineages of interest. Cytokine-induced time course experiments conducted on these bipotent cells can corroborate whether they reach mature states faster than the corresponding multipotent progenitors. Experiments with conflicting extracellular ligand cues can be useful in determining the strength of the instructive cues, the degree of transcriptional cross-antagonism between lineages, and the existence of a bipotent progenitor. For example, to analyze the differentiation paths of erythrocytes and neutrophils from a common progenitor, FDCP-mix cells can be induced with both Epo and GCSF and the trajectories of the expression of the lineage-specific transcription factors (GATA1, PU.1) and receptors (EPOR, GCSFR) can be determined by sensitive flow cytometry measurements. Groundbreaking new bioimaging techniques which enable observation of single cells over an extended period <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000518-Rieger1">[20]</xref> should mitigate technical difficulties that have hampered such analyses and should help to further elucidate the roles of extrinsic and intrinsic regulation on cell commitment decisions.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The minimal model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g001">Figure 1</xref> represents a regulatory network for lineage commitment of a multipotent progenitor to lineages A and B. The multipotent progenitor expresses basal levels of both lineage-specific transcription factors TF<sub>A</sub> and TF<sub>B</sub> (present in their inactive forms ITF<sub>A</sub> and ITF<sub>B</sub>) and lineage-specific receptors R<sub>A</sub> and R<sub>B</sub> before the addition of ligand. Addition of L<sub>A</sub> to the system leads to receptor-ligand complex C<sub>A</sub> formation. Complex C<sub>A</sub> activates signaling pathways that lead to the activation of ITF<sub>A</sub> to form ATF<sub>A</sub>. Even though a mechanistic understanding of how this occurs via cytokine-mediated signaling has not fully emerged, we have modeled it to be rapidly regulated at the protein level (e.g., by post-translational modification). There may be other mechanisms involved (e.g., transcriptional and translational regulation) that are not considered here. The activated form of the transcription factor, ATF<sub>A</sub>, upregulates the transcription of its own gene through a positive autoregulatory feedback loop, enhancing production of ITF<sub>A</sub>. ATF<sub>A</sub> also upregulates the expression of the lineage-specific receptor R<sub>A</sub> forming a ligand-regulated positive feedback loop. The model also accounts for basal synthesis of R<sub>A</sub> and ITF<sub>A</sub>, degradation of R<sub>A</sub>, C<sub>A</sub>, ITF<sub>A</sub> and ATF<sub>A</sub> and inactivation of ATF<sub>A</sub> (not explicitly shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000518-g001">Figure 1</xref>). For simplicity, we consider the network topology in the commitment of the two lineages to be symmetric: the reactions involved in the activation of ITF<sub>B</sub> to ATF<sub>B</sub> by ligand L<sub>B</sub> and the formation of the two positive feedback loops are analogous to those described in lineage A. To account for the cross-antagonism between the transcription factors TF<sub>A</sub> and TF<sub>B</sub>, ATF<sub>A</sub> and ATF<sub>B</sub> are modeled to downregulate the induced expression of [ITF<sub>B</sub>, R<sub>B</sub>] and [ITF<sub>A</sub>, R<sub>A</sub>] by competitively inhibiting the binding of ATF<sub>B</sub> and ATF<sub>A</sub> to the regulatory domains present upstream of their lineage-specific receptor and TF genes. This multilineage commitment network led to a deterministic model with eight ordinary differential equations (ODEs), shown in Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000518.s003">Table S1</xref>. The initial conditions and the values of the rate constants are provided in Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000518.s004">Table S2</xref>. A single-compartmental homogenous system is assumed and the pathways involved in TF activation and in the synthesis of TF and receptor are lumped as single-step reactions.</p>
