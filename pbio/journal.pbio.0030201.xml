				<article-title>Drosophila Larval Development and Human Immunodeficiency: The Adenosine Deaminase Connection</article-title>

        <p>Adenosine deaminase (ADA) is an enzyme present in all organisms that catalyzes the irreversible deamination of adenosine and deoxyadenosine to inosine and deoxyinosine. Both adenosine and deoxyadenosine are biologically active purines that can have a deep impact on cellular physiology; notably, ADA deficiency in humans causes severe combined immunodeficiency. We have established a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model to study the effects of altered adenosine levels in vivo by genetic elimination of adenosine deaminase-related growth factor-A (ADGF-A), which has ADA activity and is expressed in the gut and hematopoietic organ. Here we show that the hemocytes (blood cells) are the main regulator of adenosine in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva, as was speculated previously for mammals. The elevated level of adenosine in the hemolymph due to lack of ADGF-A leads to apparently inconsistent phenotypic effects: precocious metamorphic changes including differentiation of macrophage-like cells and fat body disintegration on one hand, and delay of development with block of pupariation on the other. The block of pupariation appears to involve signaling through the adenosine receptor (AdoR), but fat body disintegration, which is promoted by action of the hemocytes, seems to be independent of the AdoR. The existence of such an independent mechanism has also been suggested in mammals.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Adenosine deaminase (ADA) is an enzyme present in all organisms that catalyzes the irreversible deamination of adenosine and deoxyadenosine to inosine and deoxyinosine. It is a critically important enzyme for human survival because its congenital absence causes severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID). ADA deficiency accounts for about 20% of all types of SCID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b01">1</xref>]. It is one of the most severe human immunodeficiencies and is associated with depletion of all three major categories of lymphocytes: T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells, resulting in impaired cellular immunity and decreased production of immunoglobulins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b02">2</xref>]. Without intervention, the affected individuals die from opportunistic infections within the first few months of life.</p>
      <p>ADA occurs as a soluble monomer in all human cells, but also exists as “ecto-ADA,” bound to the membrane glycoprotein CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV, and it has been suggested that this form of ADA regulates extracellular adenosine levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b03">3</xref>]. ADA deficiency is accompanied by greatly elevated levels of the ADA substrates adenosine and deoxyadenosine, both of which are biologically active purines that can have a deep impact on cellular physiology. Adenosine is not just a metabolite; it is also a signaling molecule that regulates numerous cellular functions by binding to G protein-coupled adenosine receptors (A1, A2a, A2b, and A3 in mammals) that can regulate intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b04">4</xref>]. Deoxyadenosine is a cytotoxic metabolite released by various cell populations that undergo programmed cell death; it can kill cells through a mechanism that includes disturbances in deoxynucleotide metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b05">5</xref>].</p>
      <p>Extracellular adenosine is now considered an important stress hormone that is released in excessive amounts in the vicinity of immune cells during both systemic and cellular stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b06">6</xref>]. The predominant source of extracellular adenosine during systemic activation of the stress system is the sympathetic nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b07">7</xref>]. Specific inflammatory stimuli such as bacterial products are also capable of triggering adenosine release from immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b08">8</xref>]. These data are in line with evidence demonstrating a dramatic increase in extracellular adenosine levels under conditions associated with multiple organ failure, which is the cause of 50%–80% of all deaths in surgical intensive care units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b06">6</xref>].</p>
      <p>ADA is not the only adenosine deaminase in mammalian cells. Recently, the <italic>cat eye syndrome critical region protein 1 (CECR1)</italic> gene was identified and shown to encode a protein representing a subfamily of proteins related to but distinct from classical ADAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b09">9</xref>]. The duplication of a small region of chromosome 22 containing this gene is associated with “cat eye syndrome,” a disorder characterized by hypoplastic kidneys, congenital heart malformation, and anomalous pulmonary venous connections. The founding member of this subfamily is encoded by <italic>insect-derived growth factor</italic><italic>(IDGF)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b10">10</xref>], and homologs have been described in various organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b14">14</xref>].</p>
      <p>We have previously found six <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes with sequence similarity to the <italic>CECR1</italic> subfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b15">15</xref>]. Their products are mitogenic on <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, and at least two of them (ADGF-A and ADGF-D) exhibit strong ADA activity, which is necessary for their mitogenic function. We therefore named them adenosine deaminase-related growth factors (ADGFs). We also demonstrated that adenosine functions as a negative signal for cell proliferation and concluded that ADGFs stimulate cell growth in vitro by depletion of extracellular adenosine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b16">16</xref>]. <italic>Drosophila</italic> also contains a gene, termed <italic>Ada,</italic> with sequence similarity to human <italic>ADA,</italic> but as we have previously shown the product of this gene is most likely not an active ADA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b16">16</xref>].</p>
      <p>In this report we show that a null mutation in <italic>Drosophila ADGF-A</italic> gene leads to dramatically increased levels of adenosine and deoxyadenosine in the larval hemolymph. This increase leads to larval death associated with the disintegration of fat body and the development of melanotic tumors. We present a detailed analysis of the hematopoietic defects associated with the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutation, show a genetic interaction of this mutation with signaling through the <italic>Drosophila</italic> adenosine receptor (AdoR, encoded by the gene <italic>CG9753</italic>) and with regulation of premetamorphic changes by ecdysone, as well as a genetic interaction of ADGF-A with a major innate immunity regulator—the Toll signaling pathway.</p>

        <title>Mutation in the <italic>ADGF-A</italic> Gene Causes Larval Death and Melanotic Tumors</title>
        <p>We produced mutations in five of the six <italic>ADGF</italic> genes by homologous recombination mutagenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b17">17</xref>] and showed that loss of the most abundantly expressed gene, <italic>ADGF-A,</italic> leads to death in the larval or pupal stage. Under optimal conditions (20–30 isolated homozygous larvae per vial), about 60% of larvae homozygous for the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutation reach the third instar. Development during the third larval instar is significantly delayed, and wandering homozygous larvae usually appear 2 d after their heterozygous siblings, which start wandering at about 5 d of development. Some homozygous third-instar larvae can be found alive in the vial even after 10 d of development. Mutant third-instar larvae show fat body disintegration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g001">1</xref>B) and multiple melanotic tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), predominantly in the caudal part of the body and accompanied by disintegration of the fat body. Melanization of the lymph glands was never observed in these larvae, and the imaginal discs and brain appear normal. Less than 30% of homozygotes eventually pupate. Homozygous pupae usually die soon after pupariation; in some cases they develop normal head and thorax imaginal structures; however, abdominal parts usually do not develop. There is also an abnormal curvature (to the right) of the pupal abdomen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). Less than 2% of mutant pupae develop normally and eventually emerge as adults without any obvious abnormalities besides the abdominal curvature; some of them are sterile.</p>

        <p>To confirm that the mutant phenotype is caused solely by a mutation in the <italic>ADGF-A</italic> gene, we created transgenic flies carrying the <italic>ADGF-A</italic> gene under a heat-shock promoter <italic>(HS-ADGF-A)</italic>. The <italic>adgf-a</italic> homozygous flies carrying the <italic>HS-ADGF-A</italic> construct showed survival rates significantly higher than <italic>adgf-a</italic> even without heat shock, probably due to leaky expression of the <italic>HS-ADGF-A</italic> construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). However, while non-heat shocked animals still produced many melanotic tumors, only 22% of animals that were heat shocked as late embryos/early first instar developed these tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). This result confirms that the mutant phenotype is caused by the mutation in the <italic>ADGF-A</italic> gene. This conclusion is further supported by the even more efficient rescue achieved by expression of transgenically provided ADGF-A in the lymph glands using the Gal4/UAS system (see below).</p>

        <title>The <italic>adgf-a</italic> Mutant Phenotype Is Associated with Elevated Levels of Adenosine and/or Deoxyadenosine</title>
        <p>Using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry of deproteinated hemolymph samples, we measured adenosine concentrations in hemolymph of mutant and wild-type third-instar larvae. The adenosine concentration in the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutant was 1.14 ± 0.26 μM compared to less than 0.08 μM in the wild type, and the deoxyadenosine concentration in mutants was 1.66 ± 0.99 μM compared to an undetectable level in the wild type.</p>

        <title>The Catalytic Activity of ADGF-A Is Required for Its Function</title>
        <p>To test whether the function of ADGF-A in vivo is also dependent on its catalytic activity, we produced two versions of the <italic>UAS-ADGF-A</italic> construct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b18">18</xref>]: one carrying wild-type cDNA of ADGF-A and one carrying an ADGF-A cDNA with a mutation causing a substitution of two amino acids (H386G and A387E) in the catalytic domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b16">16</xref>]. Two different lines carrying the wild-type <italic>UAS-ADGF-A</italic> expression construct together with an <italic>Actin-Gal4</italic> driver (providing ubiquitous expression) both completely rescued the mutant phenotype, whereas larvae with <italic>UAS-ADGF-A</italic> but without the driver showed the typical mutant phenotype. However, neither of the two lines carrying the mutated version of the <italic>UAS-ADGF-A</italic> (producing full-length protein detected by anti-myc antibody; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) showed any rescue of the mutant phenotype. This result therefore demonstrates that the catalytic activity of ADGF-A is required for its function in vivo.</p>

        <title>Hemocyte Development Is Affected in the <italic>adgf-a</italic> Mutant</title>
        <p>We investigated the number and morphology of hemocytes (blood cells) in the hemolymph of the <italic>adgf-a</italic> late third-instar larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g004">4</xref>). These larvae contain an average of seven-fold more hemocytes in circulation than wild-type larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g003">Figure 3</xref>). In contrast to normal larval plasmatocytes, which remain rounded after settling down on the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), most of the cells in the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutant (more than 75%) are strongly adhesive and, after they are deposited in a drop of hemolymph on a microscope slide, develop filamentous and membranous extensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g004">Figure 4</xref>B–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g004">4</xref>D). An average of 7% of hemocytes in the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutant are lamellocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g004">4</xref>E), large flat cells that are not present in circulation of wild-type larvae under normal conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b19">19</xref>]. Crystal cells were also detected in excess, with mutant larvae carrying several hundred while there are fewer than a hundred of these cells in the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The lymph glands normally do not release hemocytes into the hemolymph before metamorphosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b20">20</xref>]; instead, they are released during metamorphosis when the lymph glands disperse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b19">19</xref>]. However, the lymph glands of <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutant larvae are already dispersed in the late third instar. This process is similar to normal metamorphic changes, in which the hemocytes are first released from the front lobes, and the posterior lobes disperse later.</p>

        <title>The <italic>adgf-a</italic> Mutant Phenotype Is Rescued by Expression of ADGF-A in the Lymph Glands</title>
        <p>To distinguish which tissues require ADGF-A expression for proper development, we tested for rescue of <italic>adgf-a</italic> lethality by expressing ADGF-A in specific subsets of larval tissues. A transgenic line carrying the <italic>UAS-ADGF-A</italic> construct on Chromosome II was crossed to lines expressing the Gal4 driver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b18">18</xref>] in different tissues (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030201-t001">Table 1</xref>). Since ADGF-A is normally expressed in the larval lymph glands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b16">16</xref>], and the mutant phenotype is characterized by abnormal hemocyte development, special consideration was given to lines expressing the Gal4 driver in the lymph glands and/or circulating hemocytes. No line expressing the Gal4 driver exclusively in the lymph glands has been reported, so we used a combination of lines sharing in common the feature of Gal4 driver expression in the lymph glands. The results (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030201-t001">Table 1</xref>) clearly demonstrate that expression of ADGF-A in the lymph glands (driven by <italic>Cg-Gal4,</italic><italic>e33C-Gal4,</italic> or <italic>c564-Gal4</italic>), but not in any other tissue examined, is necessary and sufficient to fully rescue the <italic>adgf-a</italic> lethality. In <italic>e33C-Gal4/UAS-ADGF-A,</italic> strong expression of ADGF-A in all lobes of developing lymph glands (but not in circulating hemocytes) reduces the number of hemocytes in the hemolymph to almost normal levels (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The number of hemocytes is also reduced, but to a lesser extent in larvae rescued by <italic>Cg-Gal4/UAS-ADGF-A</italic>. However, when assayed by survival rate and melanotic tumor formation, the rescue by <italic>Cg-Gal4</italic> is full and similar to that of <italic>e33C-Gal4</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The difference in effectiveness may be explained by the different expression patterns of the drivers. <italic>Cg-Gal4</italic> is expressed only in certain compartments of lymph gland lobes containing relatively mature hemocytes, and strongly in most circulating hemocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b23">23</xref>]. The <italic>C564-Gal4</italic> driver is not expressed as strongly as <italic>e33C-Gal4,</italic> but is still uniformly expressed in the lymph glands; it also fully rescued the mutant phenotype. We have tried two different insertions of the <italic>Dot-Gal4</italic> construct. The <italic>Dot-Gal4<sup>11C</sup></italic> on Chromosome II, which shows weak expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b24">24</xref>], did not rescue the phenotype, but a <italic>Dot-Gal4<sup>43A</sup></italic> insertion on Chromosome X, which shows stronger expression, rescued approximately half of the mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Nearly all rescued individuals were males, suggesting that expression of the Gal4 driver was influenced by X-chromosome dosage compensation, and expression in females heterozygous for <italic>Dot-Gal4</italic> was not strong enough for rescue.</p>

        <p>Expression of ADGF-A in salivary glands and fat body (as well as in other tissues) is not required for full rescue, as demonstrated by use of the <italic>Cg-Gal4,</italic><italic>Dot-Gal4,</italic> but especially by <italic>e33C-Gal4</italic> driver, and is also not sufficient to rescue the phenotype at all, as demonstrated by <italic>T110-Gal4</italic> and <italic>Lsp2-Gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030201-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Since ADGF-A is strongly expressed in embryonic mesoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b16">16</xref>], we have tried to rescue the phenotype by the expression of ADGF-A in embryonic and larval muscle cells using the <italic>Dmef2-Gal4</italic> driver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b25">25</xref>]. No rescue of the phenotype, including body shape of escaping pupae, was observed.</p>

However, expression of ADGF-A driven by <italic>GawB<sup>5015</sup></italic> does not prevent the formation of melanotic tumors (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g002">Figure 2</xref>B).</p>

We therefore used the <italic>l(3)hem<sup>1</sup></italic> mutation to test whether the reduction of hemocyte number in the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutant affects the phenotype. We recombined this mutation onto the chromosome containing the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutation and found that in homozygous <italic>l(3)hem<sup>1</sup>,</italic><italic>adgf-a</italic> double mutants the number of hemocytes is significantly reduced compared to the <italic>adgf-a</italic> single mutants (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, while 90% of <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutant larvae showed disintegration of fat body, only 40% of <italic>l(3)hem<sup>1</sup>,</italic><italic>adgf-a</italic> double mutants (total number of counted animals was 82) show the disintegration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g006">Figure 6</xref>A).

However, the delay in development and block of pupariation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g006">Figure 6</xref>B), as well as the pupal body shape, were not influenced by this mutation.

        <title>Block in Activation of Macrophages Suppresses Disintegration of Fat Body</title>
        <p>Previous results suggest that fat body disintegration might be caused by the action of hemocytes. Embryonic macrophages express the scavenger receptor encoded by <italic>croquemort</italic><italic>(crq),</italic> which allows them to bind and remove apoptotic corpses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b27">27</xref>]. We therefore tested whether a mutation in the <italic>crq</italic> gene would block the suggested interaction between hemocytes and fat body in <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutant larvae. We used the mutation <italic>crq<sup>KG01679</sup>,</italic> caused by a P-element insertion in the first untranslated exon of <italic>crq,</italic> which leads to pupal lethality. The number of crystal cells was not increased and lamellocytes were not detected in <italic>crq, adgf-a</italic> double mutants (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The double mutants showed a lower number of circulating hemocytes than the single mutant, but there was still a significant increase in this number compared to wild type (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g003">Figure 3</xref>), and the cells showed increased clumping. None of the double-mutant larvae showed either disintegration of fat body or melanotic tumor formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). Even the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutant larvae heterozygous for the <italic>crq</italic> mutation <italic>(crq/CyO GFP; adgf-a/adgf-a)</italic> showed significant suppression of the fat body disintegration, with most of the tissue staying compact in bigger pieces and never disintegrating to single adipose cells; melanotic tumors were rarely observed. This shows that the block of the putative interaction between fat body and macrophage-like cells (which are still present in double mutants) suppresses the fat body disintegration, further strengthening the hypothesis that the disintegration is caused by hemocytes. In addition, the absence of lamellocytes and the normal number of crystal cells in the double mutant strongly suggest that the differentiation of these cells and thus melanotic tumor formation is a secondary reaction to fat body disintegration, rather than a primary effect of the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutation.</p>

        <title>Hormonal Regulation in the <italic>adgf-a</italic> Mutant</title>
        <p>The delayed development and low pupariation rate in the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutant larvae (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g002">Figures 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g007">7</xref>A) could be caused by an effect on hormonal regulation of development. The main source of developmental hormones in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva is the ring gland, composed of the prothoracic gland, corpus allatum, and corpus cardiacum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b28">28</xref>]. The prothoracic gland releases the steroid molting hormone ecdysone, which is converted to an active form, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), by the fat body as well as some of the target organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b29">29</xref>]. The block of pupariation in the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutant suggested that the level of ecdysone in these larvae might not be sufficient to initiate pupariation. To test this possibility, we tried to rescue the phenotype by feeding mutant larvae 20E, which can initiate pupariation in the <italic>ecd<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant, which has an extremely low level of ecdysone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b31">31</xref>]. The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g007">Figure 7</xref>A) clearly demonstrate that the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutant larvae are responsive to ecdysone and that this treatment restores the pupariation frequency to almost wild-type level. The delay in development is also significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g007">Figure 7</xref>A).</p>
        <p>Since the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutant shows certain precocious metamorphic changes (macrophage differentiation and fat body disintegration), we speculated that a reduced ecdysteroid level could be caused by precocious degeneration of the prothoracic part of the ring gland. However, the overall structure of the ring gland is not visibly affected even in the oldest larvae (10 d, i.e., 5 d after the heterozygous siblings pupariated) with a fully disintegrated fat body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g007">Figure 7</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g007">7</xref>C).</p>
        <p>We also used a transgenic line carrying the <italic>SgsΔ3-GFP</italic> construct, which was previously used to monitor the effects of ecdysteroid levels on glue protein expression in salivary glands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b32">32</xref>]. All analyzed <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutant larvae carrying the <italic>SgsΔ3-GFP</italic> construct showed normal expression of Sgs-GFP in salivary glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g007">Figure 7</xref>D). Mutants that pupariated usually showed typical GFP expectoration, indicating the presence of a high premetamorphic peak of ecdysteroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g007">Figure 7</xref>E). In some cases, GFP was secreted into the lumen of salivary glands, but was not expectorated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g007">Figure 7</xref>F), which is similar to the defect seen in animals expressing the dominant-negative form of ecdysone receptor driven by the <italic>Sgs3-Gal4</italic> driver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b33">33</xref>]. These results demonstrate that the target tissues of <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutants are normally responsive to ecdysteroids and that they are probably capable of releasing ecdysteroids, although the level of ecdysteroids might vary.?&gt;</p>

        <title>ADGF-A Genetically Interacts with Toll Signaling Pathway</title>
        <p>The antimicrobial response of <italic>Drosophila</italic> includes at least two distinct signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b34">34</xref>]—the Toll signaling pathway, which leads to the activation of two nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) factors, <italic>Dorsal</italic>-related immunity factor (DIF) and dorsal (DL); and the immune deficiency protein pathway activating the third NF-κB factor, Relish (REL). A zygotic null mutation in <italic>cactus</italic> (<italic>cact;</italic> a <italic>Drosophila</italic> inhibitor of NF-κB) leads to hyperproliferation of hemocytes, melanotic tumor formation, disintegration of fat body, and slower larval development, with 60% larval lethality, as well as a thin body-shape phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b35">35</xref>]. All of these phenotypes are strikingly similar to the abnormalities seen in <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutants, which was our first clue as to a possible interaction of ADGF-A with the Toll signaling pathway. We hypothesized that the activity of ADGF-A is suppressed by Toll signaling, resulting in similar phenotypes of the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutation and constitutive activation of Toll pathway.</p>
        <p>To test this hypothesis, we crossed transgenic flies carrying <italic>ADGF-A</italic> gene under the control of a heat-shock promoter on Chromosome II <italic>(HS-ADGF-A)</italic> with <italic>cact<sup>E8</sup></italic> (a lethal allele of <italic>cact</italic> on Chromosome II, which, in combination with <italic>cact<sup>D13</sup>,</italic> results in a zygotic null combination, or, with <italic>cact<sup>IIIG</sup>,</italic> results in zygotic hypomorphic combination).</p>
        <p>Overexpression of ADGF-A in animals with a hypomorphic <italic>cact</italic> combination <italic>(cact<sup>E8</sup></italic>/<italic>cact<sup>IIIG</sup>)</italic> increased the adult survival rate almost 4-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g008">Figure 8</xref>A). The rescue could be increased by multiple heat shocks before pupariation to 7-fold (unpublished data). The suppression of melanotic tumor formation is also significant (from more than 80% down to 26%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g008">Figure 8</xref>B). The most severe <italic>cact</italic> null mutation <italic>(cact<sup>E8</sup></italic>/<italic>cact<sup>D13</sup>),</italic> leading to developmental arrest in larvae (less than 8% pupate), is partially rescued in animals with overexpression of ADGF-A when the pupariation rate is increased 3-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g008">Figure 8</xref>A).</p>

        <title>ADA Deficiency in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Causes Abnormal Hemocyte Development, Melanotic Tumor Formation, Fat Body Degeneration, and Delayed Development</title>
        <p>We have established an ADA deficiency model in <italic>Drosophila</italic> in order to study the effects of altered adenosine levels in vivo. We produced a loss-of-function mutation in the <italic>ADGF-A</italic> gene, which produces a product (ADGF-A) with ADA activity. When homozygous, the mutation causes abnormal hemocyte development, leading to melanotic tumor formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b36">36</xref>], as well as fat-body disintegration associated with death during the larval stage or delayed transition to the pupal stage of development. In agreement with our previous study using cells cultured in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b16">16</xref>], here we have shown that ADA enzymatic activity is essential for ADGF-A function in vivo, when this function is assayed by testing for rescue of the mutant phenotype. Just as increased levels of both ADA substrates, adenosine and deoxyadenosine, are found in blood of SCID patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b05">5</xref>], <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutant larvae also have elevated levels of adenosine and deoxyadenosine, indicating that the mutant phenotype is caused by disturbance in the turnover of these nucleosides.</p>
        <p>Expression of ADGF-A only in the lymph glands is sufficient to fully rescue the mutant phenotype, indicating that the hemocytes within the lymph glands play a major role in regulation of adenosine levels in the hemolymph. A similar regulatory role has also been attributed to blood cells in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b05">5</xref>]. This suggests a function for ADGF-A within the lymph gland. However, ADGF-A behaves as a soluble growth factor and could be released from the lymph gland to activate targets elsewhere in the larval body. Our results show that ADGF-A functions by limiting the level of extracellular adenosine, and in this way the protein could have a systemic function even if it were restricted to its tissue of origin. Although our tests did not exclude a role for ADGF-A in circulating hemocytes (which constitute a separate lineage from the lymph gland hemocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b20">20</xref>]), we showed that expression of ADGF-A in circulating hemocytes is not required for rescue of the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutant phenotype, since <italic>e33C-Gal4/UAS-ADGF-A</italic>—which expresses ADGF-A in the lymph gland but not in circulating hemocytes—fully rescued the phenotype.</p>

        <title>ADGF-A Is Involved in Hemocyte Differentiation in the Lymph Glands</title>
        <p>Late third-instar larvae homozygous for the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutation contain, on average, seven times more hemocytes in circulation than wild-type larvae, and most of these cells show strong adhesive properties compared to normal larval plasmatocytes, which remain rounded after settling down on the substrate. Although these cells share other characteristics with plasmatocytes, they are normally not seen in circulation until they are released from the lymph glands at the onset of metamorphosis under the regulation of ecdysone to serve as phagocytes for histolysing tissues during metamorphosis—thus, they are referred to as pupal macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b19">19</xref>]. In agreement with the presence of these cells in circulation, at least the first lobes of the lymph glands are usually completely dispersed in late third-instar mutant larvae. This indication of precocious metamorphic changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b36">36</xref>] in the mutant is further supported by the finding that hemocytes aggregate in a segmental pattern in early rather than late third instar (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g004">Figure 4</xref>H–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g004">4</xref>J), and that the hemocytes lose expression of Hemolectin in late third-instar larvae rather than at the onset of metamorphosis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g004">Figure 4</xref>G) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b21">21</xref>].</p>
        <p>Recent studies show that the Toll signaling pathway, which is already known to be involved in the control of innate immunity of both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b34">34</xref>], may also be involved in the control of hemocyte differentiation in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva. Constitutive activation of Toll signaling leads to developmental arrest and hematopoietic defects associated with melanotic tumor formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b35">35</xref>], similar to the phenotype of the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutant. Our work also shows that forced expression of the <italic>ADGF-A</italic> gene can rescue the effects of overactive Toll signaling, suggesting that ADGF-A might function downstream of Toll signaling to control its effects. This conclusion is consistent with the existence of a putative binding site for Dorsal (one of two known effectors of Toll signaling) in the <italic>ADGF-A</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g009">Figure 9</xref>). It will be important to explore this connection further, since recent studies suggest an interaction between adenosine signaling and the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is the mammalian counterpart of the Toll pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b37">37</xref>].</p>

        <title>Precocious Fat-Body Disintegration Caused by Mutant Hemocytes</title>
        <p>One of the most remarkable features of the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutant phenotype is the disintegration of the fat body in third-instar larvae, another indication of precocious metamorphic changes since the disintegration normally occurs much later, during pupal life. Furthermore, our study of this mutant provides strong evidence that the fat body disintegration is promoted by the action of hemocytes. Fat body disintegration was significantly suppressed when the hemocyte number was reduced using the <italic>l(3)hem<sup>1</sup></italic> mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b26">26</xref>], and fully blocked by the <italic>croquemort</italic> (<italic>crq</italic>) mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b27">27</xref>] which affects a CD36-related receptor (Croquemort) expressed on macrophages and required in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. Human CD36 is a scavenger receptor which, in combination with the macrophage vitronectin receptor and thrombospondin, binds apoptotic cells. A similar role of Croquemort for removing histolysing tissues during <italic>Drosophila</italic> metamorphosis has not yet been tested, but seems likely since the <italic>crq</italic> mutant used in this study <italic>(crq<sup>KG01679</sup>)</italic> is lethal in pupae.</p>
        <p>The idea that hemocytes are involved in fat body dissociation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is further supported by work on the flesh fly <italic>Sarcophaga</italic>. Natori's group showed that proteinase cathepsin B was released from pupal hemocytes when they interacted with the fat body, and that this enzyme digested the basement membrane of the fat body, causing the tissue to dissociate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b39">39</xref>]. They also showed that the interaction of hemocytes with the fat body is mediated by a 120-kDa membrane protein localized specifically on pupal hemocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b40">40</xref>]. This protein was suggested to be a scavenger receptor, but it does not seem to be homologous to <italic>Drosophila</italic> Croquemort (unpublished data). Work by Franc et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b27">27</xref>] is consistent with the idea that more than one scavenger receptor is involved in this process.</p>

        <title>Possible Signaling Role for Adenosine</title>
        <p>The precocious metamorphic changes that appear to occur in response to elevated adenosine in the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutant larvae lead to the suggestion that adenosine may act as a regulatory signal for these processes during normal development. One possibility is that adenosine acts as a downstream effector of ecdysone-regulated prepupal changes, and that the increase in adenosine concentration is mediated by ecdysone-induced down-regulation of ADGF-A expression. This is supported by the presence of multiple sites for ecdysone-inducible transcription regulators in the <italic>ADGF-A</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Adenosine could serve as a signal for macrophage differentiation, and the lack of adenosine deaminase activity due to the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutation could cause precocious differentiation of these cells in mutant larvae. We are now carrying out direct tests of the idea that the differentiation of hemocytes in mutant larvae is caused by elevated adenosine. If confirmed, this effect would have general significance, since in ADA-deficient mice, inflammatory changes in the lungs include an accumulation of activated alveolar macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b41">41</xref>], and this could also be mediated by elevated adenosine.</p>

        <title>Elevated Adenosine Delays Development and Inhibits Pupariation</title>
        <p>The elevated adenosine in the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutant larvae leads to precocious changes (hemocyte differentiation and fat body disintegration) resembling those normally occurring at the time of metamorphosis, but it also is associated with an apparently opposite effect, in that it causes a significant delay in progress through the third larval instar and a decrease in the frequency of successful pupariation (formation of the puparium from the larval cuticle), which is one of the earliest steps in metamorphosis. We conclude that the mutation has additional effects on the hormonal regulation of development.</p>
        <p>One possible explanation for the developmental delay and failure to pupariate is that the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutation affects the production or release of ecdysteroid hormones from the major endocrine organ of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva—the ring gland. This is supported by the fact that pupariation rate and survival of the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutant can be significantly improved by expression of transgenic ADGF-A in the ring gland and salivary glands. We suggest that this somehow interferes with the regulation of hormone release. Other mutants with hormonal dysregulation show delayed larval development and failure to pupariate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b43">43</xref>]. Presumably the elevated adenosine in the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutant blocks the production or release of ecdysone from the ring gland by an unknown mechanism. This idea is supported by our finding that both pupariation rate and survival of the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutant can also be improved by feeding the mutant larvae with 20E in the diet (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). Thus it is clear that the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutant is arrested in development due to an effect of the mutation on hormone production from the ring gland.</p>
        <p>The arrest of development in the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutants was significantly suppressed by loss of the adenosine receptor caused by the <italic>adoR</italic> mutation: larvae simply homozygous for <italic>adgf-a</italic> pupated after two or more days, whereas larvae also homozygous for <italic>adoR</italic> pupated within 1 d after their heterozygous siblings (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). Therefore, adenosine signaling through the AdoR must play a role in the developmental arrest of the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutant, and this is most likely mediated by signaling to the ring gland, where AdoR is expressed (ED, unpublished data). The mutation in AdoR does not block macrophage differentiation and fat-body disintegration, so this effect must involve another, as yet uncharacterized mechanism independent of AdoR signaling. Work using adenosine-receptor deficient mammalian cells also suggested the existence of a novel, undefined adenosine signaling mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b44">44</xref>]. However, we cannot exclude the role of elevated deoxyadenosine in these effects. <italic>Drosophila,</italic> now with the advantage of the well-characterized <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutant, could serve as an ideal model system in which to investigate this mechanism.</p>

        <title>Concluding Remarks</title>
        <p>In our previous work using cells cultured in vitro, we showed that, as in mammals, adenosine can block proliferation and/or survival of some <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b16">16</xref>]. In the present work, we have established a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model to study altered levels of adenosine and deoxyadenosine in vivo, and we have shown that loss of <italic>ADGF-A</italic> function causes an increase of these nucleosides in larval hemolymph. Although the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutation leads to larval or pupal death, we have shown that this is not due to the adenosine or deoxyadenosine simply blocking cellular proliferation or survival, as the experiments in vitro would suggest. Rather, this mutation leads to an increase in number of hemocytes at the end of larval development due to the differentiation and release of hemocytes from the lymph glands. Hemocytes also differentiate and are released from the lymph glands during systemic infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b19">19</xref>]. Together with our result suggesting an interaction between Toll signaling and ADGF-A, this leads to the hypothesis that adenosine controls hemocyte differentiation in response to infection, and that it signals through the adenosine receptor to postpone the next developmental step, metamorphosis. This would be consistent with the role of adenosine as a “stress hormone” in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b06">6</xref>]. A similar process of hemocyte differentiation and release from the lymph glands normally takes place at the onset of metamorphosis, when pupal macrophages remove histolyzing tissues. The <italic>ADGF-A</italic> promoter contains consensus binding sites for effectors of both Toll and ecdysone signaling. This raises the possibility that adenosine plays a role in the control of metamorphosis as well as in the response to stress.</p>

The following markers and mutations were obtained from the Bloomington stock center, accessible at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fly.bio.indiana.edu/" xlink:type="simple">http://fly.bio.indiana.edu/</ext-link> (stock numbers provided in parentheses): <italic>Hml-GFP</italic> marker (Hml-Gal4/UAS-GFP) expressing GFP in embryonic and larval hemocytes on Chromosome II (BL-6397), the <italic>l(3)hem<sup>1</sup></italic> mutation on Chromosome III (BL-6184), and the <italic>crq<sup>KG01679</sup></italic> mutation in the <italic>crq</italic> gene on Chromosome II (BL-14900). Mutants in Toll signaling pathway were obtained from Dr. S. Govind: <italic>cact<sup>E8</sup>,</italic><italic>cact<sup>IIIG</sup>,</italic> and <italic>cact<sup>D13</sup></italic> mutations in the <italic>cact</italic> gene on Chromosome II. The Gal4/UAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b18">18</xref>] system was used for protein misexpression. The following were obtained from the Bloomington stock center (stock numbers in parenthesis): <italic>Cg-Gal4</italic> on Chromosome II (BL-7011), <italic>Pw<sup>+mW.hs</sup>=GawB5015</italic> on II (BL-2721), <italic>Pw<sup>+mW.hs</sup>=GawBc564</italic> on II (BL-6982), <italic>Pw<sup>+mW.hs</sup>=GawBT110</italic> on II (BL-6998), <italic>Hml-Gal4</italic> on II (BL-6396), <italic>Dot-Gal4<sup>43A</sup></italic> on X (BL-6903), <italic>Dot-Gal4<sup>11C</sup></italic> on II (BL-6902), and <italic>Lsp2-Gal4</italic> (BL-6357) on III. The <italic>Pen2.4-GAL4e33C</italic> lethal insertion on Chromosome III was obtained from Dr. N. Perrimon's lab, and the <italic>Dmef2-Gal4</italic> driver on II from Dr. A. Michelson. Expression information of these Gal4 drivers is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030201-t001">Table 1</xref>. A stock carrying the ubiquitous actin-Gal4 driver (<italic>P-actin-Gal4 UAS-GFP/CyO;</italic> lethal insertion on Chromosome II) was obtained from Dr. R. Sousa. To recognize homozygous larvae, balancer chromosomes with the GFP marker were used: <italic>CyO Pw<sup>+mW.hs</sup>=Ubi-GFP.S65TPAD1</italic> (BL-4559) and <italic>TM3 Pw<sup>+mC</sup>=ActGFPJMR2 Ser</italic> (BL-4888). Transgenic flies SgsGFP-1 (insertion on Chromosome X) and SgsGFP-2 (insertion on Chromosome II) containing the chimeric gene construct SgsΔ3-GFP were obtained from Dr. A. J. Andres. For expression of ADGF-A using the <italic>HS-ADGF-A</italic> construct, flies were heat shocked as late embryos/early first instars at 37 °C for 30 min. In all rescue experiments, 30 freshly hatched homozygous first-instar larvae were selected using a GFP dissecting microscope and transferred into fresh vials (at least four vials for each variant). They were left to develop at 25 °C and examined as wandering third-instar larvae, pupae, and adults.</p>

        <p>Mutant larvae were raised on plates with yeast paste at 25 °C and transferred to vials with glucose-yeast medium (control) or with glucose-yeast medium containing 20-hydroxyecdysone (H-5142; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, United States) at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml shortly after the L2/L3 molt. Numbers of puparia were counted at 12-h intervals after the 120-h time point (when the first control larvae start to pupariate). The <italic>ecd<sup>1</sup></italic> flies (Bloomington stock BL-218) served as a control for the functional 20E diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b31">31</xref>]: flies were raised at 22 °C (permissive temperature for the temperature-sensitive <italic>ecd<sup>1</sup></italic> mutation) and transferred to vials with control or 20E-containing diet and raised at 29 °C (restrictive temperature).</p>

        <title>Fat body observation</title>
        <p>Living late third-instar larvae were washed and examined in PBS using a standard dissecting microscope with transmitted light.

        <title>Hemocyte counts and observations</title>
        <p>Circulating hemocytes were obtained by opening two late third-instar larvae in 30 μl of PBS. This allowed us to collect all hemolymph from the larvae in a defined volume. The solution with circulating hemocytes was mixed by gently pipetting, and part was transferred into the chamber of an improved Neubauer hemocytometer. Cell number was recounted to one animal equivalent. Hemocyte morphology was observed by differential interference contrast microscopy of living cells in Shields and Sang Insect Medium (Sigma-Aldrich) obtained by the same procedure as for counting. To observe hemocyte morphology, samples were analyzed at least 10 min after the deposition of solution with hemocytes, in order to allow the cells to adhere to the surface of the slide. Crystal cells were visualized by heating larvae at 60 °C for 10 min in a water bath [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b46">46</xref>]. GFP-stained hemocytes were observed in living, etherized larvae in PBS solution on a standard microscopic slide with a coverslip under the fluorescence microscope or by deposition of hemocytes in PBS as for counting and observing under the fluorescence microscope.</p>

        <title>Transgenic constructs</title>
        <p>Wild-type cDNA for <italic>ADGF-A</italic> was amplified by PCR using proofreading DNA polymerase (ProofStart; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, United States) from a pOT2 vector containing the <italic>ADGF-A</italic> EST-clone (GH08276) using the following primers: 5′-CGTCTAGAATGTCGCCAGTCATCCGCC-3′ (5′ end primer with XbaI tail) and 5′-GCTGATCATCAATCGATCCGTTGACTGGGGGA-3′ (3′ end primer with BclI tail). The PCR product was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, United States), and the resulting plasmid <italic>(ADGF-A-pGEM)</italic> was cut by NotI/SpeI restriction enzymes. The ADGF-A fragment was then cloned into the pCaSpeR-hs) vector cut by NotI/XbaI to obtain the <italic>HS-ADGF-A</italic> construct. The myc tag was added to the C terminus of the ADGF-A protein for detection by anti-c-Myc antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). To produce a <italic>UAS-ADGF-Amyc</italic> construct, the ADGF-A fragment was amplified (by ProofStart from pOT2 vector) using the following primers: 5′-AATCTCGAGCTCATCATGTCGCCAGTCATC-3′ (5′ end with XhoI tail) and 5′-TATCTAGATCGATCCGTTGACTGGGGG-3′ (3′ end with XbaI tail). The fragment was cut by XhoI/XbaI and cloned into the pUAST vector modified by MZ. The sequence encoding the myc-tag 5′-GAGCAAAAGCTCATTTCTGAAGAGGACTTG-3′ plus a stop codon was inserted into XbaI site of pUAST (using the XbaI site on the 5′ end and the NheI site on the 3′ end) cut by XhoI/XbaI. A mutated version—<italic>UAS-mutADGF-Amyc</italic>—was prepared in the same way as <italic>UAS-ADGF-Amyc,</italic> but pBLUESCRIPT containing mutated <italic>ADGF-A</italic> cDNA was used as a template. The mutated version of ADGF-A (carrying a mutation causing the substitution of two amino acids—His386 and Ala387 for Glu and Leu, respectively) in the catalytic domain, shown to abolish adenosine deaminase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b16">16</xref>], was prepared by recombinant PCR using the following recombinant primers: 5′-TCTACTTCGAGCTCGGAGAAACAAACTGGTTCGGT-3′ and 5′-CTCCGAGCTCGAAGTAGAAATCAATGTCATCG-3′ and the same 5′ and 3′ end primers as above.

        <title>Adenosine and deoxyadenosine concentrations measurement</title>
        <p>The detection method used liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC/MS method) of deproteinated hemolymph samples. Larval hemolymph was collected from several larvae and centrifuged to pellet the hemocytes. 1 μl of hemolymph was diluted in 99 μl of buffer. The sample was introduced in CH<sub>3</sub>CN-0.05% TFA (50:50) either via a syringe pump at 3 μl/min or via an RP-C18 150 mm × 1 mm Symmetry C<sub>8</sub> column at 50 μl/min employing an LCQ electrospray ion source operated at 4.2 kV. The peaks were then identified using the electrospray MS<sup>N</sup> mass spectra obtained by the collision-induced decomposition of the MH<sup>+</sup> ion and its product ions in a series of MS<sup>N</sup> experiments that were performed with the ion trap mass spectrometer. The sugar moiety was cleaved off the adenosine molecule and produced ion with a molecular weight of 136 (adenine), which was then detected by MS.</p>
