Developing mechanism-based toxicity biomarkers requires the identification of such novel pathways and the order of their sufficiency in causing a phenotypic response. Genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) phenotypic screening has emerged as an effective tool in unveiling the genes essential for specific cellular functions and biological activities. However, eliciting the relative contribution of and sufficiency relationships among the genes identified remains challenging. In the rodent, the most widely used animal model in preclinical studies, it is unrealistic to exhaustively examine all potential interactions by RNAi screening. Application of existing computational approaches to infer regulatory networks with biological outcomes in the rodent is limited by the requirements for a large number of targeted permutations. Therefore, we developed a two-step relay method that requires only one targeted perturbation for genome-wide de novo pathway discovery. Using expression profiles in response to small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against the gene for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (<italic>Ppara</italic>), our method unveiled the potential causal sufficiency order network for liver hypertrophy in the rodent. The validity of the inferred 16 causal transcripts or 15 known genes for PPARα-induced liver hypertrophy is supported by their ability to predict non-PPARα–induced liver hypertrophy with 84% sensitivity and 76% specificity. Simulation shows that the probability of achieving such predictive accuracy without the inferred causal relationship is exceedingly small (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005). Five of the most sufficient causal genes have been previously disrupted in mouse models; the resulting phenotypic changes in the liver support the inferred causal roles in liver hypertrophy. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of defining pathways mediating drug-induced toxicity from siRNA-treated expression profiles.

Knowledge of the components of the identified pathways and their sufficiency order for toxicity is crucial for selecting mechanism-based biomarkers to assess the safety of novel agents. Numerous efforts have been made to establish toxicogenomics databases, most of which consist of thousands of expression profiles produced in response to treatment with dozens or hundreds of compounds and their associated toxicities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b005">5</xref>]. Classifiers based on genes showing altered expression in association with the observed toxicities have been developed to predict a variety of potential toxicities in target tissues, such as liver, kidney, and heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b001">1</xref>]. Although these metrics built on different machine learning algorithms could be useful in estimating the severity of potential toxicities induced by compounds, the applications of these classifiers in understanding the mechanisms of drug-induced toxicity are not straightforward. In particular, this approach is unlikely to distinguish the upstream causal genes from the downstream responsive genes among all the genes associated with an induced toxicity. Without knowledge of the causal sufficiency order, designing experiments to test predicted toxicity in animal models remains difficult.</p><p>Genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as an effective tool in uncovering components of pathways for specific cellular functions and biological activities, such as the innate immune response, the DNA-damage response, Golgi organization, and lifespan regulation in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans,</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b012">12</xref>]. However, eliciting the causal sufficiency relationships among identified genes for a biological activity is still challenging. Phenotypic screening by RNAi has successfully identified regulators of a gene on a single-gene basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b013">13</xref>]; however, it is unrealistic to exhaustively examine all potential interactions by concomitant perturbations targeting each gene within a pathway, given the exponential number of potential interactions between these genes and the phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b012">12</xref>]. Therefore, a high-throughput approach to identify the most likely sufficiency order among these genes is critical for the application of RNAi screening in defining phenotype-orientated pathways. Such an approach is particularly important for pathway discovery in rodents, the most frequently used animal models in preclinical studies. Unfortunately, introducing genome-wide targeted genetic modifications in rodents is technically challenging.</p><p>Computational approaches have been reported to infer regulatory networks from expression profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b020">20</xref>]. A variety of statistical modeling approaches, including Bayesian-based networks, graph theory, and ordinary differential equations, have been used for depicting or uncovering molecular networks. Collins and colleagues first developed a model for identifying the mode of action for a compound after perturbing each of the genes in the network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b017">17</xref>]. Friedman and colleagues reported a Bayesian network approach for de novo inference of potential transcriptional networks based on 300 expression profiles obtained from yeast strains with 276 deletion mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b018">18</xref>]; this approach did not require prior knowledge about the modeled network, as Collins' approach did. Approaches based on physical interactions, such as DNA–protein or protein–protein interactions, were reported by Yeang et al., Gifford, and a couple of other groups as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b021">21</xref>]. Although implemented successfully in <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> these published approaches depend on the accessibility of genome-wide targeted perturbations in individual model systems. Even in models in which genome-wide perturbation by genetic engineering can be easily achieved, such as yeast or fly models, it is still quite labor intensive and prohibitively expensive to use a genome-wide overexpression or deletion mutation to obtain the data required for these analytic approaches. In rodents, it is unlikely that such a dataset from genome-wide genetic permutation could be obtained with current technology. Some progress has been made with the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)–chip technology for eliciting potential transcriptional regulatory relationships; however, screening for all the transcription factors on the genome scale is impeded by the lack of specific antibodies for each of the known transcription factors.</p><p>Recent work by Segal and colleagues in identifying regulatory modules from five strains of yeast shows promise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b015">15</xref>]. Using precompiled putative transcription factors, they identified potential transcriptional modules that are associated with enriched functionality, suggesting the potential impact of these genes on certain biological processes. Others have attempted to associate the derived network with specific biological processes as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b024">24</xref>]. Recent progress toward identifying a phenotype-oriented network in rodent models was initially reported by Schadt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b023">23</xref>]. Taking advantage of the genetic heterogeneity introduced by more than 300 crossbreeding F2 mice, the authors inferred causal genes for obesity from a combination of genetic quantitative trait loci and their associated expression profiles. The sensitivity and specificity of their approach depend on three factors: the frequency of recombination across the genome, the density of the measured genetic markers, and the coverage of the phenotypic alteration of interest among the F2 subpopulations. To ensure adequate statistical power, their approach requires large-scale cross-breeding and genotyping, yet it may not be flexible enough for inferring causal genes for drug-induced toxicities in any target tissue.</p><p>To uncover a phenotype-orientated network for any type of drug-induced toxicity in rodents, we developed a two-step relay approach to infer causal genes and their sufficiency order from small interfering RNA (siRNA) response expression profiles. In the first step, we used both the on- and off-target effects from RNAi to infer pairwise regulatory relationships from the expression profiles. This strategy allowed us to avoid the need for large-scale targeted genetic perturbations required by the majority of previously developed methods. In the second step, we used the inferred regulatory relationships among the identified gene pairs to derive causal genes for any type of drug-induced toxicity from any previously established toxicogenomics database in the rodent. Our approach provides a practical and flexible strategy for uncovering potential molecular mechanisms for drug-induced toxicity.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Inferring Pairwise Regulatory Relationships from siRNA-Treated Expression Profiles</title><p>To derive causal genes and their sufficiency order in inducing PPARα activation–induced liver hypertrophy (AILH), we profiled mouse liver after modifying <italic>Ppara</italic> mRNA levels by treatment with two <italic>Ppara</italic> siRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b025">25</xref>]. The mRNA levels of <italic>Ppara</italic> and two of its known downstream targets, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A <italic>(Cpt1a)</italic> and long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase <italic>(Acadl),</italic> were examined in the siRNA-treated mice as well as in <italic>Ppara</italic> knockout mice, which served as a positive control for the silencing efficacy of the <italic>Ppara</italic> siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030030-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Expression of both <italic>Ppara</italic> and its known target genes decreased in a coordinated fashion among all <italic>Ppara</italic> siRNA–treated mice, and regulation between <italic>Ppara</italic> and its targets, <italic>Cpt1a</italic> and <italic>Acadl,</italic> was confirmed in the <italic>Ppara</italic> knockout mice. These data suggest that <italic>Ppara</italic> siRNA effectively downregulates transcription of the targeted gene, <italic>Ppara,</italic> and its known downstream genes in vivo. The genome-wide expression profiles in livers from the <italic>Ppara</italic> siRNA–treated mice also revealed an extensive off-target effect when compared with the profiles in livers from the <italic>Ppara</italic> knockout mice, as reported separately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b026">26</xref>]. A large number of genes that were downregulated in the <italic>Ppara</italic> siRNA–treated liver profiles either were not downregulated or were upregulated in the <italic>Ppara</italic> knockout liver profiles, and vice versa. Hence, <italic>Ppara</italic> siRNA, delivered by tail vein, has a significant effect on both on- and off-target genes in vivo. The transcriptional response to <italic>Ppara</italic> siRNA treatment provides an ideal dataset for inferring pairwise regulatory relationship genes by local constraint algorithm (LCA) in that the external perturbation, or the instrumental variable, on the system can be measured.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030030-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030030.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Effective Modification of <italic>Ppara</italic> mRNA and Its Known Target Genes by siRNA In Vivo</title><p><italic>Ppara</italic> was monitored with three probes, <italic>Ppara</italic> 1, 2, and 3, targeting different fragments of the whole <italic>Ppara</italic> transcript.

The causal models corresponding to all illustrated scenarios and their combinations share a common regulatory relationship between <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic> (designated as <italic>X</italic> → <italic>Y</italic>), representing genes and/or cellular responses affected by the perturbation variable, <italic>W,</italic> or a hidden variable, <italic>H,</italic> which is not measurable in the current system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030030-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030030-g002">2</xref>D, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030030-g002">2</xref>F). Because the mRNA levels for both the on- and off-target genes are controlled by the siRNA, we considered the effect of <italic>Ppara</italic> siRNA as the instrumental variable (<italic>W</italic>), which is manifested and can be measured by the mRNA level of <italic>Ppara</italic> in response to the siRNA treatments. Without genome-wide perturbation induced by the off-target effect of <italic>Ppara</italic> siRNA, expression of the genes associated with <italic>Ppara,</italic> such as gene <italic>X</italic> and gene <italic>Y,</italic> in the <italic>Ppara</italic> siRNA–treated profiles should highly correlate with expression of <italic>Ppara</italic>. Hence, it would be impossible to determine the regulatory relationship between gene <italic>X</italic> and gene <italic>Y</italic>. However, the off-target effects of different <italic>Ppara</italic> siRNAs often introduce additional perturbations on <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic> differentially, making it possible to derive the regulatory relationship between gene <italic>X</italic> and gene <italic>Y</italic>. For example, when two conditions—(1) the correlation between <italic>Ppara</italic> and gene <italic>Y</italic> is disrupted by the off-target effects, but the correlation between <italic>Ppara</italic> and gene <italic>X</italic> remains in some profiles, and (2) the disruption of the correlation between <italic>Ppara</italic> and gene <italic>X</italic> is parallel to the disruption of correlation between <italic>Ppara</italic> and gene <italic>Y</italic> in the other profiles—are met simultaneously for <italic>Ppara</italic>, gene <italic>X,</italic> and gene <italic>Y,</italic> then the observation, which statistically satisfies the <italic>Ppara</italic> and <italic>Y</italic> conditional independency given <italic>X,</italic> indicates that it is more likely that <italic>X</italic> regulates <italic>Y</italic> than that <italic>Y</italic> regulates <italic>X</italic>. Consequently, when <italic>W,</italic> an instrumental variable whose value is controlled by a defined input or signal, is known, the causal relationship between <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic> can be inferred computationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b028">28</xref>]. More comprehensive statistical tests, such as the LCA, to estimate the likelihood of <italic>X</italic> regulating <italic>Y</italic> given an instrumental variable <italic>W</italic> over all other possible relationships among <italic>X, Y,</italic> and any other hidden variables, have been previously established for general data-mining purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b027">27</xref>]. Our two-step relay approach used LCA to infer all pairwise causal relationships between a top gene (<italic>X</italic>) and a bottom gene (<italic>Y</italic>) in the first step, and a causal gene (<italic>X</italic>) and its cellular response (<italic>Y</italic>) in the second step.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030030-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030030.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Schematic of the LCA That Determines Genes Mediating Certain Cellular Responses from Expression Profiles after Perturbation by siRNA</title><p>The three major scenarios for the effect of siRNA on gene expression and biological response are illustrated in (A): the direct target or the on-target gene for siRNA and/or its downstream regulated genes resulting in a cellular response; (C): the off-target genes and their downstream regulated genes causing the cellular response; and (E): the cellular effect of an siRNA toward on-target and/or off-target genes and their downstream regulated genes leading to the cellular response.

If some of the 16 identified transcripts are essential for liver hypertrophy, we would expect them to have predictive power for compound-induced liver hypertrophy regardless of the compounds' mode of action; otherwise, the derived causal effect of these 16 transcripts for liver hypertrophy cannot be sustained. To test this hypothesis, we profiled 211 rats that were treated with 30 non-PPAR compounds and determined their liver/body weight ratio, as an indicator of liver hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030030-st003">Table S3</xref>). A logistic regression-based classifier for liver hypertrophy was built based on nine of the 16 identified causal transcripts from the 211 profiles as the training set.

To determine if the causal information is necessary for such performance in predicting liver hypertrophy, we examined the possibility of achieving an equivalent level of accuracy in predicting liver hypertrophy based on genes selected solely by their association or correlation with the liver/body weight ratio in the PPAR minicompendium. Based on correlation with liver/body weight ratio, we identified 757 genes that had a value equal to or greater than that of the 16 inferred causal transcripts in the PPAR minicompendium. The identified genes were used as a candidate pool to build a correlation-based model. In total, we built 10,000 models based on 10,000 sets of 16 genes randomly selected from the candidate pool. Using the area under the curve (AUC) from a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot (a common indicator for model performance), we estimated the distribution of the performance for these 10,000 models. This in silico simulation revealed that none of the models in the training set, and only 37 of the models in the testing set, achieved a level of performance at least equal to that of the model based on inferred causal genes in predicting liver hypertrophy.

Hence, correlation alone is insufficient for extrapolating the capability of the 16 inferred PPARα–AILH causal transcripts to predict liver hypertrophy induced by non-PPAR compounds. The predictive power of the inferred PPARα–-AILH causal transcripts for non-PPAR–induced liver hypertrophy supports the assumption that essential biological components for liver hypertrophy exist.

The proposed 15 causal genes not only reveal the molecular mechanism of this phenomenon, which is in agreement with that shown in previous studies, but also suggest potential unknown common mechanisms underlying liver hypertrophy.

Nevertheless, application of these approaches in rodents is impeded by their requirement for a large number of targeted genetic perturbations or prior knowledge of the pathway. Our approach overcomes such hindrance by taking advantage of the siRNA off-target effects as additional genome-wide perturbations. Using the mRNA level of an siRNA-targeted gene, in the current case, <italic>Ppara,</italic> as the instrumental variable, in the siRNA-treated expression profiles, we were able to infer pairwise regulatory relationships by a simple but well-established LCA originally developed for data mining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b027">27</xref>].</p><p>Instead of approximating a global regulatory structure, we focused on the sufficiency order among the causal genes identified by the two-step relay approach.

In our case, the searching space was reduced by 272-fold. This dramatic reduction enabled us to exhaustively search for the sufficiency network, which was, otherwise, computationally expensive or simply infeasible. In contrast, most of the previously reported approaches require Monte Carlo Markov chain or other sampling techniques to search for a local optimal network as an approximation of the global optimal structure.</p><p>Moreover, the derived pairwise regulatory relationships from siRNA expression profiles can also benefit most of the currently used computational approaches for pathway de novo discovery. For example, application of these relationships as local constraints in Monte Carlo Markov chain–based Bayesian methods will reduce the searching space and consequently improve the chance that any resulting local optimal structure is the real global solution.</p><p>The two-step relay strategy offers unprecedented flexibility, although the assumption of retained pairwise relationships among the gene pairs derived from the first step is essential and needs to be experimentally examined. Because the derived regulatory relationship between the top (upstream) gene and the bottom (downstream) gene reflects a transcriptional regulatory relationship within a gene pair, these relationships are independent from the instrumental signal, in our case, <italic>Ppara.</italic> As a result, such regulatory relationships can be used to infer causal genes for any phenotypic changes induced by compounds or other types of perturbation. This portability of the inferred regulatory relationship within gene pairs is extremely helpful for toxicogenomics study because the majority of toxicity studies, including gene expression profile studies, are performed in rats, whereas knockout or RNAi silencing is most commonly undertaken in mice.</p><p>In this work, we used perturbation introduced by siRNA targeting one gene. It is conceivable that the coverage and reliability of pairwise relationship across the genome can be further improved if multiple siRNAs targeting different genes are applied. Meanwhile, other strategies can be applied to experimentally evaluate the accuracy of the inferred causal relationship. For example, genetic engineering of top genes in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> or <italic>Drosophila</italic> can be used to verify the regulatory effect of top genes on bottom genes, the key assumption of our method. Monitoring the temporal relationship between the expression regulations of these inferred causal genes and the phenotypic outcomes in liver will enable further validation of the inferred causal network in rodents as well. Consequently, a genome-wide phenotype-oriented network can be inferred and tested in a relatively high throughput fashion.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Exploring Differences among Classification, Causality, and Extrapolation</title><p>Classification does not prove a causal relationship. Yet, only a causal relationship will enable extrapolation of an established model into prediction. Hence, capability of extrapolation can be used as a test of the derived causal relationship. Many classifiers or gene sets, established by vigorous machine learning procedures, have been reported to describe the extent of drug-induced toxicity or the outcome of cancer with reasonable accuracy. However, they do not allow us to distinguish whether these identified gene sets have a functionally important role in mediating those observed outcomes or are merely indicators for the underlying propensity of those outcomes. The performance of such types of classifiers for predicting drug-induced toxicity will be affected by the diversity of compounds used in the training set and testing set. When toxicity has to be predicted for compounds affecting targets different from the targets affected by compounds in the training set, the performance of a classifier not based on causality information will deteriorate dramatically. In other words, a classifier that is not based on causality will rarely have the capability of extrapolation. Our comparison between classifiers based on genes selected by inferred causality and by correlation alone demonstrates that causality information is necessary for compound-independent extrapolation in toxicity prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030030-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The performance of classifiers built on genes selected from the 757 genes correlated with liver/body weight ratio in the PPAR minicompendium became substantially inferior when these classifiers were used to predict liver hypertrophy induced by non-PPAR compounds. Our simulation indicates that classifiers based on correlated genes alone are unlikely to successfully predict or extrapolate drug-induced toxicity independently from the mode of action of compounds used in training set (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005). In contrast, the classifier we built based on inferred causal genes can predict liver hypertrophy independent from compounds' modes of action in the original training set. The capability of extrapolating a model that was initially built on PPAR compounds into predicting liver hypertrophy regardless of a compound's primary targets has not been demonstrated in any previous reports and has not been examined for classifiers based on association markers.</p><p>The legitimacy of using the capability of extrapolation as an analytic validation approach for the inferred causal genes is further supported by experimental evidence for the inferred 16 causal transcripts in in vivo models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b040">40</xref>]. More than 85% (six of seven) of the inferred causal genes that have been genetically modified or specifically targeted in in vivo models are associated with phenotypic abnormalities in the liver that are in agreement with the role of these genes in mediating liver hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030030-t001">Table 1</xref>). Five of them are among the genes with highest sufficiency in causing liver hypertrophy. In contrast, the rate of discovering functionally related genes among the top-ranked markers in an association-based classifier is quite low. For instance, Furey and colleagues detected only three genes that are cancer-related among the top ten most discriminative genes or ESTs for classifying ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b041">41</xref>]. The rate for cancer-related genes or ESTs may be underestimated because they exclude noncoding sequences, which have been recently shown to play an important role in tumorigenesis. Nonetheless, the lack of evidence for the capability of extrapolating their association-based model into predicting outcomes of other solid tumors is in agreement with the contention that causality is a prerequisite for the capability of extrapolation in predicting outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Evaluating Statistical Power and Assumptions in the Two-Step Relay Approach</title><p>Although we have made every effort to analytically validate the derived results of causal relation in general, several factors may affect our results. First, the assumption that the derived pairwise regulatory relationship between a top gene and a bottom gene is valid in both mouse and rat liver may not hold all the time. To gain confidence in this assumption, we examined the statistical conditional independence between PPARα activity, measured by direct targets of PPARα, and bottom genes given top genes for all 16 identified transcripts using the PPAR minicompendium. We found that nine of the 16 transcripts were more likely to retain the same top–bottom relationship as derived from the siRNA profiles. Of note, the original 16 gene pairs were established by treating the mRNA level of PPARα as a direct measurement of perturbation on <italic>Ppara</italic> in siRNA-treated profiles, whereas the nine gene pairs were reestablished by treating mRNA levels of <italic>Cpt1a</italic> and other genes known to be PPARα downstream genes as an indirect measurement of perturbations on <italic>Ppara</italic> in the PPAR minicompendium. Second, statistical power could be reduced with multiple tests. For example, false-positives may occur among the inferred causal genes for PPARα–AILH after testing all the 4,727 gene pairs. The estimated false-positive rate for the 16 identified transcripts was 0.002. Third, a measurement error associated with expression profiles could affect the sensitivity and specificity of our analysis. To account for this error, we used error-weighted mean logarithmic ratios in our analysis. Cross-validation from different platforms or independent experiments will help further address this issue.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Uncovering Distinguishing Molecular Mechanisms Underlying PPARα–AILH</title><p>The five identified most sufficient causal genes for PPARα–AILH suggest that three major molecular mechanisms underlie the increases in liver weight mediated by this receptor: increased cell proliferation, altered fatty acid or lipid metabolism, and affected function of the Golgi apparatus. In agreement with observations in humanized PPARα mice treated by PPARα ligand Wy-14643, our results suggest that <italic>Cdc2a (cdk1),</italic> a cell cycle control gene, may increase liver weight by enhancing cell proliferation. As shown by Gonzalez and colleagues, replacing murine PPARα with human PPARα dramatically decreases the number of proliferating cells and inhibits the level of <italic>cdk1</italic> in the presence of Wy-14643 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b037">37</xref>]. Although they clearly demonstrated the rodent specificity for the effect of PPARα activation in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, the downstream genes mediating the proliferation effects of Wy-14643 remained largely unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b038">38</xref>]. Our study provides a testable hypothesis for the role of <italic>Cdc2a</italic> or <italic>cdk1</italic> in mediating the rodent-specific tumorigenic effect of PPARα activation. A cross between humanized PPARα mice and liver-specific <italic>Cdc2a</italic> knockout mice will be a perfect model to evaluate the hypothesized contribution of <italic>Cdc2a</italic> to PPARα activation–induced cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.</p><p>The contribution of fatty acid or lipid metabolism to PPARα–AILH, suggested by our observations, is also supported by phenotypic changes reported in several genetically modified mouse models, including the mice with humanized PPARα. For instance, both <italic>Acadm,</italic> a gene critical for fatty acid metabolism, and the extent of liver hypertrophy, measured by either the absolute liver weight or the liver/body weight ratio, are increased by PPARα ligand Wy-14643 in mice with or without humanized PPARα despite the fact that cell proliferation is dramatically reduced with the humanized receptor PPARα [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b038">38</xref>]. Furthermore, for inferred causal genes downregulated by PPARα ligands, such as <italic>Pck1</italic> and <italic>Apoa4,</italic> knocking out these genes results in significant increases in liver weight and liver/body weight ratio or in fatty liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b039">39</xref>]. The increased liver weight or size resulting from deficient mutations of these two genes, and the fact that PPARα activation reduces their expression, supports their inferred role in liver hypertrophy. Additional evidence comes from the response to the high-fat diet, the endogenous ligand for PPARα, in mice treated with an antisense oligonucleotide for <italic>Acac1</italic> and <italic>Scd1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b040">40</xref>]. As the key regulators for fatty acid oxidation and fat synthesis in the liver, <italic>Acac1</italic> and <italic>Scd1</italic> are upregulated by PPARα activation as well as by a high-fat diet. Increased expression of these genes results in increases in liver size or weight by lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. Antisense oligonucleotide inhibitors of <italic>Acac1</italic> and <italic>Acac2</italic> totally reverse this induced lipid accumulation, suggesting that <italic>Acac1</italic> mediates the effect of PPARα activation on lipid accumulation in liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b040">40</xref>]. Similar results have been reported in mice treated with an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of <italic>Scd1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b036">36</xref>]. Injection of 15 mg/kg of this oligonucleotide twice a week significantly reduced the lipid accumulation in the liver induced by a high-fat diet. Taken together, these reported observations are not only in concert with our inferred role of fatty acid metabolism and lipid synthesis in mediating PPARα–AILH, but may also reveal a potential key pathological change, lipid accumulation, linking liver hypertrophy with fatty liver.</p><p>The role of <italic>Golga4</italic> in mediating PPARα–AILH remains unknown because functional studies of this gene are lacking. However, the essential role of Golgi traffic in regulating the activation of sterol regulatory element–binding protein (SREBP), another key regulator of lipid metabolism, points in the same direction.</p><p>Distinguishing the proliferation component from the fatty acid and lipid metabolism component for liver hypertrophy is important for drug development. For example, compounds are being developed to target <italic>Pck1</italic> as novel therapeutic agents for type II diabetes or obesity. Distinguishing the two components enables us not only to predict the potential effect on liver weight by compounds directly targeting <italic>Pck1</italic> (Pepck), a potential therapeutic target regulated by PPARα and the rate-limiting enzyme for gluconeogenesis, but also to monitor any cellular proliferation associated with increased liver weight.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Revealing Common Essential Molecular Machinery That Mediates Liver Hypertrophy Shared by a Variety of Compounds with Different Mechanisms of Action</title><p>The causal sufficiency order among the 15 derived genes suggests that liver hypertrophy induced by compounds with drastically different mechanisms of actions may be mediated by common molecular components. For example, we found that <italic>Car,</italic> another nuclear receptor whose activation is also known to cause liver hypertrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b031">31</xref>], was more sufficient than <italic>Pex19,</italic> a gene required for the synthesis of the peroxisome membrane, in mediating PPARα–AILH. To our knowledge, the effect of PPARα ligands on the liver in mice with a <italic>Car</italic>-deficient mutation has never been reported; however, liver hypertrophy induced by PPARα activation and by <italic>Car</italic> activation might share the same mechanism, given the extensive crosstalk between PPARα and <italic>Car</italic> ligands and their very similar effects on some of the genes regulating fatty acid or lipid metabolism. Finally, the capability to extrapolate a model built on causal genes for PPARα–AILH to predict liver hypertrophy induced by a set of non-PPAR compounds with different mechanisms of action supports the existence of common essential molecular machinery that mediates liver hypertrophy independent of upstream signals.</p><p>In conclusion, our approach enables systematic inference of testable hypotheses about potential molecular mechanisms underlying drug-induced toxicity. The validity of any inferred hypotheses will still be subject to experimental verification. Nonetheless, the derived causal sufficiency order provides a way to prioritize all these hypotheses, which otherwise cannot be tested exhaustively across the prohibitive number of potential interactions and combinations among the genes associated with drug-induced effects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title><italic>Ppara</italic> siRNA treatment and expression profiles in the mouse.</title><p>Two different siRNAs targeting <italic>Ppara</italic> and two control siRNAs targeting secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) and GL3 were delivered to the mouse liver by hydrodynamic tail vein injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030030-b025">25</xref>].
