                <p>Dendrite morphology, a neuron's anatomical fingerprint, is a
                    neuroscientist's asset in unveiling organizational principles in the
                    brain. However, the genetic program encoding the morphological identity of a
                    single dendrite remains a mystery. In order to obtain a formal understanding of
                    dendritic branching, we studied distributions of morphological parameters in a
                    group of four individually identifiable neurons of the fly visual system. We
                    found that parameters relating to the branching topology were similar throughout
                    all cells. Only parameters relating to the area covered by the dendrite were
                    cell type specific. With these areas, artificial dendrites were grown based on
                    optimization principles minimizing the amount of wiring and maximizing synaptic
                    democracy. Although the same branching rule was used for all cells, this yielded
                    dendritic structures virtually indistinguishable from their real counterparts.
                    From these principles we derived a fully-automated model-based neuron
                    reconstruction procedure validating the artificial branching rule. In
                    conclusion, we suggest that the genetic program implementing neuronal branching
                    could be constant in all cells whereas the one responsible for the dendrite
                    spanning field should be cell specific.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>Neural computation has been shown to be heavily dependent not only on the
                    connectivity of single neurons but also on their specific dendritic
                    shape—often used as a key feature for their classification. Still,
                    very little is known about the constraints determining a neuron's
                    morphological identity. In particular, one would like to understand what cells
                    with the same or similar function share anatomically, what renders them
                    different from others, and whether one can formalize this difference
                    objectively. A large number of approaches have been proposed, trying to put
                    dendritic morphology in a parametric frame. A central problem lies in the wide
                    variety and variability of dendritic branching and function even within one
                    narrow cell class. We addressed this problem by investigating functionally and
                    anatomically highly conserved neurons in the fly brain, where each neuron can
                    easily be individually identified in different animals. Our analysis shows that
                    the pattern of dendritic branching is not unique in any particular cell, only
                    the features of the area that the dendrites cover allow a clear classification.
                    This leads to the conclusion that all fly dendrites share the same growth
                    program but a neuron's dendritic field shape, its “anatomical
                    receptive field”, is key to its specific identity.</p>

            <p>Dendrite morphology is the most prominent feature of nerve cells, typically used by
                neuroanatomists to discriminate and classify them <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000251-Stuart1">[1]</xref>. These tree-like
                ramifications represent the input region of the neurons and fulfil the role of a
                complex computational unit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000251-Euler1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000251-Miller1">[5]</xref>. Typically, dendritic
                arborizations are analyzed in a descriptive way, e.g. by enumerating local and
                global branching parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000251-Hillman1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000251-Uylings1">[8]</xref>. Very little is known
                about the general rule leading to their distinct appearance partly due to the wide
                variety among different neurons. In insects, same neurons across individuals are
                rather invariant in their anatomy and constant in their function. Lobula plate
                tangential cells (LPTCs) of the fly visual system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000251-Hausen1">[9]</xref> are uniquely
                identifiable and are therefore ideal subjects for investigating the basic rule
                constraining dendrite formation. They integrate local motion information over an
                array of retinotopically arranged columnar elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000251-Borst1">[10]</xref>. Accordingly, their
                planar dendritic trees cover the area corresponding to their distinct primary
                receptive fields. In this paper we isolate potential fundamental principles which
                may lead to the morphological identity of individual LPTCs.</p>

            <title>Results</title>
            <p>We studied inter-individual constancy and variability in four members of the LPTC
                group: the equatorial and the northern cell of the horizontal system (HSE and HSN,
                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000251-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), and two members
                of the vertical system (VS2 and VS4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000251-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), each of them represented by at least ten individuals from
                different flies. Two-photon image stacks were acquired from cells filled with
                fluorescent dye in the living blowfly, <italic>Calliphora vicina</italic>.
                Subsequently, the anatomy of each neuron was manually traced and described by a set
                of connected cylinders (see detailed explanation on the reconstruction procedures in
                the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section). The idea was, in
                concordance with previous publications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000251-Hillman1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000251-Uylings1">[8]</xref>, to use
                statistical distributions over morphological parameters thereby isolating key
                features of dendritic branching. Next to classical branching parameters on the
                “topological points” (branching and termination points in the
                tree) such as branching order and path lengths to the root, we parameterized the
                area covered by the dendritic tree, the so-called “dendrite spanning
                field” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000251-Hausen2">[11]</xref>. We defined spanning field by drawing a contour
                around the dendrite at a distance of 25 µm after orienting the
                reconstructed neuron along its axonal axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000251-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>).</p>

            <p>Regarding branching-specific statistics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000251-g001">Figure 1E–K</xref>), qualitative distinction was possible only by
                detailed examination of distributions of topological point density, path length to
                the root and branch order. Ratios between direct and path distances of the root
                    (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000251-g001">Figure 1F</xref>) followed a
                narrow distribution close to 1 in all cases for all topological points. Path length
                histograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000251-g001">Figure 1E</xref>) therefore
                corresponded to the Sholl intersection diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000251-g001">Figure 1L</xref>), a measure typically used to describe
                branching topology. On the other hand, parameters relating to the spanning field
                plainly reflected cell type specific differences: All four cells could be readily
                discriminated by eye by their relative position and the shape of their dendrite
                spanning fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000251-g001">Figure 1C and
                1D</xref>, parameters see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000251-g001">Figure
                    1M–R</xref>). Those differences were in conformity with the respective
                primary receptive field locations in the retinotopic arrangement. HS and VS spanning
                fields were easily distinguished by either their convexity index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000251-g001">Figure 1O</xref>) or the ratio of width
                against height (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000251-g001">Figure 1P</xref>).
                Finer differentiation of HSE against HSN and VS2 against VS4 was provided directly
                by their relative location to the axonal axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000251-g001">Figure 1N</xref>), and accordingly by their centre of
                mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000251-g001">Figure 1Q and 1R</xref>). We
                investigated the descriptive power of spanning field parameters versus branching
                parameters in a quantitative way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000251-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Spanning field related parameters readily grouped individual
                cells into their respective cell types as shown simply by plotting convexity index
                values against the contextual relative location off the axonal axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000251-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). On the other hand,
                even a highly-dimensional clustering analysis on the basis of parameterized shape
                fits of the distributions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000251-g001">Figure
                    1E–K</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000251.s002">Figure S2</xref>) or subsets of these did not allow the
                separation of the real cells into their respective groups. Best clustering was
                obtained using path length, density and branching order distributions which
                separated HS from VS cells but not the members of the two families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000251-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In accordance to these
                findings we postulated that if the spanning area best determines neuronal
                appearance, the particularities in branching parameter distributions might be merely
                a consequence of the neuronal target zone.</p>

            <p>In order to identify the critical impact of spanning field shape on branching
                parameters, artificial dendrites were constructed covering the same region. Inside
                the contours of the original cells, random points were distributed following their
                respective density map. An iterative greedy algorithm was launched starting at the
                coordinates of the real dendrite root. At each step, a connection was added from the
                existing tree to one of the unconnected random points according to a cost function
                which kept house of both total amount of wiring and total path length from the root
                to each point <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000251-Cuntz1">[12]</xref>. The number of random points was set to match the
                resulting number of topological points with the original dendrites. Improved
                appearance and overall path distance to the root was achieved by a subsequent
                smoothing step along primary branches (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section). This resulted in artificial dendrites confined to the same
                area as the corresponding <italic>in-vivo</italic> dendrite reconstructions which
                were virtually indistinguishable from their real counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000251-g003">Figure 3A</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000251.s003">Figure S3</xref> for a
                full overview and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000251.s004">Video S1</xref> depicting the constructing process). Interestingly, artificial
                dendrites also yielded quantitatively similar parameter distributions in all cases
                    (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000251-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, compare with
                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000251-g001">Figure 1E–L</xref>). The
                exact same branching rule can therefore account for all individual morphologies
                after constraining the spanning field shape alone.</p>

            <p>Consequently, one could consider that original raw fluorescent images containing a
                labelled neuron would correspond to a distribution of interconnected points within a
                spanning field. Then, if our assumptions about the branching rule are correct, one
                should be able to apply it to obtain the branching model directly from the image
                material. We therefore applied the same greedy algorithm describing our branching
                rule for artificial dendrites on structural points extracted from the raw data via
                image skeletonization. The results of such an attempt are shown at the examples of

            <title>Discussion</title>
            <p>In summary, we claim that all cells analysed here follow the same branching rule, and
                that their morphological identifier is the shape of their dendrite spanning fields.
                This claim is supported by the presented branching statistics, the previously
                proposed branching rule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000251-Cuntz1">[12]</xref> and its reapplication in a heuristic
                reconstruction algorithm. Early approaches to describing and reconstructing dendrite
                branching in general had failed to take into account a major functional constraint
                governing dendrites: their need to reach specific input locations. More recent
                attempts to constructing dendrite morphology in relation to their function and the
                location of their inputs had led to dendrite structures of low complexity and
                accuracy in spite of high computational costs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000251-Stiefel1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000251-Sugimura1">[14]</xref>. However, circuitry
                and connectivity as well as simple wire packing issues are known to be determinants
                of dendrite morphology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000251-Chklovskii1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000251-Shepherd1">[16]</xref>. In addition, the
                specific organization and architecture of many parts of the brain helps to reduce
                wiring costs for the circuitry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000251-Klyachko1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000251-Chklovskii2">[18]</xref>. It is therefore
                not surprising that such constraints can be used to describe dendrite branching in
                LPTCs and other cells. Other planar space-filling cells, the cerebellar Purkinje
                cells, certainly follow a similar rule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000251-Wen1">[19]</xref>. However, the suggested approach is not
                restricted to planar dendrites and future analysis will cover all different neuron
                arborizations to clarify the ubiquity of the suggested branching rule. At the
                example of LPTCs, the usefulness of the approach presented here can be put forward:
                LPTC electrophysiology was studied in great depth e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000251-Haag1">[20]</xref> and precise models,
                so-called compartmental models, including the detailed anatomical structure were
                designed and are continuously being improved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000251-Borst2">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000251-Cuntz3">[24]</xref>.
                Understanding LPTC branching, these constraints can be directly put in relation with
                the optic flow processing occurring within their circuitry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000251-Haag1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000251-Cuntz2">[23]</xref>. Assuming generality of
                principles, even the function of cells, which have not yet been reconstructed, can
                be inferred based on the contours of their dendrites alone. Moreover, the fly is the
                model animal in which the molecular components that determine neural growth are
                currently being unveiled, mainly through genetic tools <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000251-Schmucker1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000251-Parrish1">[26]</xref>. Our
                framework therefore allows a quantitative study of the impact of gene modifications
                far beyond basic statistics. In particular, molecular principles guiding neuronal
                self-avoidance during development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000251-Hughes1">[27]</xref> and others can now be put in relation with the
                branching constraints presented here. Eventually, studying molecular factors shaping
                dendritic spanning fields separately from a specific branching rule within should
                elucidate a fundamental organizational element in the brain, i.e. the
                neuron's branching structure.</p>

                    or VS cells were filled with a fluorescent dye (Alexa 488). Flies were viewed
                    under a custom built two-photon microscope <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000251-Haag4">[29]</xref>, orienting the planar
                    cells as orthogonal as possible in respect to the laser beam to minimize the
                    amount of images in the Z-direction. In order to capture the entire expansion of
                    the cells, 6 to 15 adjacent stacks (210 µm×210 µm
                    area in XY x ∼30 in 2 µm Z-steps) were taken from different
                    XYZ positions with an overlap of about 10 percent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000251.s001">Figure
                    S1A</xref>). The image stacks were then transferred to Matlab (Mathworks,
                    Natick, MA) and all further analysis was performed there in custom written
                    software. Manual fine tuning of the original coordinates from the individual
                    stacks was usually necessary to obtain a precise alignment in three dimensions.
                    Maps of maximum intensity and corresponding depth were computed along the
                    Z-axis. This reduction from 3D-data to two 2D images was sensible as there were
                    no or very few 3D crossings of branches and all cells were planar. Based on
                    these images cylinder models of the branching structure were obtained in a
                    semi-automated way: interactive software allowed switched viewing of either
                    Z-projection or an individual slice of an image stack (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000251.s001">Figure
                    S1B</xref>). The widths of 2D rectangles connecting the end points were fitted
                    by gauss functions to suggest a diameter for the cylinders (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000251.s001">Figure
                    S1D</xref>). Z-values were attributed to each cylinder directly from the
                    depth-map according to their 2D location. Quick tracing results (30 min) were
                    achievable working with maximum Z-projections alone, although slight movements
                    of the living fly compromised the accuracy of the projection image (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000251.s001">Figure
                    S1C</xref>). In order to achieve a higher accuracy, some manual corrections
                    based on individual slices were necessary in all reconstruction steps. Taking
                    advantage of the planar cell morphology allowed quicker reconstructions compared
                    to other approaches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000251-Schmitt1">[30]</xref>: detailed cell models with about 700 to 1600
                    compartments were obtained typically within around 2 hours. Jumps in the Z-axis
                    were smoothed by use of linear interpolation. Internally and externally, the

                <p>For simplification, the resulting generic directed graphs were transformed into

                    manually attributed written to the SWC file. The somata in all cells consisted
                    of a clearly separated bag-like structure that branched from the axon or
                    dendrite. The last branch point (very short branches were ignored) before the
                    soma was chosen to be the end of the dendrite and the beginning of the axon. The
                    dendrite root was set to the primary branching point. Axonal parameters showed
                    no trend to classify the cells (data not shown). There was no obvious
                    correlation between axonal and dendrite length measures. Hence, size
                    normalization of the cells was discarded. Dendrite flattening was performed as a
                    morphometric transform <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000251-Zador1">[33]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000251.s001">Figure S1E</xref>). A distance isoline to any point
                    on the dendrite was drawn at a 25 µm threshold to determine the
                    dendrite spanning fields (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000251.s001">Figure S1F</xref>). This corresponds to performing a
                    morphological dilation on the same points with a 25 µm radius disc.
                    For most statistics, only the branching and termination points
                    ( = topological points) were selected as the
                    carrier points for the topological complexity. A Voronoi segmentation was
                    performed on these points in order to express space-filling density distribution

                    density value therefore describes the area in vicinity of a specific branching

                    the dendrite root and the furthest axon terminal tip to lie on the horizontal
                    line building the axonal axis. In order to obtain a measure for the convexity of
                    dendrites, the convex hull was drawn around all dendrite nodes. The surface
                    ratio between the dendrite spanning field (see above) and this convex hull was

                        automatic diameter approximations. Normalized positions 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75
                        on the midline and 40 half pixels in orthogonal direction were used to
                        construct a sampling grid that covers a branch's thickness (first
                        panel). The average over the resulting sampling matrix was convolved with
                        the first derivative of a Gaussian distribution (little box) to emphasize
                        brightness changes. The diameter was obtained by the distance from the

                        derivative of the convolved signal. (E) Planar dendrites were mapped

                        The artificial dendrites are hard to distinguish from their biological

                        article. Dendrograms were sorted to put heavier trees (with larger
                        sub-trees) on the left side. Although, taken one by one, dendrograms of
                        artificial dendrites would not perfectly reproduce the corresponding partner
                        (since they originated from random distributions of points), a trend of
                        similarity is evident. This particularly illustrates how the differences in
                        branching between HS and VS cells relates to the spanning fields of their
                        dendrites since all artificial dendrites originate from the same branching
                        rule. This is strongly in favour of a common branching rule for all cells.
                        And this common rule is most likely very similar to the one applied to
                        obtain the artificial dendrites.</p>
