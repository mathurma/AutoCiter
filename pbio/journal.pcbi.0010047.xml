However, it is sometimes difficult to discern their causes without a clear understanding of underlying physical mechanisms of thermal stabilization of proteins. For example, it is well-known that hyperthermophiles feature a greater proportion of charged residues, but, surprisingly, the excess of positively charged residues is almost entirely due to lysines but not arginines in the majority of hyperthermophilic genomes. All-atom simulations show that lysines have a much greater number of accessible rotamers than arginines of similar degree of burial in folded states of proteins. This finding suggests that lysines would preferentially entropically stabilize the native state. Indeed, we show in computational experiments that arginine-to-lysine amino acid substitutions result in noticeable stabilization of proteins. We then hypothesize that if evolution uses this physical mechanism as a complement to electrostatic stabilization in its strategies of thermophilic adaptation, then hyperthermostable organisms would have much greater content of lysines in their proteomes than comparably sized and similarly charged arginines. Consistent with that, high-throughput comparative analysis of complete proteomes shows extremely strong bias toward arginine-to-lysine replacement in hyperthermophilic organisms and overall much greater content of lysines than arginines in hyperthermophiles. This finding cannot be explained by genomic GC compositional biases or by the universal trend of amino acid gain and loss in protein evolution. We discovered here a novel entropic mechanism of protein thermostability due to residual dynamics of rotamer isomerization in native state and demonstrated its immediate proteomic implications. Our study provides an example of how analysis of a fundamental physical mechanism of thermostability helps to resolve a puzzle in comparative genomics as to why amino acid compositions of hyperthermophilic proteomes are significantly biased toward lysines but not similarly charged arginines.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Comparative genomics sends us profound signals that are not easy to understand. For example, it is well known that proteins from hyperthermophiles are enriched with charged residues, but it has been a mystery why enrichment in positively charged amino acids is almost entirely due to lysines at the expense of very similar arginines. Here, the authors show that lysines (in contrast to arginines) exhibit significant residual dynamics in folded states of proteins, making the entropic cost to fold lysine-rich proteins less unfavorable compared with arginine-rich ones. Therefore, replacements of arginines by lysines provide additional thermal stabilization of proteins via entropic mechanism, making them positively charged residues of choice for evolutionary optimization of hyperthermostable proteins. Apparently, natural selection uses diverse physical mechanisms of thermal stability to achieve adaptation. This study provides an example of how better understanding of protein physics can help in solving genomic mysteries.</p></sec></abstract><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Citation:</meta-name><meta-value>Berezovsky IN, Chen WW, Choi PJ, Shakhnovich EI (2005) Entropic stabilization of proteins and its proteomic consequences.

The major mechanisms for increasing stability discovered so far vary from introduction of additional chemical bonds (e.g., disulfide bridges) or ion pairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b03">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b06">6</xref>] to increasing either the enthalpic free energy contributions by the optimizing of hydrophobic core interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b07">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b11">11</xref>] or the entropic contributions by varying main-chain degrees of freedom in the unfolded state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b12">12</xref>]. This repertoire of mechanisms relies on a variety of underlying physical principles for increasing protein stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b13">13</xref>]. The diversity of extreme environments and the long evolutionary history of organismal proteomes of extremophiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b15">15</xref>] suggest, in turn, many possible mechanisms of protein stabilization in response to the demands of the environment. Furthermore, the fact that each proteome contains a variety of structures and functions suggests that nature used all, even seemingly negligible, opportunities and their combinations for structure stabilization when adapting to extreme environmental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b15">15</xref>]. Here, we show how side-chain entropy in the native state can provide a mechanism of thermostabilization that is complementary to one of the major mechanisms of thermophilic adaptation, electrostatic interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b04">4</xref>]. The analysis of statistics of rotameric states, together with computational mutation experiments, followed by high-throughput analysis of complete proteomes, reveals a previously unknown mechanism of stabilization via replacement of arginine residues with lysines. This substitution stabilizes the folded state, yet it preserves the charged nature of the substitution position, which may be important for other, perhaps functional, reasons. Thus, possible evolutionary advantages of this mechanism are as follows: (i) avoidance of sterically unfavorable contacts upon substitution, (ii) conservation of the similar-to-the-original (in terms of geometry and size) side-chains, and (iii) preservation of the positive charge and, as a consequence, important electrostatic interactions in the globule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b04">4</xref>]. These subtle advantages exemplify the elegant work of natural selection and hint at the existence of other, yet undiscovered, mechanisms of protein adaptation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Monte Carlo Unfolding Simulations of Hydrolases H from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic></title><p>The Gō model of protein folding is an idealized model in which the favorable interaction contact terms are exactly those found in the native structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b16">16</xref>]. In this model, the physico-chemical details of protein interactions are replaced by a generic contact energy term that is the same for all contacts between atoms that are found in contact in the native structure, though the complexity of the folded backbone and the side-chain conformations are preserved. It has been argued that such a model is a good representation of such aspects of protein energetics and folding, where non-native contacts do not play a massive role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b17">17</xref>]. It remains unclear whether such an idealized model can quantitatively predict absolute folding transition temperatures. However, our results suggest that the Gō model predicts the transition temperature accurately enough to discriminate between proteins of thermophilic and mesophilic origin.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010047-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows the unfolding curves for the pair of meso/thermophilic hydrolase H from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Thermus thermophilus.</italic> The Gō model correctly predicts a slightly higher transition temperature for the protein from thermophilic <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> compared with the one from <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010047-g001">Figure 1</xref>)<italic>.</italic> Remarkably, the two unfolding curves coincide up to the transition, at which point they separate and then recombine at higher temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010047-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Because the native states are enthalpically identical, and the folds are essentially the same, we surmise the origin of the transition temperature difference to be purely entropic. Specifically, given the nature of the Gō model, the entropic differences must arise from the different number of accessible rotamer states in different proteins. Calculation of average number of rotamers per residue in fully unfolded state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b18">18</xref>] gives values of 12.0 and 11.4 for the mesophilic and the thermophilic proteins, respectively. These numbers thus demonstrate that the higher side-chain entropy in the unfolded state of mesophilic hydrolase is partially responsible for the fact that it unfolds at a lower temperature than the thermophilic structure.</p><fig id="pcbi-0010047-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010047.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The Temperature Dependence of the Energy of Unfolding for Hydrolases, from <italic>E. coli</italic> (black rhombuses) and <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> (red squares)</title><p>Every simulation of unfolding started from the native structure and lasted for 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> MC steps; absolute temperature increment is 0.2 and 0.1 in the vicinity of transition temperature.

					</table-wrap-foot> --></table-wrap><p>There is a total of five groups of amino acid residues with the same maximal number of rotamers in unfolded state (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010047-t001">Table 1</xref>): (i) Arg, Lys (maximal number of rotamers is 81); (ii) Glu, Met (27); (iii) Ile, Leu, His, Trp (9); (iv) Asp, Phe, Tyr (6); (v) Cys, Ser, Thr, Val (3). The amino acids lysine and arginine are both positively charged; both contain at least five heavy atoms in their side-chains. Both amino acids have four degrees of freedom in their rotatable bonds. The guanidinium group at the end of arginine displays resonance, and, as a consequence, has no internal rotational freedom. The salient difference between arginine and lysine is the fact that lysine is less bulky. Therefore, in the folded state, lysine may have slightly more freedom. Estimates of solvent accessibility of arginine and lysine do not reveal a substantial difference (unpublished data). As a control comparison, we use the pair isoleucine/leucine (each residue has a maximum of nine rotameric states and is similar to the other's physical and chemical properties).

According to <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010047-t001">Table 1</xref>, lysine and arginine residues have different residual side-chain entropy. Lysine residues have many more rotamers in the folded state than arginine residues: on average, 20.1 and 17.2 versus 3.5 and 5.6 rotamers per residue of a particular type (Lys or Arg) in 1INO and 2PRD, respectively. The control group in this analysis is the pair Leu/Ile, which shows a highly similar temperature dependence of the number of rotamers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010047-g002">Figure 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010047-g002">2</xref>D) for both proteins. Two last pairs, Thr/Ser and Thr/Val, confirm the role of the side-chain size and, as a consequence, its flexibility in providing number of accessible rotameric states. Each of Thr, Ser, and Val has a maximum of three possible rotamers and, thus, can be compared. Although both Thr and Ser are hydrophilic residues, Ser residues have a slightly greater number of rotameric states in the folded structure (at absolute temperature 1 in our temperature units used for MC simulations) as a result of its smaller side-chain. The hydrophilic/hydrophobic pair Thr/Val (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010047-g002">Figure 2</xref>G and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010047-g002">2</xref>H) exhibit very similar behavior, stemming from the similarity of their side-chain geometries. This result is further substantiated by the temperature-dependence data for the pairs Val/Ser and Phe/Tyr.

The similarity of physical and chemical properties makes it possible to adjust stability due to entropic factor by mutating one residue type into another without changing the structure significantly. The first step to verify this mechanism is a statistical study of the difference in number of accessible rotamers for the folded and unfolded states. We analyzed the ratio of the number of rotamers (in natural logarithm units) at absolute temperature T = 4 (completely unfolded state) to that at T = 1 (folded state) for a representative set of 18 protein structures. Our results do not change from protein to protein and, as such, do not depend on the possible biases in the crystallographic quality of individual structures. Since we perform long runs of MC simulations (total of 10<sup>7</sup> steps), which equilibrate our system and sample distinct rotamer states, we eliminate the memory of rotamer states in the original experimental structures.

Though there is a slight increase in the enthalpic term in the modified (R171K) structure of thermophilic hydrolase (3,321 native contacts in the modified structure versus 3,246 in the original, according to the Gō model), and an increase in the number of rotamers in the modified structure, there is no indication of a change in the transition temperature in unfolding simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010047-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). Similar replacements in the structure of mesophilic hydrolase H from <italic>E. coli,</italic> on the other hand, cause a change in the transition temperature of approximately 0.1 in absolute units (2.6%). The increase in the number of native contacts in the modified structure (3,226 in modified versus 3,131 in original) accounts for 3% of the difference in transition temperature; entropic factors do not play a stabilizing role in this case (5.38 and 5.34 rotameric states per residue in original unmutated structures, respectively). We detected an increase in the stability of the structure when all arginine residues (positions 43, 86, 88, and 171) were replaced by lysine residues. Taking into account both the decrease in the enthalpic term in the modified structure (3,083 native contacts versus 3,102 in the original, or approximately 0.6% loss) and the simultaneous increase in the transition temperature by 0.05 of absolute units (gain of 1.3%) gives a total increase of 2% in stability, which we conclude to be an effect of entropy stabilization of the structure. The number of rotamers per residue increases from 5.41 in the original to 5.62 in the mutated structure, a 4% difference, which, taking into account the roughness of the estimate, corroborates an increase in stability.

In the case of (hyper)thermophilic proteins, stabilization should be much stronger and, thus, it requires concerted contribution from many possible mechanisms. For this reason, we intentionally considered only hyperthermophilic proteomes in order to capture the most pronounced sequence biases associated with the extreme thermal stability of hyperthermophilic species. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010047-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0010047-sg002">Figure S2</xref> show sets of composition histograms for two types of residues charged and hydrophilic, respectively, presumably associated with variations in thermal stability. While in thermophilic species the percentage of polar residues is high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b29">29</xref>], this percentage is the same or even smaller in hyperthermophilic organisms (for instance, Glu, Ser, Thr; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0010047-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). In the case of charged residues, we observe clear under-representation of Asp and His and an increase of Glu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010047-g006">Figure 6</xref>) in hyperthermophilic organisms. Increase of the Glu content is usually explained by its longer side-chain, which provides more opportunities for ion interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b31">31</xref>]. It should be noted that increase of Glu at the expense of Asp can be a consequence of higher entropic contribution from Glu compared with Asp.

Thus, the role of the toward Glu deserves separate consideration with careful analysis of both enthalpic and entropic effects. In addition to the earlier-detected increase of total content in the Arg/Lys pair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b30">30</xref>], we found that in ten of the 12 hyperthermophilic genomes lysine content is much higher (not less than 6%), whereas arginine content is distributed evenly mostly between 3% and 6% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010047-g006">Figure 6</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010047-g006">6</xref>B).

The number after the slash reflects the same data for the opposite replacement, e.g., Ile, in the mesophilic sequence by Leu in the hyperthermophilic sequence. The control groups here are the pairs Leu/Ile and Ser/Thr; both residues in each pair are hydrophobic or polar, and both have the same maximal number of possible rotamers, nine and three, respectively. In all alignments of <italic>E. coli</italic> sequences against those from one of the hyperthermophilic genomes, we obtained equal or very similar numbers of residues substitutions (numbers in parenthesis show ratio of forward to back substitutions). The exceptions are pairs LI/IL and RK/KR in <italic>A. pernix,</italic> which show bias in the opposite direction explained by the GC content. Unlike the above control groups, the pairs RK/KR demonstrate a remarkable bias toward replacement of arginine in the mesophilic sequence with lysine in the hyperthermophilic sequence (at least 1.6 times in <italic>P. furiosis,</italic> and up to almost four times in <italic>N. equitans</italic>). <italic>p</italic>-Values (calculated according to χ<sup>2</sup> criteria) show a statistically significant preference for the arginine-to-lysine substitution as opposed to the reverse one.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b34">34</xref>] attempted to find “universal trend of amino acid gain and loss in protein evolution.” They found two major groups of amino acids: Cys, Met, His, Ser, and Phe; and Pro, Ala, Glu, and Gly, that are accrued and consistently lost. Their major conclusion is that, in agreement with earlier developed amino acid chronology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b35">35</xref>], “all amino acids with declining frequencies are thought to be among the first incorporated into genetic code; conversely, all amino acids with increasing frequencies, except Ser, were probably recruited late.” Importantly, amino acid chronology proposed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b34">34</xref>] reflects early stages of protein evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b36">36</xref>], and, technically, it was developed on the basis of codon chronology. The latter started from the GC-rich codons, as first codons are believed to be more thermostable than all repertoire of codons, and corresponding amino acids emerged as result of wobble and transition mutations. Thus, both amino acid chronology and universal trend of amino acid gain and loss in protein evolution demonstrate generic connection between DNA and proteins composition and its evolution. Our findings, however, are of a different nature. Contrary to “universal trend,” which does not discriminate between meso- and (hyper)thermophilic organisms, bias toward Lys residues is a statistically significant trend of hyperthermophilic proteomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010047-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, we discovered here a new mechanism of thermophilic adaptation that happens on the level of amino acid composition and originates from the specific physical chemical features of arginine/lysine residues. Finally, entropic mechanism of stabilization is complementary to generic amino acid chronology, and it demonstrates work of natural selection in order to reach adaptation to extreme environmental condition.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Thermodynamical Models of Protein Stability and the Enthalpy/Entropy Relationship as a Manifestation of a Variety of Stabilizing Factors</title><p>Most of the data on structure thermostability and its major factors come from experiments aimed at analyzing the role of individual contributors, such as hydrophobic, van der Waals, electrostatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b04">4</xref>], and other physical forces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b14">14</xref>].

Second, comparative analysis of hyperthermophilic and mesophilic (here, <italic>E. coli</italic>) proteomes reveals an enrichment of lysine content at the expense of the arginine.</p><p>Though bias in amino acid composition toward increasing charged residues is well documented in earlier works [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b46">46</xref>], the difference in the frequencies of arginine and lysine residues has not been explained unequivocally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b47">47</xref>].</p><p>There is a strong belief that GC content is the major factor in ensuring survival and selective advantages for extremophiles, in particular thermophiles, due to high thermostability of GC pairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b46">46</xref>]. Assuming that this explanation is correct, one would expect (hyper)thermophiles to select arginine over lysine. Arginine is encoded by six codons, four of which (CGU, CGC, CGA, and CGG) are GC-rich, whereas lysine is encoded by two codons (AAA and AAG). Moreover, arginine has a higher charge, which means it forms better salt bridges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b47">47</xref>]. Surprisingly, this expectation is confirmed in only a very few cases, for instance in <italic>A. pernix</italic> and <italic>M. kandlerii</italic>; whereas in the majority of other hyperthermophilic organisms, we observe significant increase in lysine content, which typically anticorrelates with GC content. Furthermore, as we demonstrated here, lysine content partially increases due to direct replacement of arginine residues (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010047-t002">Table 2</xref>), which points out the obvious advantage that lysine residues have over arginine. One could argue that (i) composition effect alone can account for the higher substitution rate of Arg/Lys, or that (ii) there was a particular common ancestor enriched by Lys, and the specific compositional bias in contemporary proteins that we observe is due to phylogeny. But the unfolding simulations, the statistical data on rotameric states, and the genomic evidence all point to the advantage of lysine over arginine when thermostability is important. Furthermore, we see excess of lysine only in hyperthermophilic organisms, regardless of their loci on the phylogenetic tree (e.g., archaea and bacteria). Lysine still has some entropic freedom, even in the folded state of a protein, due to its smaller size. In comparison, arginine, with its bulky guanidinium group, does not have the same freedom, and its possible enthalpic advantage is compensated by the drawback of packing of two closely located charges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b48">48</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Adaptation to High Temperatures as a Complex Effect of Different Types of Interactions</title><p>We discovered here a novel mechanism of structure thermostabilization that relies on side-chain rotamer entropy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b23">23</xref>]. To single out the potential effects of rotamer entropy, we compared pairs of amino acid residues with similar physical and chemical properties and the same maximal number of rotameric states. The difference in the rotamer entropy of each pair of residues must, then, be a result only the difference in the rotameric entropy of their side-chains. Statistical data of accessible rotameric states (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010047-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010047-g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010047-t001">Table 1</xref>) show substantial entropy for lysine residues in both folded and unfolded states, whereas arginine has a significantly decreased side-chain freedom in the folded state. Preference for the lysine is also supported by the genomic data (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010047-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010047-t002">Table 2</xref>) and illustrated by the computational mutation experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010047-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010047-g005">5</xref>).</p><p>In general, just a few mutations can make the difference between a mesophilic protein and its (hyper)thermophilic counterpart. Stability is reached by fine-tuning sequences and structures, rather than by drastic rearrangement. Moreover, in the case of hyperthermophilic proteins, practically all possible means of stabilization appear to be utilized. Any additional element of stabilization must both preserve the already-achieved level of stability and provide additional stabilization by invoking only minor modifications in sequence and structure. Arg/Lys replacement satisfies both of these conditions and, thus, exemplifies using the entropic contribution while simultaneously preserving the charged nature of the residues, which is important for other mechanisms of stabilization, such as the electrostatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b50">50</xref>]. Indeed, as it has been thoroughly demonstrated elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b04">4</xref>], electrostatics is one of the major factors of thermostability. The entropic mechanism discovered in this work serves as an important complementary factor that provides additional stabilization when the repertoire of other mechanisms has already been possibly exhausted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b05">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b06">6</xref>].</p><p>The novel mechanism of thermal stabilization reported here is unique in that it relies not only on the physical and chemical properties of a residue, but also on its dynamics in folded state affecting its entropic contribution. And because the effect is small, it can be revealed only in careful simulations and genomic comparisons. The important pedagogical point we draw from this result is that the study of protein stability on individual proteins using current state-of-the-art energy functions may result in missing subtle thermodynamic evolutionary signals that only become apparent in high-throughput analysis of proteomes and genomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Statistics of rotameric states.</title><p>The number of accessible rotamers in the folded (T = 1) and fully unfolded (T = 4, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010047-g001">Figure 1</xref>) states for a representative set of proteins was calculated.

A generalized-Born solvation energy function (GBorn) and a dielectric constant with linear distance-dependence were used for dynamics. The residue of interest, and all atoms within a 5-angstrom radius of any atom in that residue, were permitted to move with CHARMM degrees of freedom to ensure that the mutated residue could repack locally. The dynamics simulation was initially constrained to the native state using a harmonic potential. The artificial harmonic constraint was reduced to zero slowly over consecutive cycles of adopted-basis Newton-Raphson minimization. To detect the effects of mutation, we minimized both mutated and original structures with the same protocol in order to use the latter one as a control.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Unfolding Monte Carlo simulations of modified proteins.</title><p>Unfolding simulations were performed using an all-atom Gō model developed earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010047-b53">53</xref>].
