<abstract>
<p>Distinct transcriptional states are maintained through organization of chromatin, resulting from the sum of numerous repressive and active histone modifications, into tightly packaged heterochromatin versus more accessible euchromatin. Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is the main mammalian complex responsible for histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and is integral to chromatin organization. Using <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, we show that deletion of <italic>Suz12</italic>, a core component of all PRC2 complexes, results in loss of H3K27me3 and H3K27 dimethylation (H3K27me2), completely blocks normal mammary gland development, and profoundly curtails progenitor activity in 3D organoid cultures. Through the application of mammary organoids to bypass the severe phenotype associated with <italic>Suz12</italic> loss <italic>in vivo</italic>, we have explored gene expression and chromatin structure in wild-type and <italic>Suz12</italic>-deleted basal-derived organoids. Analysis of organoids led to the identification of lineage-specific changes in gene expression and chromatin structure, inferring cell type–specific PRC2-mediated gene silencing of the chromatin state. These expression changes were accompanied by cell cycle arrest but not lineage infidelity. Together, these data indicate that canonical PRC2 function is essential for development of the mammary gland through the repression of alternate transcription programs and maintenance of chromatin states.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The formation of mammary glands requires the tight regulation of many genes that govern cell fate decisions in the cells that form them. However, most of these genes remain undefined. The Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) has a role in gene silencing, and it is comprised of several subunits, which include either Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2) or Ezh1 in combination with Suppressor of Zeste 12 protein homolog (Suz12) and embryonic ectoderm development (EED). Dysregulation of these subunits can lead to breast cancer. Although previous studies have analyzed the contribution of these complexes in mammary epithelium, failure to inactivate all canonical PRC2 complexes has made this task difficult. Deletion of <italic>Suz12</italic> resulted in nonfunctional PRC2 and led to growth defects in mammary epithelial cells in vivo and in vitro. Here, we have used a 3D mammary organoid system to circumvent the lethality associated with <italic>Suz12</italic> loss and studied chromatin dynamics and gene expression of PRC2 complexes. Our results suggest that loss of all canonical PRC2 complexes results in failure to repress transcriptional programs associated with early commitment and differentiation of mammary epithelial cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A central question in biology is how different cell types maintain distinct cell fates despite containing the same genetic material. Organization of DNA into open or closed chromatin states by posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of histones has emerged as a critical mechanism underpinning cell diversity and reflecting lineage-specific gene expression, developmental programs, or disease processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref001">1</xref>]. The highly conserved Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which catalyzes trimethylation of histone 3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me3), is associated with global gene repression and suppression of alternative differentiation programs. The canonical PRC2 complex is composed of the intimately associated core proteins histone methyltransferase Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2) or an alternative related subunit Ezh1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref002">2</xref>], embryonic ectoderm development (Eed), Suppressor of Zeste 12 protein homolog (Suz12), and histone-binding protein accessory proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref003">3</xref>]. Upon recruitment of PRC2 to chromatin, Ezh2/Ezh1 deposits the H3K27me3 mark associated with chromatin compaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref003">3</xref>]. PRC2 is required for deposition of H3K27me3 and for maintenance of this PTM upon cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref004">4</xref>]. Additionally, the requirement of PRC2 activity for H3K27 mono- and dimethylation (H3K27me1 and H3K27me2) remains unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref005">5</xref>]. Early studies showed that both Suz12 and Eed are nonredundant and essential for a functional PRC2 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref006">6</xref>]. Deletion of <italic>Suz12</italic> or <italic>Eed</italic> resulted in elevated expression of Hox genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian cells and marked increases in gene networks that control developmental lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref008">8</xref>] because of loss of PRC2 integrity and H3K27me3-mediated repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref009">9</xref>]. In contrast to Eed and Suz12, Ezh2 function can be compensated, partially [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref010">10</xref>] or completely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref011">11</xref>], by Ezh1. Nevertheless, like mice lacking <italic>Suz12</italic> or <italic>Eed</italic>, <italic>Ezh2</italic>-deficient mice are not viable and die during early implantation stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Members of PRC2—in particular, Ezh2—are often found dysregulated in human cancers. In breast cancer, Ezh2 overexpression is associated with aggressive breast cancers and poor prognosis and inversely correlated with H3K27me3 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref012">12</xref>]. It remains unclear whether Ezh2 overexpression is a consequence or cause of breast oncogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref013">13</xref>]. High levels of Ezh2 may not be sufficient to induce mammary tumors in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref014">14</xref>], suggesting additional driver mutations are required. To further understand the basis of this dysregulation in cancer, it is imperative to determine the normal functions of PRC2 and Ezh2 in maintaining gene expression programs in the mammary gland.</p>
<p>The mammary gland in both humans and mice is a bilayered structure composed of two cellular lineages: an inner luminal layer and an outer myoepithelial layer that contacts the basement membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref015">15</xref>]. There is increasing evidence for a differentiation hierarchy composed of stem cells, committed progenitors, and mature epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref015">15</xref>]. In the steady state, mouse mammary stem cell (MaSC)/basal, luminal progenitor, and mature luminal cell subsets display distinct patterns of H3K27me3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref016">16</xref>]. The MaSC/basal subset demonstrates the lowest levels of H3K27me3. Higher levels of H3K27me3 correlate with reduced gene expression and increase upon cell specialization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref016">16</xref>]. These data support a model whereby mammary epithelial cell (MEC) differentiation requires narrowing of transcriptional programs and suppression of alternate cell fates. Accordingly, genetic ablation or knock-down of <italic>Ezh2</italic> in the mammary gland resulted in a developmental delay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref017">17</xref>] but did not entirely prevent mammary gland development. This is likely due to residual H3K27 methylation, presumably established through compensatory methyltransferase activity of Ezh1. It is therefore probable that studies to date have underestimated the importance of PRC2 in directing mammary cell fate.</p>
<p>To reexamine the contribution of the canonical PRC2 complex to mammary gland development, we deleted <italic>Suz12</italic> in vivo and in mammary organoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref018">18</xref>]. Here, we show a nonredundant function for <italic>Suz12</italic> in mammary progenitor cells due to loss of PRC2 function. Similar findings were made upon deletion of <italic>Eed</italic>. Through the application of assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) to probe chromatin accessibility in <italic>Suz12</italic>-deficient organoid cultures, we have identified regions of PRC2-dependent chromatin compaction and consequent changes in gene expression. Interestingly, the chromatin state in basal-derived organoids was reliant on PRC2 function, and <italic>Suz12</italic> deletion led to gene de-repression, thus highlighting a crucial role for PRC2 in the maintenance of chromatin states within the mammary epithelial hierarchy.</p>

<title><italic>Suz12</italic> or <italic>Eed</italic> deletion results in marked delay of mammary ductal outgrowth and perinatal lethality</title>
<p>Mammary gland development proceeds through distinct phases that include puberty and cycles of pregnancy, lactation, and involution. Suz12 expression, like Ezh2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref017">17</xref>], was detected at all stages of mammary gland development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004986.s001">S1A Fig</xref>) but was particularly high during puberty (4–6 week old mice). To examine the role of Suz12 in the mammary gland, we crossed mice bearing floxed <italic>Suz12</italic> alleles with Cre transgenic mice that express Cre under control of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter (MMTVcre). Genotyping of offspring revealed that two-thirds of MMTVcre<sup>T/+</sup>Suz12<sup>fl/f</sup> mice did not survive to weaning (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004986.s008">S1 Data</xref>), and examination of newborn pups revealed abnormal lung development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004986.s001">S1B Fig</xref>), likely due to activity of MMTVcre in this tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref019">19</xref>], and consistent with the reported role for PRC2/Ezh2 in lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>MMTVcre<sup>T/+</sup>Suz12<sup>f/f</sup> mice that survived beyond birth appeared normal and did not differ from wild-type (Wt) mice with respect to bodyweight (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004986.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). Examination of whole mounts and histological sections of mammary glands from MMTVcre<sup>T/+</sup>Suz12<sup>f/f</sup> mice during puberty revealed a heterogeneous phenotype. Some glands were indistinguishable from Wt or heterozygous littermates, while others comprised a small ductal tree, characteristic of the rudimentary ductal tree found in newborn mice (<italic>n</italic> = 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004986.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004986.s001">S1D Fig</xref>). These small but otherwise normal mammary glands indicate that gene deletion leads to severe impairment of ductal growth during puberty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref022">22</xref>]. Notably, <italic>Suz12</italic> mRNA expression in MMTVcre<sup>T/+</sup>Suz12<sup>f/f</sup> and MMTVcre<sup>T/+</sup>Suz12<sup>f/+</sup> glands was found to be comparable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004986.s001">S1E Fig</xref>), demonstrating that these ductal structures were derived from epithelial cells in which <italic>Suz12</italic> had not been deleted. Moreover, protein expression of Ezh2, Suz12, and H3K27me3 was retained in sections from 5–6 week old MMTVcre<sup>T/+</sup>Suz12<sup>f/f</sup> mammary glands, indicative of strong selection against <italic>Suz12</italic>-deleted cells and retention of a functional PRC2 complex in the mammary epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004986.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Cell fate was also retained as assessed by immunostaining for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and forkhead box A1 (Foxa1) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004986.s001">S1F Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>We next determined whether deletion of the second core subunit of canonical PRC2 member <italic>Eed</italic> produced a similar phenotype to deletion of <italic>Suz12</italic>. As seen with <italic>Suz12</italic> deletion, conditional deletion of <italic>Eed</italic> with MMTVcre resulted in perinatal lethality of mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004986.s008">S1 Data</xref>), and surviving mice appeared normal, except for a pronounced absence or delay in growth of the ductal tree (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004986.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). Similar to <italic>Suz12</italic> deletion, <italic>Eed</italic> mRNA expression was found to be indistinguishable between mammary epithelium from MMTVcre<sup>T/+</sup>Eed<sup>f/f</sup> and Wt mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004986.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). In addition, Eed, Ezh2, and H3K27me3 proteins were detected by immunofluorescence (IF) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) at comparable levels to those in Wt mammary glands (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004986.s002">S2C and S2D Fig</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that canonical PRC2 complexes are critical for the proliferation and/or survival of MECs, and cells deleted for PRC2 function cannot contribute to the developing mammary gland.</p>

<title>Suz12 is required for the integrity of PRC2 and histone H3K27me2/me3 in MECs</title>
<p>To investigate which MEC subsets were affected by Suz12 loss, we acutely deleted <italic>Suz12</italic> using the inducible and conditional Rosa26-creERT2 (R26creERT2) mouse model. R26creERT2<sup>KI/+</sup>Suz12<sup>f/f</sup> mice injected with tamoxifen die within 2 weeks because of hematopoietic failure (personal communication, S. Lee to E. Michalak), thus precluding the use of this model for in vivo studies. Basal/MaSC-enriched (basal, CD29<sup>hi</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup>), committed luminal progenitor (CD29<sup>lo</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup>), and mature luminal (CD29<sup>lo</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>−</sup>) cell subsets were sorted from R26creERT2<sup>KI/+</sup>Suz12<sup>f/f</sup> and control mice and subjected to in vitro colony-forming assays to determine the effect of <italic>Suz12</italic> deletion on the activity of mammary progenitor cells following induction by 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT). Consistent with expression of Suz12 in all mammary epithelial subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004986.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), we observed fewer colonies in 2D colony forming assays on irradiated feeder cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004986.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) upon induction of <italic>Suz12</italic> deletion. In contrast to the hematopoietic system, in which loss of one allele of <italic>Suz12</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref014">14</xref>] or <italic>Eed</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref023">23</xref>] enhances the activity of stem cells, deletion of one <italic>Suz12</italic> allele did not affect the clonogenic activity of progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004986.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Unsorted MECs efficiently deleted <italic>Suz12</italic> and yielded sufficient protein for western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004986.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). As expected, Ezh2 protein was completely lost upon <italic>Suz12</italic> deletion, while <italic>Ezh2</italic> mRNA levels were not reduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004986.s003">S3A Fig</xref>), suggesting rapid Ezh2 protein degradation leads to the absence of functional PRC2 upon <italic>Suz12</italic> deletion. This is supported by the loss of H3K27me2 and H3K27me3 that accompanies <italic>Suz12</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004986.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Conversely, expression of the active H3K27me1 mark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref004">4</xref>] did not change. No change in cleaved poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) was detected, suggesting that <italic>Suz12</italic>-deleted MECs do not undergo appreciable apoptosis. However, we observed increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase p16 and p19 alternate reading frame (p19Arf), consistent with a known role for Ezh2/PRC2 in regulating <italic>cdkn2a</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004986.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). These data suggest that Suz12 exerts an essential function in the mammary gland through maintenance of functional tri- as well as dimethylation of target loci.</p>

<title><italic>Suz12</italic> deletion diminishes mammary organoid proliferation</title>
<p>To develop a system more amenable to molecular studies, we employed a 3D mammary organoid system, in which organoids grown from single cells in defined medium recapitulate many features of mammary tissue architecture and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref018">18</xref>]. Single basal or luminal progenitor cells sorted from R26creERT2<sup>KI/+</sup>Suz12<sup>f/f</sup> mice were plated, and deletion of <italic>Suz12</italic> was induced by addition of 4OHT on day 1. <italic>Suz12</italic> loss resulted in diminished numbers and smaller basal- and luminal progenitor–derived organoids over a 2 week culture period. Notably, PCR analysis of the resulting organoids revealed that selection against cre-mediated excision of both floxed alleles of <italic>Suz12</italic> had occurred (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004986.s003">S3C Fig</xref>). To circumvent this issue, small organoids were allowed to form before induction of deletion. Indeed, addition of 4OHT on day 4 resulted in smaller cystic-like organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004986.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>) composed of <italic>Suz12</italic>-deleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004986.g003">Fig 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004986.s003">S3D and S3E Fig</xref>) that had markedly reduced levels of H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004986.s003">S3E Fig</xref>). There were no notable differences in cleaved caspase 3 (CC3) in 2 week old <italic>Suz12</italic>-deleted organoids, but rather, a striking decrease in proliferative (Ki67<sup>+</sup>) cells was evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004986.g003">Fig 3D</xref>).

<p>To determine potential target genes that are dependent on Suz12 and therefore canonical PRC2 function, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of <italic>Suz12</italic> Wt or <italic>Suz12</italic>-deleted basal- and luminal-derived mammary organoids grown from R26creERT2<sup>KI/+</sup>Suz12<sup>f/f</sup> mice. <italic>Suz12</italic> was significantly down-regulated in both populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004986.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004986.s004">S4A Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004986.s009">S2 Data</xref>), and deletion of exon 5 was confirmed at the targeted locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004986.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). In both basal- and luminal-derived organoids, the majority (&gt;86%) of differentially expressed (DE) genes were up-regulated rather than down-regulated upon <italic>Suz12</italic> deletion, consistent with the repressive role of PRC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004986.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004986.s004">S4A and S4C Fig</xref>).

<p>To explore whether the changes in gene expression accompanying loss of <italic>Suz12</italic> reflect alterations in chromatin compaction associated with loss of repressive H3K27me2/me3 marks, we performed global mapping of chromatin accessibility using ATAC-seq. Differential accessibility analysis identified 2,767 windows, of which 2,415 (87.3%) were more accessible upon <italic>Suz12</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004986.g004">Fig 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004986.s010">S3 Data</xref>). Further, 1,377 of these windows overlapped with the transcription start site or gene body of 766 independent genes in <italic>Suz12</italic>-deleted basal organoids (referred to as differentially accessible [DA] genes from hereon). Nevertheless, the frequency of reads mapping to nucleosome-free regions versus mononucleosomes was not significantly altered. We observed only minor changes to insert length, suggesting no gross changes in nucleosome occupancy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004986.s005">S5A and S5B Fig</xref>), and a comparison of GC enrichment indicated a minor increased frequency of highly GC-rich regions, usually found at regulatory elements within promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004986.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Moreover, model-based analysis of ChIP-seq (MACS) peaks analysis showed a small number of unique peaks upon <italic>Suz12</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004986.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Next, we compared the DA windows identified by ATAC-seq with gene expression from their associated gene to determine if changes in chromatin compaction elicited by <italic>Suz12</italic> deletion were sufficient to induce changes in gene transcription. A strong correlation was evident between open chromatin and transcriptional up-regulation in <italic>Suz12</italic>-deleted basal-derived organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004986.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). However, analysis of Wt organoids did not reveal a correlation between genes assigned from ATAC-seq analysis and changes in their expression. Almost one-third (28%) of genes that became more accessible upon <italic>Suz12</italic> deletion were significantly up-regulated by RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004986.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). These 218 common genes included <italic>Cdkn2a</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004986.s006">S6A Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004986.s011">S4 Data</xref>), a known target of Ezh2-mediated repression that encodes p16 and p19Arf, and transcription factors (TFs) involved in diverse lineage commitment, including <italic>Foxd1</italic> and homeobox TFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004986.s006">S6B and S6C Fig</xref>), and accordingly, represented sequence-specific DNA-binding GO terms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004986.s012">S5 Data</xref>). Notably, confocal imaging of organoids confirmed the persistence of basal and luminal cells in <italic>Suz12</italic>-deleted organoids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004986.s006">S6D Fig</xref>), suggesting lineage fidelity was maintained.</p>

These longer fragments were enriched in promoter-flanking and transcribed regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref024">24</xref>] consistent with increased expression of DE genes. Despite detecting many unique DA peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004986.s007">S7C Fig</xref>), particularly associated with promoters and intragenic/gene bodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004986.s007">S7D Fig</xref>), the corresponding windows were less strongly associated with DE genes found by RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004986.s007">S7E and S7F Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Comparison of the <italic>Suz12</italic>-deleted gene expression signatures derived for both basal and luminal organoids showed that they were most similar to claudin-low and normal-like breast tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004986.s007">S7G Fig</xref>), similar to that observed for the basal/MaSC cell signature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref025">25</xref>]. Likewise, the gene expression profile of <italic>Ezh2</italic>-deleted MECs was most concordant with claudin-low breast tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref016">16</xref>]. The striking similarity between gene expression signatures of organoids lacking key PRC2 complex genes and claudin-low breast tumors—which exhibit a metaplastic, clinically aggressive phenotype in patients—suggests that PRC2 may play a role in tumor phenotype and behavior.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using in vivo and in vitro studies, we show that deletion of a core component (either Suz12 or Eed) of the canonical PRC2 complexes leads to a complete block in mammary gland development in vivo and markedly curtails progenitor cell activity in vitro. Strikingly, <italic>Suz12-</italic> or <italic>Eed</italic>-deleted cells were strongly selected against and could not contribute to the developing mammary gland. This resulted in very small glands consisting of Wt cells. These findings are consistent with previous reports for nonredundant genes that are required for stem cell function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref026">26</xref>]. Assays using primary MECs and organoids suggest that this is due in part to de-repression of <italic>cdkn2a</italic>, resulting in increased p16 and p19 expression and reduced proliferation owing to cell cycle arrest. Thus, previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref017">17</xref>] have underestimated the importance of PRC2 in governing mammary progenitor activity and differentiation, owing to some functional redundancy between Ezh1 and Ezh2. Moreover, these results are consistent with PRC2 promoting mammary epithelial expansion, rather than inhibiting it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref027">27</xref>]. By exploiting mammary organoids to bypass the severe developmental phenotype associated with loss of Suz12, we examined changes in chromatin structure in the presence and absence of PRC2 and correlated these with gene expression changes.</p>
<p>PRC2 complexes are reported to colocalize with H3K27me3 on the promoters of around 10% of all genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref005">5</xref>]. Upon <italic>Suz12</italic> deletion, we observed comparable changes in gene expression (7%–11%) in both basal- and luminal-derived organoids. There was significant overlap between the up-regulated genes in basal- and luminal-derived organoids, and the magnitude of change was highly correlated. Assessment of chromatin accessibility with ATAC-seq indicated that the chromatin of basal-derived organoids is more open upon Suz12 loss. Recent findings in human breast epithelial subsets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref028">28</xref>] predict that bivalent promoters and primed enhancers would be the most affected by loss of H3K27me3 in <italic>Suz12</italic>-deleted basal-derived organoids. Since we did not observe a significant increase in GC content of DA reads identified by ATAC-seq, the mechanism is most likely to involve enhancers. Coupling RNA-seq with ATAC-seq analysis in basal-derived organoids revealed that deletion of <italic>Suz12</italic> led to more than one quarter of genes becoming significantly transcriptionally active coincident with more accessible chromatin. We have previously shown that the MaSC/basal subset demonstrates the lowest levels of H3K27me3 across transcriptional start sites (TSSs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref016">16</xref>] while also producing slightly less RNA overall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref029">29</xref>]. This observation supports the notion that this gene subset marked by H3K27me3 is transcriptionally regulated through H3K27me3-mediated repression accompanied by chromatin compaction and is dependent on canonical PRC2 function. Our results indicate that open chromatin is a good predictor of gene activation in basal-derived organoids. In the luminal compartment, there is an increased level of H3K27me3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref016">16</xref>], while these cells are more transcriptionally active overall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref029">29</xref>]. In luminal-derived organoids, loss of PRC2 resulted in increased chromatin accessibility and an increase in reads mapping to regions with high GC content. In contrast to basal-derived organoids, the low correlation with gene expression in luminal-derived organoids suggests that additional mechanisms beyond chromatin accessibility serve to ensure proper gene repression. This may be due to DNA methylation or the combination of additional activating and repressive histone marks that maintain gene repression in this more committed cell type, as observed for human luminal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref028">28</xref>].</p>
<p>Our studies indicate that PRC2 is responsible for both H3K27me3 and H3K27me2 marks in MECs, as evidenced by their loss in <italic>Suz12</italic>-deleted cells. Notably, we show here that the absence of these repressive marks through deletion of a single protein results in large changes in gene expression, consistent with the notion that chromatin states are the sum of a limited repertoire of PTM combinations on histone tails. While these data do not exclude noncanonical functions in the presence of a functional PRC2 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref030">30</xref>], they suggest that Suz12 is a limiting factor for expression of Ezh2 protein and thus a functional PRC2 complex in the mammary epithelium.</p>
<p>In the context of breast cancer, our data indicate that <italic>Suz12</italic>-deleted organoids, like <italic>Ezh2</italic>-null basal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref016">16</xref>], displayed similarities with signatures of claudin-low breast cancers, which are thought to arise from MaSCs. While Ezh2 up-regulation was initially associated with aggressive breast cancers, several studies now indicate that Ezh2 overexpression may be a consequence rather than a cause of breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref013">13</xref>]. Indeed, deletion of Ezh2 accelerated tumors in a mouse model of <italic>Brca1</italic>-deleted breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref031">31</xref>] and in a breast cancer model of Notch activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref013">13</xref>]. Additionally, the status of the <italic>cdkn2a</italic> locus of an individual tumor might predict its response to Ezh2 loss. The observation that Suz12 deficiency in normal mammary cells leads to de-repression of <italic>cdkn2a</italic>, paralleling that seen with loss of Ezh2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref032">32</xref>], would predict that loss of PRC2 function in breast cancer would result in decreased tumor proliferation via up-regulation of p16<sup>Ink4a</sup> and p14Arf expression. However, if this locus is perturbed, as is seen in many breast cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref033">33</xref>], then loss of Ezh2 might have quite different consequences. Further work will be required to determine if loss rather than overexpression of PRC2 contributes to tumor progression in other cellular contexts.</p>
<p>In summary, our findings establish an essential role for PRC2 in the maintenance of mammary progenitor function and point to a critical function for PRC2 in maintaining chromatin states to ensure appropriate gene expression in MECs.</p>
