<p>This study describes, for the first time, the rhythmic translational program within circadian clock cells. The results indicate that most clock cell mRNAs are translated at low-energy times of either mid-day or mid-night, and also that related cellular functions are coordinately regulated by the synchronized translation of relevant mRNAs at the same time of day.</p>

<abstract><title>Abstract</title>
<p>Genome-wide studies of circadian transcription or mRNA translation have been hindered by the presence of heterogeneous cell populations in complex tissues such as the nervous system. We describe here the use of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell-specific translational profiling approach to document the rhythmic “translatome” of neural clock cells for the first time in any organism. Unexpectedly, translation of most clock-regulated transcripts—as assayed by mRNA ribosome association—occurs at one of two predominant circadian phases, midday or mid-night, times of behavioral quiescence; mRNAs encoding similar cellular functions are translated at the same time of day. Our analysis also indicates that fundamental cellular processes—metabolism, energy production, redox state (e.g., the thioredoxin system), cell growth, signaling and others—are rhythmically modulated within clock cells via synchronized protein synthesis. Our approach is validated by the identification of mRNAs known to exhibit circadian changes in abundance and the discovery of hundreds of novel mRNAs that show translational rhythms. This includes <italic>Tdc</italic>2, encoding a neurotransmitter synthetic enzyme, which we demonstrate is required within clock neurons for normal circadian locomotor activity.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The circadian clock controls daily rhythms in physiology and behavior via mechanisms that regulate gene expression. While numerous studies have examined the clock regulation of gene transcription and documented rhythms in mRNA abundance, less is known about how circadian changes in protein synthesis contribute to the orchestration of physiological and behavioral programs. Here we have monitored mRNA ribosomal association (as a proxy for translation) to globally examine the circadian timing of protein synthesis specifically within clock cells of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The results reveal, for the first time in any organism, the complete circadian program of protein synthesis (the “circadian translatome”) within these cells. A novel finding is that most mRNAs within clock cells are translated at one of two predominant circadian phases—midday or mid-night—times of low energy expenditure. Our work also finds that many clock cell processes, including metabolism, redox state, signaling, neurotransmission, and even protein synthesis itself, are coordinately regulated such that mRNAs required for similar cellular functions are translated in synchrony at the same time of day.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Genetic studies carried out in several model systems have provided seminal knowledge about the biochemistry of the circadian molecular oscillator and the neural circuitry regulating circadian behavior. The best characterized circadian oscillators consist of transcriptional/translational feedback loops (TTFLs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-van1">[1]</xref>, although nontranscriptional oscillators (NTOs) exist in organisms ranging from unicellulars to <italic>Drosophila</italic> and humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-ONeill1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-ONeill2">[4]</xref>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals, a well-characterized TTFL oscillator consisting of several canonical clock genes regulates circadian behavioral rhythms (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-van1">[1]</xref>). Similarly, transcription of many (perhaps most) genes is orchestrated by the circadian clock, based on gene profiling studies carried out in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mammals and plants. Only a few studies, however, have documented cell-type–specific transcriptional rhythms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Nagoshi1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Miller1">[7]</xref>, due to methodological limitations. Most of those studies utilized Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS), the manual isolation of identified cells, or cell-specific transcriptional profiling techniques, but such methods are either not applicable to all cell populations or lack the sensitivity to detect the entire transcriptome; nor do they distinguish between ribosome-bound (i.e., translating) and soluble mRNA without the use of polyribosome isolation.</p>
<p>Drosophila is an excellent model for cell-type–specific profiling of clock cells because of its outstanding genetics and well-characterized circadian system. Studies have described the fly circadian molecular oscillator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Benito1">[8]</xref> and the circadian neuronal circuitry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Nitabach1">[9]</xref>, revealing molecular and functional differences among groups of pacemaker neurons that mediate morning and evening bouts of activity or responses of the clock to environmental cues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Nagoshi1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-KulaEversole1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Miyasako1">[18]</xref>. To date, no study has documented genome-wide expression profiles for all clock cells of the fly head or the complete translatome of such cells. In this study, we describe use of the Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Heiman1">[19]</xref> to define the rhythmic translatome of circadian clock cells. Our results reveal a daily synchronization of protein synthesis and identify novel cycling mRNAs within clock cells that are required for diverse physiological processes.</p>

<title>Implementation of TRAP for Studies of Circadian Biology</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that TRAP reflects the translational status of mRNAs in a manner similar to that of conventional polyribosomal analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Heiman1">[19]</xref>. In addition, a recent study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> indicates that an EGFP-L10a fusion incorporates into polysomes and can be employed for cell-specific translational profiling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Thomas1">[20]</xref>. To employ TRAP in our studies, we generated <italic>Drosophila</italic> strains carrying a <italic>UAS-EGFP-L10a</italic> transgene insertion (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Materials and Methods</xref>). Using a pan-neuronal driver (<italic>elav-Gal4</italic>), we found that the EGFP-L10a fusion has a cytoplasmic/nucleolar pattern of localization in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001703-g001">Figure 1A–C</xref>), consistent with incorporation into ribosomes. Indeed, the ring shape pattern in nucleoli (seen in the nucleus of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001703-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) likely results from expression in the Granular Component (GC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001703-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), a structure within which ribosomal proteins assemble into functional ribosomes. As expected, EGFP-L10a was localized in all neurons of the adult nervous system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001703-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>tim-uas-Gal4</italic> driver results in expression within the cytoplasm of clock neurons and glia of the nervous system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001703-g001">Figure 1F</xref>) or only clock neurons when combined with <italic>repo-Gal80</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001703-g001">Figure 1G</xref>), which inhibits expression in all glial cells. A different GFP–<italic>Drosophila</italic> ribosomal protein fusion (L11) has an identical intracellular localization pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Rosby1">[21]</xref>. In addition, it has recently been shown that our EGFP-L10a fusion localizes to branch points of neuronal dendrites, consistent with incorporation into ribosomes that mediate local protein synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Hill1">[22]</xref>. Collectively, these pieces of evidence indicate that EGFP-L10a incorporates into functional ribosomes.</p>

<p>We examined circadian locomotor activity of flies overexpressing the <italic>UAS-EGFP-L10a</italic> transgene in clock cells (Pigment Dispersing Factor, PDF, or Timeless, TIM) to determine whether there were adverse effects on behavior. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001703-g001">Figure 1H</xref>, these files have normal behavioral rhythmicity, indicating that EGFP-L10a does not act in a dominant negative manner even at high levels [Average periods (P) and Rhythmicity Indices (RI) were 23.7±0.08/0.57±0.02, 24.0±0.03/0.55±0.01, and 24.3±0.14/0.50±0.03 for control, <italic>pdf-Gal4&gt;UAS-EGFP-L10a</italic>, and <italic>tim-uas-Gal4&gt;UAS-EGFP-L10a</italic> flies; <italic>n</italic> = 17–30]. Thus, the presence of GFP-tagged ribosomes in clock cells does not affect their function.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3b">
<title>TRAP Can Detect Changes in Translational Status</title>
<p>We optimized TRAP methods for use with <italic>Drosophila</italic> and demonstrated that significant amounts of RNA could be immunoprecipitated from head tissues of flies expressing <italic>UAS-EGFP-L10a</italic> under control of the pan-neural <italic>elav-Gal4</italic> or clock cell <italic>tim-uas-Gal4</italic> driver (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Materials and Methods</xref>). Prior to pursuing genome-wide studies, we wished to determine if our <italic>Drosophila</italic> TRAP methods could detect <italic>bona fide</italic> changes in translational status. To ask this question, we employed overexpression of Iron Regulatory Protein (IRP), which is known to repress translation of an unspliced form of ferritin (<italic>fer</italic>) mRNA by inhibiting binding of the small ribosomal subunit to the message. We generated <italic>act5C-Gal4/tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup>, UAS-EGFP-L10a/UAS-IRP</italic> flies in order to be able to activate expression of the TRAP and IRP transgenes conditionally during larval development (by raising temperature to inactivate Gal80<sup>ts</sup>, an inhibitor of Gal4). Larvae of this genotype and controls (<italic>act5C-Gal4/tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup>; UAS-EGFP-L10a</italic>) were exposed to 30°C to activate expression of <italic>UAS-EGFP-L10a</italic> in both genotypes and additionally <italic>UAS-IRP</italic> in the experimental class. Early pupae were collected for both genotypes and subjected to TRAP coupled with Q-RT-PCR to quantify ribosome-associated <italic>fer</italic> mRNA (relative to control <italic>Rp49</italic> mRNA). Similar to previous studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that employed polysome gradient analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Surdej1">[23]</xref>, we observed IRP-induced translational repression of an unspliced but not a spliced form of <italic>fer</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001703-g001">Figure 1I</xref>). Indeed, translation of spliced <italic>fer</italic> was enhanced slightly by IRP overexpression, similar to that observed from the analysis of a high molecular weight polysome fraction in the previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Surdej1">[23]</xref>. This result shows feasibility for the use of TRAP in <italic>Drosophila</italic> to detect changes in translational status.</p>
<p>To determine if our methods were able to detect rhythmic changes in the ribosomal association of cycling transcripts, we examined the <italic>period (per)</italic> and <italic>timeless (tim)</italic> clock mRNAs. TRAP methods were employed to immunopurify RNA from head tissues of <italic>elav-Gal4/UAS-EGFP-L10a</italic> flies two times of day (ZT11 and ZT23, the times of high and low <italic>per/tim</italic> RNA abundance, respectively). Extracted RNA was then subjected to Q-RT-PCR, using gene-specific primers, to detect the clock mRNAs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001703-g001">Figure 1J</xref> shows that the abundances of ribosome-bound <italic>tim</italic> and <italic>per</italic> clock mRNAs are significantly higher at ZT11 than at ZT23. This result is consistent with the known rhythmic profile of <italic>tim</italic> and <italic>per</italic> RNA abundances at the two time points (higher at ZT11) and the expected translational status of the mRNA at the two times of day. We emphasize that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001703-g001">Figure 1J</xref> shows differences in ribosome association of the clock RNAs, not simply the previously documented RNA abundance for <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic>. In addition, we note that the temporal resolution of our measurements does not exclude translational regulation of <italic>per</italic> mRNA, which has been suggested in certain studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Kojima1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Bradley1">[26]</xref>. Nonetheless, these results demonstrate that TRAP methods are capable of detecting diurnal changes in the translational status of specific mRNAs.</p>

<title>Clock Cell-Specific Expression Profiling Efficiently Detects Circadianly Translated RNAs</title>
<p>Using the newly developed methods, we performed TRAP on head tissue lysates of <italic>tim-uas-Gal4; UAS-EGFP-L10a</italic> flies that were collected at 4-h intervals during the first two days of constant darkness (DD) following entrainment to LD 12∶12. Such flies express the EGFP-L10a fusion in all clock cells of the head, including the ∼150 pacemaker neurons, photoreceptors, and glia. RNA was extracted from affinity-purified samples and used to generate libraries representing all ribosome-associated transcripts (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Materials and Methods</xref>). TRAP libraries corresponding to six different times of the circadian cycle (CT0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20) were independently constructed for DD1 and DD2 (see details in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Materials and Methods</xref>). Libraries were sequenced, using a multiplexing strategy, to produce single end, 100 base sequencing reads; these were mapped to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> reference genome and analyzed as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Materials and Methods</xref>.</p>
<p>We employed two recently developed programs, JTK_CYCLE and ARSER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Yang1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Hughes1">[28]</xref>, to compare their usefulness for detecting circadian rhythms in the ribosome association of mRNAs. Using criteria and statistical cutoffs described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Materials and Methods</xref> section, 1,195 and 263 translationally cycling mRNAs were detected by the ARSER and JTK_CYCLE programs, respectively. Interestingly, the majority of the cycling mRNAs (203 out of 263) detected by JTK_CYCLE were also detected by the ARSER program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001703-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), indicating consistency of the two analyses. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001703.s001">Figure S1</xref> shows robust cycling for eight mRNAs out of the 60 identified by JTK_CYCLE but not ARSER. Thus, JTK_CYCLE may identify cycling mRNAs not detected by ARSER. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001703.s013">Table S4</xref> lists the 1,255 mRNAs that were identified as exhibiting significant translational cycling by either program (mRNAs identified by both programs are indicated in bold). The False Discovery Rate (FDR) calculated by the ARSER program at the relevant <italic>p</italic> value was 0.148, indicating that approximately 186 mRNAs are false positives. This FDR is quite low relative to other recent genome-wide studies of cycling mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Hughes2">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Hughes3">[31]</xref>. We did not compute an FDR for the JTK_CYCLE program, because 203/263 mRNAs identified by JTK_CYCLE are included in the ARSER dataset, and therefore the latter dataset represents a good approximation of FDR for our analyses. Based on the ARSER analysis, we estimate that approximately 1,069 of these mRNAs show circadian changes in translation in clock cells of the adult head, representing about 10% of all analyzed genes in the genome. This large number of cycling mRNAs is consistent with recent studies utilizing manual dissection approaches to perform cell-specific transcriptional profiling of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> PDF clock neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Nagoshi1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-KulaEversole1">[10]</xref>. Cell-specific profiling methods may identify a larger number of cycling <italic>Drosophila</italic> mRNAs, relative to previous studies, due to a more homogeneous starting cell population (i.e., clock cells).</p>

<title>Known Cycling mRNAs Exhibit Translational Rhythms</title>
<p>We examined a number of mRNAs in our datasets that had previously been shown to exhibit abundance rhythms to assess the quality of our datasets. These include both clock and clock-regulated mRNAs (<italic>per</italic>, <italic>tim</italic>, <italic>vri</italic>, <italic>clk</italic>, <italic>to</italic>, <italic>fer2</italic>, <italic>slob</italic>, <italic>ugt35b</italic>, <italic>5-HT1A</italic>, <italic>bw</italic>, <italic>Ir</italic>, and <italic>WupA</italic>). All showed translational rhythmicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001703-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) with an expected phase, although the <italic>tim</italic> rhythm damped on DD2. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001703-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, for example, shows robust rhythmicity in the sequence reads for <italic>per</italic> and lack of rhythmicity for a nearby gene. Our analysis also revealed translational cycling for many other genes that express rhythmic mRNAs. For example, our list of mRNAs includes 49 of 420 mRNAs showing circadian abundance rhythms identified in five previous microarray-based studies (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Introduction</xref>). This comparison does not include a recent study that identified 2,751 cycling mRNAs in hand-dissected PDF neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-KulaEversole1">[10]</xref>; our results include 172 of those mRNAs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001703.s013">Table S4</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Ugt35b</italic> mRNA, one of several encoding fly glucuronosyltransferase activity, was previously shown to exhibit transcriptional cycling in head tissues but not in PDF neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-KulaEversole1">[10]</xref>. Given that we employed a clock cell <italic>tim-Gal4</italic> driver in our TRAP studies, we suggest that <italic>Ugt35b</italic> cycles in other clock cells of the head.</p>
<p>We conducted TRAP combined with quantitative PCR for <italic>Ugt35b</italic>, <italic>tim</italic>, and 18 novel cycling mRNAs (not previously found to show abundance rhythms in head tissues) to verify results obtained by RNA-seq. As expected, <italic>Ugt35b</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> exhibited rhythmicity, presumably a consequence of their mRNA abundance rhythms. Of the novel mRNAs, 15/18 showed rhythmic changes in translation, with a profile very similar to that observed with RNA-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001703.s002">Figure S2</xref>). We further analyzed cycling of a number of these mRNAs in the <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> mutant, which lacks a functional clock, during the first day of constant darkness (DD1).

<title>Translational Profiling Reveals Circadianly Synchronized Protein Synthesis</title>
<p>Previous genome-wide studies showed that peaks of mRNA abundance occur at many different circadian phases (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001703.s004">Figure S4</xref>). In contrast, our profiling of the clock cell translatome revealed a striking feature of circadianly regulated protein synthesis. We found that peak translation for most of the 1,255 mRNAs identified in our study occurs predominantly during two circadian phases: midday or mid-night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001703-g003">Figure 3A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001703.s004">Figure S4</xref>). These are times of relative behavioral quiescence and just prior to initiation of locomotor activity bouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001703-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, lower panel). Thus, protein synthesis may be confined to times of day that require reduced metabolic expenditure and/or are just prior to initiation of behavioral activities. A further analysis revealed surprisingly synchronized translation of mRNAs required for the same cellular process: translation is predominantly unimodal (with a peak during the day or night) or biomodal, depending on the process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001703-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). This bias in the timing of translation was true of many other cellular processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001703-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). For example, of the 10 enzymes involved in glucose metabolism in our list of cycling RNAs, nine are translated during the day. In contrast, all 10 GPCRs in our list are translated during the night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001703-g003">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>

<title>Translational Regulation Contributes to Circadian Gene Expression</title>
<p>The synchronized rhythmic expression profiles identified by our cell-specific profiling approach may result from a clock regulation of translation or mRNA abundance. To ask whether changes in translational status contribute to the synchronization of gene expression in clock cells, we carried out additional studies, using TRAP/RNA-seq methods.</p>
<p>We reasoned that total RNA isolated from whole heads contains mRNAs from both clock and nonclock cells. Thus, if a gene is robustly expressed in nonclock cells, the abundance profile obtained from whole head total RNA will not represent its expression profile in clock cells. However, for mRNAs predominantly expressed in clock cells (such as <italic>per</italic>, <italic>tim</italic>, and others), assays of total head RNA will reflect clock cell expression. Such an mRNA ought to show enrichment in a TRAP sample from <italic>tim-uas-gal4&gt;EGFP-L10a</italic> heads relative to total RNA from the starting lysate, and the circadian expression profile, when assayed from total RNA, should approximate the profile in clock cells. Thus, if such an mRNA shows a rhythm by TRAP but not in total RNA, then it is likely to be regulated at the translational level.</p>
<p>To identify mRNAs enriched in clock cells, we created new genome-wide libraries for TRAP and total RNA samples from head tissues of <italic>tim-uas-gal4&gt;EGFP-L10a</italic>–expressing flies. These were sequenced to identify mRNAs that are substantially enriched by TRAP relative to total RNA—that is, enriched in clock cells. We identified many that show an enrichment within clock cells similar to or greater than that observed for <italic>tim</italic> mRNA. Forty-nine of them are present in our previous list of cycling mRNAs. We chose 12 cycling mRNAs from the enriched list and examined their expression profiles in total RNA versus TRAP RNA samples using Q-PCR methods. Of the 12 mRNAs tested, three did not show cycling similar to that detected by RNA-seq analysis (25%, and the same as we reported for another set of RNAs; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001703.s002">Figure S2</xref>); thus, these three were not examined further. Of the remaining nine mRNAs, which showed cycling by Q-PCR similar to that detected by RNA-seq, three of them exhibited constant abundance in total RNA but showed circadian cycling in ribosome association, indicating that they are likely regulated at the translational level. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001703-g004">Figure 4</xref> shows cycling profiles for these three mRNAs and a fourth mRNA showing both abundance and ribosome-association rhythms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001703-g004">Figure 4D</xref>).

<p>We used two different strategies to characterize the expression pattern of <italic>Tdc2</italic> in the adult brain, in particular in various groups of clock cells. First, we characterized the expression pattern of a <italic>Tdc2-Gal4</italic> transgene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Cole1">[50]</xref> and its co-localization with PERIOD protein. We found that a <italic>UAS-GFP</italic> reporter, driven by <italic>Tdc2-Gal4</italic>, was expressed in multiple regions of the fly brain, as expected. However, the only clock cells showing GFP fluorescence (identifiable by PER expression) were the ventral lateral (LNv) PDF neurons of the brain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001703.s007">Figure S7A</xref>), which are critical for circadian behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Nitabach1">[9]</xref>. Next, using anti-TDC2 antibody, we localized the TDC2 protein in flies expressing a membrane-bound GFP (mCD8-GFP) in all clock cells (driven by <italic>tim-uas-gal4</italic>). As expected, we found that there is a strong immunoreactive signal for TDC2 in many nonclock neurons. Within the clock neuronal population, we detected TDC2 immunoreactivity in all l-LNvs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001703.s007">Figure S7B</xref>, a–d), s-LNvs (a–d), and LNds (i–k), as well as a few cells in the DN1 region (l–n). Finally, a comparison of TDC2 immunoreactivity and <italic>Tdc2-gal4</italic> driven mCD8-GFP expression found that <italic>Tdc2-gal4</italic> does not express in all TDC2 immunoreactive cells (unpublished data), indicating that the <italic>Tdc2-gal4</italic> transgene does not reflect the complete expression pattern of the <italic>Tdc2</italic> gene.

<p>To assess the role of <italic>Tdc2</italic> in circadian behavior, we analyzed locomotor activity of the <italic>Tdc2<sup>RO54</sup></italic> mutant, which carries a point mutation that abolishes the enzymatic activity of TDC2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Cole1">[50]</xref>.

<title>Synchronized Translational Rhythmicity</title>
<p>This study is the first to profile the circadian translatome of a defined cell population in a complex tissue. In contrast to previous studies showing that mRNA abundance rhythms peak at multiple circadian phases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001703.s004">Figure S4</xref>), our results indicate that translation of most rhythmic transcripts within clock cells is restricted to two major phases—midday and mid-night. Furthermore, we provide evidence that circadian regulation of either mRNA abundance or protein synthesis (depending on the mRNA) contributes to this synchronization. We speculate that protein synthesis may occur predominantly at circadian phases that are associated with reduced metabolic expenditure. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, such times coincide with behavioral quiescence, just prior to initiation of locomotor activity bouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001703-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The synchronized translation of functionally related mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001703-g003">Figure 3B–D</xref>) suggests a clock-orchestrated sequential activation of biological processes; these results reinforce the concept that fundamental cellular processes are under circadian control within clock cells.</p>
<p>Two significant technical improvements enabled the discovery of synchronized translation. First, our analysis was restricted to circadian clock cells, circumventing the problem of profiling a mixed population, in which some cells express a rhythmic mRNA, whereas others express the same mRNA constitutively (thus masking rhythmicity). In addition, different cell types may express out-of-phase rhythmic mRNAs, also masking a rhythm in a mixed cell population. Second, our technique analyzes ribosome association rather than steady-state mRNA abundance, representing a more direct assessment of protein expression. Although it is not currently technically feasible to directly compare transcriptional and translational rhythms in the same cell types, our results indicate that translational regulatory mechanisms contribute to synchronized protein synthesis. Consistent with this idea, we have shown that mRNAs encoding relevant translational regulatory factors are rhythmically expressed. These include translation initiation factors, ribosomal proteins, and enzymes involved in rRNA and tRNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001703.s013">Table S4</xref>). In mammals, ribosome biogenesis is known to be regulated by the circadian clock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Jouffe1">[32]</xref>.

<p>The rhythm in <italic>TrxT</italic> translation may also function in another important circadian output. It has recently been demonstrated that there is circadian control of peroxiredoxin (PRX) protein oxidation state in organisms ranging from unicellulars to humans, and that this rhythm is regulated by an uncharacterized NTO (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-van1">[1]</xref>). Significantly, oxidized PRX multimers serve as cellular chaperones and cell cycle modulators. Thioredoxin (TRX) mediates reduction of oxidized PRX molecules to complete the PRX catalytic cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-van1">[1]</xref>, and thus rhythmic <italic>TrxT</italic> may contribute to circadian changes in PRX oxidation state. Of relevance, mRNAs encoding other chaperones are also rhythmically translated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001703.s013">Table S4</xref>).</p>

<title>Evidence for a Novel Neurotransmitter in PDF Neurons</title>
<p>Rhythmic factors important for neurotransmission were also identified by our analysis. Among them, <italic>Tdc2</italic>—encoding the synthetic enzyme for tyramine and octopamine—is rhythmically expressed in clock neurons and localized to the PDF cell population. Rhythmic release of these transmitters from PDF or other clock neurons may contribute to the temporal coordination of the clock cell circuitry, similar to the role of PDF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Lin1">[56]</xref>. Alternatively, rhythmic release of octopamine and/or tyramine may regulate downstream neurons that drive locomotor activity rhythms.</p>
<p>Of note, previous studies have suggested a clock control of tyramine synthesis, showing that there was decreased tyrosine decarboxylase activity in the brains of <italic>per</italic> clock mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Livingstone1">[57]</xref>. In addition, mutants of several clock genes, including <italic>per</italic>, <italic>clock</italic>, <italic>cycle</italic>, and <italic>doubletime</italic>, were found to be required for normal cocaine sensitization, a process depending on induction of tyrosine decarboxylase activity and production of tyramine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Andretic1">[58]</xref>. Expression of <italic>Tdc2</italic> in clock neurons is consistent with a role for tyramine, and perhaps octopamine, in this process.</p>
<p><italic>Tdc2</italic> was not described as a cycling mRNA in several previous genome-wide circadian expression studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-McDonald1">[59]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Ueda1">[63]</xref> that utilized whole fly heads as a starting material. Based on the expression pattern of <italic>Tdc2</italic>—that is, broad and strong expression in a large number of neurons including only certain clock neurons —it seems likely that the cycling of <italic>Tdc2</italic> eluded detection in previous studies because of the presence of other TDC2-containing neurons in which the transcript does not exhibit rhythms in abundance. Indeed, <italic>Tdc2</italic> was included in a long list of mRNAs (2,751) showing enrichment in the large LNv clock neurons at one time of day (ZT12) in a recent study that utilized manual dissection procedures to profile PDF neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-KulaEversole1">[10]</xref>. Our detection of rhythmic <italic>Tdc2</italic> translation and confirmation of its role in maintaining circadian locomotor activity rhythms clearly demonstrates the advantage of a cell-type–specific approach in genome-wide studies of gene expression.</p>

<title>Affinity Purification of Ribosomes and Isolation of Ribosome-Bound mRNAs</title>
<p>Adult flies were collected in 50 ml conical tubes at desired time points and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Fly heads were collected by vigorously shaking frozen flies and passing them through geological sieves according to standard procedures. Approximately 200 heads were employed for each affinity purification experiment. Frozen heads were homogenized in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 150 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM DTT, 100 µg/ml Cycloheximide, and 2 U/ml SUPERase (Life Technologies) and centrifuged at 20,000× <italic>g</italic> for 15 min to obtain cleared lysate. After adding DHPC and Igepal CA-630 to a final concentration of 30 mM and 1%, respectively, the lysates were incubated on ice for 5 min and centrifuged at 20,000× <italic>g</italic> again for 15 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to magnetic beads coated with a purified high-affinity anti-EGFP antibody (prepared using the Dyabeads Antibody Couple Kit from Invitrogen) and incubated at 4°C with end-to-end rotation for 1 h to allow binding of EGFP-tagged ribosome to the antibodies. Following incubation, samples were washed with a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 150 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM DTT, 100 µg/ml Cycloheximide, and 1% Igepal CA-630 for five times at room temperature. RNA was extracted from the beads using the TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies). Quality and quantity of the isolated RNAs were analyzed using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent).</p>
<p>Using these methods, we affinity purified RNA-containing ribosomes from head tissues of adult flies expressing <italic>UAS-EGFP-L10a</italic> in all neurons or clock cells. Similar to published studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Heiman1">[19]</xref>, we optimized homogenization procedures for <italic>Drosophila</italic> head tissues, included magnesium and cycloheximide in the lysis buffer to preserve polysomes, inhibited RNAase activity, and employed a purified, high-affinity anti-GFP antibody for ribosome precipitation. In those experiments, the <italic>UAS-EGFP-L10a</italic> transgene was expressed in all neurons or all clock cells using, respectively, the <italic>elav-Gal4</italic> or <italic>tim-uas-Gal4</italic> drivers. In three pilot experiments—two using <italic>elav-Gal4</italic> and one using <italic>tim-uas-Gal4</italic>—we obtained a total of 305–544 ng RNA from head tissues of 200 <italic>UAS-EGFP-L10a</italic>–expressing flies, whereas there were negligible amounts (50–100-fold less) of precipitated RNA in control samples (<italic>elav-Gal4</italic> or <italic>tim-uas-Gal4</italic> alone) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001703.s008">Figure S8</xref>). Nearly as much RNA was precipitated using the <italic>tim-uas-Gal4</italic> driver as with <italic>elav-Gal</italic>, and we attribute this result to the strength of the <italic>tim-uas-Gal4</italic> driver and the observation that it is expressed in all clock neurons including photoreceptors and thousands of glial cells.

<title>RNA-Seq Library Construction and Sequencing</title>
<p>We employed standard Illumina protocols and reagents (the TruSeq RNA sample preparation kit) for RNA-seq library construction. RNAs extracted from the immunoprecipitation contain a mixture of mRNAs, ribosomal RNAs, and other small RNAs that are involved in translation, such as tRNAs. Using the TruSeq RNA kit, mRNAs were isolated using poly-dT coupled magnetic beads and fragmented by addition of divalent cations at 94°C. Cleaved mRNAs were then reverse transcribed into cDNA using random primers, and cDNA was subjected to second strand synthesis using DNA polymerase I and RNaseH. DNAs were end repaired, “A” tailed, and then ligated to Illumina sequencing adaptors prior to enrichment by PCR to create a library. Sequencing of libraries was accomplished using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 in the Tufts Medical School Molecular Core Facility. Sequence reads were obtained and their quality analyzed using the quality control metrics provided by the FastQC pipeline (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</ext-link>). We obtained, on average, 21 million high-quality 100-b reads for each of the 24 samples (after removing low-quality reads), and an average of 82% of the high-quality reads could be mapped to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> 5.22 reference genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001703.s010">Table S1</xref>) using Tophat (v 2.0.0) and Bowtie2 (v 2.0.0.5) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Trapnell1">[64]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Langmead1">[65]</xref>.

</sec><sec id="s5e">
<title>Analysis of RNA-Seq Data</title>
<p>After mapping with Tophat and Bowtie, we counted the number of reads aligning to individual annotated genes in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome using HTseq-count (EMBL). Using these methods, there was good agreement between the two biological replicates for each time point in the DD1 and DD2 datasets. The correlation coefficient (r) of the two replicates was greater than 0.9 for all time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001703.s011">Table S2</xref>, representative scatter plots of two replicates are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001703.s009">Figure S9</xref>). Next, we conducted a preliminary assessment of each of the four individual datasets (DD1, replicate 1 and 2 and DD2, replicate 1 and 2) by calculating the “best cosine correlation” for all genes including 10 genes in our datasets that are known to show transcriptional cycling from previous studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001703.s012">Table S3</xref>). The “best cosine correlation” is obtained by calculating the correlation coefficient (r) between read counts of the six time points and corresponding six values on one of 48 cosine curves each with 0.5 h difference in phase, and selecting the highest r value from the 48 comparisons. We found that 10 “control” RNAs had high r values in the two DD1 datasets and DD2 dataset 1. However, poor correlation coefficients were observed for DD2 dataset 2, and thus this dataset was not used in our subsequent analyses. Given the good correlation between DD1 datasets 1 and 2, we pooled reads from these two replicates to generate one set of combined expression values. For DD2, we employed only dataset 1 in the analysis. As a consequence of improved sequencing technology, samples of the DD2 dataset 2 contained roughly the same number of reads as the combined DD1 datasets 1 and 2. Thus, the total number of reads analyzed for each sample was similar across all time points of DD1 and DD2—on average ∼32 million reads per sample. The resulting datasets (six time points for both DD1 and DD2) were quantile normalized to control for variation among experiments.</p>

<title>Identification of Genes and Transcripts Showing a Circadian Expression Pattern</title>
<p>Relative sequence read coverage at different circadian time points, quantified using HTseq-count and quantile normalized, were used to construct a time-lapse expression series and analyzed using two different programs, ARSER and JTK_CYCLE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Yang1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Hughes1">[28]</xref>, to identify the presence of circadian periodicity. ARSER was developed by Yang and Su <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Yang1">[27]</xref>, and it analyzes circadian expression data by harmonic regression based on autoregressive spectral estimation; JTK_CYCLE was developed by Hughes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001703-Hughes1">[28]</xref>, and uses a nonparametric algorithm to detect rhythmic components in genome scale datasets. Results obtained from the two different analyses were filtered in several ways to obtain the final set of cycling genes: (1) we required the average raw read counts across the 12 time points to be at least 20; (2) we required a “cycling amplitude,” defined as ½ (maximum expression value – minimum expression value)/median expression value, of at least 0.5; and (3) for results with the ARSER program, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.021 was considered statistically significant, whereas for the JTK_CYCLE program, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.015 was used as a cutoff. As the two programs appear to have different sensitivities in detecting circadian genes, different cutoff <italic>p</italic> values were chosen for them in order to include the majority of known clock genes. We think the use of this biological criterion to determine a statistical cutoff is reasonable for this type of analysis.</p>

Head collection, homogenization, TRAP, and RNA isolation were carried out as described above in “Affinity Purification of Ribosomes and Isolation of Ribosome-Bound mRNAs.” Before the immunoprecipitation step, 1/10 of the tissue lysate was set aside for extraction of total RNA. RNAs were isolated from the TRAP immunoprecipitates (referred to as “TRAP RNA”) as well as from the input whole head lysates (referred to as “total RNA”). Equal amounts (300 ng) of TRAP RNA and total RNA were used to construct RNA-seq libraries. For each of the three sets of fly heads, one TRAP RNA library and one total RNA library were constructed. RNA-seq library construction, sequencing, and mapping were conducted as described above. Sequence read counts were obtained using HTSeq (EMBL) with BDGP5, Ensembl release 68 for gene coordinates.
