<abstract>
<p>During the development of the visual system, high levels of energy are expended propelling axons from the retina to the brain. However, the role of intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism in the development of the visual system has been overlooked. Here, we report that the carbohydrate metabolites succinate and α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and their respective receptor—GPR91 and GPR99—are involved in modulating retinal ganglion cell (RGC) projections toward the thalamus during visual system development. Using ex vivo and in vivo approaches, combined with pharmacological and genetic analyses, we revealed that GPR91 and GPR99 are expressed on axons of developing RGCs and have complementary roles during RGC axon growth in an extracellular signal–regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK<sub>1/2</sub>)-dependent manner. However, they have no effects on axon guidance. These findings suggest an important role for these receptors during the establishment of the visual system and provide a foundational link between carbohydrate metabolism and axon growth.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Development of the visual system requires high levels of energy and tight regulation of multiple factors integrated by axon projections during navigation to their appropriate targets. While intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism have key roles in many biological processes, much less is known about their effects on receptors in the developing nervous system. We hypothesized that activation of two G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) by metabolic intermediates could promote growth during retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon extension and guidance from the retina to the brain. We first demonstrated that receptors for two intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism—succinate and α-ketoglutarate (α-KG)—are expressed on developing RGCs and their projections. We revealed that these receptors have a complementary role in regulating axon growth in an extracellular signal–regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK<sub>1/2</sub>)-dependent manner, although with no effect on axon guidance. The absence of either receptor caused a strong decline in axonal projections from the retina to the thalamus, while the combined absence of both receptors had an additive effect. Taken together, our findings indicate, for the first time, an important role for intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism and their receptors in stimulating axon growth during the establishment of the visual system and suggest a wider involvement in the nervous system development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>GPR91 and GPR99 are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) activated by Krebs cycle intermediates, part of the larger class of carbohydrate metabolites—an observation that renewed interest in a biochemical pathway discovered decades ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref002">2</xref>]. GPR91, through its activation by succinate outside the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, has a wide range of functions in diverse diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes. Its study allowed greater understanding of the molecular links between the TCA cycle and metabolic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>The development of the visual system requires high levels of energy to propel mitochondrial-enriched axons properly through the nervous system, as retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are essential for transmitting information from the retina to the brain. The growth and survival of neurons depend on mitochondria as they perform aerobic ATP synthesis and play a significant role in apoptotic and necrotic cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref004">4</xref>]. Thus, failures of mitochondrial function appear to be involved in degenerative diseases of the nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref005">5</xref>]. One of the most mitochondria-enriched regions of the axon is the active growth cone (GC) at the tip of the axon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref006">6</xref>]. The GC contains multiple receptors that interact with guidance molecules, allowing the front end of a developing axon to navigate through the complex landscape of the early nervous system toward its appropriate targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref007">7</xref>]. However, the role of intermediates from carbohydrate metabolism during the development of the visual system has not been well characterized.</p>
<p>In the past decade, increasing evidence has highlighted GPCRs as mediators of both repulsive and attractive axon guidance, as their ligands may serve as guidance cues for axon pathfinding; however, GPCRs involved in axon growth still remain to be found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref011">11</xref>]. In a groundbreaking study in 2004, GPR91 (succinate receptor 1 [Sucnr1]) and GPR99 (2-oxoglutarate receptor 1 [Oxgr1]) were both identified as receptors of the Krebs cycle intermediates succinate and α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref002">2</xref>]. GPR91 and the closely related GPR99 are expressed in multiple tissues, such as the kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref012">12</xref>] and cardiac muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref015">15</xref>]. Previous reports have shown that succinate and GPR91 regulate normal retinal vascularization, proliferative ischemic retinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref016">16</xref>], and cortical revascularization post-ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref017">17</xref>]. Moreover, through the activation of GPR91, succinate has been shown to have an effect on motility, migration, and growth, as it directly promotes chemotaxis and potentiates activation initiated by Toll-like receptor agonists in dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref019">19</xref>]. However, to date, scarce literature exists on GPR99 functions.</p>
<p>Human neuronal mapping and vascular innervation are closely related, as similar molecules and signaling mechanisms are shared between axon guidance, neuronal migration, and blood vessel guidance and growth. For example, the Slit/Robo pathway plays a critical role in both angiogenesis and the guidance of neuronal migration of the olfactory system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref021">21</xref>]. Moreover, semaphorins and their receptors play a pivotal role as axon guidance cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref023">23</xref>] while also acting as a vasorepulsive force that misdirects new retinal vessels toward the vitreous in a murine model of oxygen-induced retinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
<p>Therefore, we investigated the growth-promoting actions and guidance effects of the carbohydrate metabolites succinate and α-KG, through their respective receptor GPR91 and GPR99, during the establishment of the retino-thalamic pathway in an embryonic mouse model. Elucidating carbohydrate metabolite functions during visual development may provide crucial insights regarding their potential roles in the plasticity and regeneration of the nervous system and allow the development of further pharmacological tools, expanding and improving central and peripheral nervous system repair strategies.</p>

At E14/15, GPR91 and GPR99 proteins were mainly present in the ganglion cell layer but were also detected in the ganglion cell fiber and neuroblast layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003619.g001">Fig 1A–1F</xref>). The retinas from adult and E14/15 knockout (KO) mice (<italic>gpr91</italic>KO or <italic>gpr99</italic>KO) showed no expression of GPR91 or GPR99, confirming the antibodies’ specificity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003619.s002">S1A–S1H Fig</xref>). In E14/15 wild-type (WT) murine retinal explants, GPR91 and GPR99 were present in neurites, GCs, and filopodia, in dendrites and axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003619.g001">Fig 1G–1R</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003619.s002">S1I–S1L Fig</xref>).

<title>The Krebs cycle intermediates succinate and α-KG reorganize GC morphology and increase axon growth</title>
<p>As previous studies have shown that GPCRs are involved in axon guidance, we evaluated the roles of GPR91 and GPR99 on GC actions using retinal explants isolated from E14/15 mouse embryos after 2 days in vitro (DIVs) in culture. Explants treated for 60 min with the specific agonists succinate (100 μM) or α-KG (200 μM) showed a significant increase in the GC surface area and the number of filopodia, compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003619.g002">Fig 2A–2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003619.s003">S2A–S2D Fig</xref>).

Moreover, following 60-min succinate (100 μM) or α-KG (200 μM) treatment, similar effects were observed on GC surface area and filopodia number of cortical neurons (2 DIVs); these effects were also abolished in neurons lacking the expression of GPR91 and/or GPR99 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003619.s003">S2E–S2G Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>To further evaluate the effects of GPR91 and GPR99 ligand treatment on axon growth, retinal explants from WT mouse embryos were treated for 15 h with succinate (100 μM) or α-KG (200 μM). Both agonists induced an increase in total neurite growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003619.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>). Moreover, stimulation of <italic>gpr91</italic>KO murine retinal explants with α-KG and the stimulation of <italic>gpr99</italic>KO murine retinal explants with succinate also induced neurite growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003619.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>). Again, the effects of succinate were essentially abolished in <italic>gpr91</italic>KO murine retinal explants, whereas the increased outgrowth produced by α-KG was markedly reduced in <italic>gpr99</italic>KO murine retinal explants. In double-KO murine retinal explants, the effect produced by either succinate or α-KG was abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003619.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate whether the effects of intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism on GC morphology and neurite outgrowth could also affect cell viability, we treated murine embryonic retinal explants or cortical neurons with succinate or α-KG and then used a LIVE/DEAD assay to evaluate cell death. Following a 15-h treatment with succinate (100 μM) or α-KG (200 μM), retinal explants or cortical neurons showed no differences in cell viability compared to control explants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003619.s004">S3 Fig</xref>). However, we observed a high induction of cell death in the positive control condition of staurosporine-treated explants or neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003619.s004">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these results indicate that the Krebs cycle intermediates succinate and α-KG, via GPR91 and GPR99, increase axon growth in retinal explants and modulate GC morphology in retinal explants and primary neurons.</p>

<title>GPR91 and GPR99 agonists modulate GC morphology and increase axon growth via the extracellular signal–regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK<sub>1/2</sub>) pathway</title>
<p>GPR91 is coupled to at least two signaling pathways, G<sub>i</sub>/G<sub>o</sub> and G<sub>q11</sub>, whereas the activation of GPR99 by α-KG triggers a G<sub>q</sub>-mediated pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref002">2</xref>]. Moreover, previous reports have demonstrated that succinate activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways via GPR91 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref025">25</xref>]. Since MAPKs mediate axon outgrowth, migration, and guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref026">26</xref>], we determined whether the effects observed with succinate/GPR91 and α-KG/GPR99 were mediated via the ERK<sub>1/2</sub> pathway.</p>
<p>ERK<sub>1/2</sub> phosphorylation was significantly increased, both in vitro in neurons and ex vivo in retinal explants, following succinate and α-KG stimulation, while these effects were abrogated by CI-1040, a selective ERK<sub>1/2</sub> inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003619.g003">Fig 3A, 3B and 3H</xref>). CI-1040 treatment also abolished succinate- and α-KG-induced increases in GC surface area and filopodia number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003619.g003">Fig 3C–3E</xref>); no significant differences were observed between the untreated control and a control pretreated with CI-1040.

Moreover, CI-1040 treatment did not affect the viability of embryonic retinal explants and cortical neurons, as no significant neuronal cell death was observed compared to controls with the LIVE/DEAD assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003619.s004">S3 Fig</xref>).

<title>Role of GPR91 and GPR99 during development</title>
<p>To determine the contribution of GPR91 and GPR99 to the development of retinal projections in vivo, E14/15 murine embryos received an intraocular injection of DiI (DiIC18[3] [1,1’-dioctadecyl-3,3,3’,3’-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate]), a lipophilic tracer. After 7 d of tracer diffusion, surgery was performed to visualize the optic nerve, chiasm, and tract. The photomicrographs obtained revealed that genetic deletion of either GPR91 or GPR99 had no detrimental effects on RGC axon guidance, as axon steering at the optic chiasm, after a single genetic deletion of <italic>gpr91</italic> or <italic>gpr99</italic>, was similar to the WT group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003619.s005">S4A and S4B Fig</xref>). Moreover, succinate and α-KG treatment also failed to modulate axon steering in time-lapse microscopy experiments performed on GCs from E14/15 WT murine retinal explants at 1 DIV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003619.s006">S5A–S5E Fig</xref>). Microgradient application of succinate or α-KG did not induce any significant directional GC turning compared to the vehicle control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003619.s006">S5A–S5E Fig</xref>). Interestingly, short-term exposure to succinate induced an increase in the growth of retinal axons, while α-KG exposure had no significant effects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003619.s006">S5E Fig</xref>). However, in double-KO mice, few retinal axon fibers projected to the ipsilateral side of the brain although, some extended into the contralateral optic nerve. The concomitant absence of GPR91 and GPR99 appeared to induce some abnormal projections in the ipsilateral and contralateral sides of the optic chiasm, suggesting a potential compensatory role played by each receptor in the absence of the other (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003619.s005">S4A and S4B Fig</xref>). Moreover, to assess the involvement of the citric acid cycle intermediate receptors in retino-geniculate development, we examined the projections to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of adult mice. Contralateral and ipsilateral projections in the dLGN from all genetically modified mouse strains occupied the same area as those of WT mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003619.s005">S4C Fig</xref>). These data indicate a similar overlap between contralateral and ipsilateral RGC projections in the dLGN for all mouse genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003619.s005">S4D Fig</xref>). Taken together, these observations demonstrate that GPR91 and GPR99 do not appear to be implicated in guidance and target selection during the development of the retinogeniculate pathway in vivo.</p>
<p>To investigate the in vivo effects of intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism during the development of the visual system, the mouse model presents limitations. Because the mouse visual system is completed at birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref027">27</xref>], we further utilized a different rodent model. The Syrian golden hamster has a shorter gestation period (15 d versus 18.5 d), and pups are born with a relatively premature visual system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref027">27</xref>]. As the axons of RGCs reach their thalamic and midbrain targets at P3 in the hamster, this model allows examination of the induction of axon growth by different agonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref028">28</xref>]. Taking advantage of this observation, hamsters were injected intravitreally 24 h after birth (P1) with a mixed solution of cholera toxin subunit B (CTb) with either 0.9% saline solution, 100 mM succinate, or 200 mM α-KG, and immunohistological analyses were performed at P5. Intraocular injections of CTb produced intense labeling of thalamic and midbrain targets such as the dLGN and superior colliculus, making the evaluation of the collateral growth of RGC axons difficult. Thus, we evaluated the RGC branch growth at the dorsal terminal nucleus (DTN), one of the nuclei composing the accessory visual pathway and involved in mediating visuomotor reflexes underlying the generation of optokinetic nystagmus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref029">29</xref>]. Compared with the control group, unilateral intraocular injections of succinate or α-KG induced significant increases in RGC collateral axon projection length and branch number in the DTN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003619.g004">Fig 4A–4C</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Most functional studies of GPR91 and GPR99, receptors of intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism, have been performed outside the central nervous system, primarily in the kidney and heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref015">15</xref>]. In the present study, we showed that GPR91 and GPR99 are expressed on axonal and dendritic projections, GCs and filopodia of murine embryonic retinal explants, and on retinal projections and cell body of RGCs during the development of the retinothalamic pathway. We demonstrated that succinate and α-KG increase ERK<sub>1/2</sub> phosphorylation, corroborating a large number of studies on signaling pathways triggered by GPR91 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref025">25</xref>]. Moreover, stimulation of both GPR91 and GPR99 resulted in the modulation of GC morphology and an increase in RGC axon growth in an ERK<sub>1/2</sub>-dependent manner. The increased GC size, number of filopodia, and growth of RGC axons following stimulation of GPR91 and GPR99 by succinate and α-KG, respectively, is the first report, to our knowledge, implicating these ligands and receptors in axon growth. Interestingly, the deletion of GPR91 completely blocked the effects of succinate but also partially abolished the effects observed with α-KG. Nevertheless, in double-KO animals, the effects of both succinate and α-KG were abrogated. These results tend to demonstrate that succinate’s effects on RGC axon growth were mediated only through GPR91, while α-KG could, through an as-yet-unknown mechanism, activate both GPR91 and GPR99. A possible mechanism could be the conversion of α-KG into succinate, since α-KG is a precursor of succinate in the Krebs cycle. Moreover, our findings showed that GPR91 and GPR99, while having no effect on axon guidance, have complementary roles in RGC axon growth during development.</p>
<p>These data are consistent with previous observations in which succinate, via GPR91, has shown highly proliferative and stimulating vascular effects in different tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref017">17</xref>], to promote chemotaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref030">30</xref>] and to potentiate the activation and aggregation of platelets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref031">31</xref>]. Axon guidance and angiogenesis share several fundamental challenges during the formation of their extensive networks. Tip cells—specialized endothelial cells at the end of each vessel sprout—are motile and dynamically extend long filopodia protrusions reminiscent of axonal GCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref032">32</xref>]. In light of the spatiotemporal link between axon growth and angiogenesis, as well as the morphological similarities between endothelial tip cells and axonal GCs, the observed increase in the morphology of GC and neurite growth could be explained by a similar mechanism in the presence of succinate.</p>
<p>As the only type of neuron that sends axons out of the retina, RGCs ensure the visual and cognitive processing of information from the outside world to the brain. A combination of intrinsic and extrinsic signals also plays an important role in driving the axons through the visual pathway via responsive GCs, which detect and effectively translate a multitude of external chemotactic cues. In the mouse, the axon decussation occurs at the level of the optic chiasm at around E14–16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref033">33</xref>]. We observed that in WT, <italic>gpr91</italic>KO, or <italic>gpr99</italic>KO mice, the optic chiasm appeared relatively normal, as the majority of the axons at the midline crossed to project contralaterally. Our results suggest that in the mouse visual system, the absence of either GPR91 or GPR99 is insufficient to affect decussation. Moreover, neither GPR91 nor GPR99 activity at the GC modulated axon turning in an ex vivo experiment of retinal explants, since GCs are not attracted nor repelled in the presence of a succinate or α-KG microgradient, whereas succinate induced significant axon extension. Based on these results, succinate plays an essential role in axon growth by increasing axon motility, but succinate and α-KG do not affect GC and axon guidance. However, the visual projections of double-KO mice showed some mild abnormalities in axon guidance that could be explained by a compensatory effect between the two receptors, which would allow a rescue of this mild phenotype in <italic>gpr91</italic>KO or <italic>gpr99</italic>KO mice. Nevertheless, further experiments are needed to study this subtle defect in a more quantitative fashion in order to draw significant conclusions. In addition, our data show that deletion of either GPR91 or GPR99 in vivo did not affect target selection of retinal projections. Indeed, during perinatal development, RGC axons connect with multiple targets in the dLGN, sharing common terminal space, while RGC axons occupy distinct eye-dependent nonoverlapping regions of the dLGN in the adult rodent. Eye-specific segregation only occurs during postnatal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref034">34</xref>]. Accordingly, a similar relative eye-specific segregation of retinal projections was observed in the adults of all 4 mouse genotypes. Thus, our in vivo results support previous ex vivo findings that GPR91 and GPR99 do not modulate RGC axon guidance and target selection during the establishment of the visual pathway.</p>
<p>However, we demonstrated that TCA cycle intermediates induce axon growth in vivo during the development of the visual system, as intraocular injection of succinate and α-KG induced significant increases in RGC collateral axon projection length and branch number in the DTN. Moreover, accordingly, genetic interference with GPR91 or GPR99 activity profoundly affects retinal projection growth in the DTN. We showed a significant difference between WT, <italic>gpr91</italic>KO, and <italic>gpr99</italic>KO mice in axon projection length and branching at the DTN. Furthermore, the relative lack of growth of retinal projections in double-KO mice demonstrates the fundamental role played by GPR91 and GPR99 during RGC axon growth. Nonetheless, these in vivo experiments do not conclude that the receptors involved in the growth-promoting actions of intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism are only those expressed at the GCs but could also be, to some extent, those expressed throughout the projections or on the cell body of RGCs as well.</p>
<p>The levels of intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism adapt depending on tissue needs and the conditions in the surrounding regions. Investigating RGC projections and GC actions in the developing visual system faces technical limitations regarding intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism dosing. The amount of tissue needed (and its isolation) from mouse embryos or hamster newborn pups does not allow detection of metabolites due to the technique sensitivity and the rapid turnover of the metabolites. Nevertheless, based on previous published data and our own findings, we sought to avoid nonspecific responses by determining the lowest responsive doses for succinate and α-KG in our system, even if the physiological levels could not be measured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003619.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>In summary, this study demonstrates—for the first time, to our knowledge—a role for the intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism succinate and α-KG and their respective receptor GPR91 and GPR99 in axon growth during development in vivo. These receptors mediate axon growth in an ERK<sub>1/2</sub>-dependent manner, although succinate and α-KG have no effect on axon guidance. Moreover, these findings suggest a potential link between mitochondria and axon growth in development, outside the strict production of energy. This study not only demonstrates a new role for TCA cycle intermediates in the visual system development but also provides a foundation for the investigation of metabolite receptors in the visual, central, and peripheral nervous system development. This novel concept also provides new avenues for the elaboration of effective therapies aimed at the development and regeneration of the nervous system.</p>
