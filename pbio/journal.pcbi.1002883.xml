        <p>We computationally determined miRs that are significantly connected to molecular pathways by utilizing gene expression profiles in different cancer types such as glioblastomas, ovarian and breast cancers. Specifically, we assumed that the knowledge of physical interactions between miRs and genes indicated subsets of important miRs (IM) that significantly contributed to the regression of pathway-specific enrichment scores. Despite the different nature of the considered cancer types, we found strongly overlapping sets of IMs. Furthermore, IMs that were important for many pathways were enriched with literature-curated cancer and differentially expressed miRs. Such sets of IMs also coincided well with clusters of miRs that were experimentally indicated in numerous other cancer types. In particular, we focused on an overlapping set of 99 overall important miRs (OIM) that were found in glioblastomas, ovarian and breast cancers simultaneously. Notably, we observed that interactions between OIMs and leading edge genes of differentially expressed pathways were characterized by considerable changes in their expression correlations. Such gains/losses of miR and gene expression correlation indicated miR/gene pairs that may play a causal role in the underlying cancers.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>We assume that a network of physical interactions between miRs and genes allows us to determine miRs that influence the expression of whole pathways in different tumor types. Specifically, we represented each pathway by an enrichment score and an array of miRs counting the number of genes in the pathway a given miR can bind. Despite the different nature of the considered tumor types, we obtained a large set of overlapping miRs using a machine-learning algorithm. Such associated miRs were enriched with literature-curated cancer and differentially expressed miRs and also coincided well with clusters of miRs that were experimentally indicated in numerous other cancer types. Focusing on such sets of miRs we observed that interactions with genes in differentially expressed pathways were characterized by massive gains/losses of expression correlations.

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>MicroRNAs (miRs) are small non-coding RNAs that interact with their gene target coding mRNAs. Such small RNAs putatively inhibit translation by direct and imperfect binding to the 3′- and 5′-untranslated regions (UTR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Bartel1">[1]</xref> and exert expression control with other regulatory elements such as transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Martinez1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Shalgi1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Wang1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The elementary role of miRs in gene expression has been indicated in tissue- and organ-specific development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Houbaviy1">[5]</xref>. miRs also play an important role in tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Croce1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Volinia1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Lu1">[8]</xref>, where over-expressed miRs might diminish the level of expression of targeted tumor suppressor genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-EsquelaKerscher1">[9]</xref>. In turn, miRs may act as tumor suppressors, when their down-regulation leads to enhanced expression of targeted oncogenes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Chen1">[10]</xref> or are involved in various steps of the metastatic process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Hurst1">[11]</xref>. Generally, aberrant expression of miRs in cancers can arise from the deletion or mutation as well as methylation of miR coding regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Chan1">[12]</xref>. Furthermore, miRs may be located in common breakpoint regions and genomic areas of amplification and loss of heterozygosity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Calin1">[13]</xref>. Such alterations of miR-expression levels have been implicated in the de-regulation of critical players in major cellular pathways, modifying the differentiation, proliferation and survival of tumor cells. For example, miR-7 and miR-221/222 have been shown to be involved in the activation of the Akt and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathways in gliomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Kefas1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Zhang1">[15]</xref> while miR-34a was found to be a key regulator of p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-He1">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To provide a better understanding of the involvement of miRs in pathways, we computationally determined miRs that are significantly associated with molecular pathways. In particular, we utilized gene expression profiles to determine a pathway specific enrichment score in diverse cancer types, such as glioblastomas, ovarian and breast cancers. Using data of physical interactions between miRs and the 3′UTR of mRNAs we counted the numbers of leading edge genes (LEG) in each pathway that were targeted by a given miR. We assumed that the topology of interactions between LEGs of pathways and miRs allows an assessment of the tumor-specific importance of the given miR for the expression of the underlying pathways. Therefore, we used a machine learning approach to fit pathway-specific enrichment scores as a function of the corresponding number of LEGs that were targeted by an array of miRs. Despite the diversity of the underlying cancer types, we obtained a large, overlapping set of important miRs (IM) that significantly influenced the regression process in all cancer types considered. Furthermore, IMs that were important for an increasing number of pathways were enriched with literature curated cancer miRs and differentially expressed miRs. Such sets of IMs also coincided well with clusters of miRs that were experimentally indicated in numerous other cancer types. Focusing on such an overlapping set of overall important miRs (OIM) in glioblastomas, ovarian and breast cancers, we investigated their interactions to LEGs in differentially expressed pathways. We observed that such interactions were characterized by considerable changes in their expression correlations. Such gains or losses of expression correlations indicated OIM/LEG pairs that may influence expression changes in the underlying pathways.</p>

        <p>Using gene expression data of a cancer type, we applied GSEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Subramanian1">[30]</xref> to calculate a normalized enrichment score of each pathway.

In each of 10,000 regression trees, we randomly sampled <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002883.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of all <italic>n</italic> miRs and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002883.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of all <italic>x</italic> pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Wuchty1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Wuchty2">[29]</xref>. As for the assessment of a miR's importance for each pathway in the fitting process, we permuted enrichment scores and the number of targeted LEGs, calculating randomized local importance values for each miR/pathway pair. We repeated the randomization process 100 times and constructed null-distributions of randomized importance scores for each miR/pathway pair. Fitting such distributions with a Z-test, we calculated P-values for each miR/pathway pair. We corrected for multiple testing by calculating the corresponding false discovery rate (FDR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Benjamini1">[32]</xref> and defined an important miR (IM) of a pathway if FDR&lt;0.01.</p>

Considering each pathway as a set of LEGs, we counted the number of such genes that a given miR interacted with. Consequently, each pathway was further represented by a miR interaction profile, indicating the number of LEGs in a pathway a given miR interacted with (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002883-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Averaging over all pathways, we normalized miR-specific entries in this matrix by a Z-score. Representing each pathway by its normalized enrichment score, we applied the random forest algorithm, allowing the calculation of an importance value for each miR/pathway pair. Such an importance measure reflects the impact of the given miR on the fitting process of the underlying pathway's enrichment score. To assess the statistical significance of local importance scores we resorted to permutation tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002883-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Randomizing both pathway enrichment scores and the miRs numbers of targeted LEGs we generated null-distributions of importance scores for each miR/pathway pair.

        <p>Utilizing data from the HMDD database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Lu2">[23]</xref> we collected information about miRs that were experimentally found to play a role in more than 90 cancer types. Focusing on 25 cancer types with at least 25 different, implicated miRs (including glioblastoma, ovarian and breast cancer) we constructed a bipartite matrix, indicating if a given miR was experimentally reported in a certain cancer type. Ward-clustering such a binary matrix, we observed two large clusters of miRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002883-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Counting the number of different cancer types a miR was experimentally found in, we observed that such clusters consisted of the most frequently indicated miRs (histogram, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002883-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Therefore, we expected that such clusters may be enriched with IMs. Indeed, our separate sets of IMs in glioblastoma, ovarian and breast cancer overlapped well with this general pattern of miR involvement in different tumor types. Applying a hypergeometric test we further checked if IMs were enriched among miRs that appeared in at least 3 different cancer types. Indeed, 106 IMs in GBMs occurred in such a set of miRs (P&lt;10<sup>−5</sup>), while we found 107 in ovarian (P&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>) and 100 in breast cancers (P&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>).

        <p>Using such pairs of OIMs and pathways in GBMs, we retrieved all interactions between OIMs and LEGs in the corresponding pathways that were placed in the previously found clusters. Merging gene and miR expression data, we calculated Pearson's correlation coefficients using gene and miR expression profiles in glioblastoma and non-tumor control samples. As a measure of the difference between expression correlation coefficients in the disease (<italic>r<sup>D</sup></italic>) and non-tumor control cases (<italic>r<sup>C</sup></italic>) we Fisher-transformed correlation coefficients into Z-scores and calculated the corresponding change in correlation, ΔZ. A negative/positive value of ΔZ indicates a loss/gain of correlation in the disease case. Focusing on interactions between OIMs and the corresponding LEGs of pathways in these clusters we observed bimodal distributions of ΔZs in glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002883-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Notably, interactions between OIMs and LEGs that corresponded to down-regulated pathways and predominantly up-regulated miRs were characterized by a peak at ΔZ = −1.0, pointing to a loss of expression correlation. Focusing on miR/gene interactions in the cluster of up-regulated pathways and largely down-regulated miRs we observed a peak at ΔZ = +1.0, pointing to a gain of correlation. Analogously, we obtained such distributions for pairs of OIMs and LEGs in ovarian (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002883.s006">Fig. S6B</xref>) and breast cancer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002883.s007">Fig. S7B</xref>).</p>
        <p>Focusing on GBMs, we mapped all interactions between OIMs and LEGs we found in the corresponding clusters if their correlation change was |ΔZ|&gt;1.0. As for the cluster that revolved around down-regulated pathways and up-regulated OIMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002883-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>), we observed many interactions between differentially expressed OIMs and ITPR1 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1) with losses of expression correlations. Overall important miRs mapped in this analysis included miR-34a, -27b, -128ab and -15b. Focusing on the cluster composed by down-regulated pathways and largely up-regulated OIMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002883-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>), we found miR-21 and let-7i in interactions with losses of expression correlation and miR-137 in interactions that gained expression correlation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Although a growing appreciation of the importance of miRs in cancers is emerging, much remains unknown about their regulatory impact. Current knowledge appears rather scattered, focusing on single interactions between miRs and target genes of interest in a given cancer type. Here, we chose a different approach by utilizing pairwise interactions between miRs and target genes to identify combinations of important miRs (IM) and pathways in a given cancer type.</p>
      <p>A major criterion that may influence our results is the accuracy of computational methods that predict interactions between miRs and the UTRs of genes. Since such computational approaches suffer from false positives, we chose results of three different algorithms and demanded that each interaction was at least predicted twice, potentially allowing us to limit spurious signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Sethupathy1">[34]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We modeled the expression change of pathways comparing sets of cancer to non-tumor control cases as a function of the number of interactions between leading edge genes that drive the expression of a given pathway and miRs. We stress our initial assumption that the mere number of targeted LEGs in a pathway is a reasonable proxy to model the expression change of pathways in a disease, therefore allowing us to capture tumor specific effects. Although our approach did not account for any expression levels of miRs in given tumor types, we assume that the expression change of pathways is not only a matter of leading edge genes but the binding miRs as well. As such, we modeled expression change as a skeleton of miR interactions. Since such links strongly influence the flow of molecular information, we conclude that the consideration of miRs expression putatively won't override results that were largely imposed by the underlying topology of miR interactions.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, such an approach allows us to determine combinations of important miRs that potentially influence such expression changes through their targeted LEGs in the given pathways. Utilizing data of diverse cancer types, such as glioblastomas, ovarian and breast cancers, we clearly observed largely overlapping sets of IMs that were predominantly linked to differentially expressed pathways. Confirming our initial hypotheses, IMs with many pathways were predominately enriched with literature-curated cancer miRs and differentially expressed miRs. Besides, such pathway specific connections may be harnessed to predict meaningful sets of miRs that play a role in the underlying cancers. Notably, overall important miRs (OIM) in all cancer types coincided well with the most frequently indicated cancer –related miRs in different cancer types, indicating the relevance of our predictions. While the consideration of miR expression levels may change the number of IMs, such observations strongly suggest that a diminished set of OIMs will continue to show similar characteristics.</p>
      <p>Focusing on specific details of glioblastomas, ovarian and breast cancers, such cancer types are typically stratified by certain subtypes as indicated by subtle changes in gene expression profiles. While we acknowledge that pairs of pathways and important miRs may vary, we don't expect that the sets of IMs will dramatically change: considering that completely different cancer types with significant differences in their gene expression profiles provided largely overlapping sets of IMs, we expect that results that account for subtype information will be largely robust.</p>
      <p>Focusing on our set of 99 OIMs, we identified all interactions to LEGs in differentially expressed pathways. Comparing non-tumor control to disease cases, such interactions suffered partially from a massive loss of (anti-) correlation that were indicated by multimodal distributions of expression correlation changes. Dramatic changes of the expression correlation of interactions may therefore be considered to significantly influence the expression of LEGs, contributing to the perturbation of pathways in the underlying cancer types.</p>
      <p>As for qualitative observations of such OIM-LEG pairs we found that many differentially expressed miRs appeared interacting with ITPR1 in GBMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002883-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). This receptor1 is central to many signaling GBM-relevant pathways, including NGF and Plc-<bold>γ</bold>1 signaling pathways as well as insulin regulation and diabetes related pathways. miR-34a has been found to play an important role in glioblastoma as a tumor suppressor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-He1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Tazawa1">[35]</xref> while being a mediator of p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Kefas1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Zhang2">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Li1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Chang1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-He2">[39]</xref> in an interaction with a loss of expression correlation. Important targets of miR-34a included members of the Notch family and the oncogene c-met <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Li2">[40]</xref>. Specifically, we found an association of miR-34a with phospholipase C (PLCB1), which has recently been identified as a regulator of glioma cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-PhillipsMason1">[41]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The result of miR-27b was rather unexpected, since this miR has been reported up-regulated in gliomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Chen2">[42]</xref>. However, the observed discrepancy may result from the experimental setup where the up-regulated miR-27b might have resulted from an inflammatory reaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-GueraudeArellano1">[43]</xref> and originated from other than the glioma cells. Moreover, miR-27b has been identified as a pro-angiogenic miR in endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Kuehbacher1">[44]</xref> and found to be involved in tumor angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Urbich1">[45]</xref>. Regarding the up-regulation of miR-27b in glioma cells, cell culture conditions used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Chen2">[42]</xref> promote cell differentiation (medium containing fetal bovine serum) that may artificially affect the miRs expression profile. Therefore, we believe that the down-regulation of miR27b and its effects on calcium metabolism (CALM3, CACNB2) and exocytosis-related (SNAP25) genes reflect the actual situation in GBMs.</p>
      <p>The down-regulation of miR-128ab in human glioma and glioblastoma cell lines has previously been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Cui1">[46]</xref> to increase the expression of ARP5, Bmi-1 and E2F-3a, promoting neural stem cells renewal and regulate cell-cycle progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Cui1">[46]</xref>. Beside miR-128ab being important regulators of brain cell proliferation, we indicated that miR128ab may also affect expression of genes involved in energy metabolism (PFKM) and transmembrane signal transduction (SYT1, EPB41, ADCY3).</p>
      <p>miR-15b has been identified as an inhibitor of glioma growth while cyclin E1 has been found as a target of miR-15b, suggesting its role in cell cycle regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Xia1">[47]</xref>. Here, we observed that serotonin receptor 4 (HTR4) was down-regulated in glioblastoma samples, a process that is associated with up-regulation of miR-15b.</p>
      <p>The cluster composed of down-regulated pathways and largely up-regulated OIMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002883-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>) revealed miR-21, let-7i, and miR-137 to be involved in interactions with losses and gains of expression correlation, respectively.

Specifically, STAG2 encodes a subunit of cohesion, a multimeric protein complex required for cohesion of sister chromatids after DNA replication. Furthermore, STAG2 is cleaved at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition to enable chromosome segregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Sumara1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Haering1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Hanahan1">[57]</xref>. Chromosomal instability, which leads to aneuploidy, loss of heterozygosity, translocations and other chromosomal aberrations is one of the hallmarks of cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Hanahan1">[57]</xref>. Robust STAG2 expression has been shown in non-neoplastic tissues while significant fractions of glioblastomas had completely lost expression of STAG2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Solomon1">[58]</xref>, suggesting that miR-21 may have both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive effects. A link between miR-21 and the p53 pathway could be CNOT6 (Ccr4a), a deadenylase subunit of the Ccr4-Not complex that is involved in mRNA degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Dupressoir1">[59]</xref>. Ccr4a, together with Ccr4b, has been identified as a key regulator of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 5, mediating cell cycle arrest and senescence through the p53-dependent pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Kim1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Mittal1">[61]</xref>. Moreover, CNOT6 plays an important role in chemotherapy resistance to cisplatin through down-regulation of DNA-damage response by targeting Chk2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-SanchezPerez1">[62]</xref>. miR-21 expression was shown up-regulated in response to ionizing radiation while the inhibition of miR-21 enhanced the radiation-induced glioblastoma cell growth arrest and increased the level of apoptosis. While this effect may be mediated by CDC25A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Li3">[63]</xref>, our results suggested that CDC25A was targeted by miR-21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002883-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). Additionally, Cdc25A appears to be a promising therapeutic target in glioblastomas as its levels were reported to correlate with Ki-67 labeling index <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Yamashita1">[64]</xref>. Another target gene that we identified to be controlled by miR-21, SFRS3, is a pro-oncogene involved in mRNA and rRNA processing. Furthermore, SFRS3 has been reported as a critical factor for tumor induction, progression and maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Zahler1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Jia1">[66]</xref>. Lastly, the association of miR-21 with SOX2, a marker for undifferentiated and proliferating cells with up-regulated expression in glioblastomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Annovazzi1">[67]</xref> further underlined the importance of miR-21 for the pathogenesis of these tumors.</p>
      <p>Let-7 appears to be a tumor suppressor while inhibiting K-ras and C-myc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Johnson1">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Sampson1">[69]</xref>. In glioblastomas, overexpression of let-7 has been shown to decrease cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Lee1">[70]</xref>. We found a link between let-7i and integrin β3 (ITGB3) whose pro-apoptotic role has been reported in glioma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Kim2">[71]</xref>.</p>
      <p>miR-137 is also a putative tumor suppressor and is down-regulated in gliomas through a DNA hypermethylation mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Silber1">[48]</xref>. Cooperating with miR-124, miR-137 may suppress expression of phosphorylated Rb and CDK6 while inducing cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 in glioma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Silber1">[48]</xref>. Our results further suggested glioma relevant targets that are involved in AKT-mTOR signaling (MAPKAPK2 and YBX1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002883-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). The significance of other associated partners such as genes that encode ribosomal proteins RPL28 and RPS13 remains to be established.</p>
      <p>Mapping OIMs and their pathways in ovarian cancer revealed interactions between several miRs and transcription factor E2F and particularly between E2F3 and miRs-148b, -124 and -34a (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002883.s006">Fig. S6C</xref>). Indeed, miR-34a was shown to epigenetically govern the expression of E2F3 through methylation of its promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Reimer1">[72]</xref>. In our analysis, miR-132 and miR-212 gain expression correlation in interactions with SFRS1, a proto-oncogene that is involved in pre-mRNA splicing with the ability to change the splicing patterns of crucial cell cycle regulators and suppressor genes. Of particular interest is the observation that SFRS1 is up-regulated in many cancer types and therefore a potential target for cancer therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Hagopian1">[73]</xref>. Importantly, the role of these miRs and their interactions with target genes in ovarian cancers is not well understood. However, indications exist that both miRs that share a seed sequence may play a role since both miRs were found to be down-regulated by promoter methylation that contributes to pancreatic cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Park1">[74]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The down-regulation of AKT3 upon interaction with several up-regulated miRs was the highlight observation in the cluster of up-regulated pathways in breast cancers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002883.s007">Fig. S7D</xref>). AKT kinases are regulators of cell signaling in response to insulin and growth factors and are involved in a wide variety of biological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, tumorigenesis as well as glycogen synthesis and glucose uptake. In our analysis, we found that AKT3 interacted with miRs-181ac, gaining expression correlation, while miR15a, -16 and -20a lost expression correlations with their target genes. In particular, miR-15a and -16 were already indicated as relevant in different cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Aqeilan1">[75]</xref>. Furthermore, members of the miR-181 family were shown to induce sphere formation in breast cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002883-Wang2">[76]</xref>.</p>
