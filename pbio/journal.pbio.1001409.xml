        <p>NAD+ improves muscle tissue structure and function in dystrophic zebrafish by increasing basement membrane organization.</p>
      </abstract><abstract>
        <p>Muscular dystrophies are common, currently incurable diseases. A subset of dystrophies result from genetic disruptions in complexes that attach muscle fibers to their surrounding extracellular matrix microenvironment. Cell-matrix adhesions are exquisite sensors of physiological conditions and mediate responses that allow cells to adapt to changing conditions. Thus, one approach towards finding targets for future therapeutic applications is to identify cell adhesion pathways that mediate these dynamic, adaptive responses in vivo. We find that nicotinamide riboside kinase 2b-mediated NAD+ biosynthesis, which functions as a small molecule agonist of muscle fiber-extracellular matrix adhesion, corrects dystrophic phenotypes in zebrafish lacking either a primary component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex or integrin alpha7. Exogenous NAD+ or a vitamin precursor to NAD+ reduces muscle fiber degeneration and results in significantly faster escape responses in dystrophic embryos. Overexpression of paxillin, a cell adhesion protein downstream of NAD+ in this novel cell adhesion pathway, reduces muscle degeneration in zebrafish with intact integrin receptors but does not improve motility. Activation of this pathway significantly increases organization of laminin, a major component of the extracellular matrix basement membrane. Our results indicate that the primary protective effects of NAD+ result from changes to the basement membrane, as a wild-type basement membrane is sufficient to increase resilience of dystrophic muscle fibers to damage. The surprising result that NAD+ supplementation ameliorates dystrophy in dystrophin-glycoprotein complex– or integrin alpha7–deficient zebrafish suggests the existence of an additional laminin receptor complex that anchors muscle fibers to the basement membrane. We find that integrin alpha6 participates in this pathway, but either integrin alpha7 or the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex is required in conjunction with integrin alpha6 to reduce muscle degeneration. Taken together, these results define a novel cell adhesion pathway that may have future therapeutic relevance for a broad spectrum of muscular dystrophies.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>A variety of diseases, both inherited and acquired, affect muscle tissues in humans. Critical to muscle homeostasis is the anchoring of muscle fibers to their surrounding microenvironment through cell adhesion complexes that help to resist the repeated stress experienced during muscle contraction. Genetic mutations in these complexes weaken this mechanical attachment, making fibers more susceptible to damage and death. The resulting increased fiber degeneration can eventually lead to progressive muscle-wasting diseases, known collectively as muscular dystrophies. Although clinical trials are ongoing, there is presently no way to cure the loss of muscle structure and function associated with these diseases. We identified a novel cell adhesion pathway involving integrin alpha6 that promotes adhesion of muscle cells to their microenvironment. Here, we show that activation of this pathway not only significantly reduces muscle degeneration but also improves the swimming ability of dystrophic zebrafish. We explore the likely benefits and limitations of this pathway in treating symptoms of congenital muscular dystrophies. Our findings suggest that activation of this pathway (for example, by boosting levels of NAD+) has the potential to ameliorate loss of muscle structure and function in multiple muscular dystrophies.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The extracellular matrix (ECM) connects to the intracellular actin cytoskeleton via transmembrane receptor complexes. These adhesion complexes not only serve as scaffolds for tissue architecture but also function as sensors of physiological change and signal transduction hubs. Thus, adhesion complexes facilitate cell adaptation to changing conditions during development, aging, injury response, and disease. Perhaps not surprisingly, the onset and progression of many diseases is affected by disrupted cell-ECM interactions. Despite the fact that modulating cell-ECM adhesion could be exploited for therapeutic purposes, the dynamic regulation of cell-ECM adhesion in vivo is not well understood.</p>
      <p>Muscles and tendons function as an integrated unit to transduce force to the skeletal system and stabilize joints. Cell-ECM adhesions mechanically link muscles to tendons and are required for muscle physiology and homeostasis. Many muscle diseases, such as Duchenne, Becker, Merosin-deficient muscular dystrophies, and congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) with integrin deficiency, result from mutations that disrupt adhesion of muscle fibers to their surrounding basement membrane (BM), a substructure within the ECM. This weakened link between muscle fibers and the BM results in increased susceptibility to fiber damage and death during repeated cycles of contraction and relaxation. Due to the continuous bidirectional communication between cells and their surrounding BM, muscle atrophy is also accompanied by degeneration of the ECM microenvironment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Morgan1">[1]</xref>. As the BM also provides support for satellite cells that mediate muscle repair, augmenting the BM is a potential strategy to improve muscle structure and regenerative capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Moll1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Jacoby1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Muscle fibers are known to utilize two receptor complexes to adhere to laminin in the BM, the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) and integrin alpha7beta1 heterodimers. Disruption of components in either complex can lead to muscle disease. Dystroglycan (UniProtKB accession number Q8JHU7_DANRE) is a major component of the DGC and consists of two subunits (alpha and beta) transcribed from the same locus, DAG1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-IbraghimovBeskrovnaya1">[5]</xref>. Beta-Dystroglycan is a transmembrane subunit that indirectly links to the intracellular cytoskeleton, and alpha-Dystroglycan binds to laminin and agrin in the BM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Gee1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Ervasti1">[8]</xref>. Humans with mutations in <italic>DAG1</italic> have cognitive impairment and mild myopathy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Frost1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Hara1">[10]</xref>. Alpha-Dystroglycan is heavily glycosylated and these post-translational modifications are critical for binding of alpha-Dystroglycan to BM ligands and BM deposition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Gee1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Inamori1">[11]</xref>. Mutations in six genes required for normal glycosylation of alpha-Dystroglycan have been identified thus far, and the resultant diseases are commonly referred to as the dystroglycanopathies (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Godfrey1">[12]</xref>). These diseases show a wide clinical spectrum with only modest correlation between genotype and clinical phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Godfrey1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Mercuri1">[13]</xref>. Screening patient populations suggests that there are as yet unidentified genes involved in dystroglycanopathies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-JimenezMallebrera1">[14]</xref>. There are zebrafish orthologues of all six dystroglycanopathy genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Steffen1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Moore1">[16]</xref>. Morpholinos (MOs) against two of these genes have been characterized, and both lead to muscle degeneration (Fukutin related protein Q0PIP5_DANRE, LARGE 2 LARG2_DANRE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Moore1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Lin1">[17]</xref>. Thus, the zebrafish system may provide a genetically and embryologically accessible model to complement investigations in mammalian model systems.</p>
      <p>Both the DGC and integrin alpha7beta1 heterodimers contribute to force production in mouse muscle, but only the DGC is required to maintain the attachment between the muscle cell membrane (sarcolemma) and the surrounding BM during lengthening contractions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Han1">[18]</xref>. Integrin alpha7 (E7FGC7_DANRE), in contrast, functions primarily at MTJs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Mayer1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-VanDerFlier1">[20]</xref>. Despite their differing roles in sarcolemma-BM attachment, these two receptor complexes can partially compensate for one another <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Banks1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Doe1">[23]</xref>, and mutations in components of both receptor complexes greatly exacerbate the extent of muscle atrophy in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Rooney1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Guo1">[25]</xref>. These data suggest that dynamic cell-ECM signaling mediates adaptive responses when normal muscle architecture is perturbed. Thus, one therapeutic approach is to enhance the intrinsic compensatory relationships between cell adhesion proteins and their ECM microenvironment by potentiating the adhesion of the alternate complex to the BM.</p>
      <p>Vertebrate muscle is derived from somites, segmentally reiterated structures delineated by the formation of somite boundaries. As development proceeds, a subset of somitic cells generate muscle, and the somite boundary gives rise to the myotendinous junction (MTJ), which is the major site of force transmission from muscle to the skeletal system. In zebrafish, elongation of fast-twitch muscle fibers and their subsequent attachment to the MTJ correlates with an increase in laminin polymerization at the MTJ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Snow1">[26]</xref>. We have identified a novel cell adhesion pathway required for laminin polymerization at the MTJ in vivo. We found that Nicotinamide riboside kinase 2b (Nrk2b Q7ZUR6_DANRE)-mediated NAD+ synthesis potentiates laminin polymerization and subcellular localization of paxillin (Q6R3L1_DANRE), an integrin-associated adaptor protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Goody1">[27]</xref>. Yeast and human Nrks function in an alternative salvage pathway that generates Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD+) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Bieganowski1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Tempel1">[29]</xref>. Exogenous NAD+ rescues MTJ morphogenesis in Nrk2b-deficient zebrafish embryos, indicating that zebrafish Nrk2b also functions to generate NAD+. Our previous results showing a requirement for Nrk2b-generated NAD+ in initial BM morphogenesis lead us to hypothesize that activation of the Nrk2b pathway, either through chemical (NAD+ supplementation) or gene therapy (paxillin overexpression) approaches, would be sufficient to activate the intrinsic compensation between cell-ECM adhesion proteins and result in a novel method of BM augmentation. Herein we will investigate whether the Nrk2b pathway can be exploited to augment laminin polymerization and thus improve muscle tissue structure and function in dystrophic embryos.</p>
      <p>Zebrafish deficient for Dag1 display progressive muscle atrophy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Parsons1">[30]</xref>. Here, we show that muscle atrophy is preceded by degeneration of the MTJ BM. As we previously showed that Nrk2b-mediated NAD+ synthesis is necessary for MTJ BM organization during development; we hypothesized that exogenous NAD+ would improve MTJ BM organization in <italic>dag1</italic> morphants. Indeed, supplementation of <italic>dag1</italic> morphants with NAD+ or a vitamin precursor of NAD+ significantly improved muscle structure. Muscle function was also improved: NAD+- or Emergen-C-supplemented <italic>dag1</italic> morphants swam faster after a touch stimulus. Nrk2 interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of integrin beta1 in the integrin alpha7beta1 complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Li1">[31]</xref>. Surprisingly, exogenous NAD+ reduced muscle degeneration in <italic>integrin alpha7</italic> (<italic>itga7</italic>) morphants, indicating that Itga7 is not the only integrin in the Nrk2b pathway. We find that the mechanism of action of zebrafish Nrk2b involves a different integrin receptor for laminin, integrin alpha6 (Itga6 A8WHQ8_DANRE). The intracellular cell-ECM adhesion protein paxillin is downstream of Nrk2b-mediated NAD+ synthesis during MTJ development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Goody1">[27]</xref>. Paxillin overexpression was sufficient to improve laminin organization and significantly reduce muscle defects in <italic>dag1</italic> morphants. Taken together, these results suggest manipulation of NAD+ precursors/biosynthetic enzymes and paxillin as new potential therapeutic approaches for treatment of not only muscle diseases but also diseases/syndromes that affect laminin integrity.</p>

        <p>Dystroglycan null mice die around the time of implantation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Williamson1">[32]</xref>. In contrast, zebrafish <italic>dag1</italic> is maternally expressed, Dag1-deficient zebrafish gastrulate, and initial muscle fiber development is normal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Parsons1">[30]</xref>. Staining for laminin-111 in the ECM microenvironment of Dag1-deficient zebrafish muscle showed that initial BM development is also normal at 1 day post-fertilization (dpf) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Goody1">[27]</xref>. At this point in time, laminin-111 is thought to be the major laminin heterotrimer present <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Sztal1">[33]</xref>. Given the critical role of the ECM microenvironment in maintaining fiber integrity, we asked whether the MTJ BM degenerates over time. Although laminin concentrated at the MTJ BM in 2 dpf <italic>dag1</italic> morphants, staining intensity was variable (white arrowhead, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001409-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). 3-D reconstruction of laminin-111 highlighted inconsistencies in the MTJ BM in <italic>dag1</italic> morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001409-g001">Figure 1A1–A2</xref>; white arrowheads show holes in the MTJ BM). Because we have shown that Nrk2b-mediated NAD+ synthesis is <italic>necessary</italic> for normal organization of the MTJ BM at 1 dpf, we asked whether exogenous NAD+ would be <italic>sufficient</italic> to improve MTJ BM structure at 2 dpf in <italic>dag1</italic> morphants.

To quantify these observations, we used a mathematical formalism, the 2DWTMM (2-dimensional wavelet transform modulus maxima) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Goody1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Arnedo1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Snow2">[36]</xref>, to interrogate MTJ BM structure. The MTJ BM was significantly more organized in NAD+-supplemented <italic>dag1</italic> morphants compared to untreated morphants. This increased organization is visually represented by the parallel alignment of vectors oriented in the direction of the maximal intensity gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001409-g001">Figure 1A3, B3</xref>). The anisotropy factor (a readout of organization) is derived from the sum of the vectors and is significantly higher in NAD+-supplemented <italic>dag1</italic> morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001409-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, **<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, *<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05).

        <title>A Normal MTJ BM Microenvironment Is Sufficient to Rescue the Structure of Dystrophic Muscle</title>
        <p>NAD+ supplementation significantly increases MTJ BM organization <italic>prior</italic> to the onset of dystrophy. This result suggests that the mechanism of action of NAD+ could be through BM augmentation. If NAD+ supplementation reduces the incidence of dystrophy via laminin augmentation, NAD+ would not protect against muscle degeneration in <italic>laminin</italic> mutant zebrafish. We asked if laminin is required for NAD+-mediated amelioration of dystrophy by utilizing <italic>laminin gamma1</italic> mutant zebrafish, which display muscle degeneration starting at 3 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001409-g002">Figure 2I</xref>, laminin gamma1 UniProtKB accession number Q1LVF0 LAMC1_DANRE). <italic>laminin gamma1</italic> mutants supplemented with exogenous NAD+ showed no improvement in the incidence of dystrophy compared to untreated mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001409-g002">Figure 2I–J</xref>). This result shows that laminin is required for NAD+-mediated reduction of fiber detachment and supports our hypothesis that the protective effects of NAD+ occur through BM augmentation. This result also aligns with our previous finding that NAD+ reduces MTJ failure in 2 dpf <italic>nrk2b</italic> morphants but not <italic>laminin beta1</italic> morphants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Goody1">[27]</xref>. Together, these results strongly suggest that the protective effects of NAD+ supplementation on MTJ failure and fiber detachment result from augmentation of laminin in the BM.</p>
        <p>We used genetic mosaic analysis to further test our hypothesis. If the DGC is required cell autonomously for maintenance of muscle fiber adhesion, we would predict that <italic>dag1</italic> morphant cells in control hosts would degenerate as observed in <italic>dag1</italic> morphants. If, however, a normal BM provides a supportive environment for muscle fibers, we would predict that <italic>dag1</italic> morphant cells would be less likely to degenerate in control embryos. To discriminate between these two outcomes, we transplanted fluorescent dextran-labeled <italic>dag1</italic> morphant cells into control embryo hosts at the blastula stage, grew the embryos until 3 dpf, and asked whether <italic>dag1</italic> morphant cells were viable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001409-g002">Figure 2K</xref>). The vast majority of <italic>dag1</italic> morphant cells were viable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001409-g002">Figure 2L</xref>). Only 10 out of 523 transplanted <italic>dag1</italic> morphant cells (1.9%) detached from the MTJ BM. The incidence of fiber detachment per embryo in transplant hosts was significantly less than in <italic>dag1</italic> morphant embryos (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). In addition, <italic>dag1</italic> morphant cells fused with fluorescent dextran-labeled control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001409-g002">Figure 2L</xref>, fusion indicated by pink cells). A more rigorous test of our hypothesis would be to ask whether Dag1-deficient cells are more likely to detach in control hosts when muscle tissue is stressed. We repeatedly stimulated transplant host embryos to swim through a viscous medium as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Hall1">[39]</xref>. Of the 491 Dag1-deficient cells analyzed in 15 stressed host embryos, only 12 cells (2.4%) detached from the MTJ. Although a higher percentage of morphant cells detached in stressed hosts versus nonstressed hosts, the incidence of dystrophy per embryo did not significantly differ depending on stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001409-g002">Figure 2M</xref>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.81) and was still significantly different than in <italic>dag1</italic> morphants (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). These data clearly indicate that local integrity of the ECM microenvironment is sufficient for muscle cell adhesion and that Dag1 is not required cell autonomously for maintenance of this adhesion.</p>

        <title>Itga7 Is Required for Nrk2b-NAD+-Laminin-Mediated Reduction of Dystrophy in <italic>dag1</italic> Morphants</title>
        <p>The two “canonical” laminin receptors in muscle tissue are the DGC and integrin alpha7beta1 receptor complexes. Itga7 is disrupted in CMD with integrin deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Hayashi1">[41]</xref>. As the DGC is not required for Nrk2b-NAD+-laminin-mediated reduction of dystrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001409-g002">Figure 2</xref>), we asked if Itga7 is required for the amelioration of dystrophy in <italic>dag1</italic> morphants by exogenous NAD+. A zebrafish model of CMD with integrin deficiency has been generated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Mayer1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Postel1">[42]</xref>. Muscle degeneration in <italic>itga7</italic> morphants is apparent at approximately 4.5 dpf. One critical axis to consider when evaluating muscle homeostasis is whether initial muscle morphogenesis is disrupted. It is not known if initial muscle development proceeds normally in <italic>itga7</italic> morphants. We analyzed muscle morphogenesis at 26 hpf and found that both MTJ and muscle fiber development appeared normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001409-g003">Figure 3A–B</xref>). We next generated <italic>dag1;itga7</italic> double morphant embryos by co-injecting half the functional doses of <italic>dag1</italic> and <italic>itga7</italic> MOs. Surprisingly, given that early MTJ morphogenesis appears grossly unaffected in single morphants, MTJ morphogenesis was disrupted in double morphants. MTJ angles were abnormally wide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001409-g003">Figure 3C,E</xref>), similar to <italic>laminin beta1</italic> and <italic>gamma1</italic> mutant embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Parsons2">[43]</xref>. This disruption in MTJ development is dramatically greater than would be predicted based upon the individual phenotypes and suggests Dag1- and Itga7-mediated adhesion to laminin is synergistically required for MTJ morphogenesis. This was surprising given that MTJ morphogenesis appears normal in single morphants. We next asked whether exogenous NAD+ would rescue initial MTJ morphogenesis in <italic>dag1;itga7</italic> morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001409-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). We found that MTJ angles in NAD+-supplemented <italic>dag1;itga7</italic> morphants were significantly different from untreated double morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001409-g003">Figure 3E</xref>, 103.03±1.41 degrees versus 107.74±1.16 degrees, respectively; **<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, *<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05).

        <p>The above data indicate that Itga7 and Dag1 are synergistic with regards to initial muscle development, but NAD+ supplementation is sufficient to improve MTJ development in <italic>itga7;dag1</italic> double morphant embryos.

However, qualitatively, fewer fibers per myotome were detached (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001409-g003">Figure 3C to 3D</xref>; we were unable to reliably count detached fibers in myotomes with severe degeneration and thus could not quantitate this observation). Taken together, these data indicate that Itga7 is required for NAD+-mediated reduction of dystrophy in <italic>dag1</italic> morphants and that NAD+ supplementation is not sufficient to reduce the frequency of myotomes with muscle degeneration when both canonical laminin receptors (Dag1, Itga7) are compromised.</p>
        <p>The above data clearly show that Itga7 plays a role in NAD+-mediated reduction of dystrophy in <italic>dag1</italic> morphants.

        <p>Interestingly, <italic>itga6</italic> has recently been implicated in muscle development and regeneration in multiple mammalian species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Bajanca1">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Castaldo1">[49]</xref>. We asked whether <italic>itga6</italic> expression is upregulated in <italic>dag1</italic> morphant zebrafish in dystrophic lesions where regeneration is occurring. As in other vertebrates, <italic>itga6</italic> expression was low in zebrafish muscle but clearly visible in dystrophic lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001409-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, red arrowheads). Given these recent results, combined with our data showing upregulation of <italic>itga6</italic> in <italic>dag1</italic> morphants, we hypothesized that Itga6 is involved in the Nrk2b-NAD+-laminin pathway. We tested this hypothesis by using morpholino (MO)-mediated knockdown. We first characterized MOs against <italic>itga6</italic>. Injection of varying amounts/combinations of two different, nonoverlapping, translation-blocking MOs showed that both MOs generated the same phenotype and acted synergistically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001409-g004">Figure 4C–I</xref>). The <italic>itga6</italic> morphant phenotype was nearly identical to that of <italic>laminin beta1</italic> and <italic>gamma1</italic> mutants and <italic>nrk2b</italic> morphants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Goody1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Snow2">[36]</xref>. This striking phenotypic similarity suggested that <italic>itga6</italic> may function in the Nrk2b-NAD+-laminin pathway. To confirm that Itga6 acts in laminin signaling/adhesion, we conducted pseudo-genetic epistasis analysis. The transcripts for <italic>laminin beta1</italic> and <italic>gamma1</italic> are maternally expressed. Thus, injection of <italic>laminin beta1/gamma1</italic> MOs into <italic>laminin beta1/gamma1</italic> mutants slightly worsens the phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Dolez1">[50]</xref>.

        <title>Paxillin Overexpression Is Sufficient to Increase MTJ BM Structure and Decrease Fiber Detachment in <italic>dag1</italic> Morphants</title>
        <p>We previously showed that the integrin-associated adaptor protein paxillin functions downstream of Nrk2b-mediated NAD+ synthesis during MTJ development: paxillin overexpression is sufficient to rescue MTJ morphogenesis in <italic>nrk2b</italic> morphants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Goody1">[27]</xref>. Thus, likely through “inside-out” signaling via laminin receptors, paxillin is sufficient to affect the ECM microenvironment.

Paxillin concentration at the MTJ was slightly disrupted in <italic>dag1</italic> morphants at 26 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001409-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).

        <p>As paxillin does not require Dag1 for BM augmentation-mediated reduction of dystrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001409-g006">Figure 6</xref>), we asked whether integrin receptors are required.

As paxillin is an integrin adaptor protein, it is perhaps not surprising that paxillin-mediated BM augmentation requires functional integrin receptors for laminin. Our results suggest that Dag1, but not Itga6 or Itga7, is required for localization of paxillin to the MTJ and that the beneficial effects of overexpressing paxillin in Dag1-deficient muscle tissue may result from increasing the amount of MTJ-proximal paxillin involved in inside-out signaling via integrin receptors for laminin.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Tissue homeostasis, especially when tissue is stressed, requires cellular adaptations. Such adaptations are executed by a variety of mechanisms and lead to numerous potential outcomes such as hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and metaplasia, among others. Interactions between cells and their ECM microenvironment may play roles in skeletal muscle adaptation because cell-ECM adhesion complexes sense multiple types of physiological changes and interface with every major signaling pathway. Thus, cell-ECM adhesion complexes are in a prime position to facilitate appropriate responses to physiological change. However, in muscle disorders such as muscular dystrophies, sarcopenia, and denervation injuries, tissue structure is disrupted to such a degree that normal cellular adaptive responses are not sufficient to compensate. In zebrafish embryos deficient for Dag1 or Itga7, transmembrane receptor proteins involved in anchoring the sarcolemma of muscle cells to the BM, the consequence of disrupted cell adhesion is detachment and death of muscle fibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Parsons1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Postel1">[42]</xref>. Here, we show that addition of a small molecule, NAD+, is sufficient to increase the organization of the muscle cell microenvironment in dystrophic zebrafish. Exogenous NAD+ is sufficient to reduce dystrophy when either Itga7 or Dag1 is compromised because this pathway also functions through a different laminin receptor, Itga6. Pseudo-genetic epistasis experiments show that either Dag1 or Itga7 is required with Itga6 for the effects of exogenous NAD+ on reduction of dystrophy. Finally, we show that NAD+ plays a dual role in ameliorating dystrophy: NAD+-mediated paxillin clustering improves muscle structure and adhesion, but NAD+ acts independently of paxillin to improve motility. Taken together, these data provide fundamental new insights into the adaptability of cell adhesion mechanisms in vivo and the phenotypic consequences of this adaptability.</p>

        <title>The ECM Microenvironment: A Dynamic Structure Sufficient to Guide Morphological Change</title>
        <p>A fundamental question is how tissue architecture is generated and maintained during development and homeostasis. The mechanical linkage of cells to BMs, substructures in the ECM, is necessary for cell viability and physiological homeostasis. Laminins are heterotrimeric proteins necessary for BM assembly. <italic>laminin</italic> mutations lead to multiple diseases including myopathies, junctional epidermolysis bullosa, laryngo-oncho-cutaneous syndrome, and microcoria-congenital nephritic syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Tzu1">[53]</xref>. Tissue-specific function of laminin isoforms arises not only through regulated expression but also through the generation of splice variants and post-translational glycosylation and processing. Despite the apparent tissue specificity of laminin function, multiple experiments indicate that, at least in the context of muscle biology, alternate BM components can partially compensate and restore cell-ECM adhesion when one laminin chain is disrupted. Mutations in <italic>laminin alpha2</italic> cause a severe congenital muscular dystrophy, MDC1A. Overexpression of either laminin alpha1, laminin-111, or mini-agrin, an ECM protein that can link with the DGC, slows the progression of dystrophy in <italic>laminin alpha2</italic> mutant mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Moll1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Bentzinger1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Gawlik1">[54]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Rooney2">[55]</xref>. Recent data indicate that laminin-111 protein therapy can also reverse muscle disease even when the gene mutated encodes an intracellular protein. Injection of laminin-111 protein directly into muscle of DMD mice dramatically improves muscle structure and function by increasing Itga7 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Rooney3">[56]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Here, we show that disorganized laminin-111 in the MTJ BM of Dag1-deficient zebrafish muscle tissue can be significantly improved by exogenous NAD+. We implicate laminin-111 organization in prolonging cell-ECM adhesion and fiber viability by showing that <italic>laminin gamma1</italic> is required for NAD+-mediated reduction of fiber detachment. Furthermore, we used genetic mosaic analysis to directly assess the role of a normally organized MTJ BM microenvironment on cell-ECM adhesion and muscle fiber viability in Dag1-deficient muscle cells. <italic>dag1</italic> MO-injected cells were transplanted into control embryos. Dag1-deficient muscle cells developed normally, and sarcomeres formed in the viable Dag1-deficient fibers. Significantly, only 1.9% of Dag1-deficient fibers in control embryos detached from the wild-type ECM microenvironment. Our findings suggest that proper organization of the ECM microenvironment plays a crucial role in maintenance of cell-ECM adhesion and fiber viability and thus muscle tissue homeostasis. Another striking example of how the ECM microenvironment impacts muscle cells is seen in how sarcomere morphogenesis changes depending upon the elastic moduli of hydrogels. The highest percent of sarcomerogenesis (60%) was observed after culture on a relatively elastic hydrogel (15 kPa) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Serena1">[57]</xref>. Taken together, these data suggest not only that the composition and physical properties of the ECM influence muscle structure but that local organization of the ECM can be dynamic and organizational state plays a critical role in muscle cell health. In addition, these data raise the possibility that a better understanding of the effects of ECM dynamics on cell and tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis, and the use of supplements like NAD+ to increase ECM organization, could improve in vitro tissue synthesis and regenerative medicine.</p>

        <title>Unique and Redundant Roles for the Laminin Receptor Proteins Integrin alpha7, Integrin alpha6, and Dystroglycan</title>
        <p>Many studies have highlighted the complex, dynamic, and redundant interactions between integrin alpha7beta1 and the DGC in muscle disease. Although both of these laminin receptors have unique functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Han1">[18]</xref>, they can partially compensate for each other in adhesion to laminin. Expression of the uncompromised complex's components can be upregulated in dystrophy, mutations in both complexes exacerbate dystrophy, and overexpression of alternate complex components can alleviate dystrophy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Banks1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Guo1">[25]</xref>. Because exogenous NAD+ ameliorates dystrophy in embryos deficient for the DGC, we predicted that integrin alpha7beta1 would be required for reduction of dystrophy in <italic>dag1</italic> morphants. In support of this, we found that the frequency of myotomes with muscle degeneration in <italic>dag1;itga7</italic> double morphants was not significantly improved by NAD+. Surprisingly, however, overall muscle structure improved in NAD+-supplemented <italic>dag1;itga7</italic> double morphants. This result suggests (1) the existence of an additional laminin receptor downstream of NAD+ in the Nrk2b pathway, and (2) this receptor partially compensates when Dag1 and Itga7 are disrupted. We identified this receptor as Itga6. Compared to Itga7 and Dag1, far less is known about Itga6 function. Mutations in human <italic>itga6</italic> lead to epidermolysis bullosa with pyloric atresia (severe skin blistering with life-threatening obstruction of the digestive tract). The mouse <italic>itga6</italic> mutant is even more severe; mutant embryos die at birth with severe skin blistering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-GeorgesLabouesse1">[58]</xref>. Thus, at first glance, our results implicating Itga6 in muscle development and homeostasis are surprising. However, Itga6 is downstream of Myf5 and required for laminin assembly and normal myogenesis in mouse embryo explants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Bajanca1">[46]</xref>. Itga6 expression is a biomarker for highly myogenic cell populations in muscle tissue and required for normal myogenic differentiation and myotube formation of a porcine muscle progenitor cell population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Wilschut1">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Wilschut2">[48]</xref>. Itga6 and laminin1 also play key roles in regeneration of CD117-positive cells in adult human pathological hearts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Castaldo1">[49]</xref>. These studies, along with our data, suggest that Itga6 does play a role in muscle physiology and may in fact be a key player in muscle tissue adaptation to stress.</p>
        <p>Adhesion to laminin is required for initial MTJ development: MTJs in <italic>laminin beta1</italic> and <italic>gamma1</italic> mutant embryos are significantly wider than in wild-type embryos. The laminin receptors that mediate initial MTJ morphogenesis were not known. Our data indicate that Itga6 is the main laminin receptor mediating MTJ morphogenesis. MTJ angles are significantly wider in <italic>itga6</italic> morphants or <italic>dag1;itga6</italic> double morphant embryos compared to controls. MTJ development is not rescued when <italic>itga6</italic> or <italic>dag1;itga6</italic> morphants are supplemented with NAD+, indicating that Itga6 is necessary for the role of NAD+ in MTJ development. Although both <italic>dag1</italic> and <italic>itga7</italic> are expressed early in zebrafish development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Parsons1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Postel1">[42]</xref>, MTJ angles are normal in <italic>dag1</italic> or <italic>itga7</italic> single morphants. However, we show that MTJ angles are wider than normal in <italic>dag1;itga7</italic> double morphants. This result suggests that these two laminin receptors are required for normal MTJ development but function redundantly. MTJ angles in <italic>dag1;itga7</italic> double morphants are significantly narrower when incubated in NAD+, suggesting that Itga6 is sufficient to compensate for the decreased adhesion to laminin in <italic>dag1;itga7</italic> double morphants. Taken together, these results suggest that Itga6 is the major laminin receptor necessary and sufficient for mediating early muscle and MTJ morphogenesis, but that Itga7 and Dag1 also contribute.</p>
        <p>Muscle homeostasis also requires adhesion to laminin. In this instance, however, integrin alpha7beta1 and the DGC are the main laminin receptors mediating muscle stability. Muscle degenerates in zebrafish embryos deficient for either <italic>dag1</italic> or <italic>itga7</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Parsons1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Postel1">[42]</xref>. Exogenous NAD+ increases laminin organization and reduces dystrophy in embryos deficient for either <italic>dag1</italic> or <italic>itga7</italic>. Pseudo-genetic epistasis analysis indicates that both <italic>itga7</italic> and <italic>itga6</italic> are necessary for NAD+-mediated amelioration of dystrophy in <italic>dag1</italic> morphants. Our data suggest that all three laminin receptors play unique roles in MTJ development and muscle homeostasis. However, when one receptor is compromised, the other receptors can partially compensate and NAD+ supplementation potentiates this compensatory response by facilitating increased laminin organization in an integrin-dependent manner.</p>

        <title>Paxillin and Basement Membrane Organization</title>
        <p>Paxillin overexpression is also sufficient to restore laminin organization in dystrophic zebrafish. Paxillin is an essential signaling nexus that regulates cell adhesion, morphology, and migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Deakin1">[59]</xref>. Depending upon context, paxillin potentiates either the assembly or disassembly of cell-ECM adhesion complexes. The robust concentration of paxillin at MTJs during muscle development suggested a role for paxillin in maintaining muscle structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Crawford1">[60]</xref>. Here we show that overexpression of paxillin in <italic>dag1</italic> morphants increases organization of laminin-111 at the MTJ and reduces dystrophy. These results clearly implicate paxillin in playing a fundamental role in muscle homeostasis. It is very interesting that paxillin overexpression does not rescue morphogenesis/reduce dystrophy in <italic>itga6</italic> or <italic>itga7</italic> morphants. There are at least three possible explanations for why Itga6 and Itga7, but not Dag1, are required for paxillin overexpression-mediated restoration of muscle structure. One is that the subcellular localization of paxillin to MTJs is critical for paxillin function: paxillin localization is disrupted in <italic>dag1</italic> morphants, but not in <italic>itga6</italic> or <italic>itga7</italic> morphants. Overexpression of paxillin restores localization of paxillin to MTJs in <italic>dag1</italic> morphants and reduces dystrophy. Another scenario that would explain these results is that paxillin modulates “inside-out” signaling via Itga6 and Itga7. Paxillin localization to Itga6 and Itga7 containing cell-ECM adhesions may directly or indirectly cause these laminin receptors to adopt their high-affinity conformation, thus increasing adhesion to laminin. Finally, paxillin could be required to recruit the exocyst to the MTJ. The exocyst traffics vesicles to subdomains within the membrane and is critical for efficient exocytosis of integrins. Paxillin binding to an exocyst component, Sec5, mediates proper subcellular localization of exocyst complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Spiczka1">[61]</xref>. Thus, one mechanism by which paxillin could function upstream of Itga6 and Itga7 is modulation of exocyst localization. Intriguingly, another component of the exocyst is Arf6, which would require NAD+ as a cofactor for ADP-ribosylation of its targets. Our results clearly show that MTJ-localized paxillin is sufficient to impact local organization of the ECM microenvironment. It will be very interesting to determine the mechanism(s) of action and elucidate why paxillin—one of a thousand focal adhesion proteins—plays such a critical role. As paxillin is ubiquitously expressed and necessary for early development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Hagel1">[62]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Mazaki1">[63]</xref>, understanding how paxillin improves laminin organization in <italic>dag1</italic> morphants may provide insight into paxillin function in other tissues as well.</p>

        <title>Moving Toward Viable Therapeutic Options for Myopathies</title>
        <p>Congenital muscular dystrophies are a heterogeneous group of early-onset progressive muscle-wasting diseases. In animal models of CMDs where sarcolemma integrity remains intact prior to fiber detachment, BM augmentation has been proposed and implemented as a successful approach to maintain muscle fiber viability. Interestingly, multiple different methods of BM augmentation have proved beneficial. In <italic>laminin beta2</italic> mutant zebrafish, initial failure between muscle fibers and the MTJ BM is compensated for by newly formed ectopic BMs at the detached ends of fibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Jacoby1">[4]</xref>. Gene therapy approaches involving the expression of synthetic BM components are sufficient to reduce myopathy in mouse models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Moll1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Bentzinger1">[3]</xref>. We show that modulation of the ECM microenvironment by the small molecule NAD+ also ameliorates muscle degeneration. In dystrophin-deficient zebrafish, where sarcolemma integrity is compromised prior to fiber detachment, a screen of chemicals approved for human use revealed that a nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor best restored muscle structure by activating cAMP-dependent PKA signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Kawahara1">[64]</xref>. These reports highlight the importance of classifying the etiology of fiber degeneration, as different myopathies may respond better to certain treatment approaches. In addition, investigation of combinatorial therapeutic approaches may prove most useful.</p>
        <p>Along with muscle degeneration, CMDs can also present with joint and skeletal deformities and mental retardation. In dystrophic zebrafish, we find that NAD+ supplementation improves both muscle structure and mobility, but paxillin overexpression only improves muscle structure. Thus, in this system, structure does not beget function. It is perhaps not surprising that NAD+ contributes to the development and functioning of tissues other than muscle. Neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's are associated with reduced NAD+ levels and increasing NAD+ metabolism slows neuronal degeneration in vitro. Although the exact mechanisms are not known, the neuroprotective effects of NAD+ are thought to be mediated by poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs), which play critical roles in genome stability, DNA repair, and telomere maintenance. In the case of ischemia, it is thought that the oxidative stress brought on by reperfusion with oxygen can cause DNA damage. This damage then activates the PARP-1 cascade and results in rapid depletion of NAD+. Energy within the cell quickly becomes limiting and may cause cell death. Evidence for this hypothesis comes from the fact that <italic>PARP</italic>−/− mice show reduced tissue damage and protected NAD+ metabolism in cerebral ischemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Eliasson1">[65]</xref>. In a similar vein, nicotinamide treatment has been shown to allay the effects of fetal alcohol syndrome in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Ieraci1">[66]</xref>. This may be an important intervention for early neuronal damage during fetal development. Given these data, it is tempting to speculate that NAD+ may contribute to neuromuscular junction development or prolong/enhance signaling through neuromuscular junctions, thus contributing to improved motility in dystrophic zebrafish. As many NAD+ biosynthetic enzymes and precursors/metabolites are both required and cytoprotective in muscle and neural tissues, downstream targets of NAD+ signaling are promising potential therapies for multiple symptoms of muscle degeneration, including fiber atrophy, reduced motor function, and mental retardation.</p>
        <p>The experiments shown here were undertaken because we had previously shown that Nrk2b-mediated NAD+ biosynthesis is necessary for laminin organization during myotendinous junction development. An alternate method to NAD+ supplementation in vivo is vitamin supplementation with a precursor to NAD+, such as niacin. Water-soluble Emergen-C packets that contain niacin were added to ERM and were sufficient to reduce muscle degeneration in <italic>dag1</italic> morphants. This result suggests the hypothesis that maternal and fetal nutrition may partly explain the variable progression and age of onset of some dystrophies. Clearly, vitamins other than niacin in the packets could contribute to the reduction of dystrophy. However, given that the reduction in muscle degeneration is similar in NAD+-supplemented, Emergen-C-supplemented, and paxillin-overexpressing <italic>dag1</italic> morphants, it seems unlikely that other vitamins are causing this effect.</p>
        <p>Niacin has been used clinically for decades to manage dyslipidemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Altschul1">[67]</xref>. Although the mechanism of action is not well understood, it is known that niacin increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) independently of NAD+ synthesis. An extended release form of niacin, Niaspan, has been used in combination with statins that lower LDL levels to treat cardiovascular disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Hausenloy1">[68]</xref>. However, NIH recently aborted a clinical trial combining niacin and statin therapy because the combination therapy did not decrease cardiovascular events in patients with heart and vascular disease and the risk of stroke was slightly increased (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nih.gov/news/health/may2011/nhlbi-26.htm" xlink:type="simple">http://www.nih.gov/news/health/may2011/nhlbi-26.htm</ext-link>). Thus, it is not clear whether niacin will continue to be prescribed for cardiovascular disease. However, recent experiments in rats suggest other possible therapeutic uses for niacin. Niaspan is neuroprotective after stroke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Shehadah1">[69]</xref> and slows the progression of chronic kidney disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001409-Cho1">[70]</xref>. Our data suggest that the currently tractable approach of vitamin supplementation may warrant continued investigation.</p>

      <title>Summary</title>
      <p>One of the advantages of using a “4D” system such as muscle development in vivo is the depth of dynamic range that cells exhibit in response to changes in cell signaling, cell adhesion, and the biophysics of the surrounding microenvironment. These processes allow cells to adapt to changing conditions during development, aging, injury response, and repair. We show that one such adaptive response—an increase in ECM organization mediated by the Nrk2b pathway—is sufficient to improve the resilience of muscle in dystrophic zebrafish. There are three laminin receptors expressed in muscle. The “canonical” receptors, Dag1 and Itga7, are highly expressed and, when mutated, lead to congenital muscular dystrophies. Here we implicate a “non-canonical” laminin receptor, Itga6, in the Nrk2b pathway. Recent findings from mouse, pig, and human cells, along with our data utilizing zebrafish embryos, suggest a conserved and previously unrecognized role for Itga6 in promoting muscle regeneration and homeostasis. Genetic mosaic analysis shows that the main effect of the Nrk2b pathway is an increase in structure of the ECM. A series of pseudo-genetic epistasis experiments with these three laminin receptors indicate that Dag1 or Itga7 is required along with Itga6 for NAD+ to reduce dystrophy. Taken together, these data suggest that two out of three receptors are required in order to sufficiently bind laminin and increase ECM organization. Our data highlight the contribution of the Nrk2b-NAD+-laminin-paxillin-Itga6/Itga7 to cellular adaptive responses and suggest that this pathway may have therapeutic potential.</p>

Twenty-five embryos per 60 mm Petri dish were grown in 5 mL of ERM with a final concentration of either 0 or 0.1 mM NAD. Embryos were treated from shield stage (6 hpf) through live imaging/fixation, and the media were made fresh and changed every 24 h. A new aliquot was used for each change of the NAD-containing media. Emergen-C (original formula, registered trademark of Alacer Corporation) supplementation followed the above protocol. Emergen-C powder was dissolved in ERM such that the final concentration of niacin that embryos were exposed to was 6.77 micromolar. This concentration was chosen because it is roughly equivalent to what the concentration of niacin would be in an adult human bloodstream after consuming the contents of one Emergen-C packet (assuming 6 L of blood volume).</p>
