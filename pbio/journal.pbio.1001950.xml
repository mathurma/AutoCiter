<p>DNA binding protein controls plant transcription when oxygen is at a premium - During hypoxia, the plant transcription factor HRA1 counterbalances the upregulation of anaerobic gene expression triggered by a stabilized plant ethylene responsive factor.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Transcriptional activation in response to hypoxia in plants is orchestrated by ethylene-responsive factor group VII (ERF-VII) transcription factors, which are stable during hypoxia but destabilized during normoxia through their targeting to the N-end rule pathway of selective proteolysis. Whereas the conditionally expressed ERF-VII genes enable effective flooding survival strategies in rice, the constitutive accumulation of N-end-rule–insensitive versions of the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> ERF-VII factor RAP2.12 is maladaptive. This suggests that transcriptional activation under hypoxia that leads to anaerobic metabolism may need to be fine-tuned. However, it is presently unknown whether a counterbalance of RAP2.12 exists. Genome-wide transcriptome analyses identified an uncharacterized trihelix transcription factor gene, which we named <italic>HYPOXIA RESPONSE ATTENUATOR1</italic> (<italic>HRA1</italic>), as highly up-regulated by hypoxia. HRA1 counteracts the induction of core low oxygen-responsive genes and transcriptional activation of hypoxia-responsive promoters by RAP2.12. By yeast-two-hybrid assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation we demonstrated that HRA1 interacts with the RAP2.12 protein but with only a few genomic DNA regions from hypoxia-regulated genes, indicating that HRA1 modulates RAP2.12 through protein–protein interaction. Comparison of the low oxygen response of tissues characterized by different levels of metabolic hypoxia (i.e., the shoot apical zone versus mature rosette leaves) revealed that the antagonistic interplay between RAP2.12 and HRA1 enables a flexible response to fluctuating hypoxia and is of importance to stress survival. In Arabidopsis, an effective low oxygen-sensing response requires RAP2.12 stabilization followed by HRA1 induction to modulate the extent of the anaerobic response by negative feedback regulation of RAP2.12. This mechanism is crucial for plant survival under suboptimal oxygenation conditions. The discovery of the feedback loop regulating the oxygen-sensing mechanism in plants opens new perspectives for breeding flood-resistant crops.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Respiratory metabolism in land plants requires oxygen availability to be able to generate ATP, which is essential for biosynthetic processes. Cellular hypoxia can be triggered as a consequence of environmental events (mainly floods), anatomical constraints (low tissue permeability to gases), or elevated cellular respiration, and it is unfavorable to growth due to the resultant decline in ATP. The adaptation of plants to fluctuating oxygen levels inside tissues requires the dynamic regulation of mechanisms that ensure cell viability and ultimately organism survival, but only a few molecular components of this homeostatic network are known. Direct hypoxia-sensing entails the posttranslational stabilization of a subgroup of plant ethylene-responsive factor (ERF) transcription factors, which coordinate the expression of hypoxia-inducible genes. Turnover of these ERFs is determined by an oxygen-dependent pathway of proteasomal degradation. Here, we demonstrate that the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor gene <italic>HRA1</italic> is transcriptionally activated upon ERF-VII RAP2.12 stabilization and encodes a trihelix DNA binding protein that functionally interacts with RAP2.12 to curtail its activity. In addition to its negative regulation of RAP2.12, HRA1 negatively regulates activation of its own promoter. This RAP2.12-HRA1 control unit allows plants to modulate the extent of the response to hypoxia, including anaerobic enzyme production, to levels that improve endurance of the stress. Our results emphasize the importance of a strategy that can counterbalance energy-inefficient survival responses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In higher plants, respiratory metabolism requires molecular oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor to generate ATP. Limited oxygen availability (hypoxia) can occur in plant cells due to floods, frosts, and excessive respiration, requiring physiological acclimation to constraints in ATP availability for growth and development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-BaileySerres1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-BaenaGonzlez1">[2]</xref>. The switch from aerobic respiration to anaerobic ethanolic fermentation, as a means to maintain substrate-level ATP production from available carbohydrates, is essential for plant survival in conditions of oxygen deprivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-KatoNoguchi1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Ismond1">[4]</xref>. For instance, mutants lacking pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) or alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), key enzymes in ethanolic fermentation, are less tolerant to hypoxia and soil waterlogging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Ismond1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Matsumura1">[6]</xref>. On the other hand, uncontrolled or constitutive fermentation is also detrimental to plant survival, due to rapid depletion of carbohydrate resources needed for basic cellular homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Licausi1">[7]</xref>. The repression of catabolic metabolism is the basis of the quiescence survival strategy of the flash-flood–tolerant varieties of rice that have been recently adopted by many farmers in South and Southeastern Asia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-BaileySerres2">[8]</xref>. Molecular responses must be, thus, accurately balanced to meet plant requirements for survival under fluctuating oxygen conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Fukao1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>Low oxygen responses are coordinately regulated in plants by ethylene-responsive factor group VII (ERF-VII) transcription factors (TFs), primary activators of anaerobic gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-BaileySerres1">[1]</xref>. In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, the presence of the ERF-VII factor RAP2.12 in the nucleus is inversely correlated to cellular oxygen levels, due to an oxygen-dependent branch of the N-end rule pathway of targeted protein degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Licausi1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Gibbs1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Weits1">[12]</xref>. It has been observed that constitutive accumulation of versions of RAP2.12 that are insensitive to the N-end rule degradation leads to a decreased submergence or hypoxia stress tolerance, whereas overexpression of the native RAP2.12 factor improves survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Licausi1">[7]</xref>. Therefore, excessive up-regulation of the stress-responsive genes appears to be detrimental, leading to the hypothesis that fine-tuning of transcription is a prerequisite for cellular homeostasis under hypoxia.</p>
<p>Among the genes that are induced by oxygen deficiency, those encoding known or putative TFs deserve special attention as candidate modulators of transcription under hypoxia. When hypoxia-responsive genes are compared across different plant species, a few TFs in addition to ERF-VIIs are consistently up-regulated by oxygen deprivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Mustroph1">[13]</xref>. These include zinc finger, MADS, LOB domain proteins, and trihelix TF gene family members. The trihelix family, in particular, encompasses plant-specific TFs that have been so far linked to embryo development, trichome formation, seed shattering, and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-KaplanLevy1">[14]</xref>. This study was aimed at the molecular and physiological characterization of a hypoxia-inducible trihelix TF gene (<italic>At3g10040</italic>), which we named <italic>HRA1</italic> (<italic>HYPOXIA RESPONSE ATTENUATOR 1</italic>). Here, we present evidence that <italic>HRA1</italic> encodes a transcriptional repressor that attenuates the anaerobic response induced by ERF-VIIs in a tissue-specific manner. We show that HRA1 imposes an additional level of negative regulation on RAP2.12, besides the ERF-VII's oxygen-dependent instability. RAP2.12 transcriptionally activates <italic>HRA1</italic>, which in turn binds RAP2.12 and restrains its function. Additionally, HRA1 interacts with its own promoter, limiting its activation by RAP2.12 through a negative feedback mechanism. Thus, transcriptional activation by RAP2.12 is controlled under normoxia by its N-end rule susceptibility and under oxygen deficiency by HRA1. The spatial and temporal regulation of both factors appears to be a key to modulation of transcriptional activity and survival of transient hypoxia.</p>

<p>The <italic>A. thaliana</italic> Columbia-0 genome encodes 30 genes belonging to the plant-specific family of trihelix TFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-KaplanLevy1">[14]</xref>. A survey of public transcriptomic data showed that the gene <italic>At3g10040</italic> (<italic>HRA1</italic>) is the only trihelix family member up-regulated by oxygen deprivation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Trihelix TFs are induced by low oxygen in different species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s017">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s002">Figure S2</xref>) and therefore appear to be a component of the conserved stress response strategy in land plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Mustroph1">[13]</xref>. Moreover, the <italic>HRA1</italic> transcript, detected at medium-to-low levels throughout the plant life cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s003">Figure S3A</xref>), was most strongly induced by short-term oxygen deficiency in plants subjected to a range of abiotic stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Hypoxia enhanced the activity of the <italic>HRA1</italic> promoter, as visualized by means of a <italic>promHRA1:GUS</italic> transgenic line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), and led to over 15-fold elevation of <italic>HRA1</italic> mRNA in both the leaves and roots of seedlings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). A survey of our previously generated data of polysome-associated transcripts under the same hypoxia system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Mustroph2">[15]</xref> showed that this was accompanied by active loading of <italic>HRA1</italic> mRNA onto polysomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s003">Figure S3C</xref>), indicating that the synthesis of HRA1 protein occurs during the stress. When <italic>HRA1</italic> expression was monitored over time in hypoxia-treated seedlings, <italic>HRA1</italic> mRNA accumulation was induced rapidly but transiently, whereas that of hypoxia marker <italic>ADH1</italic> increased slowly and steadily during the stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).

<title>HRA1 Represses Gene Transcription During Hypoxia</title>
<p>A green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter fusion demonstrated that the HRA1 protein localized to the cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), consistent with its prediction as a TF. To investigate the role of HRA1 in transcription, we performed a microarray analysis and compared the hypoxic reconfiguration of the transcriptome between Cauliflower Mosaic Virus <italic>35S:HRA1:FLAG</italic> transgenics (<italic>OE-HRA1</italic>) and wild type Arabidopsis seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g002">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s018">Table S2</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>HRA1</italic> significantly reduced the up-regulation of 30 out of the 49 (61%) core hypoxia-responsive genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Mustroph1">[13]</xref> induced in the wild type after short-term (2 h) hypoxia (|SLR|≥1, FDR&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), revealing the ability of HRA1 to broadly affect the hypoxic transcriptome. This included genes encoding key enzymes for anaerobic metabolism, such as the marker genes <italic>ADH1</italic> and <italic>PDC1</italic>. The inhibition of hypoxic transcript accumulation by <italic>HRA1</italic> overexpression contrasted to the constitutive up-regulation of the hypoxia-responsive genes observed in <italic>35S:HA:RAP2.12</italic> transgenic seedlings, which constitutively accumulate RAP2.12 due to masking of its N-terminus from the N-end rule machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Licausi1">[7]</xref>.

<title>HRA1 Mediates Tissue-Specific Responses During Submergence-Induced Hypoxia</title>
<p>The impact of HRA1 on hypoxia-responsive gene expression prompted us to assess how altered levels of <italic>HRA1</italic> expression affect plant performance under submergence-induced hypoxia. We compared two independent <italic>35S:HRA1:FLAG</italic> transgenic genotypes (<italic>OE-HRA1#1</italic> and <italic>#2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s004">Figure S4A</xref>) and two independent T-DNA insertion homozygous mutants (<italic>hra1-1</italic> and <italic>hra1-2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s004">Figures S4B–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s005">S5</xref>) with the wild type. This revealed that both overexpression and failure to produce a full-length <italic>HRA1</italic> transcript reduced the ability of plants to withstand the stress. When tested for tolerance to complete submergence in the dark with two distinct experimental setups, wild type Arabidopsis plants endured the stress significantly longer than <italic>OE-HRA1</italic> plants at the 10-leaf rosette stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s006">Figure S6A</xref>) and, in older rosettes prior to bolting, recovered better than either <italic>OE-HRA1</italic> or <italic>hra1-1</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g003">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Underwater petiole elongation, a trait recognized as a part of the escape strategy from flooding in semiaquatic species (i.e., deepwater rice and the wetland species <italic>Rumex palustris</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-BaileySerres2">[8]</xref>, was unaffected by HRA1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s006">Figure S6B</xref>), consistent with previous reports of a limited overall correlation between the trait and flooding survival of mutants in genes up-regulated by hypoxia and Arabidopsis accessions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Lee1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Vashisht1">[17]</xref>. Moreover, the analysis of the total soluble carbohydrate content in plants prior to submergence allowed us to rule out that a significant difference in the available reserves accounts for the poorer performance of the noticeably smaller <italic>OE-HRA1#1</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s007">Figure S7</xref>). This was again in line with previous reports of a lack of correlation between carbohydrate content before submergence and stress survival in Arabidopsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Vashisht1">[17]</xref>. The observation that altered <italic>HRA1</italic> levels modified performance under submergence, at two stages of rosette development and in distinct growth environments, supports the hypothesis of a distinct role for the factor during the stress.</p>

<p>A closer examination of the phenotype of the plants at the end of the recovery period revealed that susceptibility to submergence-induced hypoxia differed in young and older rosette leaves. As compared to the wild type, young leaves emerging from the shoot apex and the shoot apical meristem region were more sensitive in the <italic>hra1-1</italic> mutant, and generally unable to recover during postsubmergence. Contrastingly, the fully expanded and mature leaves of <italic>OE-HRA1#1</italic> plants were more sensitive to dark submergence than the wild type, but the shoot apical meristem performance was less damaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, see magnified insert). This suggested that HRA1 is imperative for an effective anaerobic response in the meristematic zone and young leaves.</p>
<p>Following preliminary evaluation of temporal regulation of <italic>HRA1</italic> expression in rosette leaves during submergence, which demonstrated an early peak of gene expression after 2 h of stress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s008">Figure S8</xref>), we selected 4 h of submergence as a suitable time to study distinctions in gene transcript and protein accumulation in young and fully expanded leaves of wild type and <italic>HRA1</italic> mutant genotypes. Firstly, we then found out that in young leaves, but not in older ones, the expression of the hypoxia marker genes <italic>ADH1</italic> and <italic>PDC1</italic> were differentially regulated by manipulation of <italic>HRA1</italic>. In control and submergence treated plants, <italic>ADH1</italic> and <italic>PDC1</italic> expression was enhanced in <italic>hra1-1</italic> and dampened in young <italic>OE-HRA1</italic> rosette leaves as compared to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). In all three genotypes, hypoxic gene expression was promptly reversed to presubmergence levels upon reaeration of the plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, “Reoxygenation”), in agreement with earlier studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Licausi1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-BrancoPrice1">[18]</xref>. The enhancement in anaerobic gene expression observed in young leaves of <italic>hra1-1</italic> was also seen in the independent <italic>hra1-2</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s009">Figure S9</xref>), reinforcing the hypothesis that mutation of <italic>HRA1</italic> leads to altered regulation of the hypoxic response.</p>
<p>Secondly, Western blot analyses performed to detect the products of <italic>ADH1</italic> and all five <italic>PDCs</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Mithran1">[19]</xref> indicated that elevated levels of these transcripts in young leaves of <italic>hra1-1</italic> plants was accompanied by higher hypoxic production of the encoded proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g003">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s010">S10</xref>). Although in older leaves some enhancement of PDC accumulation in submergence was visible in the mutant as compared to the wild type, ADH was always below the limit of detection. In younger leaves, contrastingly, ADH protein levels were enhanced in <italic>hra1-1</italic> already under normoxic conditions. These results suggest that HRA1 plays a key role in negatively regulating the induction of <italic>ADH1</italic> and <italic>PDC1</italic> in younger tissues of rosette-stage plants.</p>
<p>We also considered that <italic>HRA1</italic> expression could impact steady-state levels of its upstream regulator RAP2.12. To do so, we evaluated the effect of HRA1 on RAP2.12 protein stability, using mesophyll protoplasts that were transiently transfected with a <italic>35S:RAP2.12:RrLuc</italic> plasmid construct. The stability of RAP2.12 was inferred from the activity of a C-terminal translational fusion of RAP2.12 to the <italic>Renilla reniformis</italic> luciferase (RrLuc) reporter. As RrLuc activity was unaffected by concurrent transfection of the <italic>35S:HRA1</italic> effector, we conclude that HRA1 expression does not affect RAP2.12 stability, at least in isolated leaf protoplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Altogether, these data, presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g003">Figure 3</xref>, support the conclusion that HRA1 acts to limit accumulation of transcripts and the encoded proteins associated with anaerobic metabolism, even in air, particularly in younger rosette tissue.</p>

<title>HRA1 Contributes to Effective Anaerobic Responses and Normal Plant Development</title>
<p>The submergence survival studies suggested that <italic>HRA1</italic> expression provides vital control of the anaerobic response in the meristematic region and young leaves. To further investigate the spatial and temporal regulation of <italic>HRA1</italic>, we monitored transgenics expressing <italic>promHRA1:GUS</italic>. The beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter confirmed that basal <italic>HRA1</italic> promoter activity, detectable under normal growth conditions, was restricted to the shoot apical region and leaf vasculature in aboveground tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s011">Figure S11</xref>, “Control”), and was pronounced in roots as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). This pattern of expression is consistent with the hypothesis that HRA1 is active in cells experiencing physiological hypoxia, due to higher oxygen demand, lower permeability to oxygen, or a hypoxic environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Licausi2">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-vanDongen1">[21]</xref>. The elevated levels of hypoxia marker gene transcripts in the shoot apical area under normoxia suggest that this region is physiologically hypoxic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), as reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Chung1">[22]</xref>. By use of the <italic>promHRA1:GUS</italic> transgenics, we also determined that submergence primarily enhanced GUS activity in the younger rosette tissues and to a much lesser extent in adult leaves, except within the vasculature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s011">Figure S11</xref>, “Submergence”).</p>
<p>This pattern of GUS staining correlated well with the tissue-specific effect exerted by <italic>HRA1</italic> on submergence tolerance, as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). In genotypes with altered <italic>HRA1</italic> expression, the absence of a fully functional HRA1 protein in <italic>hra1</italic> shoot meristem tissue led to its higher susceptibility to submergence. On the other hand, ectopic expression of <italic>HRA</italic>1 in older rosette leaves of <italic>OE-HRA1</italic> plants reduced their survival of submergence and prolonged darkness, possibly due to accelerated senescence of older leaves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s012">Figure S12</xref>).</p>
<p>Our data showed that HRA1 balances low oxygen acclimation responses, but also suggested that proper spatial expression of <italic>HRA1</italic> is required for normal vegetative development. Overexpression of either the native HRA1 protein in <italic>OE-HRA1#3</italic> plants or a FLAG-tagged protein in <italic>OE-HRA1#1</italic> and <italic>#2</italic> plants caused a pleiotropic phenotype that included reduced rosette size, due to shortened petiole length and altered leaf index, slower rosette growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s013">Figure S13A and B</xref>), increased leaf anthocyanin content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s013">Figure S13B</xref>), partial loss of apical dominance, delayed flowering, and reduced seed production (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s013">Figure S13C</xref>). The conservation of these phenotypes across three independent transgenic lines allowed us to recognize their cause in the ectopic expression of high <italic>HRA1</italic> levels in the whole plant, rather than ascribe it to random integration of the transgenes in unrelated genomic loci. We speculate that, although sustained <italic>HRA1</italic> expression is beneficial in rapidly dividing and expanding leaf primordia under normal growth conditions, abnormal HRA1 accumulation in mature leaves has a negative impact on plant development. Moreover, because <italic>hra1-1</italic> and <italic>hra1-2</italic> showed no differences from the wild type under normal growth conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s013">Figure S13</xref>), we can conclude that mutations in the 3′ region of the <italic>HRA1</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s004">Figure S4B and S5</xref>) particularly affect the hypoxic pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g003">Figure 3A–D</xref>) but do not relate to the developmental phenotypes shown here.</p>

<title>HRA1 Associates with Few Differentially Regulated Genes in Hypoxic Seedlings</title>
<p>To gain insight into the role of HRA1 dampening core hypoxia gene transcription during hypoxia, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-Seq analysis) using seedlings deprived of oxygen for 2 h, in the same manner as the transcriptome analysis. To identify chromatin bound by HRA1-FLAG, <italic>OE-HRA1#1</italic> and Col-0 seedling tissue was cross-linked, nuclei were isolated, and immunopurification performed with a FLAG antibody. The Col-0 sample was used as a control to monitor nonspecific immunopurification. Deep sequencing of ∼100 bp fragments yielded 146 peak-to-gene associations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s019">Table S3</xref>), corresponding to putative HRA1 target genes, 42% of which (62 elements) fell 5′ of the predicted transcription start sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s014">Figure S14A</xref>). We then focused on the 1,295 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the microarray dataset and found out that seven of the HRA1 binding sites resided on genes significantly regulated by hypoxia and/or HRA1 overexpression (<italic>HRA1</italic>; <italic>RAV1</italic>, <italic>At1g13260</italic>; <italic>HUP7</italic>, <italic>At1g43800</italic>; a hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein family protein coding gene, <italic>At1g31310</italic>; <italic>WRKY7</italic>, <italic>At4g24240</italic>; <italic>CYP78A6</italic>, <italic>At2g46660; DCL1</italic>, <italic>At1g01040</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s014">Figure S14B</xref>). The small number of stress-responsive genes identified by ChIP of HRA1 suggests that its effect on the hypoxia-responsive gene transcription may be mediated by other DNA binding factors, rather than HRA1's ability to recognize DNA. Finally, of the candidate targets of HRA1, only <italic>HUP7</italic> and <italic>HRA1</italic> itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g004">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s020">Table S4</xref>) were constitutively up-regulated by HA-RAP2.12 and less hypoxia-induced in <italic>OE-HRA1</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s014">Figure S14C</xref>).

<title>HRA1 Directly Interacts with the ERF-VII TF RAP2.12</title>
<p>We hypothesized that HRA1 could attenuate hypoxia-responsive gene expression by directly inhibiting RAP2.12 activity. To address this, we first examined whether protein–protein interaction occurs between HRA1 and RAP2.12. Previously, interaction between rice GTγ-clade trihelix protein LOC_Os11g06410 (SAB18) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s002">Figure S2</xref>) and the ERF-VII TFs SUBMERGENCE1A (SUB1A) and the related SUB1C (LOC_Os09g11460) was reported in a nondirected yeast-two-hybrid screen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Seo1">[23]</xref>. We confirmed that HRA1 and RAP2.12 interact in the heterologous yeast-two-hybrid system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g004">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s015">S15A–C</xref>). By systematically testing different combinations of full-length and truncated versions of HRA1 and RAP2.12 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s015">Figure S15A</xref>), we determined that, firstly, the conserved C-terminal region rather than the trihelix domain of HRA1 was required for RAP2.12 association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g004">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s015">S15B</xref>) and, secondly, the N-terminal portion of the ERF-VII (RAP2.12<sub>1–123</sub>) was sufficient for interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s015">Figure S15C</xref>), while its DNA binding domain might enhance the association (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s015">Figure S15B</xref>). The interaction between HRA1 and RAP2.12 was subsequently validated <italic>in planta</italic> by means of bimolecular fluorescence complementation using Arabidopsis protoplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>We also tested HRA1 interaction with the other four Arabidopsis ERF-VII factors in the yeast-two-hybrid system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Interestingly, only RAP2.12 interacted with the HRA1 protein, consistent with the fact that the RAP2.12 1–123 region, which was sufficient for binding, is poorly conserved among Arabidopsis ERF-VII sequences (with the exception of the N-terminal region, critical to N-end rule regulation, which was anyway not required for HRA1 interaction <italic>in planta</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). It remains an open question why no interaction was observed with RAP2.2, which has the highest level of sequence similarity with the RAP2.12 protein in the interaction region.</p>

<title>HRA1 Modulates the Activity of the ERF-VII TF RAP2.12</title>
<p>With the knowledge that HRA1 and RAP2.12 interact, we investigated if the interaction could account for HRA1-mediated attenuation of RAP2.12-driven transcriptional activation. Towards this goal, we used a firefly <italic>luciferase</italic> (<italic>PpLuc</italic>) reporter fusion to measure the activity of the RAP2.12-responsive <italic>PDC1</italic> promoter (−911 to −1 relative to the start codon) in transiently transfected Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts. We confirmed that <italic>35S:RAP2.12<sub>14–358</sub></italic> effector plasmid DNA enhanced the luciferase activity of <italic>promPDC1:PpLuc</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). When increasing amounts of <italic>35S:HRA1</italic> were co-transfected, the luciferase activity gradually fell towards basal levels, indicating that RAP2.12 potential in <italic>promPDC1:PpLuc</italic> transactivation was negatively affected by HRA1, presumably due to the interaction between factors. Inhibition of <italic>promPDC1:PpLuc</italic> expression was similarly achieved by concurrent expression of <italic>35S:HRA1<sub>194–431</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), which lacked the trihelix DNA binding domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s015">Figure S15A</xref>) but retained the C-terminal region that allowed interaction with RAP2.12 in the yeast-two-hybrid assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g004">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s015">S15B</xref>). This demonstrates that the repression of RAP2.12 activation of <italic>PDC1</italic> transcription by HRA1 was independent of the trihelix domain and, therefore, most likely the TF's binding of DNA. This is consistent with the absence of <italic>PDC1</italic> and many other HRA1-regulated genes in the immunoprecipitated chromatin.</p>
<p>To further validate the hypothesis that HRA1 inhibits RAP2.12 through direct interaction rather than DNA binding, we took advantage of an artificial <italic>UAS</italic> promoter, made up of four repetitions of the yeast <italic>GAL4</italic> upstream activating sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Licausi1">[7]</xref>, which cannot be recognized by endogenous plant factors. By this approach we confirmed that the activation of the <italic>UAS:PpLuc</italic> construct by a chimeric RAP2.12-GAL4DBD factor was inhibited by coexpression of <italic>35S:HRA1</italic> in protoplasts, in spite of the inability by HRA1 to recognize the <italic>UAS</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Altogether, these observations demonstrated that HRA1 inhibits RAP2.12 function by direct protein–protein interaction, rather than by competition for DNA binding.</p>
<p>Additional evidence of the impact of RAP2.12 inhibition by HRA1 was obtained in protoplasts, whose survival of hypoxia was enhanced by transfection with <italic>35S:RAP2.12</italic> only if <italic>35S:HRA1</italic> was not concurrently transfected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s016">Figure S16A</xref>), and <italic>in planta</italic>, where overexpression of a stabilized RAP2.12<sub>14–358</sub> protein in the <italic>OE-HRA1#1</italic> background was sufficient to suppress the alteration in <italic>OE-HRA1</italic> rosette morphology and return the overall phenotype to that of the wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s016">Figure S16B</xref>).</p>

<title>HRA1 Is Regulated by a Negative Feedback Mechanism</title>
<p>Because the molecular response to hypoxia might entail a balance between RAP2.12 stabilization and attenuation under low oxygen stress, tight regulation of HRA1 was anticipated. As for the promoter of <italic>PDC1</italic>, we found that the <italic>HRA1</italic> promoter (−849 to −1 relative to the start codon) was transactivated in a dosage-dependent manner by RAP2.12 and repressed by HRA1 itself in mesophyll protoplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). An additional mechanism contributing to <italic>HRA1</italic> regulation involves binding of HRA1 to its own promoter, as revealed by ChIP-Seq and confirmed by ChIP-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). We hypothesize that this binding dampens RAP2.12 activation of this promoter. In support of this, when specific RT-qPCR was performed to detect the expression of the endogenous <italic>HRA1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s004">Figure S4B</xref>), strong down-regulation was observed in <italic>OE-HRA1</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). These results demonstrate that <italic>HRA1</italic> transcription is activated upon hypoxia following the nuclear accumulation of RAP2.12 but is subsequently subjected to negative self-regulation. This can be considered a “double check” mechanism that takes advantage of HRA1's ability to both repress RAP2.12 activity and directly bind its own promoter, possibly competing with RAP2.12 binding. The double regulation of <italic>HRA1</italic> transcription is most likely responsible for the transient dynamics of <italic>HRA1</italic> transcript accumulation during hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) and allows the plant to limit hypoxic gene expression over time, as detected in the wild type and to a lesser extent in the <italic>hra1-1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Gene expression is tightly regulated in response to low oxygen stress.

Although the transcriptional rearrangement following exposure to hypoxia is not limited to the expression of fermentation-related genes, this pathway contributes largely to survival in low oxygen conditions, as mutants lacking <italic>PDC</italic> and <italic>ADH</italic> genes are hypersensitive to hypoxia and conditions with a hypoxic component <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Ismond1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Matsumura1">[6]</xref>. Moreover, the transcriptional induction of <italic>ADH</italic> and <italic>PDC</italic> genes is a conserved feature in the anaerobic response of all higher plants studied so far <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Mustroph1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>Transcriptional activation of fermentative genes is downstream of the oxygen-sensing machinery, which relies on the N-end-rule–dependent stabilization of the ERF-VII TFs, such as RAP2.12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-BaileySerres1">[1]</xref>. However, this mechanism may not be an on–off process but rather modulated in intensity by additional hypoxic players, as both environmental fluctuations in oxygen availability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Liptzin1">[25]</xref>, as well as local hypoxic microenvironments in developing tissues and organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Licausi2">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Kelliher1">[26]</xref>, may necessitate temporal and spatial flexibility in the hypoxic response. This is because stabilization of RAP2.12 would trigger activation of the core hypoxia genes, with their down-regulation reliant upon reoxygenation and the destabilization of RAP2.12. Such inflexibility could expose cells to unregulated fermentative metabolism that may rapidly exhaust the limited respiratory substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Zabalza1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Fukao2">[28]</xref>, preventing endurance of prolonged stress and limiting recovery upon reoxygenation. Here, we show that the strategy adopted by cells to respond to decreased oxygenation entails the induction of a repressor of hypoxic gene expression, the nuclear-localized trihelix protein HRA1, and confirm this protein acts as a direct attenuator of the low oxygen stabilized transcriptional activator RAP2.12 in Arabidopsis.</p>
<p>It cannot be excluded that HRA1 may mediate additional mechanisms of repression, starting from the cascade activation of hypoxia-specific transcriptional repressor(s), either at the transcriptional or post-translational level of regulation (<italic>i.e.</italic>, activation of a repressor <italic>via</italic> protein-protein interaction). The absence of candidate transcriptional repressors among HRA1 targets (according to our microarray and ChIP-seq analyses), along with HRA1's ability to restrain anaerobic promoter activation even after ablation of its DNA binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), supports the conclusion that attenuation of RAP2.12 by HRA1 is not accomplished through DNA binding. Contrastingly, HRA1's ability to bind its own promoter appears to provide a second tier of activity, namely inhibition of its transcription.</p>
<p>The present study expands the knowledge of the hypoxia-response transcription network mediated by the low oxygen stabilized ERF-VIIs. The fast induction of <italic>HRA1</italic>, notably directed by RAP2.12 at the onset of hypoxia, confers the ability to prevent excessive expression of anaerobic genes, particularly in younger tissues exposed to submergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). The up-regulation of the attenuator HRA1 serves to limit the activity of stabilized RAP2.12. This may enable the cells expressing HRA1 to limit carbon catabolism through fermentation, conserving energy reserves required at the restoration of normoxia. Interestingly, in <italic>SUB1A</italic>-containing varieties of rice the ability to resume meristem development upon desubmergence is linked to an energy-saving quiescence strategy associated with submergence tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Fukao2">[28]</xref>. The recognition of a trihelix protein that interacts with SUB1A in rice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Seo1">[23]</xref> leads to the question whether the regulation of plant ERF-VIIs may broadly rely on trihelix-dependent attenuation mechanisms similar to the one we described in Arabidopsis.</p>
<p>We show that HRA1 acts through a sophisticated mechanism that involves physical interaction with RAP2.12 to down-regulate its transactivation capacity and generates a feedback loop of negative self-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g006">Figure 6</xref>). This latter mechanism may make it possible for the cell to start a new pulse of gene expression if hypoxia is prolonged. It is important to highlight that HRA1 interacts with RAP2.12, but apparently not with HRE1 and HRE2. This is suggestive of a hierarchy in the involvement of ERF-VIIs in the anaerobic response, with the initial burst resulting from the action of RAP2.12 and HREs taking over during prolonged hypoxia, in line with the hypoxia susceptibility of <italic>hre1hre2</italic> double mutants corresponding to their inability to sustain the expression of the hypoxia-responsive genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001950-Licausi3">[29]</xref>. The relative contribution of the different ERF-VIIs requires further exploration and will likely reveal additional layers of complexity of the anaerobic transcriptional response network.</p>

<title>Model summarizing how the balanced action of RAP2.12 and HRA1 tunes transcription of hypoxia target genes.</title>
<p>In plant cells, hypoxia promotes the relocalization of RAP2.12 to the nucleus, which triggers the expression of <italic>HRA1</italic> and other RAP2.12 target genes. Once synthesized, the encoded HRA1 protein generates two negative loops of feedback regulation, one acting on RAP2.12 and another on HRA1 itself. The first one dampens RAP2.12 activity, thereby limiting the anaerobic gene expression after its initial burst. The negative self-regulation is, instead, supposed to contribute to the subsequent down-regulation of HRA1 and makes a later wave of anaerobic gene expression possible under prolonged hypoxia.</p>

<p>The tissue-specific expression of HRA1 unveils the importance of differential modulation of the anaerobic response in rosette leaves of distinct developmental age. <italic>HRA1</italic> is predominantly expressed in tissues prone to physiological hypoxia and mutants lacking HRA1 display organ-specific susceptibility to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001950-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). This implies that the need for a finely-tuned hypoxic response is varied across organs and during development. Fast growing tissues, such as young expanding leaves, required HRA1-dependent dampening of the anaerobic response for survival, and this is likely related to the need to preserve resources for resumption of growth following reoxygenation. Mature leaves, instead, can devote available carbon to fuel fermentation to preserve leaf tissue homeostasis, with less requirement for biosynthetic processes. Carbon will be more rapidly available at reoxygenation by resuming of the photosynthetic activity in source leaves, as compared to younger, sink leaves.</p>
<p>Although plants possess a vascular system for transporting nutrients, its ability to transport oxygen relies on anatomical features, such as aerenchyma, that are absent in many instances. Physiological and molecular acclimation to rapidly changing oxygen availability, due to environmental perturbations such as flooding or on a daily basis as a consequence of the light/dark cycle, requires a sophisticated mechanism to fine-tune the anaerobic response. We can conclude that two components of this system in Arabidopsis are the N-end-rule–regulated ERF-VIIs and the trihelix HRA1. It is well established that genetic variation of ERF-VIIs in rice confer distinct survival strategies and manipulation of these proteins in Arabidopsis can be used to bolster low oxygen and submergence survival. Our evidence of a mechanism regulating the efficacy of the RAP2.12-dependent transcriptional regulation provides experimental support for the existence of an elaborated system allowing the plants to respond dynamically to hypoxia. This mechanism is based on the equilibrium between the induction of the anaerobic response by group VII ERFs and repression by HRA1. Alteration of this equilibrium by misexpression of HRA1 results in lower tolerance to submergence, suggesting that crops with higher tolerance to flooding conditions might be bred through fine-tuning of the relative contribution of ERFs and HRA1 to the overall response to hypoxia. The presence of HRA1 orthologues in crops provides additional opportunity for engineering or breeding varieties with enhanced tolerance to flooding.</p>

<p>Identification of HRA1 binding sites by chromatin immunopurification and fragment sequencing (ChIP-seq). (A) Pie chart displaying the percentage of HRA1 binding peaks that map to defined domains of annotated genes. Upstream, peak maps 5′ of the predicted transcription start site; downstream, peak maps 3′ of the transcriptional unit of the gene; inside, peak maps within the annotated mRNA; overlapStart, peak overlaps with the predicted transcriptional start site of the gene; overlapEnd, peak overlaps with the end of the gene; includeFeature, peak includes the entire gene. (B) Venn diagram comparison of the 1,295 DEGs, identified by five comparisons in DNA microarray analysis, and the 146 putative targets of HRA1 binding, identified by ChIP-Seq. The overlap was seven genes. (C) Heatmap summarizing the expression values of the seven genes identified in both the DEG and ChIP-Seq datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001950.s014">Figure S14B</xref>), as extracted from the DNA microarray datasets.</p>
