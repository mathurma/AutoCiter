<article-title>Short Lives with Long-lasting Effects: Filopodia Protrusions in Neuronal Branching Morphogenesis</article-title>
</related-article>
<abstract>
<p>Actin nucleation triggers the formation of new actin filaments and has the power to shape cells but requires tight control in order to bring about proper morphologies. The regulation of the members of the novel class of WASP Homology 2 (WH2) domain-based actin nucleators, however, thus far has largely remained elusive. Our study reveals signal cascades and mechanisms regulating Cordon-Bleu (Cobl). Cobl plays some, albeit not fully understood, role in early arborization of neurons and nucleates actin by a mechanism that requires a combination of all three of its actin monomer–binding WH2 domains. Our experiments reveal that Cobl is regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and multiple, direct associations of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor Calmodulin (CaM). Overexpression analyses and rescue experiments of Cobl loss-of-function phenotypes with Cobl mutants in primary neurons and in tissue slices demonstrated the importance of CaM binding for Cobl’s functions. Cobl-induced dendritic branch initiation was preceded by Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and coincided with local F-actin and CaM accumulations. CaM inhibitor studies showed that Cobl-mediated branching is strictly dependent on CaM activity. Mechanistic studies revealed that Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM modulates Cobl’s actin binding properties and furthermore promotes Cobl’s previously identified interactions with the membrane-shaping F-BAR protein syndapin I, which accumulated with Cobl at nascent dendritic protrusion sites. The findings of our study demonstrate a direct regulation of an actin nucleator by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM and reveal that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-controlled molecular mechanisms we discovered are crucial for Cobl’s cellular functions. By unveiling the means of Cobl regulation and the mechanisms, by which Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM signals directly converge on a cellular effector promoting actin filament formation, our work furthermore sheds light on how local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals steer and power branch initiation during early arborization of nerve cells—a key process in neuronal network formation.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The organization and the formation of new actin filaments by polymerization of actin monomers has the power to shape cells. The rate-limiting step in actin polymerization is “nucleation”—a process during which the first actin monomers are assembled with the help of actin nucleators. This nucleation step requires tight temporal and spatial control in order to achieve proper cell morphologies. Here, we analyse signaling cascades and mechanisms regulating the actin nucleator Cobl, which is crucial for the formation of dendritic arbors of nerve cells—a key process in neuronal network formation. We show that the calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)-binding signaling component calmodulin (CaM) binds to Cobl and regulates its functions. Using 3-D time-lapse analyses of developing neurons, we visualized how Cobl works. We observed local accumulation of CaM, Cobl, actin, and syndapin I—a membrane-shaping protein—at dendritic branch initiation sites. We find that Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM modulates Cobl’s actin-binding properties and promotes its interactions with syndapin I, which then serves as a membrane anchor for Cobl. In summary, we i) show a direct regulation of the actin nucleator Cobl by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, ii) demonstrate that the molecular mechanisms we discovered are crucial for shaping nerve cells, and iii) underscore how local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals steer and power branch initiation during early arborization of neurons.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Metazoan life critically relies on the formation, organization, and dynamics of actin filaments, which are, for example, crucial for shaping and movement of membranes and entire cells. The polar and extremely arborized morphologies that neurons develop during pre- and postnatal brain development are a prerequisite for signal processing in neuronal networks. Their development seems to be promoted by cytoskeletal structures and local calcium signals. These Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors, voltage-gated calcium channels, and ryanodine receptors [<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and seem to be sensed by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein calmodulin (CaM; M19312.1; GI:203255), because CaM kinases (CaMKs) downstream of CaM were observed to be involved in dendritogenesis [<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Prime effector machinery that may power early neuromorphogenesis would be proteins with the ability to trigger the formation of new actin filaments in a spatially and locally well-controlled manner. The well-established actin filament-promoting components, i.e., the Arp2/3 complex and Formins, are controlled by Rho-type GTPases [<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Actin nucleators that respond to Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM signals directly are not known. With Cobl (NM_172496.3; GI:162135965) and JMY (NM_021310.3; GI:326633181), two members of the novel class of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) Homology 2 (WH2) domain-based actin nucleators [<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] have been implicated in the development of early neuronal morphology in different ways [<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Cobl nucleates actin filaments by a mechanism that requires a combination of all three of its C-terminal actin monomer-binding WH2 domains [<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In vitro, a WH2 domain–containing C-terminal fragment of human Cobl additionally increased actin dynamics by severing filaments [<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Functional studies in neurons showed that Cobl plays some, albeit not fully understood, role in early arborization of hippocampal neurons and of cerebellar Purkinje cells [<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These functions rely on associations of Cobl with the F-BAR protein syndapin I (AF104402.1; GI:4324451) and the F-actin-binding protein Abp1 (NM_001146308.1; GI:226423870) as well as on all three C-terminal WH2 domains of Cobl [<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we reveal a signaling pathway that controls the molecular functions of Cobl and identify a direct link between Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM signaling and the early morphogenesis of neurons. We demonstrate that Cobl is a direct target of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated CaM and that Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM activity and CaM interactions are crucial for the Cobl-mediated development of dendritic arbors. Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM modulates Cobl’s actin binding properties. Furthermore, we show that CaM association promotes Cobl’s interactions with syndapin I and that Cobl, CaM, F-actin, and syndapin I accumulate at branch initiation sites.</p>
<p>Taken together, our study addresses the means of Cobl regulation and reveals several molecular mechanisms that enable the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM signaling pathway to steer Cobl. With Cobl, we identified an actin filament–promoting effector by which local Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-signaling directly powers cellular morphogenesis during early neuronal network formation.</p>

<title>Dendritic Protrusions Initiate from Cobl and F-actin Accumulations</title>
<p>The extremely arborized morphologies that neurons develop during their early morphogenesis are a prerequisite for the formation of all neuronal networks. By some, yet unknown means, the underlying reorganization of cell shape involves Cobl, a protein that has the ability to promote the formation of new actin filaments [<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Dendritic arborization has furthermore been suggested to be controlled by local Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Indeed, 3-D-time-lapse calcium imaging in developing hippocampal neurons showed that protrusions, which formed in areas marked by transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, were originating from sites enriched for F-actin. These F-actin-rich sites either already existed prior to the calcium signal (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>) or F-actin accumulated after a calcium pulse (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>

Local increase of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels correlates with subsequent protrusion (arrows mark initiation sites) formation (marked by green *) from a previously existing F-actin–rich site (<bold>A</bold>) and from a site that newly acquired F-actin accumulation after a Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal (<bold>B</bold>).

(<bold>C</bold>) Example images (MIPs) of 3-D-time-lapse recording (shown are 0–2:30 and 6:00–15:30 min:s) of GFP-Cobl reveal that Cobl is dynamically enriched at distinct sites within dendrites in immature neurons undergoing dendritogenesis. Initiation of dynamic, dendritic protrusions (marked by green *) often is preceded by Cobl accumulation (white arrows). Retraction events are marked by red ° and static phases with yellow I. Dendrite branch induction is a dynamic process with often several protrusive attempts until a dendritic branch is firmly established and strongly elongated. Three consecutive initiations of a protrusion from the same site are shown.

<p>Analyzing the distribution and dynamics of the actin nucleator Cobl in developing neurons, we observed that the formation of protrusions from dendritic structures coincided with Cobl enrichment. Branching was a dynamic process with branches being initiated, shrinking back to the mother dendrite and being reinitiated until they were firmly established and grew out. Cobl accumulated in spatially restricted dendritic sites prior to the induction of almost all branching events (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>, arrows; <xref rid="pbio.1002233.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002233.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Movie</xref>). Quantitative analyses showed that Cobl was highly enriched at branch initiation sites 30 s before initiation of protrusion. The intensity of GFP-Cobl at such sites was more than twice as high as at adjacent control region of interest (ROI), whereas GFP showed no intensity differences when control ROIs were compared to branch initiation sites (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Dual imaging of GFP-Cobl and LifeAct-RFP revealed that Cobl accumulations and dendritic branch inductions were accompanied by local F-actin formation. Interestingly, the signals of both Cobl and F-actin were particularly high at the base of initiated branches. Furthermore, we observed that the maximum of Cobl accumulation hereby usually preceded that of F-actin accumulation (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002233.s018" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Movie</xref>).</p>
<p>In line with the live imaging data, immunostainings of dendrites of developing neurons showed that sites marked by increased F-actin were often marked by protrusive morphology and displayed accumulations of endogenous Cobl (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>).</p>

<title>Cobl Interacts with CaM</title>
<p>In contrast to other cytoskeletal effectors that give rise to new actin filaments, Cobl has no obvious Rho-type GTPase-binding domains or other regulatory modules that may help to control this powerful cellular machine. We therefore conducted a yeast-2-hybrid screen with BD-Cobl<sup>1001–1337</sup> as bait to identify cellular mechanisms that may be responsible for the observed local control of Cobl during branch initiation. Hit#3737 encoded for AD-CaM<sup>∆1–32</sup>.

<p>Successful and specific reconstitutions of GFP-Cobl/CaM and GFP-Cobl<sup>1001–1337</sup>/CaM complexes at defined sites in intact COS-7 cells using mitochondrially targeted CaM (Mito-mCherry-CaM) demonstrated the in vivo relevance of the Cobl/CaM interactions (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002233.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Immunohistological examinations showed that Cobl and CaM display overlapping expression. Cells with pronounced Cobl expression in the hippocampus were also marked by significant CaM expression (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>, arrows). The same was true for the cerebellum. In particular, Purkinje cell dendrites relying on Cobl for branching [<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] showed marked anti-CaM immunosignals (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>, arrows).</p>
<p>These findings suggested Cobl to be a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-regulated cytoskeletal effector. Indeed, the Cobl/CaM interaction was also observable in coprecipitation analyses with endogenous Cobl from rat brain lysates. The Cobl/CaM interaction was strongly Ca<sup>2+</sup>dependent and occurred in a wide range of Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (tested were physiological concentrations down to 2 μM) (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G</xref>).</p>
<p>We next aimed at further corroborating the Cobl/CaM interaction by coimmunoprecipitations of the endogenous proteins with suitable anti-CaM antibodies.

<p>(<bold>A</bold>) MIPs from 3-D-time-lapse recordings of GFP-Cobl and mCherry-CaM in a dendrite of a primary hippocampal neuron transfected at DIV6 and imaged at DIV7 show that episodes of Cobl accumulation at distinct dendritic sites as well as the induction of protrusions from such sites are accompanied by accumulations of CaM at the same sites (data shown as heat map of fluorescence intensities from purple to white, see <xref rid="pbio.1002233.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> for legend of color coding; see <xref rid="pbio.1002233.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref> for original data of both channels and for merged images).

<p>To experimentally test the effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM signals on Cobl’s functions in dendritogenesis, we next employed two different CaM inhibitors: W7 (N-(6-Aminohexyl)-5-chlor-1-naphthalinsulfonamide) [<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and CGS9343B (1,3-dihydro-l-[1-[4-methy1-4H,6H-pyrrolo[1,2-a][4,l]-benzoxazepin-4-y1-methy1]-4-piperidinyl]-2H-benzimidazol-2-one(1:1) maleate) [<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). W7 and CGS9343B both completely suppressed Cobl-induced dendritic arborization in developing neurons (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A–4H</xref>). Also in control cells, W7 and CGS9343B incubation caused some reduction of dendritic branch points. These effects were smaller than the strong suppression of the Cobl overexpression phenotype indicating that the CaM inhibitors indeed suppress Cobl functions and do not act in a parallel pathway. The effect of W7 and CGS9343B in control cells may include an inhibition of the functions of endogenous Cobl that has been demonstrated to be a crucial factor in dendritic arborization [<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and is expressed throughout the development of the brain (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>).

<p>Coprecipitation and corecruitment studies furthermore showed that CaM binding additionally involved regions in the middle of Cobl (aa750-1005) (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>) as well as in front of the C-terminal WH2 domains (aa1001-1176) (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002233.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>). Half-maximal binding was reached at 0.68 and 0.95 μM Ca<sup>2+</sup> for N- and C-terminal parts of Cobl, respectively (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>). These values are in line with the cooperative Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding of CaM, the k<sub>D</sub> of which decreases to ~0.5 μM upon target binding in the case of CaMKII (NM_009792.3; GI:161086915) [<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
<p>Our observations raised the exciting possibility that Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM modulates Cobl’s cytoskeletal functions. As neither full-length Cobl nor extended C-terminal parts of Cobl can be purified [<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and in vitro reconstitutions of actin polymerization are hampered by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing physiological buffers, we focused on actin coimmunoprecipitations and in vitro reconstitutions of actin binding to explore putative Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-induced modulations of Cobl functions.</p>
<p>Coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous actin with GFP-Cobl<sup>1001–1337</sup>, GFP-Cobl<sup>1176–1337</sup>, and GFP-Cobl<sup>1206–1337</sup> unveiled that Ca<sup>2+</sup> promotes actin binding. This positive effect was independent of CaM binding and also independent of the first WH2 domain neighboring the CaM binding interface but prominently involved the second and third WH2 domain of Cobl (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E–5G</xref>). Interestingly, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated increase of actin binding was not reversed upon subsequent lowering of Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the increased actin association was more striking for GFP-Cobl<sup>1176–1337</sup> lacking the CaM binding site than for GFP-Cobl<sup>1001–1337</sup> containing an interface for direct CaM binding (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Fig</xref>), we next addressed the effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM specifically on the first WH2 domain. Interestingly, the first WH2 domain (Cobl<sup>1176–1224</sup>) required the CaM-binding region (Cobl<sup>1001–1176</sup>) for coimmunoprecipitation of actin (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Fig</xref>). This specific coimmunoprecipitation of actin by Cobl<sup>1001–1224</sup> was strongly suppressed by 500 μM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which may only be reached in direct vicinity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, as well as by lower Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (2 μM), which are more commonly and more widely reached in neurons (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5H</xref>).</p>
<p>Importantly, in vitro reconstitutions with purified proteins demonstrated that this suppression of actin binding of Cobl’s first WH2 domain solely involved actin, Cobl and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM. In the presence of CaM, we observed a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-specific CaM/Cobl complex formation and a statistically significant reduction of actin binding. In contrast, in the absence of CaM, no such difference between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free conditions was observed (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5I</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002233.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Fig</xref>). Thus, the suppression of the actin binding of the first WH2 domain involves direct Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM association and relies on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor CaM.</p>
<p>The first WH2 domain is crucial for Cobl’s actin filament promoting function [<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and actin filament formation as well as Cobl accumulation was observed at the initiation point of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered, newly forming dendritic protrusions (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Both observations strongly suggested that actin filament formation at branch initiation sites plays a supporting role during dendritic arborization. It was therefore interesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup> was overall promoting actin association of the Cobl C-terminus, despite a simultaneously occurring Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding-mediated suppression of the actin association of the first WH2 domain. This suggested that actin binding may be transiently increased even further once Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels drop again, as under such conditions the dissociation of CaM may release the suppression. In line with a transient effect, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-mediated block of actin binding to the first WH2 domain indeed was fully reversible upon reduction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5J</xref>).</p>

<p>We thus addressed the exciting hypothesis that Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM signaling may not only control Cobl’s actin cytoskeletal functions but may also orchestrate Cobl’s membrane association. Whereas we were unable to purify the full Cobl Homology domain, we succeeded in purifying an alternative protein (TrxHis-Cobl<sup>54–450</sup>). In vitro reconstitutions with liposomes revealed that the N-terminus of Cobl itself has membrane-binding activity and therefore floated with liposomes irrespective of calcium presence (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D and 6E</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM addition effectively suppressed the direct membrane-binding ability of the Cobl Homology domain (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6F</xref>; upper middle panel).</p>

<p>Strikingly, the anchoring of Cobl to membranes via the F-BAR domain protein syndapin I was not suppressed by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM addition. Complexes containing all three components, i.e., Cobl, CaM, and syndapin I, floated with liposomes (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C–7E</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, the formation of complexes composed of all three components and their ability to associate with membranes suggested that Cobl’s intrinsic lipid association constitutively ensures some Cobl presence at the cell cortex. Upon association of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, this ability of Cobl is switched off. As a consequence, F-BAR domain–mediated membrane associations by syndapin I [<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] start to dominate the spatial control of Cobl at the cell cortex. Consistent with such a scenario, we observed that addition of the Cobl-binding SH3 domain of syndapin I did not suffice for restoring Cobl’s membrane association in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7F</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM association, Cobl localization becomes fully dependent on SH3 domain interactions and on F-BAR-mediated membrane association of syndapin I.</p>
<p>This regulatory mechanism would be even more effective if syndapin I associations were promoted upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM. In order to address this directly in vivo, we conducted quantitative coimmunoprecipitation studies.

<p>This increase was, to a large extent, reversible. At least upon prolonged incubation with ethylenglycol-bis(aminoethylether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) after Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulation, syndapin I coimmunoprecipitation intensities only remained moderately increased and were not significantly different from control anymore (+21.0 ± 11.4%; <xref rid="pbio.1002233.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A and 8B</xref>).</p>
<p>The striking promotion of Cobl’s association with syndapin I was dependent on Cobl’s ability to associate with the calcium sensor CaM because a Cobl mutant incapable of binding to CaM (Cobl<sup>1-408∆CaM</sup>) did not respond to changes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Instead, Cobl<sup>1-408∆CaM</sup> coimmunoprecipitated constant amounts of syndapin I (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A and 8C</xref>).</p>
<p>Endogenous coimmunoprecipitations from rat brain lysates showed a corresponding calcium-mediated increase of Cobl/syndapin I complex formation that was consistent with the ~60% increase of syndapin I association in the heterologous coimmunoprecipitations using the Cobl Homology domain described before (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8D and 8E</xref>).</p>

<p>Cobl<sup>∆CaM-N,C</sup> lacked all CaM-binding areas that we had identified and consistently did not associate with CaM anymore (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10B</xref>). The Cobl N-terminus lacking the CaM interfaces (Cobl<sup>∆CaM-N</sup>) still associated with the two other components that are known to bind to the Cobl Homology domain and are critical for the functions of Cobl in vivo, Abp1 and syndapin I [<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S15 Fig</xref>). Thus, this mutant should allow for dissecting the known requirements of syndapin I and Abp1 association from a putative importance of CaM associations in functional studies. Importantly, despite preserved Abp1 and syndapin I interactions, Cobl<sup>∆CaM-N,C</sup> overexpression did not result in the extensive dendritic arborization observed upon overexpression of wild-type Cobl. Thus, the N-terminal and the more C-terminal CaM-binding interfaces are crucial for inducing Cobl overexpression phenotypes (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10C–10L</xref>).</p>
<p>We next tested the functional importance of the identified CaM interfaces individually. Similar to Cobl<sup>∆CaM-N,C</sup>, also the individual deletions Cobl<sup>∆CaM-N</sup> and Cobl<sup>∆CaM-C</sup> were unable to trigger dendritic arborization (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10F, 10G, 10K and 10L</xref>). Thus, Cobl functions seem to require both CaM binding sites of the N-terminal part of Cobl, which we showed to be involved in modulating the syndapin I interactions (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>), as well as C-terminal CaM binding sites, which we unraveled to modulate actin associations (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>).</p>
<p>Cobl with even smaller deletions (Cobl<sup>∆CaM-C</sup>’, Cobl<sup>∆CaM-C</sup>”, and Cobl<sup>∆CaM-C</sup>”‘) also failed to give rise to the Cobl gain-of-function phenotype. Instead, the morphology of transfected neurons remained indistinguishable from control cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10H–10L</xref>). Therefore, the CaM binding area Cobl<sup>1001-1176</sup> addressed in our mechanistic studies of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-mediated actin association was critically required for Cobl-mediated dendritic branching.</p>
<p>To address whether these data reflect a requirement of both N- and C-terminal CaM binding areas for physiological Cobl functions, we next conducted Cobl loss-of-function experiments and corresponding rescue experiments (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10M–10V</xref>). We subjected cerebellar slices to gene gun transfections with GFP-reported plasmids. As described previously [<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], Cobl RNAi-impaired dendritic branching of Purkinje cells. This Cobl loss-of-function phenotype was rescued by resupplying the cells with RNAi-insensitive, wild-type Cobl (GFP-Cobl*) (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10M–10O and 10V</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, substitution of Cobl with any of the four CaM-binding–deficient mutants Cobl<sup>∆CaM-N,C</sup> Cobl<sup>∆CaM-N</sup>, Cobl<sup>∆CaM-C</sup>, and Cobl<sup>∆CaM-C</sup>’ did not only fail to rescue the Cobl loss-of-function phenotype, but impaired dendritogenesis further (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10P–10S and 10V</xref>). Cobl<sup>∆CaM-C</sup>” and Cobl<sup>∆CaM-C</sup>”‘ also were unable to rescue the Cobl loss-of-function defects in dendritic branching in the developing slice cultures (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10T–10V</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, Cobl’s crucial role in dendritic branch induction critically relies on both the N- and the C-terminal CaM association sites, for which we have revealed the molecular mechanisms of Cobl regulation.</p>

<p>Shaping neurons demands that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are converted into locally restricted and transient activity of force-generating effectors [<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The activity of such effectors must be targeted to the dendritic plasma membrane and must cease to exist once a branch is induced successfully. Whereas other actin cytoskeletal effectors are controlled by Rho-type GTPases, we here describe a direct interaction of the calcium sensor protein CaM with a powerful cytoskeletal effector remodeling neuronal morphology, the actin nucleator Cobl (<xref rid="pbio.1002233.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11</xref>).</p>

<p>To our knowledge, only few direct links of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM to the actin cytoskeleton have been discovered in neurons thus far. However, none of them explains how Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals may trigger dendritogenesis. Neither the described CaM associations with brain-enriched spectrin isoforms [<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] nor competitive binding of the F-actin bundling protein α-actinin and CaM to NMDA receptors and L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels [<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] offer obvious mechanisms bringing about dendritic arborization.</p>
<p>With Cobl, we have identified a CaM-associating component that effectively promotes the local formation of actin filaments. Actin cytoskeletal forces have the power to shape cells and cellular compartments. Whether other WH2 domain-containing actin nucleators [<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] or actin filament formation via the Arp2/3 complex and/or Formins also are directly controlled by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM remains to be addressed.</p>
<p>We found by yeast-2-hybrid, coprecipitations, coimmunoprecipitations, and corecruitment studies in intact cells that CaM associates with Cobl. Reconstitutions with purified proteins demonstrated that Cobl’s interactions with CaM are direct. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependency of the interactions strongly suggested that Cobl/CaM complexes are involved in translating Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals sensed by CaM into cellular answers. Colocalizations in different parts of the brain and a dynamic coappearance of Cobl and CaM at induction sites of dendritic protrusion support this hypothesis.</p>
<p>Several lines of evidence from functional studies underscore the importance of Cobl/CaM interactions during dendritogenesis: CaM inhibitors fully suppressed Cobl-mediated dendrite formation and branching in quantitative end-point analyses of fixed neurons and in live imaging studies. Our data strongly argue that a direct association and not merely CaM signaling is required, as overexpression of Cobl mutants incapable of associating with CaM failed to mimic Cobl-mediated effects on dendrite formation. Furthermore, re-expression of such Cobl mutants failed to rescue the Cobl loss-of-function phenotype in dendritic branching of cerebellar Purkinje cells. These findings clearly point to a critical function of CaM associations with Cobl.</p>
<p>Our analyses revealed multiple independent CaM binding areas. At least three of them reside in the Cobl Homology domain. In addition, at least three further binding motifs are located in Cobl’s C-terminal part. Usually, the CaM lobes wrap around target segments, burying them in a hydrophobic channel, and thereby enforce alter target conformations [<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Consistent with such putative conformational changes, we observed dramatically altered properties of both the N- and C-terminus of Cobl upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM signaling. Overall, calcium strongly promoted the actin association with the C-terminus of Cobl in a manner that was independent of CaM association and independent of the first WH2 domain of Cobl. In principle, such Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated effects could be due to different mechanisms, i) Ca<sup>2+</sup> modulates the properties of actin (G-actin or G-actin/F-actin balance), and this is reflected by changed association with Cobl WH2 domains, ii) Ca<sup>2+</sup> modulates the properties of the Cobl WH2 domains number 2 and 3, and this leads to changed actin affinities or iii) Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals to further cellular components, and these either modulate actin properties, Cobl properties, or both.</p>
<p>The observed Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated increase in Cobl’s overall actin binding occurred despite a simultaneous suppression of the actin binding of the first WH2 domain upon CaM association with neighboring sites, as demonstrated by quantitative coimmunoprecipitation studies and by in vitro reconstitutions with purified components. In line with CaM acting as calcium sensor protein, this suppression was released with decreasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, whereas the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-promoted actin binding of the Cobl C-terminus persisted. Since all three WH2 domains need to work together and the first WH2 domain is crucial for actin filament formation [<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the release of the suppression of the first WH2 domain after a transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal would elegantly ensure that Cobl responds to calcium transients. In contrast to simple on/off mechanisms, transient activations would also exclude Cobl activity during longer lasting NMDA and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM signaling, such as during excitotoxicity conditions. Indeed, such conditions do not promote filament formation but are marked by filament loss [<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Related to high Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels during excitotoxicity-reducing actin dynamics and filament formation, high calcium was reported to inhibit the F-actin-driven formation of filopodia-like dendritic spines and stabilized them, whereas lower calcium signals were reported to promote the formation of these F-actin-rich structures. It therefore is conceivable that, besides the crucial role in dendritogenesis, Cobl-mediated functions and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-mediated control of Cobl may in addition play some role in synapse formation and/or plasticity processes, as these involve both Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and actin cytoskeletal reorganizations [<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>
<p>We observed local F-actin accumulations at the base of dendritic protrusions. We have demonstrated earlier that Cobl overexpression promotes dendritic arborization, and Cobl loss-of-function results in a reduction of branches [<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Correlative 3-D-time-lapse studies, inhibitor studies, and mutational analyses demonstrated that dendritic branching is associated with Cobl, F-actin and syndapin I at branch initiation sites and is controlled by changing calcium levels, by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM signaling and by direct Cobl association of CaM.</p>
<p>We have identified a direct plasma membrane association of Cobl that also was CaM-regulated. This ability of the Cobl Homology domain was suppressed upon CaM association. At the same time, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM promoted Cobl’s association with syndapin I [<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and thereby promoted indirect membrane associations of Cobl. Direct membrane association of Cobl may ensure its general availability at the plasma membrane and may also explain why syndapin I loss-of-function only partially suppressed Cobl’s cortical localization [<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Upon CaM binding, syndapin I interactions will increasingly influence Cobl’s localization. Indeed, our studies revealed that dendritic branching events correlated with accumulations of both syndapin I and Cobl.</p>
<p>In line with this conclusion, syndapin I has been demonstrated to be involved in dendritogenesis [<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Interestingly, we observed accumulations of syndapin I specifically at nascent dendritic branch sites. It thus seems that F-BAR domain-mediated membrane curvature sensing and/or induction by syndapin I [<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002233.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] spatially steers the actin nucleator Cobl at the cell cortex. Consistently, mutational overexpression analyses in neuronal cultures as well as rescue experiments of cerebellar Cobl loss-of-function revealed that CaM binding to the actin-binding C-terminal part and to the syndapin I-binding N-terminal part of Cobl were crucial for Cobl functions in dendritogenesis.</p>
<p>Together, our work unveils that Cobl is regulated by the calcium sensor protein CaM and reveals the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-controlled molecular mechanisms that are crucial for Cobl’s cellular functions. The regulation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM seems to distinguish Cobl from established actin nucleators, such as the Arp2/3 complex and Formins, which are directly and indirectly regulated by Rho-type GTPases.</p>
<p>Our examinations of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-mediated mechanisms that control Cobl’s activity in neurons furthermore provided deep insights into how local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals steer and power branch initiation during early arborization of nerve cells.</p>

<p>MIPs from 3-D-time-lapse recordings of GFP-Cobl and mCherry-CaM in a dendrite of a primary hippocampal neuron transfected at DIV6 and imaged at DIV7 show that episodes of Cobl accumulation at distinct dendritic sites as well as the induction of protrusions from such sites are accompanied by accumulations of CaM at the same sites.
