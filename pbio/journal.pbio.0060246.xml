        <p>Adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus plays a critical role in hippocampus-dependent spatial learning. It remains unknown, however, how new neurons become functionally integrated into spatial circuits and contribute to hippocampus-mediated forms of learning and memory. To investigate these issues, we used a mouse model in which the differentiation of adult-generated dentate gyrus neurons can be anticipated by conditionally expressing the pro-differentiative gene <italic>PC3</italic> (<italic>Tis21</italic>/<italic>BTG2</italic>) in nestin-positive progenitor cells. In contrast to previous studies that affected the number of newly generated neurons, this strategy selectively changes their timing of differentiation. New, adult-generated dentate gyrus progenitors, in which the <italic>PC3</italic> transgene was expressed, showed accelerated differentiation and significantly reduced dendritic arborization and spine density. Functionally, this genetic manipulation specifically affected different hippocampus-dependent learning and memory tasks, including contextual fear conditioning, and selectively reduced synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus. Morphological and functional analyses of hippocampal neurons at different stages of differentiation, following transgene activation within defined time-windows, revealed that the new, adult-generated neurons up to 3–4 weeks of age are required not only to acquire new spatial information but also to use previously consolidated memories. Thus, the correct unwinding of these key memory functions, which can be an expression of the ability of adult-generated neurons to link subsequent events in memory circuits, is critically dependent on the correct timing of the initial stages of neuron maturation and connection to existing circuits.</p>

          <p>Previous studies have implicated adult-born hippocampal neurons in the formation of spatial and contextual memories by using mouse models where newly generated neurons are either eliminated or increased in number. Nonetheless, how new neurons are integrated in the existing circuits and contribute to memory formation still awaits clarification. Toward this end, we have developed a different approach, using a mouse model that accelerates the differentiation of the newly generated neurons without altering their number, and offers the possibility to induce the process at any chosen moment. We show that the new neurons pass through their early stages of maturation faster and, though establishing connections with the existing neuronal circuits, fail to function properly. In fact, mice are not only unable to learn new spatial information, but they are also unable to use previously acquired memories. These results demonstrate that the appropriate timing of maturation of new neurons is important for their adult performance in memory circuits, i.e., to integrate new memory traces and recall previous events.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Observations in mammals and birds have revealed that neurogenesis continues in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus throughout adulthood, due to the presence of progenitor cells localized in the innermost part of the granule cell layer, the subgranular zone (SGZ, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b003">3</xref>]). These progenitor cells continue to proliferate and generate new dentate granule neurons for the entire life of the organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b005">5</xref>].</p>
      <p>The process of adult hippocampal neurogenesis originates from dividing putative neural stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b006">6</xref>] and has been tentatively divided into six developmental stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b007">7</xref>], in which putative neural stem cells (named type-1 cells) develop into post-mitotic neurons through three consecutive stages of progenitor cells (type-2ab and type-3 cells; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b010">10</xref>]). This process is thought to govern the number and the differentiation of adult-generated neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b011">11</xref>].</p>
      <p>Newborn neurons become functionally integrated into existing dentate gyrus circuitry within 3 wk, extending their axons to CA3, as indicated by morphological and electrophysiological studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b020">20</xref>]. Interestingly, recent observations indicate that new neurons of the dentate gyrus become functionally active in learning circuits at late stages of their maturation (∼4–6 postnatal weeks, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b021">21</xref>]).</p>
      <p>Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is required for hippocampus-dependent learning and memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b023">23</xref>]. Indeed, the almost complete ablation of neurogenesis by an antimitotic toxin, x-ray irradiation, or virus-activated pro-drugs results in profound cognitive deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b028">28</xref>]. On the other hand, learning and/or physical exercise can enhance neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, suggesting a two-way relationship between the generation of new neurons in the adult hippocampus and cognitive processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b033">33</xref>]. Recently, it has been hypothesized that new, adult-generated neurons confer to the dentate gyrus the basic ability to encode the timing of new memories by integrating new events on the pre-existing memory circuits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b023">23</xref>].</p>
      <p>The strategies used so far to reveal the functional role of adult neurogenesis deeply affected the total number of new neurons, either by severely reducing neuronal progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b026">26</xref>] or by increasing the number of new neurons generated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b029">29</xref>]. Nonetheless, the ablation of new neurons by toxin or irradiation in some instance did not affect certain hippocampus-dependent tasks of spatial learning, such as water maze or contextual fear conditioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b035">35</xref>]. In this context, the role of the specific differentiation steps during neurogenesis and dynamics of integration of new neurons into existing circuitry remains unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b036">36</xref>].</p>
      <p>To address this issue, we used the approach of selectively enhancing the differentiation of progenitor cells in adult dentate gyrus. We conditionally expressed the gene <italic>PC3</italic> (also known as <italic>Tis21</italic> or <italic>BTG2</italic>, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b037">37</xref>] for review; GenBank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/</ext-link>) accession number M60921) in nestin-positive progenitor cells (type-1 and type-2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b007">7</xref>]) of the adult dentate gyrus. <italic>PC3</italic> is normally expressed in neuronal precursors immediately before the last asymmetric division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b039">39</xref>] and, during neurogenesis, it is known to induce their terminal differentiation in several areas of the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b041">41</xref>].</p>
      <p>We found that nestin-driven expression of <italic>PC3</italic> resulted in premature differentiation of adult-generated dentate gyrus neurons, with a reduction in the number of type-1 and type-2 neuronal progenitors. This genetic manipulation did not change the overall number of newly generated neurons; rather it altered their differentiation timing and resulted in profound changes in newborn neuron morphology. Remarkably, early <italic>PC3</italic> expression caused a severe impairment in performance on the different hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory tests used and resulted in a selective reduction in synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus. These results indicate that early stages of adult neurogenesis are crucial for the correct functional integration of newborn neurons into cognitive hippocampal circuits.</p>

        <title>Adult Hippocampal Granule Precursors Are Induced to Differentiate by <italic>PC3</italic></title>
        <p>Up-regulation of <italic>PC3</italic> induces neural precursors to shift from proliferation to differentiation, thereby promoting the generation of new neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b041">41</xref>]. Such enhancement of neurogenesis has been observed so far in neuroblasts of the neural tube and in cerebellar granule cell precursors, and follows inhibition of G1 to S phase progression and stimulation of proneural genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b042">42</xref>].</p>
        <p>We reasoned that conditionally controlling the differentiation of progenitor cells in the adult dentate gyrus would allow a selective analysis of their involvement in spatial memory networks.</p>
        <p>Thus, to start, we tested whether the differentiation of adult-generated newborn dentate gyrus neurons was influenced by <italic>PC3</italic>, which begins to be physiologically expressed in progenitor cells before differentiation, at the moment of their final mitosis (SF-V and FT, unpublished data). Up-regulation of <italic>PC3</italic> was activated earlier in nestin-expressing adult hippocampal stem and progenitor cells (type-1 and type-2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b007">7</xref>]) of bitransgenic nestin-rtTA/TRE-<italic>PC3</italic> mice (hereafter named Tg<italic>PC3</italic>). This was achieved by conditional expression from postnatal day 30 (P30) onward of the transgene under control of the nestin promoter, through administration of doxycycline, as previously shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b041">41</xref>]. Sixty days after activation of the <italic>PC3</italic> transgene, mice received five daily injections of BrdU (at P90–P94) to detect new progenitor cells and/or neurons, immediately followed by immunohistochemical analyses. Analysis of the expression of transgenic <italic>PC3</italic> in P95 mice with the <italic>PC3</italic> transgene active (named Tg<italic>PC3</italic> ON mice) indicated targeting to the dentate gyrus, as visualized by X-gal staining, which revealed the β-galactosidase activity of the β<italic>-geo</italic> reporter gene fused to the nestin-rtTA transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060246-g001">Figure 1</xref>A).</p>

            <p>(A) Selective targeting to the dentate gyrus in P95 mice of the <italic>PC3</italic> transgene (X-gal staining, blue) conditionally activated since P30 by doxycycline treatment (scale bar, 615 μm). New stem and progenitor cells (B–F, J) as well as new post-mitotic neurons (G–I) 1–5-d-old were detected by incorporation of BrdU after five daily injections in P95 Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF and ON mice (the latter having the transgene active), and were classified by analyzing the expression of specific markers through multiple-labeling and confocal microscopy detection.</p>
            <p>(B) The number of putative stem cells (type-1; BrdU/GFAP/nestin-positive) decreased about 50% in mice with activated <italic>PC3</italic> transgene.</p>
            <p>(C) This decrease was specific, given that the total number of GFAP-positive cells was only slightly reduced.</p>
            <p>(D) Activation of the <italic>PC3</italic> transgene also reduced a the number of new progenitor cells type-2ab (BrdU/GFAP-positive and nestin-negative), (E) type-2b (BrdU/nestin/DCX-positive), and (F) type-3 (BrdU/DCX-positive and nestin-negative).</p>
            <p>(G) Conversely, the new differentiating early post-mitotic neurons at stage 5 and 6 (BrdU/NeuN-positive), or (H) those specifically at stage 6 (BrdU/DCX/NeuN-positive), presented a strong, significant increase in mice with activated <italic>PC3</italic> transgene.</p>
            <p>(I) The new differentiating neurons, whose number is increased by activation of the <italic>PC3</italic> transgene, also expressed <italic>NeuroD1</italic>, which is required for their differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b047">47</xref>].</p>
            <p>(J) Nonetheless, in mice with active <italic>PC3</italic> transgene, no significant change was observed in the total number of new 1–5-d-old neurons in dentate gyrus—as detected by BrdU incorporation—or (K) in the total number of new terminally differentiated neurons (4 wk old, positive to BrdU and NeuN). These findings indicate, as a whole, that activation of the <italic>PC3</italic> transgene selectively accelerates the transition of stem and progenitor cells toward a differentiated state.

        <p>Among the different cell populations of the dentate gyrus, the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-expressing astroglia are considered to be dividing putative neural stem cells from which neuronal progenitor cells originate, given their ability to repopulate the dentate gyrus after cytotoxic ablation of dividing cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b006">6</xref>]. These stem cells are identified primarily by the expression of <italic>GFAP</italic>, accompanied by <italic>nestin</italic> or also <italic>Sox2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b044">44</xref>] and have been defined as type-1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b007">7</xref>]. We found that, in Tg<italic>PC3</italic> ON mice at P95, the BrdU<sup>+</sup>/GFAP<sup>+</sup>/nestin<sup>+</sup> cells—corresponding to 1–5-d-old type-1 cells—decreased significantly with respect to Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF control mice (about 40%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060246-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0003). The whole GFAP-positive astroglial cell population decreased only slightly, confirming the selectivity of effect on type-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060246-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). Since no difference between Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF and wild-type (WT) mice was found in these and in the following immunohistochemical analyses (unpublished data; <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), only Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF were considered as controls.</p>
        <p>Next, we analyzed the transiently amplifying progenitor cells derived from type-1 cells. These progenitors express nestin but lack GFAP and astrocytic features and are divided into two subgroups based on the absence or presence of the immature neuronal marker, doublecortin (DCX) (named type-2a and type-2b, respectively; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b010">10</xref>]). A further group of progenitor cells lacks nestin but expresses DCX (type-3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b009">9</xref>]). We observed that Tg<italic>PC3</italic> ON mice presented a significant decrease of 35% in the whole type-2a/type-2b population of 1–5-d-old newborn progenitor cells (identified as BrdU<sup>+</sup>/nestin<sup>+</sup>/GFAP<sup>–</sup>; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.02, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060246-g001">Figure 1</xref>D) and of 45% in type-2b progenitor cells (i.e., BrdU<sup>+</sup>/nestin<sup>+</sup>/DCX<sup>+</sup>; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.002, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060246-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). Moreover, Tg<italic>PC3</italic> ON mice also showed a reduction, albeit not significant, of type-3 progenitor cells (identified as BrdU<sup>+</sup>/nestin<sup>−</sup>/DCX<sup>+</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060246-g001">Figure 1</xref>F), consistent with the fact that at this stage, the nestin promoter becomes physiologically inactive and thus ceases to drive the expression of transgenic <italic>PC3</italic>. A control of the expression of transgenic <italic>PC3</italic> in nestin-positive type-1and type-2ab progenitor cell types, as determined by β-galactosidase expression, is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060246-sg001">Figure S1</xref>A–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060246-sg001">S1</xref>D.</p>
        <p>Type-3 progenitor cells generate early post-mitotic neurons identified by expression of the neuronal-specific differentiation marker, NeuN (stage 5 and 6; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b045">45</xref>]). In contrast to progenitor cells type-1–type-3, in Tg<italic>PC3</italic> ON mice the number of early post-mitotic, differentiated neurons up to 5 d old expressing NeuN increased considerably—more than twice than in control mice (identified as Brdu<sup>+</sup>/NeuN<sup>+</sup> as well as Brdu<sup>+</sup>/DCX<sup>+</sup>/NeuN<sup>+</sup>; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060246-g001">Figure 1</xref>G and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060246-g001">1</xref>H, respectively). Representative images of Brdu<sup>+</sup>/DCX<sup>+</sup>/NeuN<sup>+</sup> cells are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060246-g001">Figure 1</xref>L and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060246-g001">1</xref>M. These new neurons, which increased in number by activation of the <italic>PC3</italic> transgene, were also positive for <italic>NeuroD1</italic> (Brdu<sup>+</sup>/NeuroD1<sup>+</sup>/NeuN<sup>+</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060246-g001">Figure 1</xref>I), whose expression begins in type-2b progenitor cells, is maintained in post-mitotic hippocampal granule neurons, and is required for differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b047">47</xref>]. We conclude that the nestin promoter-driven expression of transgenic <italic>PC3</italic> accelerates the shift of adult-generated hippocampal stem and progenitors cells towards a post-mitotic, terminally differentiated phenotype, corresponding to NeuN-expressing neurons stage 5 and 6.</p>
        <p>Notably, <italic>PC3</italic> transgene activation did not change the total number of 1–5-d-old new progenitors generated in the dentate gyrus (BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells analyzed at P95 after completion of BrdU injections; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060246-g001">Figure 1</xref>J) or the total number of 4-wk-old new neurons (BrdU<sup>+</sup>/NeuN<sup>+</sup> cells analyzed at P116; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060246-g001">Figure 1</xref>K). The effects of transgene activation on the relative abundance of new dentate gyrus progenitor cell types and neurons is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060246-g001">Figure 1</xref>N. In addition, no significant change was detected in the number of proliferating progenitor cells of the whole dentate gyrus in mice with active transgene with respect to control mice, as detected by Ki67 labeling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060246-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A). Furthermore, an analysis of proliferating progenitor cell types expressing Ki67 showed that in Tg<italic>PC3</italic> mice, the number of type-1 (Ki67<sup>+</sup>/nestin<sup>+</sup>/GFAP<sup>+</sup>; <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), type-2ab (Ki67<sup>+</sup>/nestin<sup>+</sup>/GFAP<sup>–</sup>; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and type-2b (Ki67<sup>+</sup>/nestin<sup>+</sup>/DCX<sup>+</sup>; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) decreased, whereas that of type-3 progenitor cells increased significantly (Ki67<sup>+</sup>/nestin<sup>–</sup>/DCX<sup>+</sup>; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060246-sg002">Figure S2</xref>B–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060246-sg002">S2</xref>F).</p>
        <p>Together, these data indicate that <italic>PC3</italic> selectively accelerates the transition of stem and progenitor cells (type-1 to type-3) toward a post-mitotic differentiated state without affecting the following: (i) the total number of proliferating cells; (ii) the total number of newly generated neurons; or (iii) the final number of neurons differentiated. The decrease in the number of proliferating Ki67<sup>+</sup>/nestin<sup>+</sup> type-1–type-2ab progenitor cells expressing <italic>PC3</italic> is consistent with the notion that <italic>PC3</italic> expression is associated to the neurogenic asymmetric type of division in neuroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b039">39</xref>].</p>
        <p>To test whether activation of the <italic>PC3</italic> transgene caused nonspecific changes, a stereological analysis of the hippocampus was conducted. Activation of the <italic>PC3</italic> transgene after P30 did not alter the volume of the dentate gyrus or the whole hippocampus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060246-sg003">Figure S3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060246-sg003">S3</xref>B) or the total cell number in the dentate gyrus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060246-sg003">Figure S3</xref>C). Moreover, there was no evidence of reduced cell survival either in the whole hippocampus, as defined by TUNEL analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060246-sg003">Figure S3</xref>D), or within different subpopulations, as defined by labeling with the apoptotic marker caspase-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b048">48</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060246-sg003">Figure S3</xref>E–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060246-sg003">S3</xref>J). Also, no evident alteration in distribution of mature granule neurons or in morphology was detected in the hippocampus or in the whole brain (unpublished data).</p>
        <p>In conclusion, these results show that the activation of the <italic>PC3</italic> transgene accelerates the process of differentiation of dentate gyrus progenitor cells, thus providing a tool to specifically analyze the relationship between timing of hippocampal neurogenesis and spatial learning.</p>
        <p>We wished also to verify whether the expression of <italic>PC3</italic> had any effect on nestin-positive neural cells in the other adult neurogenic niche, i.e., the subventricular zone (SVZ), comprising type B astrocytic-like progenitors, type C transit amplifying cells, and type A migrating neuroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b049">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b051">51</xref>]. We observed that the number of type B and type C cells, labeled by BrdU/GFAP and BrdU/NG2, respectively, did not change significantly in Tg<italic>PC3</italic> ON mice (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060246-sg004">Figure S4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060246-sg004">S4</xref>B); on the other hand, the number of type A cells, corresponding to immature neurons derived from type C cells and identified by BrdU/DCX staining, was significantly lower than in control mice (40% decrease, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060246-sg004">Figure S4</xref>C). Conversely, differentiated SVZ neurons up to 5 d old (BrdU<sup>+</sup>/NeuN<sup>+</sup> cells) increased more than 2-fold in Tg<italic>PC3</italic> ON mice (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060246-sg004">Figure S4</xref>D), although the final number of new neurons generated in SVZ, as analyzed measuring BrdU<sup>+</sup>/NeuN<sup>+</sup> cells 3 wk later (at P116) in their final migratory destination, i.e., the olfactory bulb, did not differ in Tg<italic>PC3</italic> ON and OFF mice (unpublished data).</p>
        <p>This suggests that <italic>PC3</italic> accelerated the differentiation of SVZ cells, as observed for the cells of the dentate gyrus. It should be emphasized, however, that SVZ cells are not involved in spatial memory processes, being anatomically and functionally independent from those of the dentate gyrus, since they migrate through the rostral migratory stream to the olfactory bulb where they play a specific role in the olfactory processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b052">52</xref>].</p>

        <title>Reduced Dendritic Arborization and Spine Density in Adult-Generated Neurons in the Dentate Gyrus Prematurely Differentiated</title>
        <p>We then investigated whether early-differentiated dentate gyrus neurons in Tg<italic>PC3</italic> ON mice showed an altered morphology in the three different stages of the morphogenetic process underlying the maturation of granule neurons from progenitors in the SGZ of dentate gyrus. We labeled the newly generated granule neurons in adult hippocampus of Tg<italic>PC3</italic> mice by infecting the dentate gyrus region with a retrovirus produced by the vector CAG-GFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b019">19</xref>]. Highly concentrated retrovirus (about 10<sup>8</sup> pfu/ml) was delivered through sterotaxic surgery in the dentate gyrus of Tg<italic>PC3</italic> mice at P95, two months after activation of the transgene, according to the time schedule followed for immunohistochemical analyses. CAG-GFP vector is replication incompetent; thus, only dividing cells at the moment of surgery could be infected.</p>
        <p>The soma of the majority of GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons detected in control mice was localized on the hilar border of the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus at the different time points analyzed, i.e., throughout 7 −28 days post-infection (dpi). The most evident developmental feature of GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons, detected at different dpi in Tg<italic>PC3</italic> mice with either active or inactive transgene, was the progressive growth of dendrites, whose lengths, shorter than the width of the dentate gyrus blade at 7 dpi, increased greatly at 16 dpi and further at 28 dpi, reaching far outside of the dentate gyrus. During these last two time points, the dendritic growth was accompanied by an increase in the complexity of arborization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060246-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). There were, however, clear differences in neuronal morphology between Tg<italic>PC3</italic> ON and Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF mice, which we evaluated by scoring dendritic length and branching points. Analysis of GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons at 7 dpi revealed a significantly increased dendritic length in Tg<italic>PC3</italic> ON mice compared with Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF. This difference, however, was reversed in GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons at 16 dpi and more clearly at 28 dpi, when the dendritic lengths in Tg<italic>PC3</italic> ON mice were significantly shorter than those in Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060246-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Similarly, the number of branching points in GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons at 7 dpi was significantly greater in Tg<italic>PC3</italic> ON than in Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF mice, but again this difference was transient, because in GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons at 16 and 28 dpi, the number of branching points became equivalent in the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060246-g002">Figure 2</xref>C).</p>

        <p>To further evaluate the dendritic complexity, we analyzed the density of spines. The dendritic spine is the locus of connection to excitatory synaptic input, mainly glutamatergic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b053">53</xref>]; therefore, the process of spine formation has consequences in the functionality of neurons. Normally, spine growth starts in the adult-generated dentate gyrus neurons at about 16 dpi and reaches a plateau at 56 dpi, but at 28 dpi the exponential phase of growth has already ceased, and this stage can be considered representative of the attainment of the morphological maturity of the neuron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b019">19</xref>]. Therefore, we focused our analyses at 28 dpi, and also at 70 dpi, when the plateau of growth is attained. Quantification of spine density in dentate gyrus neurons indicated a significant reduction both at 28 dpi and at 70 dpi in Tg<italic>PC3</italic> mice with active transgene, compared to mice with inactive transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060246-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). However, at 28 dpi the decrease of spine density was substantial (60%), whereas at 70 dpi, it was mild (15% decrease; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060246-g002">Figure 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060246-g002">2</xref>E).</p>
        <p>We conclude that the dendritic length of new dentate gyrus neurons in Tg<italic>PC3</italic> ON mice, albeit greater than in control mice at 7 dpi, appeared significantly shorter at 28 dpi, associated with reduced spine density. This evidence points to a decrease in dendritic growth and in spine number during the developmental stages between 7 and 28 dpi; a partial recovery of normal values of spine density may slowly occur during the following stages. The absence of alteration in the branching points would indicate that no major morphological alterations occur, other than those likely consequent to a faster attainment of the end point of the maturation process.</p>

At the end of the first session, Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF mice were treated with doxycycline to activate the <italic>PC3</italic> transgene and subjected to a further experimental session (behavioral tests 2).

            <p>(B) Tg<italic>PC3</italic> ON (<italic>n</italic> = 10), Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF (<italic>n</italic> = 8) and WT (<italic>n</italic> = 23) mice were trained in the Morris water maze for 18 trials (six trials per day; trial/block 1–18), followed by 2 d of reversal learning (trial/block 19–30) in which the platform was moved to the opposite position. After the <italic>PC3</italic> transgene activation, Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF (labelled as Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF → ON, <italic>n</italic> = 8) and WT-doxy (<italic>n</italic> = 11) mice were subjected to a new learning session (trial/block 31–42) in which the platform was moved to a novel position in the pool. Escape latency is expressed in seconds required to reach the platform. The performance of Tg<italic>PC3</italic> ON mice was significantly impaired during both learning (left) and reversal learning (middle) in comparison with both Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF and WT.

        <p>To further test the effect of the <italic>PC3</italic> transgene activation on spatial memory, we submitted transgenic and control mice to a less stressful behavioral task compared to the water maze, namely the eight-arm radial maze [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b057">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b058">58</xref>]. In this task, mice have to search for a food pellet located at the end of each arm. Reentering a previously visited arm was considered as an error. Significant differences in the percentage of errors were found among groups (<italic>F</italic>(2,38) = 6.71; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005). As shown by post-hoc comparisons (Duncan multiple range test), the performance of TgPC3 ON mice was severely impaired (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in comparison to both Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF and WT mice, whereas no significant differences were found between these latter groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060246-g003">Figure 3</xref>D, left).</p>
        <p>Given that the above behavioral tests were conducted in Tg<italic>PC3</italic> ON mice in the presence of an active transgene, we wished to verify whether the observed behavioral phenotype could be related to indirect effects of <italic>PC3</italic> over-expression in nestin-positive cells on neighboring, mature granule cells. Thus, we tested spatial learning in the Morris water maze using Tg<italic>PC3</italic> ON mice in which the transgene was activated at P30 and inactivated at P95, i.e., prior to behavioral tests. To this aim, doxycycline treatment was suspended at P90, to allow 5 d of metabolization of the residual levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060246-sg006">Figure S6</xref>A). The performance of Tg<italic>PC3</italic> ON mice was significantly impaired in learning and reversal learning, as well as in the first and in the second probe trial, compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060246-sg006">Figure S6</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060246-sg006">S6</xref>C). Thus, we can exclude indirect cell-mediated effects by nestin-positive cells expressing the <italic>PC3</italic> transgene during the behavioral tests.</p>
        <p>Altogether, these behavioral results indicate that, in <italic>PC3</italic> transgenic mice, the accelerated differentiation of dentate gyrus adult progenitors dramatically impairs learning and memory of spatial information.</p>

        <title>Subsequent <italic>PC3</italic> Gene Activation in Trained Mice Results in Spatial Learning and Memory Deficits</title>
        <p>To verify whether genetically altered neurogenesis could impair learning performance in previously experienced tasks, Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF mice and their controls were treated with doxycycline (doxy; Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF → ON and WT-doxy, respectively) following the first experimental phase. In addition, for this set of experiments, the gene was activated for a shorter period of time (see time schedule in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060246-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). During treatment, both Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF → ON and WT-doxy mice were submitted to a second session of spatial learning and memory tasks. A new piece of information was introduced in the Morris water maze by moving the hidden platform to a different location. By contrast, in the radial maze, all mice were tested with the same procedure used in the first experimental phase. This differential approach was used to test for the ability of the mice to use previously acquired information.</p>
        <p>In the Morris water maze, Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF → ON mice were impaired in learning the novel position of the platform in comparison to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060246-g003">Figure 3</xref>B, trials 31–42; <italic>F</italic>(1,17) = 5.25; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).

        <p>These results indicate that the anticipated differentiation of dentate gyrus neural progenitors produces a remarkable impairment in tasks properly solved by transgenic mice before the <italic>PC3</italic> transgene activation. Thus, the normal differentiation timing of dentate gyrus neural precursors emerges as a major constraint to learning performance, even in a previously experienced spatial setting, either in the presence or absence of new information.</p>

        <title>Premature Differentiation of Adult-Generated Granule Cell Neurons Decreases Long-Term Potentiation of Synaptic Transmission in the Dentate Gyrus Selectively</title>
        <p>Long-term changes in synaptic strength have been described in several brain areas. In particular, hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) of glutamatergic synaptic transmission is believed to be the synaptic correlate of several forms of learning and memory (for reviews, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b061">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b062">62</xref>]). To test whether the above-described deficits in memory tasks caused by early expression of the <italic>PC3</italic> gene correlated with a change in long-term synaptic transmission, we recorded field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus while stimulating perforant path afferents in WT, Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF, and Tg<italic>PC3</italic> ON mice. Robust LTP of excitatory synaptic transmission could be evoked by high-frequency stimulations (HFS: four trains of 100 stimuli at 100 Hz) in WT animals. Overall, fEPSP slopes were 1.5 ± 0.04 larger when measured 50 min after LTP induction and compared with baseline levels (<italic>n</italic> = 13 slices, 7 mice; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060246-g005">Figure 5</xref>A).

        <title>Premature Differentiation of Adult-Generated Granule Cell Neurons Reduces Their Incorporation into Spatial Memory Networks of Dentate Gyrus</title>
        <p>The decrease of LTP evoked in the dentate gyrus of mice with an activated transgene prompted us to ask whether this decrease was correlated with the function of new neurons in memory circuits. It has been shown that newly generated neurons of the dentate gyrus are progressively integrated into spatial memory-related circuits after 4–6 wk of age. Such evidence was obtained by measuring c-<italic>fos</italic> expression, whose activation specifically occurs in dentate gyrus neurons of mice that have undergone spatial memory training and is thus correlated with the recruitment of new neurons into spatial memory circuits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b021">21</xref>]. Thus, we wished to define whether the anticipated differentiation of new granule neurons of dentate gyrus had an effect on the time at which they became active in memory networks and on the extent of their activation. To this end, we measured the number of new neurons at 2, 4, and 6 wk of age that become activated by a spatial memory test. Mice, either control (Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF) or with the <italic>PC3</italic> transgene activated 60 d before (Tg<italic>PC3</italic> ON), were treated with five daily injections of BrdU and then trained in different groups in the Morris water maze test 2, 4, and 6 wk later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060246-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). Mice were killed 1.5 h following the tests, and the number of new neurons, identified by positivity to BrdU and NeuN, was compared to the number of new neurons integrated into memory circuits, identified by c-<italic>fos</italic>, BrdU, and NeuN concomitant expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060246-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). In Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF mice, the fraction of new neurons expressing c-<italic>fos</italic> was null 2 wk after birth (i.e., after BrdU injections) but reached about 2% after 4 wk and increased to about 5% after 6 wk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060246-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). These data are in agreement with those obtained by Frankland's group, and they indicate a progressive functional activation of new neurons within spatial circuits, correlated to their age and maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b021">21</xref>]. In contrast, in mice with the <italic>PC3</italic> transgene activated, virtually no 2-, 4-, or 6-wk-old new neurons expressing c-<italic>fos</italic> were detectable, clearly indicating that new neurons did not undergo activation by spatial training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060246-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). The lack of induction of c-<italic>fos</italic> expression by spatial training in 4- and 6-wk-old neurons of Tg<italic>PC3</italic> ON mice corresponded to a significant learning deficit of these mice in the Morris water maze task (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060246-sg007">Figure S7</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060246-sg007">S7</xref>B).</p>

        <p>Moreover, in the dentate gyrus, the ratio between the total number of new neurons generated (i.e., BrdU<sup>+</sup>/NeuN<sup>+</sup> cells) and the total number of neurons (NeuN<sup>+</sup> cells) did not significantly differ in the same Tg<italic>PC3</italic> ON and Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF mice groups analyzed 2, 4, and 6 wk after BrdU injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060246-g006">Figure 6</xref>D).

        <title>Anticipated Maturation of Adult-Generated Hippocampal Progenitor Cells</title>
        <p>The transgenic conditional model used in this study offers the possibility of analyzing the hippocampus-dependent learning and memory processes after a selective enhancement of the maturation rate of new adult-generated hippocampal neurons. In contrast, previous studies eliminated new progenitor cells and neurons from the adult hippocampus, using either antimitotic toxins, x-ray irradiation or virus-activated pro-drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b028">28</xref>]. Our analysis of the dentate gyrus showed that activation of the <italic>PC3</italic> transgene driven by nestin promoter led to a great increase in fully differentiated, 1–5-d-old, adult-generated hippocampal granule neurons (stage 6; positive for NeuN and BrdU), accompanied by a parallel decrease in stem cells and putative transiently amplifying progenitor cells (type-1 and −2) of the same age. These results clearly indicate an accelerated transition toward terminal differentiation of the newborn progenitor cells expressing the PC3 transgene. Moreover, the analysis of fully differentiated hippocampal granule neurons of about 4 wk of age showed that the final number of neurons produced is the same in both Tg<italic>PC3</italic> ON and control mice. As a whole, these findings indicate that the rate of maturation of new neurons is accelerated by <italic>PC3</italic>, without any effect on the rate of neurogenesis—i.e., the birth rate of new neurons—and thus on the total number of new neurons generated.</p>
        <p>Such <italic>PC3</italic>-dependent anticipated differentiation of progenitor cells is in line with the previously observed, intrinsic differentiative properties of <italic>PC3</italic> on neural precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b041">41</xref>] and might result from the prevalence, in progenitor cells type-1 and type-2, of the asymmetric neurogenic type of division, with which the expression of <italic>PC3</italic> is associated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b063">63</xref>].</p>

        <title>Deficits in Spatial Learning and Memory Are Associated with Reduced Functionality of New Neurons</title>
        <p>The enhanced rate of maturation of the whole population of progenitor cells of the adult dentate gyrus of Tg<italic>PC3</italic> ON mice was clearly associated with a severe impairment in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory, as indicated by the performance of transgenic mice in different hippocampus-related behavioral tasks. In fact, learning and memory deficits were observed both in the Morris water maze and in the radial maze test. Furthermore, a significant memory deficit was also observed in the contextual fear conditioning test, in which both the hippocampus and the amygdala mediate the association between context and the aversive stimulus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b059">59</xref>]. Conversely, no significant effect was observed in the cued version of the task, mainly characterized by a greater involvement of the amygdala formation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b064">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b066">66</xref>]).</p>
        <p>Such selective impairment of hippocampal spatial learning raises questions about the role played by functional and morphological modifications occurring in newborn neurons of our mouse model.</p>
        <p>A relevant functional change observed in mice with maturation of progenitor cells enhanced by <italic>PC3</italic> is the decrease of LTP evoked in the dentate gyrus, an effect that appears to be specific, because no alteration of synaptic plasticity in the CA1 region is seen. It is widely believed that LTP and depression of synaptic transmission underlie several forms of learning and memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b061">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b062">62</xref>], and are often accompanied by structural changes of dendritic spines (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b067">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b069">69</xref>]). The earliest form of excitability is shown by nestin<sup>+</sup> non-radial precursor cells (type-2 cells; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b018">18</xref>]), and LTP begins to be observed in adult-generated, young (1–3-wk-old) hippocampal neurons, where it is elicited more easily than in mature, post-mitotic dentate gyrus neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b016">16</xref>]. Thus, the reduced LTP that we observe should not depend on the reduced number of progenitor cells type-2 and type-3 present in mice with activated transgene, because they are too immature to generate LTP. Rather, the reduction of LTP may depend on new neurons that are ≥2 wks old, whose numbers are unchanged in our mouse model but whose dendritic arborization and spine density are markedly decreased. Thus, bypassing the early stages of differentiation during adult neurogenesis in neurons generated following transgene activation strongly affects the ability of dentate gyrus circuits to integrate synaptic transmission. This is further suggested by the observation that basic synaptic transmission is unchanged, as input-output curve analysis shows.</p>
        <p>A second functional change that we observe in the dentate gyrus of transgenic mice is the lack of activation of new, fully differentiated neurons, 4–6 wk of age, in response to learning, as indicated by the absence of induction of c-<italic>fos</italic> expression after training. Indeed, the activation of adult-generated dentate gyrus neurons in spatial memory circuits has been linked to the induction of c-<italic>fos</italic> expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b070">70</xref>]. This expression is elicited in adult-generated dentate gyrus neurons, 4–6 wk of age, in mice trained in the Morris water maze, indicating that at this developmental stage the dentate gyrus neuron develops functions critical for its activation and recruitment into spatial memory circuits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b021">21</xref>]. Hence, the absence of c-<italic>fos</italic> activation in 4–6-wk-old neurons that have expressed <italic>PC3</italic> at birth suggests that these neurons do not attain a functional state in hippocampal circuits.</p>
        <p>The functional alterations observed by us in new, adult-generated dentate gyrus neurons that are prematurely differentiated may find a structural correlate in the morphological alterations, most evident in 4-wk-old neurons identified after infection with a GFP-expressing retrovirus, i.e., reduced dendritic length and spine density.</p>
        <p>We can assume that the birth datings of a neuron by BrdU and retroviral infection are comparable, and we consider that a neuron analyzed 4 wk post-infection is representative of the level of mid-late maturation, when the main neuronal structures are developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b019">19</xref>].</p>
        <p>Altogether, it is plausible that the faster attainment of the terminally differentiated state, observed in adult-generated dentate gyrus neurons of mice with active transgene, may (following an initial faster development of the dendritic tree seen in neurons at 7 dpi) lead to a premature end of the developmental stages relative to the establishment and growth of the dendritic tree during the second and third week after birth. Only at later stages, i.e., in 10-wk-old neurons, emerges a tendency to recover, at least in part, normal values of spine density.</p>
        <p>Neuronal structure and functional activity are correlated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b071">71</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b075">75</xref>]. Indeed, the reduced dendritic structure affects spine formation (the latter being spatially constrained by dendrites) and ultimately the afferent synaptic input, since each spine receives one synaptic bouton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b076">76</xref>]. As a result, the neuron has reduced capability to activate and integrate memory patterns, as our electrophysiological and behavioral data indicate.</p>

        <title>Continuous Requirement in Spatial Learning of Newly Generated Neurons</title>
        <p>In conclusion, the selective anticipation of differentiation of new, adult-generated dentate gyrus neurons induced in the <italic>PC3</italic> transgenic mouse model reveals the critical role of developmental timing, even before terminal mitosis, for the generation of neurons that are fully able to integrate new spatial memories.</p>
        <p>As our data indicate, the number of new neurons necessary to integrate new spatial information appears relatively small. In fact, the number of new dentate gyrus neurons generated during the shortest period of activation of the transgene, sufficient to prevent new spatial learning (about 20,000, i.e., 800–1,000 per day multiplied by 22 days elapsed before behavioral session 2), should not exceed 5%–6% of the total number of neurons in the dentate gyrus (less than one half million).</p>
        <p>It is worth noting that the progenitor cells born before or during the first session of spatial training in Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF mice will normally differentiate without being affected by activation of the transgene during session 2, because in progenitor cells, the nestin promoter becomes physiologically inactive within 1 wk after their birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b007">7</xref>]. Thus, in Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF → ON mice, only the new neurons born in the 3–4-wk period of transgene activation preceding and during the second behavioral session appear to be responsible for the spatial learning and memory deficits observed.</p>
        <p>Moreover, given that Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF → ON mice were significantly impaired in spatial tasks since the beginning of the second session, the premature differentiation of adult-generated hippocampal progenitor cells could prevent not only learning new spatial tasks but also the use of information acquired previously in normal condition, i.e., during session 1 before activation of the transgene.</p>
        <p>Therefore, the picture emerging from our data is that the correct differentiation and integration into existing memory circuits of a relatively small population of new adult-generated neurons not more than 4 wk old are crucial not only for spatial learning but also, notably, for the use of memories consolidated in tasks previously performed. Conversely, neurons older than 4 wk appear less efficient. This unique role of younger adult-generated neurons in the maintenance of key memory functions may derive from their proposed ability to link temporally proximal events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b023">23</xref>], and also entails the need for continuous renewal of new neurons as soon as they terminally differentiate. The late activation (i.e., c-<italic>fos</italic> expression) observed after training in 4–6-wk-old neurons by us and by the group of Frankland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b021">21</xref>], might thus be related to subsequent steps of integration into spatial learning circuits.</p>
        <p>The significant impairment of the hippocampal function observed in our model, i.e., the deficit of spatial learning in the Morris water and radial maze tests accompanied by deficit of dentate gyrus LTP, is not frequently observed in studies of spatial memory (e.g., see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b077">77</xref>]).</p>
        <p>It is plausible that the ablation of new neurons, while eliminating their functional contribution, may at least in some case trigger compensatory processes, e.g., increased proliferation of the surviving progenitors, or a plastic reassembly of the cytoarchitecture of circuits. In our model, the new neurons exist, albeit with a reduced functionality; thus, as our data strongly suggest, no compensatory processes are activated. Moreover, these altered new neurons appear to establish connections with the existing neurons and are thus integrated in previously-formed circuits. It might be the same as expanding a circuit by interspersing new elements with lower functionality. Therefore this model, assembling within spatial circuits new neurons generated in normal number but with altered maturation, can be considered the equivalent of an anatomical dominant-negative, and may give the advantage over ablative strategies of magnifying the ability of new neurons—variable depending on their maturation state—to integrate and/or recall traces of temporally proximal events from existing circuits.</p>

The number of branching points was counted manually in the same images. For each data point, 20–30 cells from two mice were analyzed (either control or with activated transgene). From the same GFP-positive neurons, the spines present on dendritic processes were imaged by acquiring <italic>z</italic>-series of 25–35 optical sections at 0.5 μm of interval with a 63X apochromatic oil lens, and a digital zoom of 3. The number of spines was counted manually on two-dimensional projections obtained by the LAS AF software. The linear spine density was then calculated by dividing the total number of spines by the length of the corresponding dendritic process.</p>

        <p>WT, Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF, and Tg<italic>PC3</italic> ON mice, 95 d old, were used for electrophysiological recordings. Tg<italic>PC3</italic> ON mice were used after animals were exposed for two months to doxycycline hydrochloride. Mice were deeply anesthetized with isofluorane inhalation and decapitated, and the brains were removed and immersed in cold “cutting” solution (4 °C) containing (in mM): 234 sucrose, 11 glucose, 24 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, gassed with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Coronal slices (300 μm) were cut with a vibratome from a block of brain containing the dorsal hippocampus and then incubated in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing (in mM): 126 NaCl, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 glucose, gassed with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>; pH 7.4, initially at 35 °C for 1 h, and subsequently at room temperature. Slices were then transferred to a submersed recording chamber and maintained at 32 ± 1 °C while being continuously perfused by fresh and oxygenated aCSF at a rate of ∼2–3 ml/min. Recordings were performed in the continuous presence of 100 μM picrotoxin to block inhibitory GABAergic transmission. Monopolar stimulating and recording electrodes consisted of glass pipettes (0.5–1 Mμ) filled with aCSF and placed in the middle of the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus or in the middle of the stratum radiatum. Field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were amplified using a Multiclamp 700B patch-clamp amplifier (Molecular Devices). A Digidata 1320 digitizer and PClamp9 (Molecular Devices) were used for data acquisition, analysis, and generation of stimuli. Input-output (I/O) curves were generated before inducing LTP. For I/O curves, stimulus intensities were adjusted to have afferent volleys of 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 μV in all tested slices, and the resulting fEPSP slopes were calculated and averaged across 3–5 sweeps. For LTP experiments, fEPSPs were stimulated at 0.1 Hz. If a stable baseline of at least 10 min was achieved, LTP was induced by four trains of 100 stimuli at 100 Hz repeated every 20 s for recordings in the dentate gyrus and one train of 100 stimuli at 100 Hz in the CA1 area. Results are presented as means ± SEM. Data were averaged in 0.5-min bins.</p>

        <title>Behavioral tests.</title>
        <p>All mice were tested in an open field and a plus maze [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b085">85</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b086">86</xref>] to assess locomotor abilities and anxiety levels. No statistically significant differences were found among the groups in both tasks (unpublished data).</p>
        <p>The behavioral experiments were carried out in two phases, according to the schedule shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060246-g003">Figure 3</xref>A. In the first phase, the following groups of mice, aged 3 mo, were used: Tg<italic>PC3</italic> ON (<italic>n</italic> = 10), in which the <italic>PC3</italic> transgene was activated at P30 by doxycycline administration; Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF (<italic>n</italic> = 8), in which doxycycline was not administered so that the <italic>PC3</italic> transgene was not activated; and WT (<italic>n</italic> = 12 treated with doxycycline; <italic>n</italic> = 11 untreated). At the end of the first phase, Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF (<italic>n</italic> = 8) and untreated control mice (WT, <italic>n</italic> = 11) were administered with doxycycline and, after day 22 of treatment, these two mice groups (labeled as Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF → ON and WT-doxy, respectively) were subjected to a second behavioral testing session.</p>
        <p>The Morris water maze [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b055">55</xref>] was carried out in a circular swimming pool of 1.3 m in diameter, filled with opaque water at a temperature of 25 ± 1 °C and located in a room containing prominent extra-maze cues. A hidden, 15-cm diameter platform was used. In the first experimental phase, the training consisted of 18 trials (six trials per day, lasting a maximum of 60 s, with an intertrial interval of 30 min), with the platform left in the same position. After 3 d of learning, the platform was moved to the opposite position and reversal learning was monitored for two additional days. Probe tests (60 s) were carried out 24 h after both learning and reversal learning by removing the platform from the pool. In the second phase, Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF → ON and WT-doxy mice were submitted to a further session of spatial learning lasting 2 d, during which the platform was located in a different position from those used in the previous experimental phase. A probe test was carried out 24 h after learning. Behavior was evaluated by EthoVision software (Noldus Information Technology).</p>
        <p>For the eight-arm radial maze [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b057">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b058">58</xref>], mice were singly housed, with water provided ad libitum, and gradually reduced to 85% of their free-feeding body weight. Throughout the experiment, mice were maintained at their reduced weight by being fed with a premeasured amount of food on each day. The maze apparatus was constructed of gray plastic maze, with eight identical arms radiating 37 cm from an octagonal starting platform (side 7 cm). On each training trial, a 20-mg food pellet was placed at the end of each arm (baits were not replaced) and the animal was placed on the central platform, facing a randomly selected direction. In both the first and second experimental phases, all groups of mice were submitted to one trial per day for 10 training days; each daily trial ended when eight choices were made or 15 min had elapsed. An arm choice was defined as placement of all paws on a maze arm. An error was noted when an animal entered a previously visited arm.</p>
        <p>For the contextual and cued fear conditioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b087">87</xref>], the experiments were carried out in two different chambers. In both the first and second experimental phases, all mice were trained in conditioning chamber A (26 × 22 × 18 cm), made of transparent Plexiglas with a grid metal floor and located in a sound-insulated box lighted by a white tensor lamp (60 W). After an acclimatizing period lasting 120 s, a 30-s tone was administered (CS; 3 kHz, 80 dB). During the last 2 s of tone presentation, a foot-shock was delivered (US; 0.5 mA). Both CS and US ended simultaneously. Mice were left in the conditioning chamber for a further period of 30 s and then returned to their home cage. For the contextual conditioning test, 24 h after training mice were placed in the same chamber for 5 min. Two hours after the contextual test, mice were tested for cued conditioning in chamber B, made of black Plexiglas, with a floor of triangular shape, lighted by a blue tensor lamp (60 W) and perfumed by a vanilla essence diffuser. The test lasted 6 min, with CS administered during the last 3 min.</p>
