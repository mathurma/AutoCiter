<p>Many bacteria exhibit multicellular behaviour, with individuals within a colony coordinating their actions for communal benefit. One example of complex multicellular phenotypes is myxobacterial fruiting body formation, where thousands of cells aggregate into large three-dimensional structures, within which sporulation occurs. Here we describe a novel theoretical model, which uses Monte Carlo dynamics to simulate and explain multicellular development. The model captures multiple behaviours observed during fruiting, including the spontaneous formation of aggregation centres and the formation and dissolution of fruiting bodies. We show that a small number of physical properties in the model is sufficient to explain the most frequently documented population-level behaviours observed during development in <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic>.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Understanding how relatively simple, single cell bacteria can communicate and coordinate their actions is important for explaining how complex multicellular behaviour can emerge without a central controller. Myxobacteria are particularly interesting in this respect because cells undergo multiple phases of coordinated behaviour during their life-cycle. One of the most fascinating and complex phases is the formation of fruiting bodies—large multicellular aggregates of cells formed in response to starvation. In this article we use evidence from the latest experimental data to construct a computational model explaining how cells can form fruiting bodies. Both in our model and in nature, cells move together in dense swarms, which collide to form aggregation centres. In particular, we show that it is possible for aggregates to form spontaneously where previous models require artificially induced aggregates to start the fruiting process.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Bacteria are able to sense their surroundings in order to adapt to environmental change. Most bacteria live in dense populations, therefore other cells constitute a major part of their physical and chemical environment allowing regulatory interactions between cells to be established. The benefits of coordinated behaviour include: more efficient proliferation resulting from a cellular division of labour, access to resources that cannot be utilised by isolated cells, defence against antagonists and population survival by differentiation into distinct cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Shapiro1">[1]</xref>.</p>
<p>Myxobacteria are Gram-negative, ubiquitous, soil dwelling bacteria that are semi-flexible, and rod-shaped. Cells glide across a surface using the adventurous (A) and the social (S) motility systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-McBride1">[2]</xref>. S-motility is coordinated at the leading pole; cells extend type IV pili which can adhere to the surface of other bacteria or polysaccharides, and upon retraction the cell is pulled forward. A-motility is coordinated at the lagging pole; cells are thought to extrude a slime which expands and generates a propulsive force to push cells forward <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Wolgemuth1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-SgaardAnderson1">[4]</xref>. Myxobacteria display distinct social phenotypes and multicellular behaviours.</p>
<p><italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> is the most commonly studied species of myxobacteria. In response to starvation, cells undergo multiple phases of behaviour culminating in the formation of fruiting bodies and myxospores. The developmental process involves a series of macroscopic changes in colony morphology. A key regulator of development is C-signal ling which occurs when C-signal, a cell surface-associated signal encoded by <italic>csgA</italic>, is exchanged between cells in close contact with one another. C-signal stimulates the expression of <italic>csgA</italic> leading to a rise in C-signal ling throughout development from positive feedback. Different colony morphologies are a consequence of different C-signal ling levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Kim1">[5]</xref>. C-signal ling is thought to affect the reversal frequency of individual cells in a contact-dependent fashion allowing the synchronisation of behaviour <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Kim1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Kim2">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>During vegetative growth cells move in the direction of their long axis, reversing typically once every ten minutes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Jelsbak1">[8]</xref>. Under starvation conditions, C-signal accumulates within a cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Kim1">[5]</xref> reducing its reversal frequency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Jelsbak2">[9]</xref>. The reduction in the reversal frequency and the effects of A and S motility causes cells to form streams and increases the likelihood of aggregation; cells which cannot reverse tend to remain stuck in one location since their ability to move around obstacles is limited by only being able to move forward <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Wu1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>M. xanthus</italic> cells begin to form fruiting bodies after a prolonged starvation period of approximately 24 h. Starved cells form into large, intricate multicellular aggregates containing between 50,000 and 100,000 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-OConnor1">[11]</xref>. The fruiting body is the precursor to sporulation where cells undergo morphogenesis and physically change shape from rods to nearly spherical cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-White1">[12]</xref>. Inside the nascent fruiting body, a percentage of the cells differentiate into dormant myxospores. This process requires both temporal and spatial coordination in three dimensions, making it one of the most complex and least understood phases of the life-cycle. Relatively little is known about the spatial dynamics of fruiting body construction with research primarily devoted to understanding the signalling mechanisms required to coordinate development rather than the actual physics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Curtis1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>There is some disagreement over how fruiting actually begins. O'Connor and Zusman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-OConnor1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-White2">[14]</xref> observed that cells appear to orbit around a largely stationary aggregation centre. This led to the <italic>traffic jam</italic> model, which proposes that streams of cells collide together causing the formation of a kernel of stationary cells. Cells move around and over the static centre leading to a mound formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Igoshin1">[15]</xref>. Work on <italic>Stigmatella</italic> fruiting body formation showed that cells form circular orbits around a base and then move upwards in a spiral fashion around the base, building the stalk on top of it <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-White2">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Grilione1">[16]</xref>. It was presumed other myxobacteria, including <italic>M. xanthus</italic>, form fruits in a similar way; however, Kuner and Kaiser <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Kuner1">[17]</xref> did not observe the spiralling patterns suggesting that this behaviour is possibly non-essential and may not be intrinsically important to fruiting development. Recent work by Curtis <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Curtis1">[13]</xref> suggests that fruiting bodies are formed using a stepped layer building approach; large streams of cells forming sheets collide causing a rapid build up in density at the meeting point. Cells in one of the opposing streams are forced upwards and over the other, similar to tectonic plate movements. The displaced cells are supported on top of the dense layer of cells and extra-cellular polysaccharide (EPS) underneath and begin to spread out forming a new layer. As the new layer becomes more dense itself, cells at the centre start to get pushed upwards to form a new layer and the process repeats causing the formation of an expanding mound of cells.</p>
<p>Previous computational models of fruiting body development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Sozinova1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Kaiser1">[20]</xref> are based on the orbiting <italic>traffic jam</italic> model and rely upon the artificial induction of an aggregation centre to start fruiting body development, typically by making a subset of cells stationary. In this paper, we take a different approach and use an off-lattice Monte Carlo simulation to show how cells can spontaneously aggregate to form layers and fruiting bodies based on the observations of Curtis <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Curtis1">[13]</xref>. The motivation of this work is to gain an increased understanding of fruiting, by examining the physical properties driving cells to engage in fruiting, using mathematical and computational modelling.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2">
<title>Model</title>
<p>To study fruiting body development in the model myxobacterium <italic>M. xanthus</italic>, a Monte Carlo model of the fruiting body dynamics was developed. Similar stochastic models have been used to study three-dimensional fruiting formation in <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Savill1">[21]</xref> so some of those concepts were adapted to derive the model of myxobacteria fruiting.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Boundary conditions</title>
<p>Periodic boundary conditions were disabled in the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000686.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-plane since it does not make sense for cells to be able to push through the floor nor move through the ceiling for which there is no physical interpretation. Boundaries are maintained with a boundary energy term which severely penalises a cell for attempting to cross a particular domain boundary. The energy penalty is several orders of magnitude larger than the value any of the other energy terms might produce so it is nearly impossible for a configuration with these domain crossings to be favourable.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Cell influx</title>
<p>Fruiting body formation requires a highly dense region of cells to seed aggregation. To achieve such a density at the start of simulation would require cells to be placed so that they fill all available space on the floor of the simulation volume. Even under these conditions, the cell density is usually not sufficient to seed fruiting, and the lack of space for movement would inhibit cell motility. Biologically, fruiting bodies are thought to form from the confluence of streams of cells resulting in the cell density increasing over time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-SgaardAnderson1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Kaiser2">[22]</xref>. To capture this behaviour in the simulations, <italic>entry zones</italic> were placed around the edges of the simulation volume (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000686.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Entry zones allow new cells to be introduced into the simulation over time to model cell influx. A maximum influx rate (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000686.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) can be specified to govern how quickly new cells enter the simulation volume. The actual influx rate is stochastic and less than the maximum influx rate, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000686.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and is determined by the amount of free space within the entry zones where new cells can be placed. New cells are placed at random locations by periodically sampling the entry zones to see if there is free space to place a cell and then placing a cell if the maximum influx rate (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000686.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) has not been exceeded. Fruiting requires a high cell density and simulating a finite number of cells makes it problematic to assemble enough cells in an area to form a fruit; the cell density is never high enough. A finite number of cells may clump and partially aggregate but they are unlikely to form a fruiting body. With the entry zone model, a constant cell density can be maintained to sustain fruiting body growth.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>C-signalling</title>
<p>Cell reversals are thought be controlled by C-signal stimulating the complex Frz pathway, however the exact function of each component has yet to be determined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Zusman1">[23]</xref>. We therefore model the macroscopic behaviour of the pathway, where an internal phase switch is used as an abstract representation of C-signal. The switch increments until it reaches <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000686.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> at which point it resets and the cell reverses. The switch can be perturbed by signalling between neighbouring cells to make reversals happen more quickly, by a factor proportional to the number of collisions a cell experiences with its neighbouring cells. The function is therefore:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000686.e006" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000686.e007" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000686.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the new cumulative value, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000686.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the current value, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000686.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a basal increase factor, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000686.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the signal strength, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000686.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the level of C-signal ling a cell experiences at time <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000686.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, defined by the collisions a cell experiences with each of its neighbours and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000686.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> a collision factor.</p>
<p>In this work we keep the model of C-signal ling quite simple, as our goal is to explore other factors which can facilitate the formation of aggregates and fruiting bodies. Experiments indicate that even 15 hours into starvation, levels of C-signalling are sufficient to reduce the rate of reversals to once every 22 minutes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Jelsbak3">[24]</xref>. Moreover, these experiments show that the slowdown in reversal induces a 15-fold increase in travel distance, in what could be considered a ‘unidirectional behaviour’. We approximate this low frequency of reversals by considering cells which have come near to an aggregation as non-reversing, reflecting the approach taken in other simulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Sozinova1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Sozinova2">[19]</xref>. Nevertheless, in simulations of fruiting C-signal ling levels and collisions are monitored, enabling the imposition of a threshold C-signal ling level governing the induction of sporulation.</p>

<title>Slime trail following energy</title>
<p>As well as extruding slime to move, cells can also detect slime trails left by other cells and preferentially follow them. This allows cells to follow other adventurous cells and leads to the formation of streams that can break away from the main colony. Slime following is complementary to A-motility. As each cell moves, it deposits a slime trail.

This is consistent with O'Connor and Zusman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-OConnor1">[11]</xref> who suggest that cells appear to behave as independent sheets. This effect has been modelled so that it is somewhat analogous to a snow plow, which is pushed forwards into the snow pushing the snow up and away. In a similar way it is proposed that the oncoming force of a sheet of cells is sufficient to push oncoming cells up and direct them over and on top. Each cell monitors the number of head-on collisions it has, and the more the collisions the greater the chance of it being pushed up. Cells are not forced to always be pushed upwards, as this would be imposing an artificial constraint on the system, instead cells prefer regions of lower cell density where they are freer to move. Some cells will be pushed outwards away from the stream, but the majority will be pushed upwards since this is the only region of free space available.</p>

The exact role of the slime has yet to be elucidated due to the methods used to collect data and the very high cell densities within the fruit, making it difficult to resolve individual cells. Electron microscopy can resolve cells at higher resolutions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-OConnor1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Grilione1">[16]</xref> but this can only take a snapshot of a dynamic process and is unsuitable for tracking cells over a relatively long time period.</p>
<p>In a dense region, cells generate a lot of EPS with a fruit being a large amalgamation of cells within an EPS matrix. The EPS is likely to exert a surface tension effect causing cells to stick together rather than drifting apart. This is separate from the slime trail following effect as it is non-directional, acting over the whole cell area. If two cells are close to each other and encased in slime, breaking them apart requires extra energy to counter the adhesive effects of the slime. In contrast to the climbing effect, here cells experience an energy penalty for breaking apart. It is a form of non-specific attraction and operates over short ranges since two cells several cell lengths apart will not affect each other; only cells in close proximity experience adhesion.</p>

Each cell was composed of eight three-dimensional segments (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000686-g002">Figure 2</xref>) with each segment being composed of 27 segment nodes arranged in a cube formation. Segments were allowed to overlap so that cells maintained a continuous volume and the correct aspect ratio despite being made of multiple separate segments (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000686-g002">Figure 2 b</xref>). The physical behaviour of cells was described using a Hamiltonian function whilst the internal state was described using ordinary differential equations (ODEs).</p>

<title>Cell adhesion</title>
<p>The EPS surrounding cells is rarely considered in models; however, in our model we found that slime can have an essential role in fruit formation. The Hamiltonian includes an adhesion term, which generates energy proportional to the inverse square of the distance between any two cells in a neighbourhood. It is more energetically favourable for cells to remain close to other cells otherwise there is a severe penalty for moving apart that increases exponentially with distance. An inverse relationship was chosen so that long range interactions are weak; cells towards the perimeter of the local neighbourhood should not exert the same influence as cells in close proximity. Adhesion acts to control the viscosity of the slime determining how easy it is for cells to move through it. The amount of slime and thickness varies depending on the stage of fruiting and the cell density <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Grilione1">[16]</xref>. We note that Curtis <italic>et al.</italic> reported that a <italic>pilA</italic> mutant produces less EPS and this inhibits fruiting body formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Curtis1">[13]</xref>. It is not known biologically whether the effect of the <italic>pilA</italic> mutation is a consequence of reduced EPS production, or due to altered motility properties. Therefore, a direct comparison with the <italic>pilA</italic> mutant described by Curtis <italic>et al.</italic> is not possible.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000686.s001">Figure S1</xref> shows the effect of varying the strength of adhesion on a stream of cells. When there is no adhesion, cells at the front of the stream are able to move adventurously, causing the stream to break down into a number of smaller streams which diverge. As the adhesion strength (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000686.e155" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) is increased, cells remain much closer.

When <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000686.e157" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the slime is so viscous that cells are no longer able to move.</p>

<title>Aggregate formation</title>
<p>Fruiting begins with streaming and the confluence of streams to form aggregation centres. The fruiting model presented here allows cells to spontaneously form streams and aggregation centres (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000686-g004">Figure 4</xref>). A simulation consisting of 300 cells was run three times to determine the efficacy of streaming and aggregation (model parameters are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000686-t001">Table 1</xref>). Cells were initially randomly distributed. After approximately 100 min of simulated real time, cells formed into streams regardless of their initial configuration. Cells aligned and formed small streams which joined other streams when they came into contact. After 300 min cells typically formed an aggregate, which expanded as the the majority of cells joined it.</p>

<p>The effects of motility along with cell adhesion causes model cells to form streams. As the streams approach an aggregation centre, cells will attempt to avoid collision and alter course.

<title>A finite number of cells prevents fruiting</title>
<p>In a model with a finite number of cells, it is difficult to achieve a high enough cell density to maintain aggregates. There is an upper bound on the density of cells in a mono-layer above which cells will not have enough space to move and be able to engage in activity. With a high cell density which still allows cells to move, it is possible to get aggregation, but once the fruit starts to form, the number of cells moving into the aggregate will not be sustainable and the fruit will simply dissociate. This type of model is also unrealistic because in reality, an aggregate would be surrounded by other cells and not sit in isolation as more cells join it. Although it would be ideal to model a vast mono-layer of cells to ensure there were a sufficient number of cells to a form a fruit, computational limitations (typically memory) restrict the size of a simulation.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000686.s004">Figure S4</xref> shows the output of a fruiting body simulation using a finite number of cells. 1600 cells were arranged into two opposing sets of streams with one set perpendicular to the other. The streams move into each other and collide. In the aggregation centre, some cells push upwards and move over others forming new layers and the base of a stalk. The effect of using a finite number of cells becomes apparent after 300 time steps when the stalk begins to disassociate. The cells organise themselves into a stack four layers thick, but since there are no more cells to expand the base layer, the upper cells begin to climb down and move away from the fruit. Once a few cells move away, a mass exodus is triggered causing all of the cells to move away. The formation and subsequent rapid dispersion of fruits will occur at any point where an aggregate forms. This effect will be more apparent on subsequent aggregation formations since the number of cells within the mass is unlikely to be as high as in the initial formation so the deterioration will be more pronounced.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3e">
<title>Fruit dispersal</title>
<p>Curtis <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Curtis1">[13]</xref> observed that during the initial stages of fruiting, small fruiting bodies would sometimes repeatedly start to form and then dissipate before a stable fruiting body finally formed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000686-g001">Figure 1</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Curtis1">[13]</xref>).</p>
<p>The formation of transitory aggregates can be explained by adjusting the cell influx rate. The simulations maintained the same initial conditions as the previous fruiting simulation, except the rate of influx was altered. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000686.s002">Figure S2</xref> shows a snapshot of a simulation where the influx rate was reduced by 90%. Although a fruiting body begins to form it rapidly dissociates over time. Cells accumulate and the stack expands outwards from the centre for approximately 200 min after which the fruit collapses and the cells begin to disperse. The cell density remains too low for cells to attempt a new fruit formation suggesting that influx could be a primary driving factor behind development.</p>
<p>The base influx rate was selected to ensure a constantly high cell density to enable fruit formation. Lower influx rates promote transitory fruiting body formation and dissociation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000686-g005">Figure 5</xref> shows three-dimensional snapshots of fruiting development when the influx rate was reduced to 25% of the base value. After 500 min, three small mounds have formed; however, they dissociate and new mounds form. This agrees with experimental evidence showing transitory aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Curtis1">[13]</xref>. If the simulation volume were enlarged by several orders of magnitude (which has not been computationally feasible), we predict that as fruiting bodies disperse, a cohesive layer of cells would form and drift off. This would meet other disparate layers from other dispersed fruits and further fruiting development would be initiated where they collide. The process would repeat leading to multiple transitory fruit formations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Curtis1">[13]</xref>. The prerequisite for this to occur is a sufficiently high cell influx that allows a fruit to form but at a sub-optimal rate such that development cannot be sustained. The fruiting body must be sufficiently large so that, when cells leave it, they form a layer of equal density to the initial layers so that fruiting can occur spontaneously at other locations. The influx rate appears to be the rate limiting step in controlling fruiting growth; there is a point where the number of cells forming new layers will begin to exceed the number of cells flowing into the system so the development of new layers is arrested.</p>

<p>The influx rate we use here refers specifically to the addition of new cells into the simulation volume.

<title>Sporulation stabilises fruiting bodies</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000686-g006">Figure 6</xref> shows how mound formation in the fruiting simulation varies over time. The motile cell count rises sharply during the first 16 h of simulated real time as cells accumulate within the fruit and surrounding area. After this time point, a combination of the cell density and the aggregate size makes it more difficult for new cells to enter the aggregate. The high cell density ensures constant C-signal ling triggering a constant rise in myxospores, which occupy an increasing fraction of the aggregate. Fruiting development begins after 10 h with a small mound formation. This rapidly expands and develops into a fruiting body after 24 h around which motile cells orbit in stream formations. Towards the periphery of the fruit, the cell density rapidly decreases leaving only a thin layer of cells (less than three cells deep) in the regions not occupied by the fruit.</p>

<p>C-signal is not evenly distributed throughout the colony. Cells within the fruit collide much more frequently with other cells so they accumulate C-signal faster (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000686-g007">Figure 7 a</xref>) and sporulate faster (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000686-g007">Figure 7 b</xref>). The majority of C-signal ling occurs within the fruit hence spores are formed within or close to the fruit centre and are pushed into the centre by the motile cells.</p>

<p>The large hemispherical aggregate agrees with the formations observed by Kuner and Kaiser <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Kuner1">[17]</xref>. The aggregate is stable due to the spores that occupy the centre of the mound (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000686-g007">Figure 7 a</xref>). The spores limit the movement of the motile cells causing them to stall more frequently in the aggregate and expanding the size of the traffic jams. The motile cells push the non-motile cells towards the centre of the aggregate in agreement with existing data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-OConnor1">[11]</xref>. Cells are highly crowded and aligned, forming streams and sheets. This is in agreement with the observations of O'Connor and Zusman (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000686-g006">Fig. 6A</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-OConnor1">[11]</xref>). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000686.s005">Video S1</xref> is a video of simulation output showing the formation of the fruiting body.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A precise understanding of how and why myxobacteria cells form fruiting bodies remains elusive; however, we can start to address the issue of fruiting body development from a theoretical perspective and provide a possible explanation of how they form. The models presented here indicate that fruit formation can be simply a natural consequence of cell behaviour without any form of centralised coordination. The lack of reversals makes cells prone to collisions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Wu1">[10]</xref>. Aggregation centres tend to form quickly as small streams of cells frequently collide and block each other's path. Without the ability to reverse, cells are forced to remain stuck in their current position. Any cells that join the tail of the trail become stuck as well leading to a traffic jam and the formation of an aggregate. It should be noted that these small streams are typically too small to trigger cells to instigate climbing since although the cells are blocked, the density of neighbouring cells is not generally sufficient to support a new layer of cells on top of it.</p>
<p>A primary goal of the modelling work presented here is to show that a physical and biochemical model can explain multiple phases of behaviour. While it is beyond the scope of this work to fully address <italic>all</italic> factors controlling the myxobacteria life-cycle, we previously showed that a similar Monte Carlo model of cell physics can explain rippling and the behaviour of cells in the early stages of starvation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Holmes1">[35]</xref>. We also modelled a C-signal ling mutant by switching off the C-signal ling component in the Hamiltonian and observed vegetative behaviour in agreement with Curtis <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Curtis1">[13]</xref>. By adjusting the C-signal ling levels of the model presented in this article, cells can be shown to revert to responding to C-signal with a higher incidence of reversal.</p>
<p>Cell climbing was an important factor in governing how well aggregates formed in our model. Cells were allowed to climb at any angle, but it was more favourable for them to climb at steeper inclines. Climbing simulates the effect of oncoming cells pushing up and under cells causing them to rise upwards to a new layer. It was found that cells need to climb at a fairly steep angle (though only for relatively short distances) with a typical incline angle being <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000686.e160" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> rad since a cell is being pushed upwards by another cell so the height it rises must be sufficient to allow the opposing cell to move into its space.</p>
<p>Sozinova <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-Sozinova1">[18]</xref> used a three-dimensional lattice gas cellular automata model to study rippling formation. Cells were oriented in one of six directions on a hexagonal grid, which introduces spatial inaccuracy. This limits the direction cells can move in and any orbiting patterns of cells may be an artefact of this; any alteration in direction is a turn of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000686.e161" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> rad so cells can move through tight arcs. The rigid cell body also means that the cell must alter its course dramatically. In reality, the partial flexibility of the cell means it does not have to completely alter its course to avoid an obstacle; it can bend slightly to align itself alongside the object and move around it. O'Connor and Zusman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000686-OConnor1">[11]</xref> showed that cells cluster in small aligned patches within a fruit and move together. A hexagonal lattice model does not allow for this; cells maintain alignment only if they never change direction, otherwise they alter course by <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000686.e162" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> rad and spatial alignment is lost almost immediately.</p>
<p>The models presented here show that it is possible for fruiting bodies to develop without artificial induction. Cell density and an upward pushing force seem to be sufficient to instigate formation. Importantly, the EPS surrounding cells must exert an adhesive force, binding cells together. Without this force, cells are too unconstrained and move away from the aggregate. Each layer acts almost independently. Cells from one layer have a much reduced effect on cells in another layer than cells in the same layer. Experiments where all terms in the Hamiltonian were dependent on a local three-dimensional neighbourhood showed that cells cannot move freely due to feeling the effects of cells moving in all directions around them.</p>
<p>The fruiting models offer an explanation of the initial formation of fruiting bodies as a consequence of cell physics and a low reversal frequency, suggesting that fruiting bodies form can form spontaneously without the need for an artificial aggregation centre to start the process. The fruiting model has also shown that observed transitory fruiting body developments before a stable fruiting body forms can be explained as a consequence of net cell influx. Sporulation appears to be important for stable fruiting body formation. A large aggregate of non-motile cells provides a base around which the motile cells can move to form the fruiting body. Motile cells are still driven upwards at the base of the aggregate where streams collide and they force the spores to move upwards as well. This offers a potential mechanism for allowing myxobacterial cells to form sporangiole on stalks without extensive behaviour modifications. Although the model incorporates sporulation, it is still not clear how cells choose to sporulate since only a percentage of the fruiting body do so. The fruiting model approximates this behaviour by only allowing a percentage of the cells to sporulate. Future experimental work will hopefully provide more information on the sporulating process which can be incorporated into the models.</p>
<p>The models presented here offer potential mechanisms <italic>M. xanthus</italic> could use to organise streaming, aggregation and fruiting body formation. Importantly, by deriving the fruiting models from an existing model of rippling, we have shown that a single model based on the observable, physical characteristics of myxobacteria can explain multiple spatial phenotypes and may shed more light on how myxobacteria is able to exhibit multiple different behaviours during its life-cycle.</p>
