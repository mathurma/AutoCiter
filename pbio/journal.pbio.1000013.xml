        <p>Polycomb group (PcG) and trithorax group (trxG) proteins are conserved chromatin factors that regulate key developmental genes throughout development. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, PcG and trxG factors bind to regulatory DNA elements called PcG and trxG response elements (PREs and TREs). Several DNA binding proteins have been suggested to recruit PcG proteins to PREs, but the DNA sequences necessary and sufficient to define PREs are largely unknown. Here, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on chip assays to map the chromosomal distribution of <italic>Drosophila</italic> PcG proteins, the N- and C-terminal fragments of the Trithorax (TRX) protein and four candidate DNA-binding factors for PcG recruitment. In addition, we mapped histone modifications associated with PcG-dependent silencing and TRX-mediated activation. PcG proteins colocalize in large regions that may be defined as polycomb domains and colocalize with recruiters to form several hundreds of putative PREs. Strikingly, the majority of PcG recruiter binding sites are associated with H3K4me3 and not with PcG binding, suggesting that recruiter proteins have a dual function in activation as well as silencing. One major discriminant between activation and silencing is the strong binding of Pleiohomeotic (PHO) to silenced regions, whereas its homolog Pleiohomeotic-like (PHOL) binds preferentially to active promoters. In addition, the C-terminal fragment of TRX (TRX-C) showed high affinity to PcG binding sites, whereas the N-terminal fragment (TRX-N) bound mainly to active promoter regions trimethylated on H3K4. Our results indicate that DNA binding proteins serve as platforms to assist PcG and trxG binding. Furthermore, several DNA sequence features discriminate between PcG- and TRX-N–bound regions, indicating that underlying DNA sequence contains critical information to drive PREs and TREs towards silencing or activation.</p>

          <p>Although all cells of a developing organism have the same DNA, they express different genes and transmit these gene expression patterns to daughter cells through multiple rounds of cell division. This cellular memory for gene expression states is maintained by two groups of proteins: Polycomb-group proteins (PcG), which establish and maintain stable gene silencing, and trithorax group proteins (trxG), which counteract silencing and enable gene activation. It is unknown how this balance works and how exactly these proteins are recruited to their target sequences. By mapping the genome-wide distribution of PcG and trxG factors and proteins known to recruit them to chromatin, we found that putative PcG recruiters are not only colocalized at PcG binding sites, but also bind to many other genomic regions that are actually the binding sites of the Trithorax complex. We identified new DNA sequences important for the recruitment of both PcG and trxG proteins and showed that the differential binding of the recruiters PHO and PHOL may discriminate between active and inactive regions. Finally, we found that the two fragments of the Trithorax protein have different chromosomal distributions, suggesting that they may have distinct nuclear functions.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Polycomb group (PcG) and trithorax group (trxG) proteins are conserved chromatin factors that maintain, respectively, the memory of inactive or active states of homeotic genes throughout development. They also regulate many other target genes (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b001">1</xref>]) and misregulation of PcG and trxG genes leads to loss of cell fates, aberrant cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Moreover, PcG and trxG factors play an important role in diverse epigenetic processes such as stem cell pluripotency and plasticity, genomic imprinting, and X chromosome inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b002">2</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, PcG and trxG proteins are recruited to chromatin by regulatory DNA elements called PcG and trxG response elements (PREs and TREs, respectively). These elements were shown to drive epigenetic inheritance of silent and active chromatin states throughout development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b004">4</xref>]. Biochemical studies on PcG proteins revealed that they exist in at least three distinct multiprotein complexes (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b005">5</xref>]). PRC2-type complexes contain the four core components E(z) (Enhancer of zeste), Esc (Extra sex combs), Su(z)12 (Suppressor of zeste 12), and Nurf-55. The SET domain-containing E(z) subunit trimethylates lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3). This mark is specifically recognized by the chromo domain of Polycomb (PC), a subunit of the PRC1-type complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b006">6</xref>]. PRC1 contains PC, Polyhomeotic (PH), PSC (Posterior sex combs), and the histone H2A ubiquityltransferase dRing, in addition to several other components, including TBP-associated factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b007">7</xref>]. The PhoRC complexes include the sequence-specific DNA binding proteins Pleiohomeotic (PHO) or its homolog Pleiohomeotic-like (PHOL), as well as the dSfmbt protein (<italic>Scm</italic>-related gene containing four MBT domains). Several trxG complexes have been identified: TAC1 (Trithorax Acetylation Complex) with the histone methyltransferse Trithorax (TRX), NURF, SWI/SNF, ASH1, and ASH2 (for reviews, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b008">8</xref>]). Interestingly, the human TRX homolog MLL1 has been previously shown to be cleaved at two conserved sites by the Taspase1 enzyme, generating an N-terminal and a C-terminal fragment, which can heterodimerize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b010">10</xref>]. However, it is unknown whether the two moieties can have different functions or chromosomal distributions. Additional PcG/trxG proteins have been identified that are not part of the core of these complexes, but are associated with them and, therefore, can be considered as PcG/trxG-associated proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b011">11</xref>]. These proteins may exist as individual molecules in the cell, but it is also possible that they are part of other protein complexes that contain additional, as yet unidentified PcG/trxG proteins.</p>
      <p>PcG and trxG complexes (except PhoRC) do not bind their target DNA in a sequence-specific manner in vitro, but are recruited to PRE/TRE sequences in vivo. A simple pathway for PcG protein recruitment based on stepwise recruitment of PRC2 proteins by PhoRC, followed by PRC1 recruitment by the H3K27me3 mark deposited by PRC2 has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b012">12</xref>]. However, PcG recruitment seems to be more complex. PHO interacts with PRC2 as well as with the PC and PH subunits of PRC1 in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b013">13</xref>]. PHO/PHOL binding sites alone are insufficient to tether PcG proteins to DNA in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b015">15</xref>], and most PcG sites are stained normally in polytene chromosomes in <italic>pho/phol</italic> double mutants despite lack of detectable PHO and PHOL proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b015">15</xref>]. However, PcG protein binding is lost at the bxd PRE in <italic>pho/phol</italic> double-mutant wing discs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b012">12</xref>], suggesting that the role of PHO and possibly PHOL is important. Other factors have been shown to be involved in recruitment, such as GAGA factor (GAF), Pipsqueak (PSQ), Dorsal switch protein (DSP1), Zeste, Grainyhead (GH), and Sp1/KLF (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b005">5</xref>]). Mutations in the corresponding genes do not have a clear PcG phenotype, and intriguingly, all seem to be involved in activation as well as in repression. In summary, many unresolved questions regarding PcG recruitment still remain, and the current model proposes that a combination of several DNA binding factors, and maybe yet-unknown components, could lead to tethering of PcG proteins to DNA.</p>
      <p>Recently, the distribution of several core components of PcG members and their associated histone modifications has been analyzed in fly as well as mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b022">22</xref>]. Yet, a comprehensive genome-wide binding map of PcG/trxG recruitment factors and of trxG proteins is still lacking. Here, we have generated high-resolution genome-wide binding maps in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos of two PRC1 components and their associated histone mark H3K27me3, the N- and the C-terminal part of the TRX protein and their associated histone mark H3K4me3 as well as four sequence-specific DNA binding proteins known to be involved in recruitment of Polycomb proteins. Our results show the complementarity between PcG and trxG protein binding in the genome and suggest that multiple DNA binding proteins participate in setting up this PcG and trxG protein distribution.</p>

        <title>Overview of PcG and trxG Genomic Landscapes</title>
        <p>Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in 4–12-h-old <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content> embryos coupled with genome-wide high-density tiling arrays, we mapped the distribution of the PRC1 components: PC and PH, the N- and the C-terminal part of the Trithorax protein (TRX-N and TRX-C, respectively), and the histone H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 marks. We also determined the genome-wide binding profile of GAF, PHO, PHOL and DSP1, four DNA binding proteins thought to be involved in PcG recruitment. Reproducibility of biological replicates is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-sg001">Figures S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-sg002">S2</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows an example of the different profiles along part of chromosome 3R including the HOX gene cluster named ANT-C. The statistics on the number and size of regions significantly enriched for various proteins is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-sg003">Figures S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-sg004">S4</xref>, and in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-st001">Table S1</xref>. As observed previously, PC and H3K27me3 mark covered over 200 large domains (&gt;5 kb), most of which contain discontinuous subregions with significant <italic>p</italic>-values for enrichment separated by small intervening subregions that were enriched although their <italic>p</italic>-values were not significant (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-sd001">Text S1</xref> for a precise definition of H3K27me3 and PC domains). The number of significantly enriched subregions for PC and H3K27me3 were 2,110 and 2,480, respectively. Nearly all PH binding sites fall into PC- and H3K27me3-bound regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). The sequence-specific DNA binding proteins PHO, PHOL, DSP1, and GAF are bound to thousands of genomic sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-st001">Table S1</xref>). Surprisingly, whereas PcG binding sites strongly predict the presence of one or more of the DNA binding factors, the converse is not true. In fact, the sequence-specific DNA binding proteins are more frequently bound to sites bound by TRX-N and trimethylated on H3K4 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Binding of the N-terminal fragment and the C-terminal fragment of TRX (TRX-N and TRX-C, respectively) correlates well at the genome-wide level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-sg005">Figure S5</xref>), but the relative intensities are very different. TRX-N is significantly bound to 4,868 genomic sites, with strong binding correlated to H3K4me3-bound regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g002">Figure 2</xref>; a total of 4,893 regions contained H3K4me3). At most of these sites, TRX-C binding levels are higher than background, but not picked up as significant. Strong binding of TRX-C is only identified at 167 genomic sites, mainly located in PRC1-bound regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g002">Figure 2</xref>C) where TRX-N binds weakly if at all.

        <title>Bivalent Domains Are Not a Common Feature of the Fly Embryo Epigenome</title>
        <p>Recent analysis of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in mouse and human cells revealed the coexistence of these two marks in a large fraction of the H3K27me3 regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b029">29</xref>]. These regions encompass most of the H3K27 trimethylated sites in embryonic stem (ES) cells and a substantial portion of them in differentiated cells. Although we do frequently observe H3K4me3 occupancy at transcription start sites (TSSs) flanking PH sites, this is almost exclusively observed at the boundary of large H3K27me3 domains (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-sd001">Text S1</xref>). From a total of 4,893 H3K4me3 and 2,480 H3K27me3 regions, only 161 had an overlap, i.e., only 6.5% of the H3K27me3 regions. Considering that most of the genes identified by these regions of overlap are expressed only in a fraction of the embryonic cells, we believe that most of these cases reflect a mixture of cell populations rather than true bivalency. Moreover, the H3K4me3 profile always showed sharp peaks at promoters within large H3K27me3 regions, in contrast to mammalian cells in which bivalent domains often show similar profiles with H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 spread over regions of several kilobases in size. Thus, our data suggest that H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 are generally exclusive in the fly genome. Nevertheless, individual cases of true bivalency may exist in fly embryos or at other developmental stages. A rigorous demonstration of this point will require sequential ChIP with mononucleosomal chromatin and antibodies directed against the H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 marks.</p>

        <title>Two Layers of Genomic Organization</title>
        <p>We sought a comprehensive characterization of the joint distribution of PcG and trxG factors and associated marks. Many of the data tracks are highly correlated among themselves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-sg005">Figures S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-sg006">S6</xref>), and are also tightly associated with other spatial genomic features like TSSs. We therefore developed a new method for dissecting a multivariate genomic profile into a hierarchy of “spatial clusters.” Briefly, “spatial clustering” can be viewed as the genomic analog of gene clustering, since it dissects the genome into clusters that share a common profile across all experimental tracks (detailed information is given in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-sd001">Text S1</xref>). Unlike gene clustering, our model takes into account the genomic layout of the data, and organizes clusters spatially to probabilistically describe the typical genomic order among them. We used the clustering results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g003">Figure 3</xref>) as a blueprint for our dataset, validating conclusions by running an independent, supervised data analysis. An example of cluster organization is illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-sg007">Figure S7</xref>. Analysis of the distribution of cluster location with respect to the TSS further demonstrates how the clusters are organized around genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g003">Figure 3</xref>B, note that TSS data were not used by the algorithm to define clusters).</p>

            <p>(A) Spatial clusters. We dissected our multifactor genome-wide dataset into groups of loci with common factor and histone mark occupancy (spatial clusters). Clusters are probabilistically tied together to reflect a typical genomic organization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-sg018">Figure S18</xref>). Our algorithm detected two superclusters, one representing H3K27me3-marked domains (left) and the other representing H3K4me3-marked domains (right), and further decomposed each supercluster into distinct genomic behaviors. Here, we depict each cluster as a block, where rows represent the 2 kb (−1 kb to +1 kb) around cluster centers, color-coded to reflect the binding intensity of nine marks and factors (yellow indicates strong binding, blue negative enrichment).</p>
            <p>(B) We also plotted the enrichment of clusters' locations relative to the TSS (<italic>x</italic>-axis, zero reflect the TSS itself), normalized by the genome-wide frequency of distances from the TSS.</p>
            <p>(C) Frequency of clusters in the genome. The relative abundance of the eight clusters is shown. About two-thirds of the genome is not associated with either of our two superclusters (i.e., lboth H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 are lacking).</p>

        <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g003">Figure 3</xref>, our data reflect two levels of genomic organization. First, the genome is partitioned into three superclusters. Consistent with the mutually exclusive distribution of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3, unsupervised spatial clustering identifies a “H3K27me3-marked” supercluster and “H3K4me3-marked” supercluster, in addition to regions with no particular epigenomic enrichment (“background” supercluster, not shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Second, each supercluster is subdivided into distinct clusters, and the model identifies the connections between clusters that organize the entire genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-sg018">Figure S18</xref>). The H3K27me3 superclusters are anchored around clusters characterized by high levels of PH binding (labeled as “PH sites”). These clusters include also strong PHO enrichment, presence of the recruiter factors GAF and DSP1 and TRX-C occupancy. All of the PH site clusters in the BX-C, the ANT-C, the <italic>ph</italic>, the <italic>hh</italic>, and the <italic>en</italic> genes were previously identified as PREs, suggesting that in general, most of the PH clusters are indeed PREs. The H3K27me3 supercluster also included three clusters with lower levels of PC and a general lack of PH and cofactors. We labeled them as “Strong,” “Medium,” and “Weak” PC clusters.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the H3K4me3-marked supercluster was subdivided by the algorithm into four clusters. These clusters reflect clear organization around annotated TSSs, as identified by their TSS enrichment statistics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g003">Figure 3</xref>B) and binding preferences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). We denoted the cluster with the most 5′ enrichment as the “K4me3-recruiters” cluster. It is characterized by high levels of GAF, DSP1, and significant, but weaker levels of PHO and PHOL, as well as medium to weak H3K4me3 levels. Enriched exactly at the TSS is the “K4me3-TSS” cluster with high H3K4me3 levels in combination with high levels of TRX-N, PHO and PHOL. The K4me3 cluster has only high levels of H3K4me3 and represent the region downstream the TSS, whereas the “weak K4me3” cluster shows low, but significant levels of H3K4me3 alone and is more weakly enriched around TSSs.</p>

        <title>Polycomb Domain Plasticity</title>
        <p>PC and H3K27me3 were bound in large regions, often greater than 5 kb, with the largest ones spanning several hundred kilobases (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-sg004">S4</xref>A). Globally, H3K27me3 and PC profiles were very well correlated, facilitating the definition of PC domains (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-sd001">Text S1</xref>), underscoring the significance of the H3K27me3 supercluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g003">Figure 3</xref>) identified by spatial clustering. A similar pattern was observed for PC and H3K27me3 by Schwartz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b020">20</xref>] in their genome-wide mapping studies in S2 cells and by Tolhuis et al. who used Kc cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b022">22</xref>].</p>

The average distribution of H3K27me3 around PH peaks takes a dip at the PH sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), which may be due to nucleosome depletion at the PREs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b020">20</xref>].

        <p>Despite these common features, there are differences in the positions of many of the PcG domains in different biological samples. Although the majority of our 217 H3K27me3 domains also exists in S2 cells, 79 (36%) of them did not overlap any bound regions in S2 cells. These data are corroborated by the analysis of the distribution of the PC protein which, similar to H3K27me3, forms large domains. In general, H3K27me3 differences between embryos and S2 cells paralleled differences in PC binding. The same was observed in a comparison between ChIP on chip binding of PC from embryos and the PC DamID profile obtained previously in Kc cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b022">22</xref>]. Interestingly, a substantial portion of the PC domains in Kc cells differed from those observed both in embryos and in S2 cells. Thus, many common PC domains are identified in various cell types, but a significant subset of them is cell-type specific rather than constitutive. These data are in agreement with previous studies suggesting that part of the PcG binding is cell-type and developmental-stage specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b030">30</xref>].</p>

DSP1 and GAF were present in about 50% of the PH sites. In contrast, PHOL binding was not common at PH sites, with a frequency (21.1%) comparable to that of TRX-N (26.5%). Surprisingly, only a minority of all recruitment factors binding sites (3.2% to 13.5%) was restricted to PH sites (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000013-t001">Table 1</xref>). Comparison with previously published Zeste data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b031">31</xref>] showed that a moderate 25% of the Zeste sites colocalized with PH peaks.

        <title>H3K4me3 and the Distribution of Putative PcG Recruitment Factors</title>
        <p>The K4me3-recruiter cluster (including strong GAF and DSP1 and medium to weak H3K4me3 levels) is located in a position just upstream to the TSS. The K4me3-TSS cluster (high H3K4me3 levels and strong TRX-N, PHO, and PHOL binding) is usually following it and is almost exclusively observed over the 2 kb around the TSS. Finally, the K4me3 cluster (high H3K4me3 levels without TF occupancy) is enriched 3′ to the TSS. This organization suggests that binding of GAF and DSP1 can promote the activation of a TSS upon binding of TRX-N and the PHO/PHOL factors. Therefore, PH target promoters are strongly bound by PHO and TRX-C and depleted of PHOL and TRX-N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g004">Figure 4</xref>B), whereas H3K4me3 promoters are bound by PHO, PHOL, and TRX-N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Notably, the positions of PHO (and PHOL) in the second class of promoters is right at the TSS, whereas at PH-bound promoters, PHO is colocalized with PH upstream to the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). This different architecture may contribute to PH recruitment or to silencing of PH-bound promoters.</p>

        <title>TRX Binding and Associated Histone Marks</title>
        <p>We further analyzed active promoters and PREs/TREs by analyzing TRX binding. The human TRX homolog MLL1 is cleaved by Taspase1, generating an N-terminal and a C-terminal fragment, which can heterodimerize in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b010">10</xref>]. Low levels of TRX-N co-occupied PH binding sites in about 26.5% of cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g004">Figure 4</xref>A; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000013-t001">Table1</xref>). However, TRX-N is present at thousands of other genomic sites, where no PcG binding can be observed. These genomic sites correspond mainly to annotated 5′ ends of genes carrying H3K4me3 peaks slightly offset towards the body of the gene in comparison to TRX-N (cluster K4me3-TSS; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Interestingly, although the TRX-C profile overall looks similar to the TRX-N, its relative binding intensities are different. TRX-C is strongly bound at PcG binding sites, whereas low binding is observed at most promoter regions of non-PcG target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g004">Figure 4</xref>). These results suggest that whereas the distribution of the N-terminal part of TRX follows a general transcription cofactor role, the C-terminal part is specifically linked to PcG function. PcG proteins might repress transcription by anchoring the C-terminal portion of TRX at PREs. On the other hand, constitutive TRX-C binding at PREs/TREs might allow PcG target genes to switch their state upon strong transcriptional induction.</p>

        <p>Two motifs (GAGA and the CA repeat motif) are marking clearly the PH sites and the K4me3-recruiter clusters. Three additional motifs are strongly marking the K4me3-TSS cluster and clearly discriminating it from the spatially coupled K4me3-recruiter cluster sites. Two of them are motifs bound by the Myc, Max, and Mad/Mnt proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b036">36</xref>] and include the DNA replication element (DRE) TATCGATA, which is also consensus for several other factors including the TRF2n, Cut, and Beaf-32. The third motif (CAGCTG) is an E-box bound by bHLH proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b037">37</xref>] which, like DREs, are involved in the regulation of many developmental genes. We note that the detected motif enrichments are specific to the K4me3-TSS cluster and not to general TSSs in the genome since general non–H3K4me3-associated TSSs lack these motifs.</p>
        <p>Importantly, we also discovered motifs that discriminate between K4me3-recruiters and PH sites. The CAACAACAA motif is enriched around K4me3-recruiters, but not in and around PH sites (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-sg008">Figure S8</xref>). On the other hand, the CCGTCGG and the Sp1/KLF-like [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b038">38</xref>] GGGGTGGG motifs are specific to PH sites and not K4me3-recruiters (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-sg011">Figure S11</xref>). These motifs constitute candidates to recruit new DNA-binding factors to PREs.</p>
        <p>In addition to these motifs, the consensus sites for PHO/PHOL, DSP1, and GAF are more strongly enriched at the 300-bp core regions around the maximal binding peak of PH than around the other genomic regions bound by the factors without PH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-st005">Table S5</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-st008">S8</xref>). Thus, the density of binding sites is specific to PREs, suggesting that cooperative binding may help recruit PcG proteins. Consistent with this idea, the fold enrichment for each of the factors (with the exception of PHOL, see below) is higher at PH-bound regions compared to non–PH-bound regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-sg012">Figures S12</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g004">4</xref>).</p>
        <p>Of particular interest is the distribution of the PHO motif around PH sites and the K4me3-TSS clusters. Unlike the GAGA (or CACA) motif, the frequency of motifs with sequence similarity to consensus PHO motifs is high, but these motifs are not well localized at PH sites. High predicted PHO affinities (defined by PWMs; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-sd001">Text S1</xref>) were also present in the strong PcG clusters surrounding PH sites. This pattern matches perfectly with our ChIP data, which also suggest that PHO levels are regionally high around PH sites. In contrast to this pattern, the K4me3-TSS cluster is characterized by weak, but significant peaks of PHO motifs that were localized right at the TSS. This pattern is again matched by the PHO and PHOL ChIP data at the TSS of H3K4me3 associated promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g004">Figure 4</xref>C).</p>

        <title>Discrimination between PH Sites and H3K4me3-Marked Clusters by Differential PHO and PHOL Binding</title>
        <p>PHO and PHOL share sequence homology, were shown to bind the same DNA motif in vitro, and have been proposed to play redundant roles in PcG-mediated silencing (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b005">5</xref>]). Notably, we observed that PHO and PHOL binding patterns do not always overlap in the genome. In particular, PHO binds much stronger than PHOL at PH sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g003">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-sg013">S13</xref>C, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-sg014">S14</xref>), whereas both proteins bind with similar intensities in K4-recruiter and K4-TSS clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g004">4</xref>). We also noticed that the majority of PHOL sites in the genome colocalized with TRX-N and H3K4me3-bound regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-sg005">S5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-st004">Table S4</xref>A). To investigate whether PHO and PHOL may fulfill distinct roles in recruitment of PcG and trxG proteins, we computed the genome-wide ratio of PHO/PHOL binding (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-sd001">Text S1</xref>) and plotted it compared to the individual profiles as well as to PH sites. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g007">Figure 7</xref>A shows that the PHO/PHOL ratio accurately matches the PH distribution profile since the binding of the two proteins at all other sites in the genome cancels out, whereas PHO binding at PREs is much stronger than PHOL. To confirm whether the ratio of PHO/PHOL is linked to the activity state of PRE/TREs, we examined by quantitative ChIP assays the binding levels of PH, PHO, and PHOL at three PcG target genes characterized by ON/OFF expression states in different larval tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g007">Figure 7</xref>B–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g007">7</xref>F). <italic>Ubx</italic> is expressed in haltere/third leg imaginal discs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b039">39</xref>] and is repressed in eye imaginal discs (ED). On the contrary, <italic>so</italic> (<italic>sine oculis</italic>) and <italic>toy</italic> (<italic>twin of eyeless</italic>) have very low expression in haltere/third leg discs and are highly expressed in eye discs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-sg015">Figure S15</xref>A). For <italic>Ubx</italic> regulation, we analyzed protein binding levels at the bx PRE, bxd PRE, and the <italic>Ubx</italic> TSS, and for <italic>so</italic> and <italic>toy</italic>, we analyzed their TSS, which overlapped with the PH-bound region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-sg015">Figure S15</xref>B). PH, PHO, and PHOL are bound in all the 5′ regions of the genes that we examined in both the ON and OFF state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g007">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-sg016">S16</xref>). However, significant differences in binding levels were noticed. In haltere/third leg discs where <italic>Ubx</italic> is ON, bx PRE, bxd PRE, and <italic>Ubx</italic> TSS showed a slight decrease in PH binding (50%) as compared to eye discs. Both <italic>so</italic> and <italic>toy</italic> TSS showed higher levels of PH binding in haltere/third leg discs, where these genes are silenced (OFF), as compared to eye imaginal discs (ON). At the <italic>Ubx</italic> TSS and the bx PRE, levels of PHOL were significantly higher in haltere/third leg discs (ON) as compared to eye discs (OFF). With regards to PHO, stronger binding was observed at the PREs in eye discs (OFF state), whereas at <italic>so</italic> and <italic>toy</italic> stronger binding was observed in haltere/third discs (OFF state) compared to eye discs (ON). In summary, a significant decrease in the levels of PH in tissue where target genes are active correlates with a decrease in the PHO/PHOL ratio. On the other hand, increased PH levels at genes that are OFF in a certain tissue correlates well with an increased PHO/PHOL ratio.</p>

        <p>To further examine the function of the PHO/PHOL ratio in Polycomb-dependent gene silencing, we performed quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) on eye, haltere/third leg and wing imaginal discs from wild-type and <italic>pho<sup>1</sup></italic> homozygous (null mutant allele of PHO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b040">40</xref>]) third instar larvae.

In <italic>pho<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant larval eye discs, <italic>Ubx</italic> gene becomes derepressed (5.5-fold), and gene activation is even stronger for the <italic>Antp</italic> gene (between 10- and 30-fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g008">Figure 8</xref>A). These results suggest that the loss per se of PHO has an impact on the level of transcription of Polycomb-silenced target genes, and this underscores its fundamental role in setting up Polycomb-mediated silencing. Binding of PHOL to the same sequence motif in the promoter region of these two genes might partially complement for the loss of PHO. Indeed, we detected increased binding levels of PHOL to chromatin in <italic>pho<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant imaginal discs (unpublished data).</p>

        <p>We then analyzed the effect of the <italic>pho<sup>1</sup></italic> mutation in haltere/third leg discs where the <italic>Ubx</italic> gene is transcribed and in wing discs where <italic>Antp</italic> is active.

        <p>Because we found a high colocalization of PHO and PHOL with TRX-N at many gene promoters not related to PcG-mediated silencing, we performed quantitative RT-PCR to check the expression of two constitutively transcribed genes such as <italic>Chc</italic> and <italic>Rp49</italic>, which are bound by PHO in wild-type embryos.

        <p>These results, together with the recent work of Beisel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b041">41</xref>], indicate that PHO is a modulator, not only of PcG-mediated silencing, but also of the active state of many genes.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The genome-wide mapping of PcG factors, TRX, their associated histone marks, and potential PcG recruiter proteins in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos revealed several important features. First, similar to the PcG distribution in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell lines, PcG proteins strongly colocalize and form large domains containing multiple binding sites. Second, the N-terminal and C-terminal fragments of TRX show different binding affinities to repressed and active chromatin. The N-terminal fragment of TRX has low affinity to PcG binding sites but is strongly bound to thousands of active promoter regions that are trimethylated on H3K4, whereas the C-terminal fragment of TRX only showed high binding affinity to PcG binding sites. Third, the majority of PcG recruiter binding sites are associated with H3K4me3 and TRX-N foci and not with PH binding. The binding ratio between the PHO protein and its homolog PHOL is a major predictive feature of PcG versus TRX recruitment. Finally, supervised and unsupervised sequence analysis methods led to the identification of sequence motifs that discriminate between most of the PcG and TRX binding sites, but these motifs are likely to be working jointly, and none of them seems to drive recruitment by itself.</p>

        <title>Promiscuous Binding Pattern of PcG Recruitment Proteins</title>
        <p>To date, PREs have been only characterized in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. These elements are not defined by a conserved sequence, but include several conserved motifs, which are recognized by known DNA binding proteins like GAGA factor (GAF), Pipsqueak (PSQ), Pleiohomeotic and Pleiohomeotic-(like) (PHO and PHOL), dorsal switch protein (DSP1), Zeste, Grainyhead (GH), and SP1/KLF. Our genomic profiles provide a comprehensive view on the potential role of these factors in the establishment of PcG domains.</p>
        <p>The presence of PHO at all PREs indicates that PHO is a crucial determinant of PcG-mediated silencing, consistent with earlier analysis on one particular PRE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b046">46</xref>]. On the other hand, PHOL and Zeste were bound at a small subset of PREs. Zeste was previously shown to be necessary for maintaining active chromatin states at the <italic>Fab-7</italic> (<italic>Frontabdominal-7</italic>) PRE/TRE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b047">47</xref>]. Therefore, Zeste and PHOL may primarily assist transcription rather than PcG-mediated silencing. GAF and DSP1 resemble PHO as they bind to many (albeit less than PHO) PREs as well as to active promoters. Supervised DNA motif analysis indicated a higher density of GAF, DSP1, and PHO binding sites at PREs as compared to other bound regions at non-PH sites. This suggests that cooperative binding of these proteins may provide a platform for PcG protein binding. Moreover, GAF may act by inducing chromatin remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b049">49</xref>] to remove nucleosomes, since the regions bound by PcG proteins show a characteristic dip in H3K27me3 signal that has been attributed to the absence of nucleosomes in those regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b051">51</xref>]. These nucleosome depletion sites are the places wherein histone H3 to H3.3 replacement takes place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b051">51</xref>]. Indeed, several of the Zeste-bound regions and GAGA binding sequences were shown to localize to peaks of H3.3, suggesting the possibility that GAF may recruit PcG components to PHO-site–containing PREs as well as recruit TRX to promoters via nucleosome disruption.</p>
        <p>In addition to an increased density of motifs for GAF, PHO, and PHOL, unsupervised spatial cluster analysis identified specific motifs that distinguish the PH sites from the K4me3 cluster. Although the identity of the factors binding to these motifs is unknown, this suggests that the DNA sequence of PREs contains much of the information needed to recruit PcG proteins and to define silent or active chromatin states. With this distinction, it may be possible to develop an algorithm to faithfully predict the genomic location of PREs. Earlier attempts to predict PREs in the fly genome have made progress toward this goal, but they are still far from reaching the required sensitivity and specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b025">25</xref>] (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-st009">Tables S9</xref> to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-st011">S11</xref>). The use of a sequence analysis pipeline that is not dependent on prior knowledge was demonstrated here to generate new discriminative motifs with a potential predictive power. The unique genomic organization of PcG domains may suggest that the genome is using, not only local sequence (high-affinity transcription factor binding sites located at the binding peaks) information to determine PREs, but also integration of regional sequence information (stronger affinity on 5 kb surrounding PREs). Using such regional information to predict PREs may break the current specificity and sensitivity barriers.</p>

        <title>The PHO versus PHOL Binding Ratio Is a PRE Marker</title>
        <p>Our ChIP on chip data showed that PHO binding comes in two distinct flavors. In one class of target sites, PHO binding coincides with PH sites within PC domains, whereas outside these domains, it is largely colocalized with PHOL, TRX-N, and H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000013-st004">Table S4</xref>). PHOL binding was weaker at PH sites and was mainly present along with marks associated with gene activation. Quantitative ChIP assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g007">Figure 7</xref>) revealed that PH, PHO, and PHOL were bound in PREs/TSS of their target genes in both ON and OFF states, but the ON state was marked by a decrease in PH binding and a corresponding increase in PHOL levels, whereas the OFF state was characterized by an increase in both PH and PHO binding levels.</p>
        <p>Papp and Muller [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b039">39</xref>] analyzed chromatin at the <italic>Ubx</italic> TSS, the bx PRE, and the bxd PRE (the same primers were used in our study) by comparing haltere/third leg imaginal discs (ON state) with wing imaginal discs (OFF state). They found a 50% reduction of PH binding levels at the bx PRE, a minor decrease at bxd, and no change in the <italic>Ubx</italic> TSS. Our ChIP experiments demonstrated a 50% decrease in PH levels at bx PRE and at the <italic>Ubx</italic> TSS and a minor decrease at bxd PRE when comparing haltere/third leg imaginal discs to eye imaginal discs. We also observed a slight decrease in the levels of PHO in haltere/third leg disc (ON state) as compared to eye imaginal discs (OFF state) at the bx and bxd PRE, whereas Papp and Muller [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b039">39</xref>] did not see differences in the levels of PHO. The most likely explanation for these discrepancies is that the peripodal membrane cells of the wing imaginal discs express <italic>Ubx</italic>, whereas all cells silence this gene in eye imaginal discs.</p>
        <p>In <italic>pho<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant eye discs, the absence of PHO causes derepression of the homeotic genes <italic>Ubx</italic> and <italic>Antp</italic>. However, the expression levels in <italic>pho<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants are still much weaker compared to tissues where these genes are normally expressed. This low degree of activation could be explained by compensatory binding of PHOL to the PHO sites in order to maintain PcG-mediated silencing, even if the PHOL-dependent rescue function is incomplete as <italic>pho<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants die as pharate adults. PHO and PHOL have indeed been described as redundant in their role in PcG-mediated silencing since they bind to the same DNA sequence motif in vitro. However, out of the 1,757 places wherein both PHO and PHOL were significantly bound, only 807 shared the same local maxima (46%). Another 559 (32%) peaks were within 250 bp of each other. This suggests that, in vivo, these two proteins prefer slightly different sequences, with PHO more strongly attracted to PREs, whereas PHOL binds better to promoters. Moreover, PHO interacts directly with PC and PH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b013">13</xref>], as well as with the PRC2 components E(z) and Esc, whereas PHOL only interacts with Esc in yeast two-hybrid assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b012">12</xref>]. Stronger interactions between PHO and PcG components may stabilize PHO binding at PREs, favoring it over the binding of PHOL. It is thus possible that the primary function of PHOL is as a transcription cofactor, and that its recruitment to PREs is subsidiary to PHO.</p>

        <title>The Double Life of TRX</title>
        <p>Here, we report for the first time, to our knowledge, the genome-wide distribution of TRX. This protein has been proposed to counteract PcG-mediated silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b052">52</xref>]. Petruk et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b053">53</xref>] demonstrated that TRX colocalizes with Polymerase II and elongation factors in <italic>Drosophila</italic> polytene chromosomes. They then showed that PcG and TRX proteins bind to a PRE mutually exclusively in salivary gland chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b054">54</xref>]. In contrast, two other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b041">41</xref>] found binding of TRX at discrete sites at PREs and promoter regions of HOX genes, and suggested that TRX coexists with PRC1 components at silent genes. We postulated that these differences might be explained by the use of different TRX antibodies, one against the N-terminal domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b053">53</xref>] and one against the C-terminal domain of TRX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b041">41</xref>]. Notably, the TRX protein is proteolytically cleaved into an N-terminal and a C-terminal domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b010">10</xref>], but the fate of the two moieties after cleavage has never been addressed in vivo.</p>
        <p>Our genome-wide mapping studies using the same antibody against the N-terminal fragment (TRX-N) as used by Petruk et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b053">53</xref>], showed that the binding affinity of the N-terminal fragment to PREs is rather weak, whereas TRX-N binds thousands of promoter regions trimethylated on H3K4, indicating a general role of TRX-N in gene activation. In contrast, ChIP on chip profiling using an antibody against the C-terminal TRX fragment showed high binding levels at PRE/TREs, whereas binding to promoter regions (where the TRX N-terminal fragment is strongly bound) is rather weak. The strong quantitative correlation between the binding intensities of PH and TRX-C suggests that TRX-C can indeed bind to silent PcG target genes. These data are confirmed by the colocalization of PH and TRX-C at inactive Hox genes in salivary gland polytene chromosomes and in diploid cell nuclei (as seen in a combination of DNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunostaining; unpublished data). Thus, PcG silencing may involve locking the C-terminal portion of TRX in an inactive state that perturbs transcription activation events. The fact that TRX is recognized by two different antibodies that recognize PREs (H3K4me3-depleted regions) or TSSs suggests that these antibodies reflect the activity state of the protein and thus represent a powerful tool to study the switching of genes between silencing and activation.</p>

        <title>Plasticity of Polycomb Binding Profiles in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Embryos versus <italic>Drosophila</italic> Cell Lines</title>
        <p>Similar to mapping studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell lines, H3K27me3 also forms large domains in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. These large PcG domains could provide the basis of a robust epigenetic memory to maintain gene expression states during mitosis. As previously suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b055">55</xref>], stably bound PcG complexes at PREs may loop out and form transient contacts with neighboring chromatin, which become trimethylated on H3K27. H3K27me3 might then attract the chromodomain of the PC protein, which may be occasionally trapped at these remote sites by cross-linking mediated by the chromodomain of PC. Alternatively, PcG subcomplexes missing some of the subunits might spread from the PRE into flanking genomic regions containing H3K27me3 histones.</p>
        <p>Although genome-wide PcG profiles in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos correlate well with profiles from <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell lines, it has recently been shown that PcG protein binding profiles are partially remodeled during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b030">30</xref>].

The fact that a consistent number of targets are only found in one or two of the samples indicates tissue specific PcG occupancy. Thus, although PcG proteins have been often invoked as epigenetic gatekeepers of cellular memory processes, they may be involved as well in dynamic gene regulation during fly development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b056">56</xref>], similar to their function in mammalian cells.</p>

          <p>A total of 63.79% of our target genes overlapped with Schwartz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b020">20</xref>] (S2 cell line). Schwartz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b020">20</xref>] defined strong PcG sites as those that showed simultaneous strong binding of PC, PSC, E(Z), and H3K27me3 (above 2-fold enrichment). A total of 188 genes from these regions that showed both PcG binding and methylation were defined as strong PcG targets. Weak PcG sites were defined as those wherein binding for one of the profiles (PC, PSC, E(Z), and H3K27me3) was lower and below the threshold levels. Seventy-four target genes were assigned to these regions. We separately compared our list of target genes to strong and weak PcG targets of Schwartz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b020">20</xref>]: 137/188 (73%) of strong target genes and 18/74 (24.3%) of the weak target genes of Schwartz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b020">20</xref>] matched our list. The majority of the strong targets are present in our list, showing that significant binding of multiple PcG proteins might be indicating genuine PcG targets. A total of 13.17% of our target genes were predicted by Ringrose et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000013-b025">25</xref>]; 27.57% of our target genes overlapped with Tolhuis et al.

The HMM structure defines the probability of observing each of the clusters given the cluster covering the previous genomic locus. Shown here are the spatial cluster model HMM states for the PcG/trxG model and the main transitions (conditional probabilities larger than 5% and 1%) in the model. Arc widths schematically reflect transition probability. The TSS enrichment (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000013-g003">Figure 3</xref>) is provided for reference. Note that although the model is defined as directional, we always train it using the forward strand direction, so it lacks real “directionality” as expected from transcriptional units. The figure shows directional edges since the transition probability is always relative to the general cluster frequency, so transitions from very common states (e.g., background states) are occurring often but have low conditional probability, whereas transitions from rare states (e.g., PREs) occurs with high conditional probability.</p>

          <p>The patser program was used for this analysis. The position-specific probability matrix (PSPM) of the MEME motifs (motif width 5–10 bp) were taken as input for patser. The motifs were counted in PH and non-PH regions bound with recruitment factors (PHO+DSP1+GAF). ‘NC' denotes not calculated. The density of motif in each sequence set was also calculated. The total number of base pairs in each sequence set was calculated after concatenating the entire sequence into a single string. In PRE regions, am1, am3, and bm3 were present in one motif per 168 bp, 66 bp, and 2,464 bp, whereas in non-PRE regions, the same motifs were present at one motif per 356 bp, 112 bp, and 9,047 bp, respectively.</p>
