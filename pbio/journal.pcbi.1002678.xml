        <p>Collective motion phenomena in large groups of social organisms have long fascinated the observer, especially in cases, such as bird flocks or fish schools, where large-scale highly coordinated actions emerge in the absence of obvious leaders. However, the mechanisms involved in this self-organized behavior are still poorly understood, because the individual-level interactions underlying them remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate the power of a bottom-up methodology to build models for animal group motion from data gathered at the individual scale. Using video tracks of fish shoal in a tank, we show how a careful, incremental analysis at the local scale allows for the determination of the stimulus/response function governing an individual's moving decisions. We find in particular that both positional and orientational effects are present, act upon the fish turning speed, and depend on the swimming speed, yielding a novel schooling model whose parameters are all estimated from data. Our approach also leads to identify a density-dependent effect that results in a behavioral change for the largest groups considered. This suggests that, in confined environment, the behavioral state of fish and their reaction patterns change with group size. We debate the applicability, beyond the particular case studied here, of this novel framework for deciphering interactions in moving animal groups.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Swarms of insects, schools of fish and flocks of birds display an impressive variety of collective patterns that emerge from local interactions among group members. These puzzling phenomena raise a variety of questions about the behavioral rules that govern the coordination of individuals' motions and the emergence of large-scale patterns. While numerous models have been proposed, there is still a strong need for detailed experimental studies to foster the biological understanding of such collective motion. Here, we use data recorded on fish barred flagtails moving in groups of increasing sizes in a water tank to demonstrate the power of an incremental methodology for building a fish behavior model completely based on interactions with the physical environment and neighboring fish. In contrast to previous works, our model revealed an implicit balancing of neighbors position and orientation on the turning speed of fish, an unexpected transition between shoaling and schooling induced by a change in the swimming speed, and a group-size effect which results in a decrease of social interactions among fish as density increases. An important feature of this model lies in its ability to allow a large palette of adaptive patterns with a great economy of means.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Collective motion occurs across a variety of scales in nature, offering a wealth of fascinating phenomena which have attracted a lot of attention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Parrish1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Sumpter1">[5]</xref>. The self-organized motion of social animals is particularly intriguing because the behavioral rules the individuals actually follow and from which these remarkable collective phenomena emerge often remain largely unknown due to the tremendous difficulties to collect quality field data and/or perform controlled experiments in the laboratory. This situation does not prevent a thriving modeling activity, thanks to the relative ease by which numerical simulations can be conducted. However, most models of moving animal groups are built from general considerations, educated guesses following qualitative observations, or ideas developed along purely theoretical lines of thought <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Aoki1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Parrish3">[9]</xref>. Even when authors strive to build a model from data, as in the recent paper by Lukeman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Lukeman1">[10]</xref>, this model building amounts to writing down a fairly complicated structure a priori, involving many implicit assumptions, and to fit collective data to determine effective parameters, yielding a best-fit model.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, recent studies within the physics community of simple, minimal models for collective motion have revealed an emerging picture of universality classes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Vicsek1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Toner1">[15]</xref>: Take, for instance, the Vicsek model, arguably one of the simplest models exhibiting collective motion. In this model, point particles move at constant speed and choose, at discrete time-steps, their new heading to be the average of that of their neighbors located within unit distance. Many of these behavioral restrictions can be relaxed without changing the emerging collective properties. Fluctuations of speed can be allowed, some short-range repulsion (conferring a finite size to the particles) can be added, even explicit alignment can be replaced by inelastic collisions, etc., all these changes will still produce the remarkable nonlinear high-density high-order bands emerging near onset of collective motion, and, deeper in the ordered moving phase, the anomalously strong number fluctuations which have become a landmark of the collective motion of polarly aligning self-propelled particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Narayan1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Deseigne1">[20]</xref>. The Vicsek model, in this context, is one of the simplest members of a large universality class defined by all models sharing the same large-scale properties. This universality class can be embodied in the continuous field equations that physicists are now able to derive. With such a viewpoint, different models in this class merely differ in the numerical values of their parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Bertin1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Baskaran1">[23]</xref>, very much like different fluids are commonly described by the Navier-Stokes equations and differ only in their viscosity and other constitutive parameters.</p>
      <p>Significant features nevertheless may be altered when a qualitatively important feature is changed, such as the symmetry of the aligning interaction, or added, as when local attraction/repulsion between individuals is also considered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Couzin1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Grgoire1">[24]</xref> In this latter case, for instance, no strong clustering and high density band appears when attraction is sufficiently strong, and finite groups may keep cohesion in open space as most natural groups do. These models yield a more complex phase diagram where collectively moving groups may assume gas-like, liquid-like or even moving crystal states as the two parameters controlling alignment and cohesion are varied.</p>
      <p>So, it remains important to know how individuals make behavioral choices when interacting with others, not only from a social ethology and cognitive viewpoint, but also because i) different behavioral rules may make a difference in small enough groups and ii) the analysis of local-scale data that this requires may lead to discover features eventually found to give rise to different qualitative collective properties. A recent instance can be found in the results on the structure of starling flocks gathered by Ballerini et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Ballerini1">[25]</xref>: They have ignited an ongoing debate about the possibility that individuals might interact mostly with neighbors determined by topological rules and not by metric criteria as assumed in most models. While this message has intrinsic value for the study of decision-making processes in animal groups, it was also shown recently that such metric-free, topological interactions are relevant, in the sense that they give rise to collective properties that are qualitatively different from those of metric models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Ginelli2">[26]</xref>. Thus, in this case, an individual-level ingredient suggested by data, which had been only partially and theoretically considered before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Aoki1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Huth1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Inada1">[27]</xref>, defines new classes of collective properties. Given that animals are likely to possess more sophisticated behavior than, say, sub-cellular filaments displaced by molecular motors, one can expect more hidden features to play an important role at the collective level. This is a central finding of the recent work by Katz et al. where a careful analysis of groups of two and three fish revealed that the mechanisms at play are, at least in the golden shiners studied there, much more subtly intertwined that in existing fish models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Katz1">[28]</xref>. Indeed they concluded that alignment emerges from attraction and repulsion as opposed to being an explicit tendency among fish. Whether fish display some mechanisms of active alignment or only attraction/repulsion is likely to lead to different patterns as interactions accumulate over time. In short, extracting interaction rules from individual scale data is crucial not only for animal behavior studies, but also because heretofore overlooked features can be found decisive in governing the emergent collective properties of moving animal groups.</p>
      <p>Here, we assess the power of a bottom-up methodology to build models for animal group motion from data gathered at the individual scale in groups of increasing sizes. We use data obtained by recording the motion of barred flagtails ( <italic>Kuhlia mugil</italic>) in a tank. In natural conditions, the barred flagtail form schools with a few thousands individuals along the reef margin of rocky shorelines, from just below the breaking surf to a depth of a few meters. However the size of these schools is much smaller than in species like the sardine or the Atlantic herring.</p>
      <p>Our analysis is incremental: in a previous work we characterized the spontaneous behavior of a single fish, including wall-avoidance behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Gautrais1">[29]</xref>. Here, using pairs of fish, we first characterize the response function of one fish depending on the position and orientation of the other fish. Then we calibrate multiple fish interactions, using data in larger groups. At each step, the already-determined factors and parameters are kept unchanged and the new terms introduced in the stimulus-response function and the corresponding new parameters are determined from data with nonlinear regression routines (see Statistical Analysis in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The resulting model is validated by comparing extensive simulations to the original data. Often, different functional forms are tested and we determine which one is most faithful to the data. When no significant difference is found, the simplest version is retained, following a principle of parsimony.</p>

        <p>Experiments with 1 to 30 fish were performed in shallow circular swimming pools that let the fish form quasi 2-dimensional schools (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002678-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002678.s009">Video S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002678.s010">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002678.s011">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002678.s012">S4</xref>). At the collective level, we observe a transition from schooling to shoaling behavior when the density of fish increases in the tank: the group polarization <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which measures the degree of alignment, is high in groups of two and five fish, even if sometimes we do observe some breaks in the synchronization, while in larger groups, when <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, it remains low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002678-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Within each group size, we notice some variability, the most striking effect being an increase of the synchronization level with the individuals velocity in groups of two fish.</p>

        <p>For every group size, fish move continuously and quickly synchronize their speed to a well defined, but replicate-dependent value (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002678.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). The fish trajectories are smooth, differentiable and the instantaneous speed <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> has a well-defined mean <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and root mean square fluctuations of about 10–20% which are found to be uncorrelated to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the angular velocity of the fish orientation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002678.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). On this basis, fish can be modeled as self-propelled particles moving in 2D space at constant speed <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the only dynamical variable retained is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Moreover, since the recorded trajectories, be they extracted from a single fish or from small groups in the tank, are always irregular/stochastic, our model takes the form of coupled stochastic differential equations for the angular velocities of each fish. Note that if noise acts on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> rather than the fish position or heading, trajectories are smooth and differentiable, as observed.</p>

        <title>Pair interactions</title>
        <p>The stimulus/response function of a single fish in the tank is directly expressed by how <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> varies with the relative position of the fish and the wall. We now assume that this framework holds when two fish <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are present in the tank by defining how, for fish <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, its turning speed <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is modulated by the combined stimuli due to the wall and to fish <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Almost all existing fish behavior models, on the basis of common sense, intuition, and sometimes experimental evidence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Breder1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Tien1">[37]</xref>, offer a combination of three basic ingredients: short distance repulsion (to avoid collisions), alignment for intermediate distances, and attraction up to some maximal range. Here, we dispose of repulsion not only because we want to allow for the rare experimentally observed over- and under-passings events, but mostly because we do not need to incorporate it explicitly to avoid collisions (see below and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002678.s009">Video S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002678.s010">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002678.s011">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002678.s012">S4</xref>). In contrast with most existing “zonal” models, and because there is little cognitive/physiological evidence for a sudden switch between alignment and attraction, we want to allow for continuous, distance-dependent weighting between alignment and attraction in agreement with the recent findings of Katz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Katz1">[28]</xref>. These two factors a priori depend on the geometrical quantities defining the location of fish <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from the viewpoint of fish <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>: their distance <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is involved, but also <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the angular position of fish <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with respect to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the current heading of fish <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, as well as their relative heading difference <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002678-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). The main angular variable for explicit alignment is, as usual, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, whereas for attraction it is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; both may also depend on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e059" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The stimulus/response function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of fish <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e061" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> thus combines a priori wall avoidance, alignment and attraction in some unknown function with parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e062" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e063" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (reaction to the wall), <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e065" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e066" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
        <p>Next, in the spirit of an expansion around the no-interaction case, we write the expression for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e068" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> above as the sum of three terms:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002678.e069"><graphic orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e069" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>where the “main” variables have been placed first for each term. The wall avoidance term <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> depends explicitly on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to reflect a possible screening of the wall by the other fish. We have tested the influence of this by introducing a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> dependence in the wall avoidance term determined for the single-fish behavior. Essentially, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was made smaller for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. But this brought no significant improvement, so we keep <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as found previously.</p>
        <p>On general grounds, one expects that the relative importance of the positional interaction <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (attraction) to the velocity interaction <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (alignment) increases with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Given that the fish are constrained in a rather small tank, a limited range of inter-distances is effectively explored. In the spirit, again, of a small-distance expansion, a satisfactory choice is given by a linear dependence of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, while <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is independent of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Of course, such a functional choice cannot be correct at large distances since then <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> would take large unrealistic values, meaning that the fish would spend enormous amounts of energy turning toward a distant “neighbor” (see the Discussion for more comments on this point).</p>
        <p>The attraction interaction <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> must depend on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the relative angle with the other fish position: it is reasonable to assume that a fish is not attracted much towards a neighbor located behind, and of course this term must be zero when the other fish is right ahead, yielding <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. A simple, compatible, trigonometric function representing the leading term of a Fourier expansion is the sine function. We thus write <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a parameter controlling the weight of the positional information. Finally, we neglect the possible dependence on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e089" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>: the way a fish would turn toward the position of a neighbor does not depend on the orientation of that fish. This is especially natural when this interaction dominates, i.e. when the neighbor is far away. Moreover knowing the other fish orientation is a cognitively expensive and/or time consuming process at larger distances.</p>
        <p>The alignment interaction is mostly characterized by its functional dependence on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e090" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The main constraint here is that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e091" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (the two fish are then already aligned). Here again, the simplest choice is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e092" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as in most models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Couzin1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Lukeman1">[10]</xref>. Including higher harmonics (e.g. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) would allow to account for the few observed nematic alignment events where a fish remains anti-aligned with its neighbors. However, incorporating this term did not improve the faithfulness of the model to our dataset, so we keep only the leading sine function. In principle, the strength of alignment can also depend on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e094" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>: less attention may be paid to “back neighbors”. We have tested simple and reasonable choices for the dependence of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e095" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e096" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, e.g. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e097" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, but this did not lead to significant improvement so we kept no angular position dependence in the alignment interaction. We thus write, finally: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e098" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e099" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a parameter controlling the weight of the orientational information.</p>

Results regarding this last parameter are the least convincing, with a large dispersion of individual values. This is mostly due to the confinement of fish in the tank: the positional interaction never dominates alignment, preventing its accurate estimation. Nevertheless it is crucial to note here that without these positional interactions the model fails to match the data. Furthermore, we have tested <italic>a posteriori</italic> our ansatz by testing each contribution (either wall avoidance, neighbor position or neighbor orientation) after the other twos have been subtracted from the fish response according to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002678.e103">Eq.

        <title>Multiple fish interactions</title>
        <p>Can multiple-fish interactions be factorized into pairs? This is often taken for granted, following a typical physics approach where this assumption is routinely made. However, recent work has suggested that this is not valid when describing pedestrian interactions in a crowd <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Moussad1">[38]</xref>. Even more recently, Katz et al. argued that this is also the case for groups of three golden shiners <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Katz1">[28]</xref> (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Bialek1">[39]</xref> for the case of birds). Here, our data set is too small to allow for an in-depth analysis of group behavior at the level of detail that was accomplished above for two fish, mostly because many more variables are involved, but the quality of the pair approximation can be evaluated a posteriori. Assuming that multiple fish interactions are indeed essentially made of the sum of the pair interactions involved, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002678.e135">Eq. (5)</xref> is extended to<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002678.e149"><graphic orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e149" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(6)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e150" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the (current) neighborhood of fish <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e151" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> which contains <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e152" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> individuals. In our observations with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e153" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> fish, individuals mostly stayed together, suggesting that individuals remains aware of all others. Using all-to-all, equal-weight coupling, we found good agreement between data and simulations of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002678.e134">Eqs. (4)</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002678.e149">(6)</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002678.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). This justifies a posteriori the factorization in pairs and the use of two-fish parameters for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e154" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> groups, but also the overall normalization factor <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e155" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002678.e149">Eq. (6)</xref>, which indicates that, in the stimulus response of a fish, wall avoidance and the averaged influence of neighbors keep, on average, the same relative importance irrespective of the group size. The raw, “force-like” un-normalized superposition would yield too strong a coupling.</p>
        <p>For the larger group sizes, all-to-all equal-weight coupling quickly becomes unrealistic, and one must determine the set of neighbors a fish interacts with. In principle, abundant data recorded in larger tanks would allow to discriminate between alternative choices, but our experimental recordings are too short for this. Nevertheless, many choices can be eliminated: the usual one, which consists in cutting off interactions at fixed distances (zonal models), is inconsistent with our continuous weighting of alignment and attraction with fish inter-distance. Based on an analysis of starling flocks, Ballerini et al. have argued that these birds actually pay attention to their 6–8 closest neighbors, irrespective of the density of the flock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Ballerini1">[25]</xref>. Coming back to our observations, this non-metric choice of neighbors can, however, lead to unrealistic situations when, for instance, a fish is leading a small group, since then this fish will only pay attention to those behind, even if individuals are located at intermediate distances ahead (but see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002678.s007">Fig. S7</xref>). A simple, reasonable, non-metric solution is that of neighbors determined by the Voronoi tessellation around each individual: this allows for continuous weighting between alignment and attraction and avoids the caveat mentioned above in the case of a fixed number of closest neighbors. Moreover, given the rather small inter-distances observed, individuals beyond the first shell of Voronoi neighbors are largely screened out, so that our final choice was that of the first shell of Voronoi neighbors (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002678-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Using this, the validation of the model simulated with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e156" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> fish using the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e157" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> parameters is again quite satisfactory (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002678.s003">Fig. S3</xref>).</p>
        <p>This is however not true anymore for larger groups which display too high a polarization when using the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e158" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> parameters (whereas distance predictions remains satisfactory, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002678.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). Our approach actually allows to further investigate this discrepancy. We estimate the parameters at the individual scale for each fish with our nonlinear least-square procedure using the Ito-integrated version of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002678.e134">Eqs (4)</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002678.e149">(6)</xref> for each fish time series (see Statistical Analysis). Thanks to this parametric inversion strategy, we have been able to extract the parameter values for each replicate separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002678-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). The model predictions with these replicate-based parameters yield a near-perfect match with the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002678-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). The results confirm that, within the limits of statistical accuracy, the parameters and their v-dependence remain about the same up to N = 10, in agreement with the above findings ; but in larger groups there is a decreased tendency of fish to react to their neighbors, which both concerns the alignment and positional interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002678-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Characterizing and modeling the interactions between individuals and their behavioral consequences is a crucial step to understand the emergence of complex collective animal behaviors. With the recent progress in tracking technologies, high precision datasets on moving animal groups are now available, thus opening the way to a fine-scale analysis of individual behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Tien1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Nagy1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Wu1">[42]</xref>. Here we adopted a bottom-up modeling strategy for deciphering interactions in fish shoaling together. This strategy is based on a step-by-step quantification of the spontaneous motion of a single fish and of the combined effects of local interactions with neighbors and obstacles on individuals motion. At each step, one model ingredient is considered and checked against experimental data. The required parameters are determined using a dedicated inversion procedure and the numerical values of these parameters are kept unchanged in the following steps, yielding, in the end, a model without any free parameter. Such an incremental procedure fosters the explicit enunciation of the rationale behind each functional choice, and differs from searching the best set of free parameters to fit large-group data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Lukeman1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Eriksson1">[43]</xref>. Proceeding step by step also puts stronger constraints on matching, since the incorporation of additional behavioral features at each step assumes the stability of the previously explored behaviors and of the corresponding model parameters. Using pairs of fish, we were able to show how positional and directional stimuli combine, and the crucial role of the swimming speed in the alignment interaction. At intermediate sizes, multiple fish interactions could be faithfully factorized into pair interactions albeit in a normalized form. However we found that at even larger group sizes our incremental modeling approach fails to accurately reproduce the collective dynamics.</p>
      <p>We explored this point further, still considering the statistical behavior of each fish separately, but only using the data corresponding to the large-group experiments. We concluded that our model could still grasp the observed individual and collective features but with smaller positional and alignment coefficients. We believe that this decrease in reactivity to neighbors is a consequence of the high density already imposed by confinement effects. Indeed, our model predicts that large groups adopting the high neighbor reactivity found in smaller groups would remain polarized also in open space, keeping group cohesion with an average distance to neighbors of about two body lengths (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002678.s006">Fig. S6</xref>). Since the largest groups we observed in the tank are already characterized by such a typical neighbors distance due to confinement effects, we argue that lower interaction strengths may simply indicate the fish vanishing need to actively react to neighbors position and heading in order to maintain a high density. This could be, for instance, a physiological consequence of the density per se: the physiological and behavioral consequences, for an individual, of living in dense groups, known as group effect, have been described in numerous species from insects to vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Anstey1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Armario1">[45]</xref>. Our results investigation suggests that this sensitivity may be represented in a quite straightforward manner, preserving the model shape of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002678.e134">Eqs. (4)</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002678.e149">(6)</xref> and only modifying the interaction parameters. This conjecture, of course, could only be validated by experiments on large groups conducted in open space or larger tanks. While we believe in a positive answer, namely that without too strong a confinement, individuals would react to the perceived neighbors the same way regardless of the overall group size, we leave this question for future investigations on group effect in fish schools.</p>
      <p>Our approach yielded a novel type of fish school model whose main features are its built-in balancing mechanism between positional and orientational information, a topological interaction neighborhood, and explicit dependencies on fish speed. Note that similar features were recently uncovered for another species thanks to a novel data analysis procedure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Katz1">[28]</xref>. The smooth transition from a dominant alignment reaction when a neighbor is close to attraction when it is far away is in line with a simple additive physiological integration of both information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Lemasson1">[46]</xref>. The linear dependence of the positional interaction strength on fish inter-distance obviously cannot hold for sparse groups, and will have to be modified by introducing a long-distance saturation when dealing with situations where confinement effects are weaker. Even if we claim that a Voronoi neighborhood was the best choice to account for our data thus extending the relevance of topological interactions, we also checked that our conclusions were robust against this choice, by testing a simple K-Nearest Neighbors network of interactions (which remains topological <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Ballerini1">[25]</xref>). We computed the model predictions with the parameters estimated for groups of N = 2 fish, but considering only the K nearest neighbors for increasing values of K (K = 1 to 7, and 10). The results are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002678.s007">Fig. S7</xref> ; the main impact of a lower level of connectivity is a decrease of polarization, but it does not lead to better predictions at the collective scale. Interestingly, the best predictions were found with a number of nearest neighbors that corresponds to the average number of neighbors belonging to the first shell in a Voronoi neighborhood (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e174" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, Fig S7–B). This number of influential nearest neighbors is remarkably similar to the one found in starlings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Ballerini1">[25]</xref> and in contrast with recent results found by Herbert-Read et al. in mosquito fish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-HerbertRead1">[47]</xref>. Further dedicated experiments will be required to discriminate between alternative choices of the relevant neighborhood.</p>
      <p>The speed dependence of the parameters, directly derived from our data, is in contrast with most previous fish school models. It leads to an increase of group polarization with swimming speed, a direct consequence of the predominance of alignment at high speed (see Video S7). In natural conditions, this mechanism could be involved in the transitions from shoaling at low speed often associated with feeding behavior to polarized schooling at high speed associated with searching for food. Such speed change could also be elicited by the detection of a threat and abrupt transitions can occur when fish suddenly increase their speed, for instance generating a flash expansion (see Video S8). The question of whether the propagation of such an excitation wave within large schools can generate an efficient collective evasion call for further experimental tests <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Magurran1">[48]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The reason why our approach was fruitful in spite of the limited amount of data available lies largely in the suitable properties of the behavior of the fish studied: the smooth fluctuations of tangential speed and their de-correlation from angular velocity variations were essential in limiting the number of variables at play but also allowed for a faithful account of single fish behavior by a simple Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Clearly it is likely that more complicated solutions will be needed for other species where tangential and angular accelerations are intimately coupled and/or the underlying stochastic process is not as transparent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Katz1">[28]</xref>. Nevertheless, we expect that, pending sufficient amounts of data, our approach could be successfully applied to more complex situations occurring in various biological systems at different scales of organization.</p>

        <p>The experiments were performed from April to June 2001 at the Sea Turtle Survey and Discovery Centre of Reunion Island. Barred flagtail Kuhlia mugil (Forster) were caught in March 2001 in the coastal area around Reunion Island. 80–100 fishes were conveyed to the marine station and housed in a holding tank of 4 m diameter and 1.2 m depth. Fishes were fed daily ad libitum with a mixture of aquaria flake-food and pieces of fish flesh. Fishes were considered acclimatized when all of them feed on the aquaria flake-food. This weaning period lasted 15 days. Experiments were performed in a circular tank similar to the holding tank. Opaque curtains were placed around and above the tank to obtain diffuse lighting and to reduce external disturbances from the environment. The tank was supplied with a continuous flow of seawater <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-Domenici1">[49]</xref>. Since currents may influence fish behavior, the seawater inlet pipe was placed vertically and the water flow was stopped throughout the observation periods. A digital video camera (Sony model CDR-TRV 900E) was fixed at 5 meters above the tank and tilted at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e176" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to observe the whole tank. The remotely operated video camera was fitted with a polarizing filter and a wide-angle lens. Groups of N = 1 to 30 fish were introduced in the experimental tank and acclimatized to their new environment for a period of 20 min. Their behavior was then recorded at 24 fps for 2 mins. Prior to each trial, the fish were deprived of food for 12 hours to standardize the hunger level and were transferred to the experimental tank. The relative shallowness of the water ensured quasi two-dimensional motion. Five replicates per group size using different individuals were performed. Eighty per cent of the trials were performed in the morning to avoid possible conditions of strong wind that may disturb the fish, and sunshine that may render light inside the tank unsuitable for video recording. A first data processing consisted in sampling 12 images per second out of the 24 images recorded by the video camera. A custom-made tracking software was then used to extract high-quality, smooth trajectories from the video recordings, with crossing ambiguities resolved by eyes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002678.s011">Video S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002678.s012">S4</xref>).

        <p>By construction, our method does not “learn the parameters to make the model fit”, contrasting with a more usual procedure which consists in stating an a priori model and searching a best set of free parameters that optimizes its collective patterns towards the observed collective properties (namely, make the model fit at the collective scale). In such cases, it is known that several models can adjust the data at the collective scale (because the search for best match is unconstrained and can be performed for each model, so that the collective level underdetermines the individual level).</p>
        <p>In the present study, once the model has been formulated, that is, once we identified in the experiments with pairs of fish the nature of stimuli (the orientation and relative position of neighboring fish, and how they combine to determine the response of a focal fish), we estimated the values of 5 parameters at the individual scale. So for each fish, we measured its behavioral response (i.e. the change of its turning speed) for each configuration of stimuli encountered in its path.</p>
        <p>Only then, we tested whether these parameters measured at the individual level can explain the observations at the collective scale <italic>with no free parameters</italic>. For each group independently, we thus checked that the model allows a quantitative matching concurrently at individual and collective scales. This confirmed that our model calibrated with the parameters estimated from the third derivative of the fish position (i.e. the change in the turning speed) was able to reproduce quantitatively the statistics resulting from the time integration of the coupling between fish (polarization, inter-distance). Moreover the same procedure applied separately on each group size revealed, on the one hand, the dependences of the estimated parameters on the swimming speed (using groups of N = 2 fish), and on the other hand, the modulation of interactions' strength with group size (in the largest groups).</p>

The estimated variance of the residuals yields an estimate of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e228" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>

As swimming speed increases a high level of polarization with about the same nearest neighbor distance is observed for all group sizes. These results strongly contrasts with the experimental observations suggesting a decrease in reactivity to neighbors as a consequence of the high density already imposed by confinement effects.</p>

We computed the prediction errors for polarization and distances cumulated over all groups and sizes, namely the sum of square differences between the observed values and the predicted values, as those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002678-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>. The prediction errors for distances are reported in blue, and the prediction errors for polarization are reported in black. The prediction errors for the Voronoi definition of influential neighbors are also reported, for reference (dotted lines). (A) First, to check whether the loss of polarization in large groups can be explained by restricting the neighborhood to the few first nearest neighbors as found by Herbert-Read et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002678-HerbertRead1">[47]</xref>, we computed the predictions of the model using the N = 2 parameters, with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e231" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Indeed, if fish were to react strongly but only to the 3 nearest neighbors, the prediction error for the distances can be about as low as for the Voronoi neighbors. However, this is not the case for the polarization error, which remains by far greater than with replicate-dependent parameters. Actually, interactions with fewer neighbors can impede the global polarization, but still allows for local polarization between nearest neighbors, a picture which does not correspond to the homogeneous loss of polarization noticeable in movie S4. We conclude that the lower polarization in large groups cannot be simply explained by considering a weaker coupling due to a limited number of influential neighbors. (B) As a complementary check, we also performed the complete inversion procedure over all groups, and for each value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e232" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, deriving in each case the model predictions (as for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002678-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, using here 100 simulated series for each of the 25 groups and for each of the eight values of K). Doing this, we observe that the prediction errors reach minimal values for about <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002678.e233" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and are then of same order as the prediction errors under the Voronoi neighborhood hypothesis. We note that the Voronoi definition yields a number of neighbors which fluctuates with time around this value, and that the fish are more or less homogeneously distributed in the tank. We conclude that the two definitions of neighborhood practically overlap in the present experimental setup.</p>

When the swimming speed suddenly increases over a short time interval in a shoaling group, the alignment interaction becomes abruptly dominant over position interaction, and neighboring fish align to each other. This polarization remains local due to the lack of time to build up over the entire group so that the initial isotropic distribution of headings is conserved for a short time, and a flash-expansion pattern arises. After the speed has decreased, the group returns to shoaling. Video S7 and S8 show that the speed-dependencies can trigger very different collective responses, depending on the rate of change. This control of collective behavioral response by speed is a parsimonious, effective, and robust mechanism. It also suggests further experiments aimed at identifying which external factors can affect individual speed (light, food presence or depletion, predators strike, …), and at elucidating the propagation of speed changes to the neighbors.</p>
