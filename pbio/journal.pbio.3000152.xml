<abstract>
<p>The current understanding of mammalian kidney development is largely based on mouse models. Recent landmark studies revealed pervasive differences in renal embryogenesis between mouse and human. The scarcity of detailed gene expression data in humans therefore hampers a thorough understanding of human kidney development and the possible developmental origin of kidney diseases. In this paper, we present a single-cell transcriptomics study of the human fetal kidney. We identified 22 cell types and a host of marker genes. Comparison of samples from different developmental ages revealed continuous gene expression changes in podocytes. To demonstrate the usefulness of our data set, we explored the heterogeneity of the nephrogenic niche, localized podocyte precursors, and confirmed disease-associated marker genes. With close to 18,000 renal cells from five different developmental ages, this study provides a rich resource for the elucidation of human kidney development, easily accessible through an interactive web application.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Regenerative medicine offers an exciting avenue to potential cures of kidney disease. However, a detailed knowledge of the structure and embryonic development of the kidney is crucial, both for stimulating regeneration in the body and for growing healthy kidney tissue in a dish. Most of such knowledge has been obtained from mice, whose development differs in crucial ways from that of humans. We therefore studied the composition of human fetal kidney tissue from five developmental ages, using a technique that can measure gene expression in individual cells. Our measurements revealed 22 distinguishable cell types, some of which we localized in the tissue by fluorescence microscopy. We found several subpopulations of nephron progenitors—cells that give rise to the nephron, the functional unit of the kidney. Our study also focused on the development of podocytes, a cell type that is crucial for the filtration function of the kidney, and our results might inform attempts to recreate these cells in a dish. We hope that our data set, made conveniently accessible through a web application, will help scientists develop new regenerative medicine approaches to kidney disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mammalian kidney development initiates in the intermediate mesoderm through crosstalk between the metanephric mesenchyme (MM) and the ureteric bud (UB). The UB originates from the nephric duct, invades the MM, and starts to subdivide progressively into multiple ramifications. The UB tip cells, which make the first contact with the MM, become enveloped by an assembly of mesenchymal cells, the cap mesenchyme (CM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The CM contains nephron progenitor cells (NPCs), which give rise to the whole nephron epithelium through tightly regulated morphogenic transformations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref001">1</xref>]. Self-renewal of (mouse) NPCs is governed by key transcription factors, such as <italic>Six2</italic> and <italic>Meox1</italic>, which mark the nephrogenic zone of the kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref002">2</xref>]. Signaling between UB tip cells and NPCs regulates the balance between self-renewal and differentiation of NPCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref003">3</xref>]. In humans, about 1 million nephrons are produced before the NPC population is irrevocably exhausted a few weeks before birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref004">4</xref>]. During nephrogenesis, NPCs undergo mesenchymal-epithelial transition and differentiate into a succession of intermediate structures: the pretubular aggregate (PTA), renal vesicle (RV), and comma- and s-shaped body (CSB and SSB, respectively). Then, via the capillary loop stage, mature and functional glomerular and tubular structures are eventually formed. In contrast to the nephron epithelium, the collecting duct system originates from the UB. Glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor/ RET proto-oncogene (GDNF/RET) signaling between the UB and CM critically regulates proliferation of UB tip cells and branching morphogenesis of the UB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref005">5</xref>]. Stromal cells—such as interstitial cells (ICs), mesangial cells, juxtaglomerular cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and pericytes—derive from a common interstitial progenitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref007">7</xref>]. Finally, vascular endothelial cells and the highly specified glomerular endothelium originate from the MM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref008">8</xref>], and leukocytes and erythrocytes enter with the blood stream. The current understanding of mammalian kidney development is largely based on mouse studies, although it is clear that human and mouse kidneys are morphologically different. Three recent landmark studies have revealed, in great detail, a significant divergence between mouse and human renal embryogenesis in terms of morphology as well as gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref011">11</xref>]. These studies underline that the prevailing lack of data on human kidney development severely hinders the detailed understanding of human kidney development and possible developmental origins of kidney disease.</p>

<p>In the study described here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to study gene expression dynamics in human fetal kidney development. Analysis of a fetal kidney from week 16 (w16) of gestation revealed 22 cell types, which we identified by known marker genes. Pseudotime analysis clarified their temporal relationship. We further defined specifically expressed cell type marker genes of which many have not been implied in kidney development. Comparison to four additional samples (from w9, w11, w13, and w18) suggested that most cell types have a constant expression pattern, with the notable exception of podocytes. To highlight two ways in which our data set can be interrogated, we then explored the nephrogenic niche and the development of podocytes. Gene expression differences between four NPC clusters were related to spatial heterogeneity by immunostaining and single-molecule fluorescence in-situ hybridization (smFISH). Expression of the disease-associated gene <italic>UNCX</italic> was localized to NPCs and their early derivatives. Finally, we focused on podocyte development, which proceeds via a distinct precursor state. By immunostaining and smFISH, we localized these precursors in situ and confirmed the disease-associated gene <italic>OLFM3</italic> as a marker.</p>

<title>Clustering and identification of cell types</title>
<p>We performed single-cell transcriptomics on a human fetal kidney from w16 of gestation, equivalent to 14 weeks of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). After data pruning and stringent removal of cells affected by stress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s002">S2 Fig</xref>, Methods), 6,602 cells were retained for further analysis. Clusters of cells were identified by hierarchical clustering after k-nearest neighbor smoothing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref012">12</xref>]. We assigned cell types to these clusters by expression of marker genes from the literature on mouse kidney development. The studies that linked the genes of this literature set to particular cell types are referenced in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s011">S1 Table</xref>. After merging similar clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s003">S3 Fig</xref>, Methods), we obtained 22 cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s004">S4 Fig</xref>) and visualized the single-cell transcriptomes in a two-dimensional t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) map [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref013">13</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>The mean expression levels of the literature set genes showed clear differences between cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). NPCs, which were distributed over four distinct clusters (NPCa–d), were marked by the established markers <italic>SIX2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), <italic>CITED1</italic>, <italic>MEOX1</italic>, and <italic>EYA1</italic>. Expression of these progenitor markers was highest in NPCa, which we hence considered “bona fide” self-renewing NPCs. NPCb showed lower levels of <italic>CITED1</italic> and <italic>SALL1</italic> and higher levels of <italic>GDNF</italic> and <italic>HES1</italic> compared to the other NPC clusters. <italic>HES1</italic>, a transcription factor downstream of NOTCH signaling, is important for further renal cell differentiation. Compared to the other NPC clusters, NPCc showed higher expression of <italic>CRABP2</italic>, which is related to retinoic acid signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref014">14</xref>]. NPCd exhibited low <italic>OSR1</italic>, <italic>CITED1</italic>, and <italic>MEOX1</italic> expression and increased levels of <italic>LEF1</italic>, a known indicator of NPC induction towards differentiation. Compared to the other NPC subtypes, NPCd were also marked by a larger fraction of cells in G2/M-phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>) and a higher expression of proliferation markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), which indicated faster proliferation. We will discuss the relationship between the various NPC clusters in more detail below (see Heterogeneity in the nephrogenic niche).</p>

<p>Nephrogenesis continues with the creation of the pre-tubular aggregate (PTA) cells, which in turn develops into the RV and CSB. In our data, PTA cells were identified based on high expression of <italic>LHX1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), <italic>JAG1</italic>, <italic>WNT4</italic>, and <italic>CCND1</italic>. Because RV and CSB are mainly distinguishable by morphology, cells belonging to these two structures were grouped in our analysis (RVCSB). RVCSB cells were marked by the same genes as PTA cells, but they appeared to proliferate less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g002">Fig 2B–2D</xref>). Furthermore, they expressed markers reflecting more advanced regional patterning, which allowed us to discriminate between two subtypes (a and b). RVCSBa had a higher expression of genes that were recently associated with the distal RV (<italic>SFRP2</italic>, <italic>DLL1</italic>, <italic>LHX1</italic>), whereas RVCSBb expressed genes that indicate the proximal RV (<italic>CDH6</italic>, <italic>FOXC2</italic>, <italic>MAFB</italic>, <italic>CLDN1</italic>, <italic>WT1</italic>).</p>
<p>The next step in development is the formation of the SSB. In our data set, this structure was represented by three clusters, named according to the part of tubule and glomerular epithelium they are known to give rise to—SSBpr, proximal tubule; SSBm/d, medial/distal; SSBpod, podocytes. SSBpr were identified in our data by markers of the early proximal tubule (ErPrT) (such as <italic>HNF1A</italic>, <italic>CDH6</italic>, <italic>AMN</italic>), as well as low expression of <italic>SLC3A1</italic>, <italic>LRP2</italic>, and <italic>SLC13A1</italic>, which are known to be found in more mature proximal tubule cells. Therefore, SSBpr were likely precursors of the ErPrT cells, which expressed higher levels of early proximal markers together with <italic>CLDN2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), <italic>ANPEP</italic>, and <italic>SLC34A1</italic>. Another cluster (SSBm/d) accounted for the precursor cells of the loop of Henle and the distal tubule in the SSB. This cluster could be identified by the presence of <italic>IRX1</italic>, <italic>IRX2</italic>, <italic>SIM2</italic>, <italic>SOX9</italic>, <italic>POU3F3</italic>, and <italic>HNF1B</italic>, together with low expression of <italic>PAPPA2</italic> and <italic>MAL</italic> and the absence of <italic>CDH6</italic> and <italic>HNF1A</italic>. Cell types that are known to develop from the SSBm/d were found together in one cluster (distal tubule/loop of Henle [DTLH]). This cluster showed high expression of the distal markers <italic>MAL</italic>, <italic>CLCN5</italic>, <italic>SLC12A3</italic>, and <italic>POU3F3</italic>, which are specific to the distal tubule, as well as <italic>SLC12A1</italic>, <italic>PAPPA2</italic>, and <italic>UMOD</italic>, which are found in the loop of Henle. Finally, cells that likely gave rise to podocytes, SSBpod, clustered separately. These cells showed high expression of <italic>MAFB</italic> and <italic>FOXC2</italic>, both transcription factors necessary for the development of podocyte identity, and low levels of the mature podocytes markers <italic>CLIC5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), <italic>PTPRO</italic>, <italic>NPHS1</italic>, and <italic>NPHS2</italic>. This cluster also showed the highest expression of <italic>OLFM3</italic>, previously identified as a specific marker of podocyte precursors residing in the visceral part of the proximal segment of the SSB. In contrast to SSBpod, podocytes (Pods) showed higher expression of mature podocyte markers and lower levels of <italic>MAFB</italic>. Differences between SSBpod and Pods will be studied in more detail below (see Podocyte development). Because of the high similarity in gene expression between SSB and capillary loop stage, we could not exclude that the SSB clusters also contained cells from the capillary loop stage.</p>
<p>Cells of the connecting tubule (CnT), which connects the distal tubule to the collecting duct, could also be identified in the data. They shared markers with the collecting duct (such as <italic>ALDH1A1</italic>, <italic>TACSTD2</italic>, and <italic>CDH1</italic>), distal tubule (<italic>SOX9</italic>, <italic>POU3F3</italic>), and UB (<italic>RET</italic>, <italic>KRT8</italic>, <italic>KRT18</italic>, <italic>MMP7</italic>). Cells of the UB and collecting duct (UBCD) were strongly marked by well-known genes like <italic>AQP2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), <italic>CALB1</italic>, <italic>KRT8</italic>, <italic>KRT18</italic>, <italic>RET</italic>, and <italic>GATA2</italic>, found in the collecting duct as well as the stalk and tip of the UB.</p>
<p>The developing nephrons are surrounded by interstitial tissue, a separate lineage that originates in interstitial progenitor cells (IPCs). We identified IPCs by coexpression of <italic>FOXD1</italic> and <italic>GDNF</italic>. These cells also expressed lower levels of markers known to be found in more mature cells like <italic>PDGFRA</italic> for ICs or <italic>PDGFRB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) and <italic>ACTA2</italic> for mesangial cells. We identified two subtypes of ICs (a and b), which were similar in their marker gene profile. Compared to IPCs, they lacked <italic>FOXD1</italic> and expressed less (ICa) or no (ICb) <italic>GDNF</italic>. ICa showed high levels of <italic>FGF7</italic>, which has been localized to the renal fibroblasts or stroma surrounding the ureter and the collecting system. ICa also showed high levels of <italic>TPM2</italic> and <italic>ACTA2</italic>, markers of smooth muscle-like cells. ICb, on the other hand, expressed genes like <italic>DCN</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), <italic>DES</italic>, <italic>SERPINE2</italic>, and <italic>COL3A1</italic>, which are known to mark cortical stromal cells. Endothelial cells were identified by markers such as <italic>KDR</italic> and <italic>TEK</italic>, whereas leukocytes showed many specifically expressed genes, such as <italic>CD37</italic> or <italic>CD48</italic>. Finally, one cluster of cells (Prolif) had a higher expression of proliferation markers compared to most other cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g002">Fig 2D</xref>) but lacked discernible cell type markers.</p>

<sec id="sec004">
<title>Developmental flow</title>
<p>The literature-based analysis of the found clusters seemed to suggest that cells cluster by developmental progression (e.g., NPCs versus PTA cells), as well as location (e.g., RVCSBa, distal, versus RVCSBb, proximal). Because the interpretation of clusters is sometimes based on genes that are expressed in multiple developmental stages, we wanted to retrieve the developmental flow with an independent method. We used <italic>Monocle 2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref017">17</xref>] to learn a graph that represents the developmental hierarchy of the cell types from the PTA on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Subsequently, cells were placed on a pseudotime scale rooted in the PTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>). This analysis showed that PTA cells were followed by RVCSBa and RVCSBb, the SSB clusters, and finally the clusters identified as more mature types (DTLH, ErPrT, Pod). Therefore, the clustering was strongly driven by developmental progression. RVCSBa cells were distributed over a fairly broad period of pseudotime and already occurred before branch point 1, which separates proximal from distal cell fates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). This might indicate that some of these cells preceded the RVCSBb, whereas others were primed to develop into distal fates. RVCSBb cells, however, only appeared after branch point 1, which confirmed that they were likely progenitors of proximal cell fates. On three separate branches, SSBm/d preceded DTLH, SSBpr preceded ErPrT, and SSBpod preceded Pods, which confirmed the identity of the SSB clusters. The temporal relationship of the NPC subtypes will be discussed in detail below (see Heterogeneity in the nephrogenic niche).</p>

<title>Comparison with existing single-cell transcriptomics data</title>
<p>To further confirm the interpretation of the cell clusters, we wanted to compare our data with an existing single-cell transcriptomics study of a w17 fetal kidney by Lindström and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref019">19</xref>]. To that end, we first corrected for batch effects, using a method based on matching mutual nearest neighbors in the two data sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref020">20</xref>]. After correction, the two data sets showed a large degree of overlap (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s005">S5A Fig</xref>). This allowed us to use the cell types found by Lindström and colleagues to classify the cell clusters found here, using a k-nearest neighbors approach (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec014">Methods</xref>). NPCa–c were also classified as NPC by Lindström and colleagues, whereas NPCb were considered “primed NPC,” which supports the notion that NPCb were primed to differentiate. The NPCd cluster was classified as “proliferating cells.” This classification is in agreement with our observation that NPCd seemed to proliferate more than other NPC subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g002">Fig 2B–2D</xref>). Because NPCd expressed low levels of NPC markers (such as <italic>SIX2</italic> and <italic>CITED1</italic>), these cells were likely in a transition state between NPCs and PTA cells. Whereas the majority of PTA cells identified here were considered “PTA/RV I” by Lindström and colleagues, RVCSBa cells were spread over multiple cell types. This spread was likely due to the fact that transitory cell types are transcriptionally similar, and their clustering is therefore less robust. Nevertheless, the “PTA/RV II” cluster received most of the RVCSBa cells. RVCSBb cells were called “podocyte precursors” in the Lindström data set, whereas SSBpod as well as Pods were classified as “podocytes.” In our data set, RVCSBb directly preceded SSBpod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), so they could indeed be considered podocyte progenitors. Below, we will show that SSBpod did form a cell state separate from Pods and should not be grouped with them (see Podocyte development). In agreement with our analysis, the majority of SSBpr were classified as “proximal precursor” or “proximal tubule,” and all ErPrT were considered “proximal tubule” by Lindström and colleagues. CnT and DTLH were both classified as “distal/loop of Henle (LOH) precursor.” The fact that two cell types in the study by Lindström and colleagues (“podocytes” and “distal/LOH precursor”) were split in multiple subclusters in our study likely reflects differences in sample preparation. Whereas Lindström and colleagues preferentially released single cells from the nephrogenic niche, here, the whole kidney was used. Consequently, the Lindström data set has a finer resolution of NPCs and early, proliferating cell types, whereas our data set allowed us to resolve more mature cell types. The two data sets therefore complement each other.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec006">
<title>Marker identification</title>
<p>To confirm the inferred cell types and also identify novel markers, we pursued two complementary strategies. First, we determined a set of marker genes based on their usefulness as classifiers for individual cell types: for each gene, the performance of a binary classifier was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) and combined with expression level filtering (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec014">Methods</xref>). This resulted in 88 marker genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s006">S6A Fig</xref>, marker set, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s013">S3 Table</xref>). Only 11 of these markers overlapped with the 89 genes in the literature set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s006">S6C Fig</xref>). To our knowledge, many of the remaining markers had not been associated with kidney development in previous studies. As an independent approach, we used the <italic>KeyGenes</italic> algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref021">21</xref>] to identify classifier genes among the 500 most highly variable genes (HVGs), using two-thirds of all cells as a training set. Based on the classifier genes determined by <italic>KeyGenes</italic>, we next predicted the cell types of the remaining one-third of the cells (test set). Cell types could be predicted with an average certainty (id score) of 0.59; 24% of the cells in the test set obtained an id score higher than 0.8. Of the 95 classifier genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s006">S6B Fig</xref>, <italic>KeyGenes set</italic>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s013">S3 Table</xref>), 24 were the same as in the marker set, and 14 were common with the literature set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s006">S6C Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Because the interpretation of the found cell clusters was largely based on markers identified in mouse development, we were wondering whether the new markers identified here were informative for the classification of cell types in the mouse kidney. Using a scRNA-seq measurement of cells from a whole P1 mouse kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref022">22</xref>], we plotted the expression of the newly identified marker genes in single cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). In many cases, markers that were found to label a particular cell type in the human fetal kidney were coexpressed in the same subset of mouse cells. A few markers, however, were either ubiquitously expressed or almost completely absent. This might be due to interspecies differences.</p>

<sec id="sec007">
<title>Comparison of different developmental ages</title>
<p>By establishing the identity of cell clusters at w16, we obtained a snapshot of cell type diversity in the fetal kidney. To explore whether the identified expression patterns change dynamically throughout development, we analyzed four additional samples from different developmental ages (w9, w11, w13, and w18), which together contained 11,359 usable cells. Using, again, batch correction based on mutual nearest neighbors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref020">20</xref>], we visualized all samples in a common tSNE map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g004">Fig 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). Overall, gene expression in the different samples was largely overlapping for the majority of cell types. For example, proximal tubules cells (ErPrT) appeared at the same positions in the tSNE map in all samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). The position of Pods, however, shifted systematically across different ages, which corresponds to a continuing change in expression pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). This observation might suggest that Pods further matured in terms of their expression pattern after being specified.</p>

<p>Differential expression analysis of Pods of different ages revealed 109 differentially expressed genes (fold change &gt; 2 in any comparison, false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s014">S4 Table</xref>). Functional annotation analysis of these genes showed significant enrichment of two gene ontology (GO) terms—“proteinaceous extracellular matrix” (adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value = 1.9 × 10<sup>−3</sup>, including <italic>SPON2</italic>, <italic>BGN</italic>, <italic>COL1A2</italic>, and <italic>CTGF</italic>) and “extracellular exosomes” (adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value = 1.4 × 10<sup>−3</sup>, including <italic>NPNT</italic>, <italic>S100A10</italic>, <italic>ANXA1</italic>, and <italic>EPCAM</italic>). Some of the differentially expressed genes have been shown to be important for kidney development. For example, <italic>NPNT</italic> and <italic>DCN</italic> showed increasing expression from w11 to w18. Knockout of the extracellular matrix protein NPNT in mice decreases the invasion of the UB and causes agenesis or hypoplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref023">23</xref>]. <italic>NPNT</italic> was further shown to be expressed in the glomerular basement membrane and to be necessary for podocyte adhesion in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref024">24</xref>]. Ablation of this gene in mice causes podocyte effacement. As in the case of <italic>NPNT</italic>, <italic>DCN</italic> has been reported to be part of the glomerular basement membrane proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref025">25</xref>]. This gene appeared strongly up-regulated in podocytes between w11 and w13 or w18 (fold changes of 3.25 and 4.6, respectively). The increase of <italic>NPNT</italic> and <italic>DCN</italic> expression over time in our data set could reflect an increase in adhesion between podocytes and glomerular basement membrane. Pods further showed significant differential expressions of genes related to stress, like <italic>HSPA1A</italic> and HSPA1<italic>B</italic> or <italic>NFKB</italic> genes (<italic>NFKB2</italic>, <italic>NFKBIA</italic>, and <italic>REL</italic>), with the highest levels at w18. This might suggest that dissociation-related stress increases with age for podocytes, maybe related to stronger adhesion of the cells, or that stress-related genes have another, physiological role in development.</p>
<p>We would like to emphasize that the observed gene expression changes with age should be considered with caution because they might be related to the differences in genotype between the samples. A much larger number of samples would be necessary to rule out such interindividual differences as a cause.</p>
<p>Having established the identity of the cell clusters, we next wanted to demonstrate how the data set can be used to explore different aspects of kidney development. We specifically focused on the nephrogenic niche, which showed pronounced heterogeneity, and the development of podocytes, which progressed via a distinct, intermediate cell state (SSBpod).</p>

<title>Heterogeneity in the nephrogenic niche</title>
<p>The formation of the nephron epithelium starts with the NPCs that differentiate and form the PTA, RV, and CSB. Studies in the mouse suggest that cells in the NPC compartment are not biased towards a particular lineage and patterning is first detectable in the PTA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref026">26</xref>]. Nevertheless, the w16 scRNA-seq data indicated the presence of several nephron progenitor subpopulations, NPCa–d. To clarify the temporal relationship of these clusters, we employed <italic>Monocle 2</italic> again to arrange them together with the PTA cells on a pseudotime scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). NPCa clearly preceded NPCb and c, which seemed to appear around the same pseudotime. NPCd cells followed NPCb and c and preceded PTA. This analysis suggested that NPCa are the “bona fide” NPCs and give rise to NPCb and c. NPCd, which were likely more proliferative than the other NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g002">Fig 2B–2D</xref>), seemed to be an intermediate state between (slowly cycling) NPCa–c and the PTA.</p>

<p>To localize the NPC clusters in the tissue, we made use of the fact that they expressed various levels of <italic>CITED1</italic> and <italic>SIX2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g002">Fig 2A</xref>): whereas NPCa and NPCc exhibited roughly similar levels of these markers, NPCb and NPCd had lost <italic>CITED1</italic> almost completely, while retaining some <italic>SIX2</italic> expression. In an immunostaining of a w15 kidney, CITED1 and SIX2 appeared overlapping in a subset of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g005">Fig 5B–5D</xref>). Quantification of the fluorescence signal (Methods) revealed clear differences between their expression patterns. Whereas SIX2 expression was approximately constant throughout the CM, CITED1 expression decreased, relative to SIX2, with increasing (radial) distance from the UB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). A marked drop of CITED1 was visible between 10 and 20 μm from the UB, which approximately corresponds to the first layer of cells. To exclude that the observed difference between SIX2 and CITED1 expression was due to the different fluorophores on the secondary antibodies, we repeated the experiment with swapped fluorophores. This measurement produced a very similar expression gradient (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s009">S9A Fig</xref>). To exclude that the observed effect was influenced by PTA found in the CM towards the stalk of the UB, the analysis was repeated, taking only the 20% of CM cells closest to the edge of the cortex into account. A similar expression gradient was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s009">S9C Fig</xref>). This result implies the existence of a CITED1 low/SIX2 high subpopulation of cells, which are not in contact with the UB. Secondly, we observed that CITED1 decreased relative to SIX2 towards the interface with the PTA and the stalk of the UB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). A similar observation was made when the experiment was repeated with swapped fluorophores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s009">S9B Fig</xref>). Taken together, these results suggested that NPCa and NPCc were located closer to the surface of the UB and closer to the tip of the UB compared to the other NPC subtypes. Additionally, we also observed differences in subcellular localization of CITED1 protein within the CITED1 high compartment. Whereas for the majority of cells CITED1 was found in the cytoplasm, in several cells it was concentrated in the nucleus (right inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). In contrast, SIX2 was always found restricted to the nucleus (left inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). This observation might indicate that CITED1 was only active in a small population of cells, which would constitute another layer of cell–cell heterogeneity.</p>
<p>In addition to the observed heterogeneity in <italic>CITED1</italic> and <italic>SIX2</italic>, differences between the NPC clusters could also be gleaned from the set of novel markers (marker set, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s013">S3 Table</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>TMEM100</italic> and <italic>RSPO3</italic> specifically marked NPCa. <italic>RSPO3</italic> is an activator of the canonical WNT signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref027">27</xref>], suggesting a role of WNT either in NPC self-renewal or UB branching morphogenesis. Notably, all markers of NPCb (<italic>CACYBP</italic>, <italic>MRPL18</italic>, <italic>ZFAND2A</italic>, <italic>DNAJB1</italic>) were related to the stress response in some form. The markers of NPCc (<italic>CRABP2</italic>, <italic>HAS2</italic>, <italic>MDK</italic>, <italic>HOXC6</italic>), which were also expressed in the other NPC types, are all either targets of retinoic acid or binding it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref029">29</xref>]. <italic>MDK</italic> has been shown to be expressed in the CM of the developing rat kidney, and its neutralization reduced the number of formed nephrons in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref031">31</xref>]. Finally, the NPCd markers CENPF, HMGB2, CCNB2, and NUSAP1 all have a role in cell cycle regulation or proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref016">16</xref>]. HMGB2 was recently implied in the activation of quiescent adult neural stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref032">32</xref>].</p>
<p>The observation that markers of NPCb were related to the stress response seemed to suggest that this cluster was created as an artefact of cell dissociation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref033">33</xref>], despite our best efforts to remove stressed cells (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec014">Methods</xref>). On the other hand, the vast majority of NPCb cells were classified as “primed NPC II” in the Lindström data set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). The fact that NPCb cells were only detected in the w16 and w18 kidneys is consistent with single-cell dissociation becoming increasingly difficult with fetal age, or alternatively, with a progenitor cell aging phenomenon. To explore the differences between NPCb and the other NPC clusters further, we immunostained HSPA1A and NR4A1, both known stress-response genes, in w15 kidney sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). <italic>HSPA1A</italic> was identified as a marker of NPCb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s009">S9D Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s013">S3 Table</xref>), whereas <italic>NR4A1</italic> was expressed in multiple NPC clusters but highest in NPCb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s009">S9D Fig</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>NR4A1</italic> was also identified in the study by Adam and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref022">22</xref>] to be up-regulated in response to elevated temperatures during enzymatic dissociation. HSPA1A and NR4A1 were both observable in the nephrogenic niche at the level of the stalk of the UB and at the transition to the PTA or RV. Additionally, we studied the expression of <italic>EGR1</italic>, another stress-related gene that marked NPCb, with smFISH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s009">S9E Fig</xref>). <italic>EGR1</italic> was mainly found toward the stalk of the UB and in a few cells around the tip of the UB, whereas <italic>SIX2</italic> and <italic>CITED1</italic> transcripts were visible throughout the CM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s009">S9F Fig</xref>). Because results obtained in fixed tissue sections are not confounded by dissociation-related artifacts, these immunostainings and smFISH measurements supported the existence of NPCb cells in the fetal kidney.</p>
<p>The fourth NPC cluster, NPCd, was clearly distinguished by proliferation markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g002">Fig 2B–2D</xref>). To locate NPCd in the tissue, we immunostained the cell cycle regulator and NPCd marker <italic>CKS2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s002">S2G Fig</xref>). CKS2 signal could be observed around the stalk of the UB and in RVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). This result supported the interpretation that NPCd were a proliferating transitory state between NPCa–c and PTA.</p>
<p>Given the crucial role of the nephrogenic niche in the development of nephrons, it is likely that misexpression or mutation of genes that are specifically expressed in NPCs affect kidney function. Mining a database of genome wide association studies (GWAS) revealed that genes that were differentially expressed in NPCs were significantly enriched for association with kidney disease (<italic>p</italic> = 1.7 × 10<sup>−3</sup>, one-sided Fisher’s exact test). No enrichment was found for lung diseases (<italic>p</italic> = 0.21, one-sided Fisher’s exact test) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec014">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s010">S10 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s014">S4 Table</xref>). Unsurprisingly, several of the disease-associated genes are known regulators of kidney development, such as <italic>SALL1</italic>, <italic>SOX11</italic>, and <italic>HAS2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref037">37</xref>]. The other identified genes had not been previously associated with kidney development. For example, <italic>DDX1</italic>, which was differentially expressed in NPCs as well as SSBpod, is an RNA helicase that promotes micro-RNA maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref038">38</xref>]. <italic>UNCX</italic>, which was broadly expressed in all NPC clusters, is a homeobox transcription factor involved in somitogenesis and neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref039">39</xref>] and has also been found to be up-regulated in the induced mouse nephrogenic mesenchyme in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref040">40</xref>]. It was recently associated with renal-function–related traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref041">41</xref>] as well as glomerular filtration rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref044">44</xref>]. In our data, the expression profile of <italic>UNCX</italic> was similar to that of <italic>CITED1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s009">S9H Fig</xref>). Immunostaining of UNCX confirmed the scRNA-seq results and showed expression of UNCX in the nephrogenic zone, as marked by CITED1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g005">Fig 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s009">S9I Fig</xref>). These findings suggested <italic>UNCX</italic> as a novel potential regulator of early nephrogenesis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec009">
<title>Podocyte development</title>
<p>Another cell type of high relevance for kidney function is the podocyte. This cell type is critical for filtration and is implied in several forms of kidney disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref045">45</xref>]. Podocytes wrap around the glomerular basement membrane (capillary bed) inside Bowman’s capsule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) and pseudotime analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g003">Fig 3</xref>) of the w16 kidney data set had indicated that development into Pods occurs via a distinct intermediate state that we dubbed SSBpod here. This cell state was likely related or even identical to previously discovered podocyte precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref046">46</xref>]. In the Lindström data set [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref019">19</xref>], SSBpod and Pods were both classified as “podocytes,” and the RVCSBb were considered “podocyte precursors” (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s005">S5B Fig</xref>). To show that SSBpod cells were indeed a localizable cell state distinct from Pods, we further investigated their expression pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), focusing on known literature markers (literature set) and the marker set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s013">S3 Table</xref>). Compared to RVCSBb, SSBpod showed higher expression of <italic>MAFB</italic> and <italic>FOXC2</italic>, which are necessary for the determination of podocyte identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref048">48</xref>]. On the other hand, compared to Pods, they exhibited lower expression of genes typically associated with more mature podocytes, like <italic>CLIC5</italic>, <italic>PODXL</italic>, and <italic>PTPRO</italic>. Filtration function-related genes like <italic>NPHS1</italic>, <italic>NPHS2</italic>, and <italic>PTPRO</italic> were expressed at intermediate levels in SSBpod compared to RVCSBb, where they were absent, and Pods, where they are highly expressed. A similar pattern could be observed for genes associated with podocyte polarization or structural organization as well as pedicel growth and patterning. Finally, Pods showed the expression of genes that negatively regulate the cell cycle and support long term survival, consistent with their postmitotic nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref049">49</xref>]. In contrast, SSBpod specifically expressed <italic>ORC4</italic>, which has a function in DNA replication. However, proliferation markers were lowly expressed in both SSBpod and Pods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), which suggested low proliferative potential in both cell types. In contrast to NPCs, association with kidney disease was not significantly enriched among genes differentially expressed in SSBpod (<italic>p</italic>-value = 0.1, one-sided Fisher’s exact test). One of the disease-associated genes was <italic>OLFM3</italic>, which has been associated with glomerular filtration rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref050">50</xref>]. OLFM3, a secreted glycoprotein, has a known function in brain and retina development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref051">51</xref>] and has been identified as a marker for podocyte precursors in two independent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref046">46</xref>]. In our data set, it was specifically expressed in SSBpod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g006">Fig 6C</xref>) and was a marker for this cell type in the marker set and KeyGenes set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s013">S3 Table</xref>).</p>

<p>In order to localize SSBpod, Pods and mesangial cells in situ, we immunostained w15 kidney sections with antibodies for MAFB, PODXL, and ACTA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). As expected, PODXL and MAFB were found in Pods at the capillary loop stage and in more mature glomeruli. MAFB staining extended to the proximal segment of the SSB, which indicated that SSBpod may be part of this structure. To locate the SSBpod cells more precisely, we performed smFISH on <italic>CLIC5</italic> and <italic>MAFB</italic>, expressed both in Pods and SSBpod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). We observed a subpopulation of <italic>MAFB</italic>+/<italic>CLIC5−</italic> cells outside the glomeruli, which we identified as the SSBpod. These cells could be found predominantly in the visceral part of the proximal segment of the SSB but also at the capillary loop stage. This result supported the notion that SSBpod were transient cells that preceded (mature) Pods. Having localized the SSBpod, we next wanted to confirm OLFM3 as a marker of this cell type. smFISH of <italic>OLFM3</italic>, <italic>MAFB</italic>, and <italic>CLIC5</italic> showed <italic>OLFM3</italic> to be coexpressed with <italic>MAFB</italic> but absent in cells that were positive for <italic>CLIC5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g006">Fig 6E</xref>), a marker that persists in podocytes in the adult kidney. Quantification of the density of smFISH signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g006">Fig 6F</xref>) showed that <italic>OLFM3</italic> was absent in glomeruli but could be detected in the subpopulation we identified as SSBpod (<italic>MAFB+</italic>/<italic>CLIC5−</italic>). In summary, these results supported <italic>OLFM3</italic> as a robust marker of podocyte precursors.</p>
<p>Finally, we were wondering whether our data set would also allow us to identify candidate mechanisms that drive development from SSBpod to Pods. Differential expression analysis revealed 228 genes that had a significant, bigger than 2-fold changes between SSBpod and Pods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g006">Fig 6G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s014">S4 Table</xref>). Among these we found factors belonging to multiple signaling pathways, such as <italic>FGF1</italic>, <italic>VEGFA</italic>, <italic>HES1</italic>, and <italic>EGF1</italic>. <italic>Vegfa</italic> and <italic>Fgf1</italic> are known to have a homeostatic function in podocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref052">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref054">54</xref>], whereas <italic>Hes1</italic>, a target of the NOTCH signaling pathway, seems to be necessary for the synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins in these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref055">55</xref>]. Binding sites for the transcription factor AP-1 were strongly enriched in this set of genes (145 out of 228 genes, adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value = 1.3 × 10<sup>−5</sup>). AP-1 would therefore be an interesting target for perturbation studies in mouse models.</p>
<p>All in all, the results presented here complement other, recent, single-cell transcriptomics studies of the fetal kidney. We demonstrated how the data can be interrogated to find expression patterns that will improve our understanding of human kidney development.</p>

<title>Heterogeneity in the nephrogenic niche</title>
<p>Building an organ during development requires the careful balance between two fundamental processes—growth and the creation of structure. In many organs, these two functions are reconciled by self-renewing progenitor cells that can be induced to differentiate. In kidney development, NPCs give rise to the epithelium of the nephron, the functional unit of the kidney. To balance growth with patterning, self-renewal and differentiation of NPCs have to be tightly controlled. It is well established that the niche of the NPC plays an important role in this control, but the precise mechanisms are not well understood. In particular, it is not clear how the position and movement of NPCs in the niche might impact the induction towards differentiation.</p>
<p>Heterogeneity in the nephrogenic niche was brought to light first by Mugford and colleagues in 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref026">26</xref>] and has been confirmed by multiple recent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref056">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref057">57</xref>]. Mugford and colleagues used in situ hybridization to study the localization of transcriptional regulators in E15.5 mouse kidney. Three distinct compartments were defined in the CM—inner capping mesenchyme (which lies closest to the cleft of the UB), outer capping mesenchyme (at the tip of the UB), and induced mesenchyme (at the level of the stalk of the UB). Although all compartments expressed <italic>Six2</italic>, only inner and outer capping mesenchyme expressed <italic>Cited1</italic>. The induced CM was distinguished by Wnt pathway activity, as evidenced by <italic>Wnt4</italic> expression. Several recent scRNA-seq studies confirmed heterogeneity in the nephrogenic niche. Brunskill and colleagues studied an E12.5 mouse kidney and found two subpopulations in the CM, which they classified as uninduced (<italic>Six2</italic> positive, <italic>Cited1</italic> positive) and induced (<italic>Six2</italic> positive, <italic>Cited1</italic> negative) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref056">56</xref>]. Among the hundreds of genes that were differentially expressed between these two populations, they found genes related to the Wnt signaling pathway as well as protein vesicular trafficking and degradation. Wang and colleagues also found two subclusters in the CM of the human fetal kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref057">57</xref>]. They interpreted one subcluster as the self-renewing compartment due to higher expression of markers for cell division. The other subcluster, which showed gene expression related to NOTCH signaling (<italic>HES1</italic>, <italic>HEY1</italic>), was considered induced. Two studies by Lindström and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref019">19</xref>] also explored NPC heterogeneity. The first study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref010">10</xref>] identified four NPC clusters (self-renewing, primed, differentiating, and proliferating), whereas the second [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref019">19</xref>] revealed four clusters of NPCs (I–IV), two clusters of primed NPCs (I–II), as well as several clusters of proliferating cells.</p>
<p>In the data set presented here, we identified four clusters of NPCs. Among these, NPCa are most likely the self-renewing compartment. In agreement with the studies by Lindström and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref019">19</xref>], they expressed the highest levels of <italic>CITED1</italic> and <italic>TMEM100</italic> compared with the other NPCs. Furthermore, they preceded all other NPC clusters in pseudotime analysis. NPCb showed expression of several genes that modulate NOTCH, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) pathway activity, as well as low levels of <italic>LEF1</italic>, which has been shown to indicate induction towards differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref019">19</xref>]. The classification of NPCb as “primed NPC” by comparison to the Lindström data set supported the interpretation of NPCb as a state distinct from NPCa that is primed to differentiate. The fact that we detected NPCb only at w16 and w18 leads us to speculate that NPCb could be the result of continuous changes in the nephrogenic niche over the course of development. The third NPC cluster, NPCc, appeared together with NPCb in pseudotime and was distinguished from the other NPCs by higher expression of genes involved in or regulated by retinoic acid signaling. The retinoic-acid binding protein CRABP2 has been identified as an NPC marker in other reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref057">57</xref>]. We speculate that NPCc are the result of spatially varying concentrations of retinoic acid, which is produced in the cortical interstitium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref058">58</xref>]. Finally, NPCd appeared between NPCb–c and PTA in pseudotime and were clearly distinguished from the other NPC clusters by increased proliferation, at least as far as that can be inferred from gene expression data. In agreement with our analysis, NPCd were classified as “proliferating cells” by comparison with the Lindström data set [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref019">19</xref>]. NPCd cells also lowly expressed markers of induction towards differentiation (such as <italic>LEF1</italic>, <italic>LHX1</italic>, <italic>WNT4</italic>), which indicates a transitory state between induced and/or primed NPCs and PTA. The suggested developmental flow from NPCa via NPCb–c to NPCd was supported by a gradual decrease of <italic>OSR1</italic>, which is a well-known marker of the early CM.</p>
<p>By in situ detection of CITED1, SIX2, and other genes, we also explored the spatial localization of the different NPC clusters. NPCa seemed to reside closest to the tip of the UB, the induced and/or primed NPC b and c were situated closer to the stalk, and NPCd were closest to the PTA. This finding is consistent with the recent report of NPCs streaming from their niche at the UB tip towards the UB branch point to form the PTA and RV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref019">19</xref>]. On this path, the cells gradually lose the NPC transcriptional program, and differentiation is induced. In the mouse, trajectories of NPCs also seem to have a large stochastic component: NPCs repeatedly detach from the UB and attach again and also shuttle back and forth between the “uninduced region” at the UB tip and the “committed region” around the stalk of the UB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref059">59</xref>]. This observation could indicate that varying expression levels of genes such as <italic>CITED1</italic> occur as a consequence of cell migration and are not necessarily functionally relevant. Indeed, <italic>Cited1</italic> knockout has no adverse effects on kidney development in the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref060">60</xref>]. Taken together, our results support a model in which (self-renewing) NPCa reside at the tip of the UB, probably in close proximity or even in contact with the UB. Movement away from the UB tip, toward the stalk, is accompanied by decreased <italic>CITED1</italic> expression and transformation to the (induced and/or primed) NPCb–c states. Arrival at the stalk of the UB is characterized by the NPCd expression state, increased proliferation, and eventually transformation to the PTA. It is conceivable that cells sometimes visit the different NPC states in reverse order, which would reconcile this model with the observed high, multidirectional motility of NPCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref059">59</xref>].</p>

<title>Proximal–distal patterning</title>
<p>In the prevailing model of mammalian kidney development, self-renewing NPCs are not prepatterned to develop into a certain lineage. When the developing nephron first displays signs of proximal–distal patterning is an important, outstanding question. Mugford and colleagues have found evidence that the PTA, which succeeds the NPCs, is already polarized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref026">26</xref>]. A recent study by Lindström and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref019">19</xref>] proposed an intriguing mechanism that couples temporal and spatial cues: whereas NPCs that are recruited to the PTA early develop into distal cell types, NPCs that are integrated later contribute to the proximal compartment. In our study, we identified the PTA by known marker genes (<italic>CCND1</italic>, <italic>LHX1</italic>, and <italic>WNT4</italic>) and high proliferation. We were unable to detect any substructure within the PTA, which might be due to the limited resolution of our scRNA-seq method. RV/CSB, the next developmental stage, however, was split in two clusters (a and b). Pseudotime analysis suggested that RVCSBa was a heterogeneous cluster comprising early RV cells (which appeared before RVCSBb) and the distal segment of the RVCSB. This observation is consistent with the time-dependent recruitment model by Lindström and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref019">19</xref>] in the sense that in that model, distal specification precedes proximal patterning.</p>

<sec id="sec013">
<title>Podocyte development</title>
<p>Single-cell transcriptomics studies of various organs have brought to light many new, intermediate cell states. This has provoked the question of whether we should consider gene expression in complex tissues as a continuum rather than a collection of distinct expression profiles. In developmental systems, it is certainly useful to think about gene expression change as a continuous process. Nevertheless, there are clearly distinct intermediate cell states even within linear developmental paths. In our study, we observed that RVCSBb gave rise to Pods via an intermediate state, the SSBpod, which directly preceded the Pods in pseudotime. Specific expression of <italic>OLFM3</italic> made it likely that this cluster is identical to previously identified podocyte precursors, which were marked by this gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref046">46</xref>]. Menon and colleagues defined a cluster of “immature” or “early” podocytes, characterized by high <italic>OLFM3</italic> and low <italic>MAFB</italic> expression. In that study, podocytes showed increased <italic>MAFB</italic> expression but loss of <italic>OLFM3</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref046">46</xref>]. Lindström and colleagues located <italic>OLFM3</italic> positive cells to the proximal part of the SSB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref019">19</xref>]. In our study, we confirmed all of these observations: <italic>OLFM3</italic> was localized to the visceral part of the proximal segment of the SSB, and <italic>OLFM3</italic> negative Pods showed higher expression of mature podocyte markers compared to the <italic>OLFM3</italic> positive SSBpod. Functional annotation analysis of genes that were differentially expressed between SSBpod and Pods revealed enrichment of a binding site for AP-1. This transcription factor has been found to be important for the development of the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref061">61</xref>], neural precursor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref062">62</xref>], and the heart valve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref063">63</xref>] in mice. A role of AP-1 in kidney development has not been described yet, and further research is needed to elucidate its potential function. The analysis of the kidneys from different gestational ages showed high similarity of cell types across different ages with the exception of Pods. These displayed a systematic change in expression pattern, which might indicate the continued maturation of Pods over time. This observation is in agreement with a study by Brunskill and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref064">64</xref>] in the mouse, which compared embryonic (E13.5 and E15.5) with adult podocytes (defined as <italic>MafB</italic> positive cells). That study found hundreds of genes that were differentially expressed between embryonic and adult podocytes. Furthermore, targeted experiments are needed to demonstrate the possible maturation of podocytes in human kidney development.</p>
<p>In summary, we have leveraged a combination of single-cell transcriptomics and in situ imaging to study the intricate structure of the developing human kidney. The transcriptomics data, accessible via a web application (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.semraulab.com/kidney" xlink:type="simple">http://www.semraulab.com/kidney</ext-link>), will be a valuable starting point for discovering gene regulatory mechanisms or finding new disease mechanisms.</p>

<title>Single-cell dissociation of human fetal kidney</title>
<p>One human embryo of w16 (male) was isolated and the kidney dissected in cold saline solution (0.9% NaCl, Versylene Fresenius, Almere, Netherlands). For sex genotyping, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for AMELX/Y was used as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref065">65</xref>]. The obtained kidney was decapsulated and kept on ice in dissociation buffer (DPBS + Penicillin 100 U/mL + Streptomycin 0.1 mg/mL; all from Life Technologies) before cutting it into 1–2 mm pieces. The pieces were washed three times with washing solution (Advanced DMEM F12 supplemented with ITS commercial solution [Insulin–Transferrin–Selenium; Thermofisher], Glutamax, Penicillin 100 U/mL, and Streptomycin 0.1 mg/mL) with brief centrifugation (160 g) in order to remove as many red blood cells as possible. The washed kidney tissue was then incubated with digestion solution (Trypsin/EDTA solution 0.25% and Collagenase-II 280 U/ml) and incubated overnight at 4°C. The next day, the digestion solution was removed, and the kidney was rinsed with washing solution and incubated with washing solution for 30 min at 37°C with agitation. Subsequently, the sample was sequentially passed through sterile cell strainers of 100, 70, and 40 μm pore size with the help of washing solution. The cells were then centrifuged and counted, and viability was measured to be 78% (trypan blue assay) before proceeding with scRNA sequencing library preparation. Four additional human fetal kidneys (w9, male; w11, male; w13, female; and w18, female) were dissected as described above, but, additionally, live cells were purified by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) before library preparation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref066">66</xref>].</p>

<p>Single-cell expression for the w16 sample was quantified using unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) by 10× Genomics’ “Cell Ranger” software. After removing cells with less than 2,000 transcripts per cell, 8,503 cells were retained for further analysis.

Stress markers were defined as those genes that were significantly up-regulated upon prolonged enzymatic incubation of mouse kidney tissue in the study by Adam and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref022">22</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s012">S2 Table</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). Mouse genes from this list were converted to human genes using biomart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref068">68</xref>]. Genes of the literature set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s011">S1 Table</xref>) only showed small differences between stressed and nonstressed cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s002">S2C and S2D Fig</xref>), and stressed cells did not form a separate cluster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s002">S2E and S2F Fig</xref>). Therefore, removing stressed cells did not reduce the cell type diversity in the sample. Additionally, 42 cells had more than 1% of their expression coming from <italic>HBB</italic>, <italic>HBA1</italic>, and <italic>HBA2</italic> and were therefore classified as red blood cells and discarded from any further analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s002">S2E Fig</xref>). Sporadic expression of hemoglobin genes in other cells was likely due to red blood cells that burst before isolation. The same filtering approach was applied to the samples from the other developmental ages as well as the data from Lindström and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref019">19</xref>]. Raw UMI counts were smoothened by k-nearest neighbors smoothing version 2.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref012">12</xref>]. This procedure reduces technical noise by sharing information between transcriptionally similar cells, which likely belong to the same cell type. Briefly, the expression profiles of each cell and its k-nearest neighbors were summed (k = 10; distance metric: Euclidean distance of the first 10 PCs with a dither of 0.05). The resulting smoothened count matrix had a higher total count than the original and was therefore scaled back to the original matrix by a global factor. Expression was normalized by the method developed by Lun and colleages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref069">69</xref>] (as implemented in the scran [version 1.10.1] R package using the functions quickCluster and computeSumFactors). Normalized gene expression was Freeman-Tukey transformed in further analyses unless stated otherwise.</p>

<title>Reduction of dimensionality</title>
<p>Variability of gene expression was calculated using the improvedCV2-function from the scran R package. Intercell distances were calculated using the 5% most HVGs excluding stress markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref022">22</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s012">S2 Table</xref>) and ribosomal genes (obtained from the HGNC website) without any filter for minimum mean expression. For maps of individual samples, we used (1–Pearson correlation) as distance measure. For maps of combined samples, we used Euclidean distance in the MNN-corrected principal component space. All tSNE maps used a perplexity setting of 500. For the DDRTree embedding used with pseudotime analysis, see section Pseudotime analysis.</p>

<sec id="sec025">
<title>Clustering</title>
<p>Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using Ward linkage and the same intercell distances as for the reduction of dimensionality. The dendrogram of this clustering was cut at height 0.6 to yield 29 clusters of cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). The cut off was chosen such that the number of resulting clusters was comparable to the number of cell types expected from the literature on mouse development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref070">70</xref>] and other scRNA-seq studies of the human fetal kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref056">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref057">57</xref>]. We estimated the number of cell types to be around 20 but created slightly more as a starting point to allow for the discovery of new cell types. On the other hand, we did not want to use a much higher number to avoid overclustering (i.e., creating many clusters that are merely driven by noise, which would then have to be merged manually). The presence of known markers of the different cell types in the kidney (literature set, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s011">S1 Table</xref>) was then used to identify cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). Based on this analysis, some adjacent clusters (clusters 4 and 5, 11 and 12, 15 and 16, and 17 and 18) showed very similar expression of known marker genes of podocytes, ICs, UB, and collecting duct and proximal tubule cells, respectively. In addition, the aforementioned clusters were in close proximity, both in the clustering dendrogram as well as in tSNE space (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). Consequently, these clusters were merged. For example, clusters 4 and 5 had similar expression of genes known to be expressed in mature podocytes (<italic>NPHS2</italic>, <italic>PTPRO</italic>, <italic>PODXL</italic>) compared to cluster 6, which showed very weak expression of these genes and had distinctive expression of <italic>OLFM3</italic>, which has been shown to be specifically expressed in podocytes precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref046">46</xref>]. Furthermore, we also merged clusters 7 and 25, which were more distant in the dendrogram of the hierarchical clustering but had very similar literature marker profiles (e.g., <italic>LHX1</italic>, <italic>WNT4</italic>, <italic>CCND1</italic>, <italic>JAG1</italic>, <italic>PAX2</italic>, and <italic>PAX8</italic>) and appeared in close proximity in tSNE space. Finally, clusters 26 and 29 were also merged. Cluster 26 was a heterogeneous cluster of only 56 cells that were spread in tSNE space between multiple other clusters. This cluster was closest to PTA (cluster 29) in terms of literature marker expression (<italic>WNT4</italic>, <italic>LHX1</italic>, and <italic>CCND1</italic>) and differed from it with respect to proliferative state, which may account for the heterogeneous distribution.</p>

<title>Combining different data sets</title>
<p>To compare cells from multiple scRNA-seq data sets, we used the fastMNN function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref020">20</xref>] implemented in scran (version 1.10.1) on the first 50 principal components of the 5% HVGs without stress markers or ribosomal genes. We used a k-nearest neighbor approach to infer the cell types of unclassified cells from already classified cells. For each unclassified cell, the 20 nearest neighbors in batch-corrected principal component space (Euclidean distance) were determined. The most common cell type among these neighbors was then assigned to the unclassified cell. For the comparison with the data set from Lindström and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref019">19</xref>], we restricted our data set to the nephrogenic niche. The cluster identities for the Lindström and colleagues data set were kindly provided to us by the group of Andrew D. Smith.</p>

The 5% HVGs (without stress or ribosomal genes) were used as input to the algorithm.

<title>Marker genes and KeyGenes</title>
<p>For each gene, the cluster of interest (COI) was defined as the cluster that had the highest mean expression of the gene. Then, a binary classifier based on an expression threshold was defined: cells with expression above that threshold were considered to be part of the COI. We systematically varied this threshold to create a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) based on the cells’ true cluster identities. The AUROC (area under the ROC) was then used to determine the usefulness of this gene as a marker (rather than the specificity or sensitivity at a specific threshold). We defined genes as marker set candidates if they satisfy all of the following four criteria: (1) they have an AUROC exceeding 0.8, (2) they are detected in at least 80% of the cells in the COI, (3) they have a minimum mean expression of 1.5 in the COI, and (4) they are significantly expressed in at most 25% of the cells outside the COI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s013">S3 Table</xref>). Significant expression was defined here as an expression level higher than the 25th percentile of expression in the COI. Subsequently, the top four candidate marker genes per cluster, as ranked by the AUROC, resulted in a final set of 88 marker genes (marker set, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s013">S3 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>To apply the KeyGenes prediction algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref021">21</xref>], two-thirds of the cells were assigned to the training set and one-third to the test set. A multinomial logistic regression model was trained on the training set with LASSO shrinkage using the 500 most HVGs, filtered for stress markers and ribosomal genes. The shrinkage parameter was determined by 20-fold cross validation. To apply the KeyGenes method to single cells, each cell was treated as a sample, and cross validation was used to control for overfitting. The model obtained a list of 95 classifier genes with nonzero weights (KeyGenes set, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s013">S3 Table</xref>). Thereafter, the cells in the test set were assigned to the cell type with the highest identity (id) score; 84% of the cells in the test set were classified correctly (16% test error). On average, the id score was 0.59, and 24% of the cells in the test set obtained an id score higher than 0.8.</p>

<title>Differential expression analysis</title>
<p>For all differential expression analyses, we used EdgeR (version 3.24.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref071">71</xref>] on raw counts. Normalization and dispersion estimates were calculated by calcNormFactors and estimateDisp, respectively. We modeled gene expression with a negative binomial generalized linear model with glmQLFit. Besides the conditions to be compared, a detection rate for each gene was added to the design matrix. The detection rate is defined as the fraction of cells with nonzero expression. In the comparison of different ages, we excluded the w9 and w16 samples. The w9 sample contained only a few cells, which results in high uncertainty for average gene expression levels. The w16 sample was created separately from the other samples. Therefore, to avoid batch effects, which are not corrected for in the differential expression analysis, we therefore also excluded the w16 sample.</p>

<title>GWAS analysis</title>
<p>The NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog was used to retrieve genes associated with traits related to kidney diseases.

This selection resulted in a list of 560 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s014">S4 Table</xref>, Kidney GWAS genes). As a negative control, we also obtained a list of 1,508 genes associated with lung diseases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000152.s014">S4 Table</xref>, Lung GWAS genes) by selecting the following traits: lung adenocarcinoma, lung carcinoma, interstitial lung disease, squamous cell lung carcinoma, lung disease severity measurement, family history of lung cancer, non-small cell lung carcinoma, diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, pulmonary function measurement, vital capacity, emphysema, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, and asthma.

<title>Image analysis</title>
<p>smFISH image stacks were processed with 3D deconvolution and background correction (rolling ball, radius: 3 pixels = 0.39 μm), using the NIS Elements software (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Subsequently, maximum projection was used to create a 2D representation of the image stack. The resulting smFISH images were analyzed with homemade MATLAB scripts. First, autofluorescent background was removed by subtracting the appropriately scaled signal of the GFP channel from each of the other channels. Then a region of interest (ROI) containing the structure of interest was defined manually, and candidate smFISH signals were detected by binarizing the image using a global threshold. Connected components were then counted as smFISH signals if they fulfilled two criteria: their average intensity was bigger than the third quartile of individual pixel intensities and they had an area of three pixels or bigger. The density of smFISH signals in the ROI was calculated as the number of retained connected components divided by the area of the ROI.</p>
<p>Images of immunostaining were pre-processed by background subtraction (rolling ball, radius: 100 pixels = 13 μm) using ImageJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000152.ref073">73</xref>]. Quantification of the immunostaining signal was carried out using homemade MATLAB scripts. First, the CM region was segmented manually. Then, cross-sections of the CM, roughly perpendicular to the outline of the UB, were drawn by hand, approximately 30 pixels apart. For the starting point of each cross-section, the contour length <italic>s</italic> along the UB starting from the top of the CM (close to the edge of the cortex) was determined (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). The distance <italic>s</italic> was expressed relative to the total contour length (from top to bottom of the UB). The distance from the UB along the cross-sections was defined to be the distance <italic>d</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000152.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Fluorescence intensities were then averaged over lines of 30 pixels length perpendicular to the drawn cross-section. The resulting intensity profiles (which depend on <italic>d</italic> and <italic>s</italic>) were then averaged over multiple images and either <italic>s</italic> or <italic>d</italic> to get average intensity profiles depending only on <italic>d</italic> or <italic>s</italic>.
