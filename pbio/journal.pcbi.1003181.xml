<abstract>
<p>Because DNA packaging in nucleosomes modulates its accessibility to transcription factors (TFs), unraveling the causal determinants of nucleosome positioning is of great importance to understanding gene regulation. Although there is evidence that intrinsic sequence specificity contributes to nucleosome positioning, the extent to which other factors contribute to nucleosome positioning is currently highly debated. Here we obtained both in vivo and in vitro reference maps of positions that are either consistently covered or free of nucleosomes across multiple experimental data-sets in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We then systematically quantified the contribution of TF binding to nucleosome positiong using a rigorous statistical mechanics model in which TFs compete with nucleosomes for binding DNA. Our results reconcile previous seemingly conflicting results on the determinants of nucleosome positioning and provide a quantitative explanation for the difference between in vivo and in vitro positioning. On a genome-wide scale, nucleosome positioning is dominated by the phasing of nucleosome arrays over gene bodies, and their positioning is mainly determined by the intrinsic sequence preferences of nucleosomes. In contrast, larger nucleosome free regions in promoters, which likely have a much more significant impact on gene expression, are determined mainly by TF binding. Interestingly, of the 158 yeast TFs included in our modeling, we find that only 10–20 significantly contribute to inducing nucleosome-free regions, and these TFs are highly enriched for having direct interations with chromatin remodelers. Together our results imply that nucleosome free regions in yeast promoters results from the binding of a specific class of TFs that recruit chromatin remodelers.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The DNA of all eukaryotic organisms is packaged into nucleosomes, which cover roughly <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the genome. As nucleosome positioning profoundly affects DNA accessibility to other DNA binding proteins such as transcription factors (TFs), it plays an important role in transcription regulation. However, to what extent nucleosome positioning is guided by intrinsic DNA sequence preferences of nucleosomes, and to what extent other DNA binding factors play a role, is currently highly debated. Here we use a rigorous biophysical model to systematically study the relative contributions of intrinsic sequence preferences and competitive binding of TFs to nucleosome positioning in yeast. We find that, on the one hand, the phasing of the many small spacers within dense nucleosome arrays that cover gene bodies are mainly determined by intrinsic sequence preferences. On the other hand, larger nucleosome free regions (NFRs) in promoters are explained predominantly by TF binding. Strikingly, we find that only 10–20 TFs make a significant contribution to explaining NFRs, and these TFs are highly enriched for directly interacting with chromatin modifiers. Thus, the picture that emerges is that binding by a specific class of TFs recruits chromatin modifiers which mediate local nucleosome expulsion.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The genomes of all eukaryotic organisms are packaged into nucleosomes, which are the fundamental units of chromatin, each composed of approximately 147 base pairs (bp) of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer. Recent developments in technologies for measuring chromatin marks by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on microarrays (ChIP-Chip) or by sequencing (ChIP-seq) have enabled the construction of genome-wide maps of nucleosome positions and modifications at high resolution across various conditions. These experimental data have revealed that nucleosomes are not uniformly distributed across the genome but rather that transcription start and termination sites are relatively depleted of nucleosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Lee1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Mavrich1">[2]</xref>. Furthermore, nucleosome positioning has been shown to vary across physiological conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Shivaswamy1">[3]</xref>.</p>
<p>It has long been accepted that nucleosomes have intrinsic sequence preferences which influence nucleosome positioning, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Simpson1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Lowary1">[6]</xref>. At the same time, it has also long been known that barriers in the DNA can cause nucleosomes to be ‘statistically positioned’ relative to such barriers, introducing a periodic pattern of nucleosome occupancy on both sides of the barrier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Kornberg1">[7]</xref>. Given the fact that nucleosomes may cover more than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Lee1">[1]</xref>, it is therefore also conceivable that a relatively small number of barriers on the DNA, in combination with statistical positioning relative to these barriers, determines most of the observed nucleosome positioning. For example, recent work suggests that nucleosome occupancy patterns around TSSs could at least partly be explained by such statistical positioning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Mobius1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>Probably the most obvious class of candidate molecules that could introduce condition-specific barriers on the DNA are sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs). Indeed, for some specific promoters in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> it has been established that binding of TFs is a major determinant of nucleosome positioning in the promoter region, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Floer1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Wang1">[11]</xref>. Moreover, the resulting nucleosome positioning has major effects on gene regulation from these promoters. In addition, for a few TFs it has been established that their binding induces local nucleosome exclusion genome-wide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Lee1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Badis1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Ganapathi1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although it is thus clear that both intrinsic sequence preferences of nucleosomes and competitive binding of other DNA binding factors play a role in nucleosome positioning, the relative importance of these factors have come under intense debate in recent years. For example, it has been proposed that the positioning of nucleosomes, in particular in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, is mainly determined by intrinsic sequence preference of the nucleosomes, i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Segal1">[15]</xref>. In this view, nucleosomes are mainly positioned by a ‘code’ in the DNA sequence and the accessibility of the DNA to TFs is downstream of this sequence-guided nucleosome positioning. However, these conclusions were challenged by several studies which suggested nucleosome sequence specificity can only explain a modest fraction of nucleosome positioning, and that statistical positioning likely also plays an important role <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Lee1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Mavrich1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Peckham1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Chevereau1">[17]</xref>. More recently, several groups have undertaken further experimental investigations into this question, in particular by experimentally comparing nucleosome positioning <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Kaplan1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Zhang1">[19]</xref>. Although there is general agreement that these experimental studies confirmed that both intrinsic sequence preferences and the competitive binding of TFs play a role in nucleosome positioning, different authors came to strikingly different, and often seemingly contradictory conclusions regarding which of these factors play a dominant role <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Stein1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Locke1">[24]</xref>. It is thus clear that, rather than lacking sufficient experimental data, the current challenge in furthering our understanding of the determinants of nucleosome positioning lies in the quantitative interpretation of this data.</p>
<p>Here we show that, by analyzing existing experimental data in combination with rigorous computational modeling, important novel insights can be gained that reconcile previous seemingly contradictory observations, and that suggest a new picture of the mechanisms regulating nucleosome positions. In particular, we use a biophysical model to quantitatively assess the role of TFs in determining nucleosome positioning in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, to assess which aspects of nucleosome positioning TFs contribute to most, and to identify whether there are subsets of TFs that play a predominant roles in this process. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is a particularly attractive system for such an analysis because extensive nucleosome positioning data are available, and because it is essentially the only organism in which sequence-specificities are available for the very large majority of TFs.</p>
<p>Rather than assuming that intrinsic sequence preferences determine nucleosome positioning and that TF binding occurs preferentially at those regions not covered by nucleosomes, or vice versa, assuming that TF binding sets boundaries in the DNA against which nucleosomes are statistically positioned, in our model the TF binding and nucleosome positioning patterns are determined by a dynamic competition of all TFs and nucleosomes for binding to the DNA. Our model incorporates both the sequence preferences of the nucleosomes and of all TFs in a thermodynamic setting, and rigorously calculates the resulting equilibrium occupancies genome-wide as a function of the concentrations of all TFs and the nucleosomes.</p>
<p>Using this model in combination with experimental data we find that TF binding makes a substantial contribution to nucleosome positioning but only at a specific subset of genomic positions. In particular, the linker regions between nucleosomes can be clearly divided into two classes based on their size: the large majority of linkers is small (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> bp) and occurs within large nucleosome arrays in gene bodies, whereas a minority of linkers is large (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> bp) and occurs predominantly in promoters. Our results show that the phasing of the small linkers within nucleosome arrays, and thereby the majority of nucleosome positioning genome-wide, is mainly determined by sequence preferences of nucleosomes. In contrast, the larger nucleosome free regions in promoters, which are likely most relevant for effects on gene expression, are mainly determined by competitive binding of TFs. By applying our model to data on nucleosome positioning <italic>in vitro</italic> we also confirm that the ability of TFs to explain nucleosome positioning in promoters is restricted to <italic>in vivo</italic> data. Thus, our model provides a quantitative and mechanistic explanation for the observed discrepancies between <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> nucleosome positioning. Most strikingly, our results also show that, rather than all TFs contributing roughly equally to the competition with nucleosomes, the effect of TFs on nucleosome positioning is restricted to a relatively small set of about <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> TFs. Although one might expect that these TFs are simply the highest expressed TFs with the largest number of TFBSs genome-wide in the conditions in which the experiments were performed, we find this not to be the case. Instead, we find that these TFs are highly enriched for having known protein-protein interactions with chromatin remodeling complexes, histones, and chromatin modification enzymes. Thus, the mechanistic picture suggested by our results is that there is a specific class of TFs who, upon binding to the DNA, recruit chromatin modifiers that then mediate local expulsion of nucleosomes.</p>

<title>A biophysical model of TF and nucleosome binding to genomic DNA</title>
<p>To rigorously investigate the competition between TFs and nucleosomes for binding to DNA, and the role of TFs in nucleosome positioning, we take a statistical mechanics approach in which we explicitly consider all possible non-overlapping binding configurations to the genome for nucleosomes and a large set of TFs, assigning a probability to each configuration using standard Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics. The basic approach, which uses dynamic programming to efficiently sum over all possible binding configurations, has been used in computational methods for analysis of transcription regulation for over a decade, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Chevereau1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Bussemaker1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Schwab1">[28]</xref>, and has been used more recently to specifically investigate the effect of competitive binding of nucleosomes and TFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Wasson1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-RavehSadka1">[30]</xref>. Here we use this approach to comprehensively investigate the role of TFs in determining nucleosome positioning. We employ an unprecendented complete set of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> TF binding models, we investigate the dependence on the concentrations of these TFs, and we also introduce tunable sequence-specificities for all TFs and nucleosomes.</p>
<p>The model is explained in detail in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>. Briefly, each TF <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is assumed to bind DNA segments of a fixed length <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and, for any length-<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> DNA segment <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, a binding energy <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is determined. The energies <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are calculated from a weight matrix representation of the TF's binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Berg1">[31]</xref> and involve a tunable scale parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> which controls the sequence-specificity of the TF. To obtain energy matrices for the large majority of sequence-specific TFs in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> we used a collection of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> WMs that we curated previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Chen1">[32]</xref> and that are based on a combination of ChIP-chip and <italic>in vitro</italic> binding data. Notably, while the WMs allow us to determine how the binding energy (measured in units <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) varies across positions in the genome for each TF, the WMs do not allow us to determine the sequence-independent contribution to binding energy, i.e. the overall ‘stickines’ of each TF for DNA. To compare binding energies across TFs we set the sequence-independent contribution to the binding energy such that all TFs have equal overall affinity for the DNA (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>
<p>Of the computational work done on nucleosome positioning, probably most effort has been invested in developing models for nucleosome sequence-specificity based on data from both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> nucleosome binding, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Segal1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Kaplan1">[18]</xref>. Exploiting analytical results from statistical mechanics, Locke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Locke1">[24]</xref> rigorously inferred the energies of nucleosome binding from high-throughput data and used these to evaluate several models of different complexity for the sequence specificities of nucleosomes. The results from this study suggested that the sequence specificity of nucleosomes can be captured by fairly simple models. As we discuss below, our own analysis suggests that the performance of different models of nucleosome sequence specificity depends on the precise data-set and performance evaluation method used, but that all models make highly correlated predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003181-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Of the models analyzed, the model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Kaplan1">[18]</xref> gave robustly high performance across data-sets and we use this model in our study. In particular, we assume that nucleosomes bind to DNA segments of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> nucleotides and determine an energy of binding <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for any length <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> segment <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> using a generalization of the model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Kaplan1">[18]</xref>, involving a scale parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that controls the sequence specificity of the nucleosomes, analogous to the scale parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the TFs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> allows us to investigate the effect of enhancing or decreasing the nucleosome sequence specificity. For example, when setting <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the variation in nucleosome binding energies across different sequences is reduced to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the energy variations predicted by the model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Kaplan1">[18]</xref>.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the model assumes that any DNA segment can only be bound by a single TF or a nucleosome at a time. Although it is likely that there are exceptions to this simplification, it is generally accepted that TFs and nucleosomes compete for binding to DNA. In absence of specific information as to which TFs compete with nucleosomes and which can co-bind with nucleosomes, we make the simplifying assumption that all TFs compete with nucleosomes, as has been done previously by others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Wasson1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-RavehSadka1">[30]</xref>. Like previous approaches, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Mobius1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Segal1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Segal2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Wasson1">[29]</xref>, our model also assumes that the average occupancy profiles across a population of cells are well approximated by their thermodynamic equilibrium averages. Notably, given that there are many ATP-driven processes that cause nucleosome turnover and displacement by chromatin remodelers, it is not a priori clear that this equilibrium assumption holds. Ours and previous computational approaches thus essentially assume that these ATP-driven processes act mainly to affect kinetics, i.e. to allow nucleosomes to resample their positions, without systematically biasing their positioning.

Note that, because all TFs and nucleosomes are in competition for binding to the DNA, the occupancy of any factor to a sequence segment of the genome in principle depends, not only on the concentration of this factor and its affinity to the sequence segment, but on the concentrations of all other factors and their affinities to all other locations in the genome. Thus, the TF and nucleosome occupancy profiles across the genome can be changed by varying the concentrations <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and scale factors <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

<title>Comparing model predictions with experimental nucleosome position profiles</title>
<p>Many experimental studies have been carried out to map nucleosome positions in eukaryotic species, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Johnson1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Valouev1">[37]</xref>, and in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> in particular, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Lee1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Shivaswamy1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Kaplan1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Zhang1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Field1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Whitehouse1">[39]</xref>, so that several data-sets of nucleosome positions in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> are available. In order to determine how to meaningfully compare computational predictions with these experimental data, we first performed a comparative analysis of several experimental data sets. Patterns of nucleosome positioning that are typically highlighted in publications, such as the nucleosome-depleted regions upstream of the transcription start sites (TSSs) and well-positioned nucleosomes immediately downstream of TSS, involve genome-wide averages of nucleosome occupancy across a class of positions. Such average patterns are robust to fluctuations and are shared by all data-sets.</p>
<p>Previous works have assessed the performance of models of nucleosome sequence specificity by determining both the predicted and experimentally observed nucleosome occupancies across individual regions of the genome, and by calculating the Pearson correlation of these nucleosome occupancy profiles. To assess the validity of such an approach, we calculated Pearson correlations between observed occupancy profiles of several experimental data-sets (both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>) as well as several models of nucleosome sequence specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003181-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). This shows that, unfortunately, the occupancy profiles correlate only weakly across different experimental data-sets, with Pearson correlation coefficients typically ranging from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for <italic>in vivo</italic> data-sets, and only marginally higher for <italic>in vitro</italic> data-sets. This large variability across data-sets may to some extent be due to biases of the technological platforms. For example, it is well known that the nucleotide composition and propensity to form secondary structures of the reads can systematically bias the read counts in ChIP-seq by more than 10-fold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Stein1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Harismendy1">[40]</xref>. Variations in details of the ChIP protocol are likely also responsible for some of the variation across data-sets, and previous studies have indicated that MNase digestion bias may also systematically affect nucleosome positioning data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Chung1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Locke1">[24]</xref>. Since all experiments were performed in YPD, true biological variation is likely only a minor source of variation in these data.</p>
<p>In contrast to the experimental data, the occupancy profiles predicted by the different computational models are all highly correlated. Moreover, the correlations across models for a given data-set vary much less than the correlations for a given method vary across data-sets. For example, all models consistently perform better on <italic>in vitro</italic> than on <italic>in vivo</italic> data. Among the <italic>in vivo</italic> data-sets, all methods perform by far best on the <italic>in vivo</italic> data of Kaplan et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Kaplan1">[18]</xref> (which is also far more correlated with <italic>in vitro</italic> data than any other <italic>in vivo</italic> data-set) and far worst on the <italic>in vivo</italic> data of Shivaswamy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Shivaswamy1">[3]</xref>. Thus, comparison of different models with existing data supports the conclusions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Locke1">[24]</xref> that different models of nucleosome-specificity perform similarly in explaining nucleosome positioning. Since the model of Kaplan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Kaplan1">[18]</xref> exhibits highest performance for the majority of <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> data-sets, we chose to use this model in our analysis. However, the weak correlation of nucleosome occupancy profiles across data-sets shows that assessing the performance of computational predictions by directly comparing predicted and observed nucleosome occupancies is highly problematic. A meaningful comparison of computational models requires that one first extracts those features of the nucleosome positioning that are reproducible across experimental data-sets.</p>
<p>In contrast to the absolute value of the ChIP signal, we observed that the positions of local maxima and minima in nucleosome occupancy are much better reproduced across data-sets. This reproducibility of the ‘peaks and troughs’ in the nucleosome occupancy profile has been observed previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Jiang1">[41]</xref>, and has been used to create a reference set of ‘nucleosome’ and ‘linker’ segments. In this procedure, local maxima and minima are used to annotate nucleosomes and linkers in each data-set. These annotations are then intersected, with reference nucleosomes placed at the consensus positions of regions annotated as nucleosomes in all data-sets, and reference linkers the regions free of nucleosomes in all annotations. That the positions of annotated nucleosomes are highly reproducible across data-sets, especially compared to raw coverage and compared to nucleosome maps based on randomized data, is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003181-g001">Figure 1B</xref>. The annotated positions of individual nucleosomes across different data-sets typically vary by less than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> base pairs from the reference position (blue curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003181-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and the vast majority of annotated nucleosome positions vary by less than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> bp from the reference position. In contrast, on randomized data positions of annotated nucleosomes typically vary by roughly <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> bp from the reference position (dotted curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003181-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, although ideally we would like to test whether computational models can predict relative nucleosome occupancies across the genome, it is not possible to meaningfully perform such an assessment given the variability observed in the experimental data. We thus evaluate the performance of different models by assessing their ability to predict nucleosome and linkers that occur consistently across different data-sets. We use the reference set annotated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Jiang1">[41]</xref> consisting of roughly <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> annotated linker regions and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> annotated nucleosomes, that together cover about <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the genome, to assess the performance of the model in predicting <italic>in vivo</italic> nucleosome positioning. In addition, we have applied a similar annotation procedure (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) to produce a reference set of nucleosomes and linkers from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <italic>in vitro</italic> data-sets, which we use to assess the performance of the model in predicting nucleosome positioning <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
<p>To assess the model's performance we compare the predicted nucleosome coverage at annotated linker and nucleosome segments. That is, instead of comparing the predicted and observed absolute occupancies, we assess the model's ability to predict local maxima and minima in nucleosome occupancy, that occur consistently across data-sets. As described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, based on the predicted nucleosome coverage, we classify each segment as either nucleosome or linker, and then calculate the <italic>mutual information</italic> <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> between the predicted and experimentally measured classification.

We will refer <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e062" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as the ‘quality score’.

<p>These results may seem contradictory, given that the sequence-specificity model of Kaplan et al. was developed specifically with the aim of explaining nucleosome positioning. However, Kaplan et al. optimized the overall Pearson correlation between predicted and observed nucleosome coverage, which depends strongly on the variation in absolute nucleosome occupancies. In contrast, the quality score <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> depends mainly on the locations of local maxima and minima in the occupancy, and much less on the absolute amount of variation in nucleosome occupancy. To investigate this further, we compared the distribution of nucleosome occupancies for the model with different values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with the distribution of nucleosome occupancies for the model of Kaplan et al. and the experimentally observed distribution of nucleosome occupancies for the data of Lee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Lee1">[1]</xref> (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, and note that very similar distributions are obtained from other experimental data-sets; Figure S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003181.s002">Text S1</xref>).</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003181-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, the model of Kaplan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Kaplan1">[18]</xref> predicts an overall nucleosome coverage that is dramatically lower than our fits, i.e. with a median nucleosome coverage of about <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Such a coverage distribution is strongly at odds with the experimental data which shows that, rather than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, about <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the genome is covered by nucleosomes, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Lee1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Shivaswamy1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Kornberg2">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Jansen1">[45]</xref>. It is likely that the unrealistically low nucleosome occupancy of Kaplan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Kaplan1">[18]</xref> is an artefact of optimizing the Pearson correlation in nucleosome coverage, since this objective function favors high variance in predicted nucleosome coverage, and does not penalize the mismatch in the average nucleosome coverage.</p>
<p>For our model, the coverage distribution indeed strongly depends on the nucleosome specificity. Strikingly, by far the best fit between the observed and predicted coverage distribution occurs precisely at the specificity that maximizes our quality score (i.e. at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). This demonstrates that, in contrast to the predictions of Kaplan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Kaplan1">[18]</xref>, our fits produce realistic nucleosome coverage profiles, in spite of not specifically optimizing these coverage profiles. In fact, at the optimal nucleosome specificity, the predicted and experimentally observed nucleosome coverage distribution is virtually identical for the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of base pairs in the genome with highest nucleosome coverage (blue and red curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003181-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The main deviation between model and experimental data is that the model fails to predict regions with low nucleosome coverage that are observed experimentally. Indeed, as we will see below, whereas the model correctly predicts almost all nucleosomes, the model fails to correctly predict a substantial fraction of linker regions as nucleosome free.</p>
<p>In summary, optimizing the quality score <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> produces much more realistic fits to the nucleosome coverage distribution than previous models, and shows that the best fits are obtained with only weak nucleosome sequence-specificity.</p>

We ranked TFs by the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e092" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-statistic they obtained in cross-validation (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), and then investigated what quality scores <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> can be obtained using the top <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e094" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e095" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e096" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and top <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e097" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> TFs, refitting all concentrations and sequence specificity parameters. We find that adding the TFs clearly increases the quality of the predictions on the test-sets, although the improvement is relatively small, i.e. from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e098" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e099" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003181-g003">Figure 3A</xref>. Given this modest increase in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e100" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the large number of parameters involved when including many TFs in parallel, one may wonder whether these results are affected by overfitting. However, as shown in Figure S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003181.s002">Text S1</xref>, the observed <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e101" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> scores on train and test sets are essentially identical.

<p>As already observed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Jiang1">[41]</xref>, the length distribution of linkers is bimodal. The large majority of linkers is short, around on average <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e107" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> bps in length, corresponding to short linkers within arrays of nucleosomes. There is a second class, corresponding to roughly <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e108" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of all annotated linkers, that are much longer, i.e. each more than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e109" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> bps long. We will refer to these longer linkers as ‘nucleosome free regions’ (NFRs). We next asked whether TFs contribute more to explaining the positioning of the short linkers or the longer NFRs. Moreover, as TFs are expected to bind predominantly to promoter regions, we also investigated whether the contribution of the TFs to explaining nucleosome positioning is most significant in promoters (defined as running from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e110" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> bp upstream to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e111" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> bp downstream of TSS). We find that, generally, inclusion of the TFs leads to a substantially larger increase in performance for promoter regions, and TFs contribute much more to explaining NFRs than explaining small linkers (Figure S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003181.s002">Text S1</xref>). In particular, considering NFRs and nucleosomes in promoter regions, inclusion of TFs almost doubles the quality score <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e112" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, i.e. from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003181-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, red bars. As an aside, we note that these observations do not depend on assessing the model's performance by the quality score <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. As shown in Figure S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003181.s002">Text S1</xref>, we find essentially the same results when assessing the model's performance using ROC curves, and the area under the curve (AUC) is almost perfectly correlated (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) with the quality score <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. It is also noteworthy that, both when predicting all linkers genome-wide or NFRs in promoters, even though up to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> TFs can be incorporated, the model essentially reaches its optimal performance after adding the first <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> TFs. We investigate this in more detail below.</p>
<p>It thus appears that TFs contribute not so much to explaining positioned nucleosomes, but rather explain the location of longer NFRs, especially in promoters. Further supporting this observation, the rightmost pair of bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003181-g003">Figure 3A</xref> shows the performance of the model including all TFs but with nucleosome sequence specificity removed, i.e. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We see that removing nucleosome sequence specificity only modestly affects the ability of the model to predict NFRs in promoters. In contrast, the performance on predicting all linkers genome-wide drops significantly when nucleosome sequence specificity is removed, even falling clearly below the performance of the model without TFs. This is further confirmed by closer examination of the errors that the fitted models make (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003181-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>For all models, the large majority of nucleosomes is correctly predicted and the fraction of correctly predicted nucleosomes is most strongly affected by removing the sequence specificity of the nucleosomes, i.e. from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> correct for the model with only nucleosome sequence specificity to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the model with all TFs and no nucleosome specificity. The fraction of correctly predicted linkers is much smaller, e.g slightly below <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e123" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the model without TFs. Adding the TFs to the model consistently increases the fraction of correctly predicted linkers, and this increase does not require nucleosome sequence specificity. When considering all linkers genome-wide, the increase in correctly predicted linkers is relatively modest, i.e. from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. However, for NFRs in promoters the fraction of correctly predicted NFRs increases from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to around <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In summary, correctly predicting the phasing of nucleosome arrays over gene bodies crucially depends on nucleosome sequence specificity and is only weakly affected by including TFs, whereas correctly predicting NFRs is strongly dependent on inclusion of the TFs and is almost independent of nucleosome sequence specificity.</p>

<title>Characterization and additional validation of the fitted model</title>
<p>To characterize the biophysical properties of the fitted model we first determined the overall statistics of nucleosome and TF occupancies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003181-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Nucleosomes cover more than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the genome, and most of the remaining regions of the genome are uncovered, with all TFs combined covering less than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e129" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the genome.

The latter quantity is low whenever the TF's coverage results from strong sites with high frequencies of binding, and is high when the TF's coverage comes from a large set of weak sites with lower binding frequencies. The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003181-g004">Figure 4</xref>) show, first of all, that the binding sites of nucleosomes have both the lowest binding energy and the lowest variation in binding energies, i.e. they are the least sequence specific. Interestingly, the top <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e139" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> TFs clearly fall into <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e140" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> classes: a set of TFs (ABF1, REB1, ORC1, and RSC30) that are highly sequence specific and have strong binding sites, and a class of much less sequence specific TFs (PHO2, NHP6A, etcetera) that bind at a much larger number of weaker sites.</p>
<p>As has been observed previously, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Lee1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Mavrich1">[2]</xref>, averaged nucleosome coverage profiles show a characteristic pattern relative to the starts of genes with a nucleosome depleted region immediately upstream of TSS, followed by a well-positioned nucleosome immediately downstream of TSS and a periodic pattern of nucleosome coverage downstream into the gene body. Although the nucleosome sequence specificity by itself, i.e. without including TFs, reproduces some of this pattern at the 5′ end of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003181-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), the observed nucleosome depleted region and the oscillatory pattern into the gene body is much weaker than observed experimentally. As an additional test of the validity of our model, we checked whether inclusion of the TFs improves this average coverage profile relative to gene starts and ends.</p>

<p>We find that adding TFs to the model significantly improves the match between the theoretically predicted and experimentally observed nucleosome coverage pattern at the 5′ ends of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003181-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). It is noteworthy that the nucleosome-depleted region immediately upstream of TSS coincides with a peak in the overall predicted binding of TFs (Figure S5C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003181.s002">Text S1</xref>), further illustrating the role of TFs in establishing nucleosome depletion in these regions. A local peak in TF binding is also predicted immediately downstream of the 3′ ends of genes (Figure S5D in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003181.s002">Text S1</xref>). Although at the 3′ ends of genes, the inclusion of the TFs also improves the match between the theoretical predictions and the experimentally observed nucleosome coverage, the experimental data and predictions clearly disagree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003181-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). First, the width of the experimentally observed NFR is twice as big as the width of the predicted NFR. Second, the oscillations exhibited by the experimentally-determined distribution are not as pronounced as predicted by the model. This lack of a match can likely be attributed to the role of RNA polymerase. Our model considers only <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e141" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> TFs and, in particular, does not consider the effects of binding of general transcription factors and RNA polymerase. Experimental data on the positioning of the largest subunit of Pol II - Rpo21, and the general transcription factor Sua7 shows that these factors localize at 3′ ends of genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Venters1">[46]</xref>, suggesting that they may contribute to the nucleosome free region observed at the 3′ ends of genes (Figure S6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003181.s002">Text S1</xref>). This is further supported by the analysis in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Fan1">[47]</xref>, which shows that rapid removal of Polymerase from 3′ end regions increases local nucleosome occupancy.</p>
<p>As another validation of the model, we investigated whether the predicted TF binding matches experimental observations. For example, we compared the intergenic regions predicted to be targeted by the TFs Abf1, Reb1, and Sum1, with the observed target intergenic regions according ot the ChIP-chip data of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Harbison1">[48]</xref>. This shows that, in spite of the fact that the model was only optimized to fit nucleosome positioning, the fitted model also accurately predicts which regions are targeted by these TFs (Figure S7 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003181.s002">Text S1</xref>).</p>
<p>It is important to stress that, although we assess the model's performance by these global statistics, it predicts the precise locations of individual nucleosomes, NFRs, and TF binding sites. The full genome-wide nucleosome and TF coverage predictions obtained with the model including the TFs are made available through our SwissRegulon server <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.swissregulon.unibas.ch/ozonov" xlink:type="simple">www.swissregulon.unibas.ch/ozonov</ext-link>, allowing users to investigate in detail which NFRs at which promoters are explained by the binding of particular TFs. To illustrate the detailed comparison of the model's predictions and observed nucleosome occupancies <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003181-g006">Figure 6</xref> shows the measured nucleosome coverage, the predictions of the model with and without TFs, and the predicted coverage of TFs, in two genomic regions. As the figure shows, whereas the locations of small peaks and troughs in occupancy across arrays of nucleosomes are reasonably well captured by nucleosome sequence specificity alone, competition with TF binding is needed to explain the occurrence of larger nucleosome free regions, which occur predominantly in promoters. Importantly, it is likely precisely this latter class of regions that are crucial for the effects of nucleosome positioning on gene expression.</p>

<p>However, this detailed comparison also reveals that, whereas the locations of TF binding typically matches the centers of observed NFRs, the predicted shape of these NFRs differs considerably between the model and the experimental observations. In particular, NFRs tend to be much narrower in the model's predictions than in the experimental data. This suggests that, although TF binding determines the genomic location where nucleosome depletion is observed, the observed nucleosome exclusion is more substantial than predicted from the steric hindrance between TFs and nucleosomes. This suggests that TF binding may recruit aditional factors involved in nucleosome exclusion. We return to this observation below.</p>

<title>Only a small subset of TFs, enriched for interacting with chromatin modifiers, crucially affects nucleosome positioning</title>
<p>Our model incorporates the role of TFs through a simple competition for binding DNA and one might thus naively expect that all TFs that are expressed in YPD would contribute similarly to explaining nucleosome positioning, maybe in proportion to the number of their binding sites in the genome. However, we observed above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003181-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) that when consecutively adding more TFs to the model, the performance already assymptotes after <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e142" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> TFs. This could be due to redundancies in the contributions of the TFs, i.e. if sites for different TFs cluster in particular genomic regions, then binding by only a subset of the TFs will suffice to explain the occurrence of NFRs in these regions, and adding more TFs to the model would not further improve performance. Alternatively, it may be that there is a specific class of TFs that contribute much more to nucleosome positioning than other TFs.</p>
<p>To investigate this, we used <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e143" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> cross-validation on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e144" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> independent training and test sets to assess, for each of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e145" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> TFs, whether a model containing only nucleosomes and the single TF statistically significantly outperforms the model with only nucleosome specificity, quantifying the significance by a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e146" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-statistic (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003181-g007">Figure 7A</xref> shows the distribution of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e147" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-statistics obtained for the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e148" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> TFs (blue dots), together with the distribution of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e149" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-statistics expected by chance (brown dotted curve).

<p>As another validation, we checked whether the ability of this subset of TFs to explain nucleosome positioning is a specific property of the sequence specificities of yeast's TFs. That is, it is in principle conceivable that among <italic>any</italic> set of WMs with similar information content and sequence composition, a few will be able to help explain nucleosome positioning. To test this we constructed a set of synthetic WMs by randomly shuffling the columns of the original WMs, and fitted models with these <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e168" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> TFs in exact analogy to our fits with the original WMs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003181-g007">Figure 7A</xref> (green dots), none of the shuffled WMs perform better than expected by chance, confirming that the ability to explain nucleosome positioning is unique to the specific set of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e169" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> yeast WMs that we identified.</p>
<p>As a final test, we also evaluated whether the real WMs can explain the nucleosome positioning that is observed <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). On the one hand, since no TFs are present in the conditions at which the <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments are performed, the TFs should in principle not contribute to nucleosome positioning. On the other hand, as the raw <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> occupancies are significantly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003181-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), one might expect that the TF WMs can still positively contribute to explaining <italic>in vitro</italic> nucleosome positioning. It is thus striking that none of the real yeast WMs performs better than expected by chance in explaining <italic>in vitro</italic> nucleosome positioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003181-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, red dots), i.e. including TFs does not help explaining <italic>in vitro</italic> nucleosome positioning. This shows that the actions of a specific set of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e170" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> TFs are crucial for explaining the differences between <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> nucleosome occupancies.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003181-g007">Figure 7B</xref> lists the top <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e171" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> TFs and shows their quality scores on the test sets (results for all TFs are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003181.s001">Table S1</xref>). The fact that only around <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e172" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> TFs contribute significantly to nucleosome positioning raises the question of what distinguishes these TFs from the others and we investigated a number of hypotheses. One might hypothesize that the top TFs are simply those that are highest expressed in YPD, or those which occupy most sites genome-wide. However, expression data indicates that these TFs are not particularly highly expressed in YPD compared to other TFs (Figure S9 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003181.s002">Text S1</xref>, data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Lipson1">[49]</xref>). Consistent with this, the genome-wide number of binding sites, as observed in genome-wide ChIP-chip experiments (Figure S10 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003181.s002">Text S1</xref>), is not generally higher for these TFs. Thus, the role of these TFs in nucleosome positioning is not simply the result of increased binding or expression in YPD. Notably, for a considerable number of TFs our model predicts essentially no binding sites, and not all of these TFs are low expressed in YPD. It is conceivable that the low number of predicted sites for these TFs indicates that these TFs do not compete with nucleosomes but can bind to DNA which is wrapped around a nucleosome. We also investigated whether the top <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e173" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> TFs have particularly high or low information content and found that this is not the case (Figure S11 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003181.s002">Text S1</xref>).</p>
<p>However, when we manually inspected the functional annotation of the top <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e174" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> TFs, we noticed that roughly half of these TFs are known to be involved in chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003181.s001">Table S1</xref>). Since, among our <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e175" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> TFs only <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e176" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> have been previously implicated in chromatin remodeling or nucleosome positioning, this amounts to a highly significant enrichment among our top <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e177" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> TFs (p-value <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e178" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). This suggested that the top <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e179" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> TFs may be characterized by interacting directly with chromatin modification machinery.

<p>The fact that only those TFs that interact directly with chromatin modifiers contribute significantly to explaining NFRs has interesting implications for the mechanisms of nucleosome positioning. It suggests that the creation of NFRs depends on the actions of chromatin modifiers whose activities lead to local expulsion of nucleosomes from the DNA. That is, the mechanistic picture that emerges is that, initially, the competition between TFs and nucleosomes for binding DNA, as implemented in our model, determines where TFs will end up binding DNA. Subsequently, in those places where TFs from the specific class that can recruit chromatin modifiers are bound, the recruitment of these modifiers will lead to local expulsion of the nucleosomes, leaving a larger region depleted of nucleosomes. This mechanistic picture also explains our previous observation that the predicted NFRs tend to be much narrower than those observed in the data.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It is generally accepted that the packaging of DNA by nucleosomes in eukaryotes can modulate the accessibility of TFs to their cognate sites and thereby have major effects on gene regulation. In recent years there have been significant experimental efforts to determine nucleosome positioning patterns genome-wide, and to analyzing how these nucleosome-positioning patterns are established. As we discussed in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">introduction</xref>, there has been a considerable debate as to whether nucleosome positioning in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> is predominantly controlled by intrinsic sequence specificity of the nucleosomes, or that statistical positioning around barriers introduced by other DNA binding factors is more important for nucleosome positioning, and different researchers have presented seemingly contradictory results in this regard. We feel that these apparent contradictions may be reconciled by the results presented here.</p>
<p>The large majority of annotated nucleosomes and linkers genome-wide concern the phasing of short linkers within dense arrays of nucleosomes, mainly inside genes. We find that the positioning of these nucleosomes and short linkers crucially depends on the sequence specificity of the nucleosomes, and that TFs contribute relatively little to their positioning. Therefore, predicting all linkers and nucleosomes on a genome-wide scale, the sequence specificity of the nucleosomes provides the main contribution to explaining their positions. In contrast, we find that nucleosome specificity contributes little to explaining larger nucleosome free regions, especially those within promoter regions. As our modeling shows, NFRs in promoters are predominantly explained by the DNA binding of a specific class of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e193" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> transcription factors. Thus, while genome-wide locations of nucleosomes and short linkers are predominantly determined by nucleosome sequence-specificity, the large nucleosome free regions in promoters that likely contribute much more significantly to gene regulation, are determined mainly through the competitive binding of TFs. Importantly, the fact that competition with TFs can not help explain the <italic>in vitro</italic> nucleosome positioning shows that the contributions of the TFs is restricted to <italic>in vivo</italic> positioning. Thus, the competitive binding of TFs provides a quantitative and mechanistic explanation for the differences between <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> nucleosome occupancies.</p>
<p>That nucleosome free regions in promoters result from a competition between TF and nucleosome binding is supported by a number of recent studies of individual promoters, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Floer1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Wang1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Lam1">[50]</xref>. In these studies the interplay of TF and nucleosome binding determines positions of NFRs and the resulting accessibility pattern has major consequences for gene expression. Our results suggest that this mechanism is not restricted to a few promoters, but is the typical situation genome-wide. Thus, whereas nucleosome sequence specificity does have a major impact on genome-wide nucleosome positioning, precisely those aspects of nucleosome positioning that have most impact on gene regulation are rather determined by the competition between nucleosomes and TF binding.</p>
<p>Another major result from our study is that less than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e194" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e195" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> TFs that we analyzed appear to have a significant effect on nucleosome positioning. As we have shown, these TFs are not characterized by particularly high expression or large numbers of binding sites in YPD, nor do they possess particular sequence specificities or DNA binding domains. Instead, our analysis suggests that these TFs engage in specific protein-protein interactions with chromatin remodelers, thereby effecting nucleosome eviction much more dramatically than other TFs.</p>
<p>Although the final predictions of our statistical mechanical model are quite competent, i.e. in promoters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e196" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of all nucleosomes and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e197" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of all NFRs are correctly identified, they are still far from perfect. This raises the question as to what additional elements are missing from the model. The main error the model makes is failing to identify roughly one third of nucleosome free regions as nucleosome free. This suggests that the model misses additional factors that promote displacement of nucleosomes. As most sequence-specific TFs in yeast are already represented in the model, and our results suggest that only a small fraction of these TFs significantly affect nucleosome positioning, it seems unlikely that the missing sequence-specific TFs play a major role in the overall quality of the results. In contrast, as shown in Figure S6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003181.s002">Text S1</xref>, general TFs including the RNA polymerase itself may play an important role in nucleosome positioning. In this context it has also been suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Zhang1">[19]</xref> that the well-positioned nucleosome immediately downstream of TSS may result from a direct interaction between general transcription factors and the RNA polymerase with this nucleosome. Thus, including the recruitment and binding of general TFs and RNA polymerase will likely further improve the model.</p>
<p>In addition, TF binding can recruit chromatin modifying enzymes that displace nucleosomes and alter histone tails. The fact that experimentally observed NFRs are typically wider than the theoretically predicted ones suggest that the TF binding recruits chromatin modifiers which lead to a larger region of nucleosome exclusion than given by the TF binding itself. Thus, feed-back from TF binding to nucleosome modification and ejection as mediated by chromatin remodelers is a major feature that could improve the model's predictions. In summary, the picture that emerges from our study is that the binding of a specific class of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e198" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> TFs determines local recruitment of chromatin remodelers, which then mediate local expulsion of nucleosomes. The latter may further positively feed-back on TF binding and thereby expand and stabilize the nucleosome-free regions.</p>
<p>Although this work has focused on yeast, the competition between nucleosomes and TFs for binding DNA may even be more crucial for transcription regulation in higher eukaryotes. For example, in multi-cellular eukaryotes many gene regulatory elements occur in distal enhancers, i.e. local clusters of TF binding sites a few hundred base pairs in length, to which a combination of TFs binds to effect transcription at a promoter that can be hundreds of kilobases away. Recent mapping of enhancers based on chromatin marks has suggested that these enhancers are bound and activated in a highly tissue- and condition-specific manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Heintzman1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Visel1">[52]</xref>. An attractive simplified model for such tissue-specific binding is that nucleosomes by default cause DNA to be inaccessible and that TF binding is too weak to access individual TF binding sites. Only in areas where a cluster with many binding sites for precisely that subset of TFs that is highly expressed in the condition will these TFs jointly outcompete the nucleosomes and create a region of DNA accessibility and TF binding, i.e. similar to the qualitative model presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Mirny1">[53]</xref>. We believe that the statistical mechanics model that we have used here, might also be useful to quantitatively investigate such models of enhancer function.</p>

<p>There has been a significant amount of effort into modeling the sequence specificity of nucleosomes using data from both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Lee1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Segal1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Kaplan1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Locke1">[24]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003181-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, different models of nucleosome sequence-specificity give predicted occupancies that are very highly correlated, and the model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Kaplan1">[18]</xref> exhibits the most robustly high performance. We thus took the model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Kaplan1">[18]</xref> as the basis for calculating binding energies <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e222" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the nucleosome to each possible <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e223" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> bp stretch <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e224" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Specifically, the raw probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e225" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of a 147 bp long sequence segment <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e226" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> under Kaplan et al's model can be obtained using the “nucleosome_prediction.pl” script, that is provided by the authors on their website, with default parameters and using the option “raw_binding”. Using this we define a binding energy under the Kaplan model as<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003181.e227"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e227" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(5)</label></disp-formula>In order to allow us to tune the sequence specificity of the nucleosomes, we introduce a similar scale parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e228" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to obtain<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003181.e229"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e229" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(6)</label></disp-formula>Note that, at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e230" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the sequence-specificity of this model will be equal to that of Kaplan et al's model, whereas at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e231" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> nucleosomes will have no sequence preferences whatsoever. For notational simplicity, in the following we will consider the nucleosome as just another member of the set <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e232" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of all DNA binding factors <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e233" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>Let <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e234" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denote a (non-overlapping) configuration of TFs and nucleosomes bound to the genome and let <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e235" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denote all segments in the genome where a binding site for factor <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e236" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> occurs. Using the standard Gibbs-Boltzmann approach, the probability of finding the cell in configuration <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e237" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is given by<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003181.e238"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e238" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(7)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e239" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the concentration of TF <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e240" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e241" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the inverse temperature, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e242" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the partition function<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003181.e243"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e243" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(8)</label></disp-formula>Note that the probability depends on the scale factors <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e244" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> through the dependence of the binding energies <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e245" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on the scale factors.</p>
<p>Note that, since we will be fitting the scale factors <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e246" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we can define<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003181.e247"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e247" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(9)</label></disp-formula>and fit the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e248" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. For notational simplicity, we will drop the tilde and refer to these rescaled gammas as simply <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e249" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Note that this is equivalent to measuring the energy in units of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e250" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>Using only information about known binding sites, i.e. the WM entries <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e251" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we cannot determine the sequence-independent contribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e252" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for each TF, which essentially controls how generally ‘sticky’ the TF is to DNA. To allow the comparison of binding energies of different TFs on a common scale we set <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e253" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> such that, in the limit of low TF concentrations, each TF has equal binding to the yeast genome. Specifically, we set <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e254" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> such that the average <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e255" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, when averaging over all sequence segments <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e256" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the genome.</p>
<p>Using this reparametrization the probability of a configuration becomes simply<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003181.e257"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e257" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(10)</label></disp-formula><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003181-g008">Figure 8</xref> shows a cartoon illustrating various configurations <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e258" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the factors contributing to their probabilities.</p>

<p>The partition function can be calculated efficiently using recursion relations variously known as transfer matrices or dynamic programming, and this has been routinely used in the field to sum over non-overlapping configurations of hypothesized binding sites, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Bussemaker1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-vanNimwegen1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Wasson1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-RavehSadka1">[30]</xref>.

We then have<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003181.e261"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e261" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(11)</label></disp-formula>Similarly, we can calculate the ‘backward’ partition sums <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e262" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from position <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e263" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to the end of the chromosome. Finally, the probability that a binding site for factor <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e264" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> covers positions <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e265" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> through <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e266" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is given by<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003181.e267"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e267" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(12)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e268" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the chromosome length. The occupancy of factor <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e269" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to position <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e270" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is then given by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e271" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Thus, given a set of scale factors <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e272" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and concentrations <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e273" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we can efficiently calculate the occupancies of all <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e274" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> TFs and the nucleosomes across the entire yeast genome.</p>

<title>Experimentally determined positions of nucleosomes and linkers</title>
<p>To compare the ‘raw’ occupancies as predicted by various models of nucleosome specificity and measured across several <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, we first downloaded the per base occupancy predictions provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Kaplan1">[18]</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Locke1">[24]</xref> and used these predicted occupancies directly.

To obtain per-base nucleosome occupancies we calculated, for the ChIP-seq data, the number of reads overlapping each position and log-transformed these read counts. For the ChIP-chip data we log-transformed the chip signal. We observed that there is a very small number of positions for which sometimes aberrantly high or low signals are reported. To avoid having these outliers skew the observed correlations we removed the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e275" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of genomic positions with highest signal and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e276" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with lowest signal.

To compare the reproducibility of the annotated nucleosomes with what may be expected by chance, given the annotation procedure, we created randomized data-sets in which each sequencing read is mapped to a randomly chosen location in the genome. We then applied the same annotation procedure to this randomized data and calculated standard-deviations of the positions of annotated nucleosomes in the same way.</p>

To annotate nucleosomes for every data-set we first run the GeneTrack software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Albert1">[59]</xref> using parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e297" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (width of the exclusion zone corresponding to configurations with non-overlapping nucleosomes), <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e298" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (width of the smoothing gaussian kernel), <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e299" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (half-width of the peak) and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e300" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (cut-off for peak height).

Since the width <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e305" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the smoothing kernel is much smaller than the nucleosome width, the final nucleosome annotation is insensitive to the precise width of this kernel. Similarly, raising the cut-off <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e306" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e307" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-fold or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e308" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-fold would only slightly reduce the number of called nucleosomes (i.e. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e309" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e310" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> respectively) and not substantially affect the results presented in the paper. We use the annotated nucleosomes as input to GeneTrack (with the same settings), i.e. as if each annotated nucleosome were a read, to produce annotated reference nucleosomes. We retained the roughly <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e311" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of annotated reference nucleosomes that occur in all <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e312" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> data-sets, leaving <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e313" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> reference nucleosome genome-wide.

<title>Assessing the match between predicted nucleosome coverage and experimental nucleosome positioning</title>
<p>To compare the experimentally annotated linker and nucleosome regions with the predicted nucleosome coverage we proceeded as follows. For a given set of parameters, i.e. concentrations <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e315" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and scale parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e316" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we first calculate the median of the predicted nucleosome occupancy across each annotated linker and nucleosome region. Given a critical median occupancy level <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e317" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we then classified each region as either ‘nucleosome’ <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e318" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> when its median occupancy was larger than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e319" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and ‘linker’ <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e320" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> when its median occupancy was less than or equal to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e321" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We then determined the fraction of regions both predicted and annotated as nucleosome <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e322" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the fraction of regions predicted as nucleosome and annotated as linker <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e323" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the fraction of regions predicted as linker and annotated as nucleosome <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e324" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and the fraction both predicted and annotated as linkers <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e325" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

We then define the mutual information <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e333" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as the maximal mutual information that can be obtained varying the critical occupancy <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e334" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, i.e.<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003181.e335"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e335" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(14)</label></disp-formula>Finally, to normalize the mutual information on a more intuitive scale, we divide by the maximal possible mutual information, i.e. the entropy of the experimentally observed distribution:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003181.e336"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e336" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(15)</label></disp-formula>to obtain<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003181.e337"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e337" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(16)</label></disp-formula>Thus, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e338" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the fraction of the information regarding nucleosome and linker positioning that is captured by the predictions, which we refer to as the <italic>quality score</italic>. We calculate the mutual informations <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e339" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and quality score <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e340" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in an entirely analogous manner when considering a particular subset of experimentally annotated nucleosomes and linkers, i.e. excluding short linkers and/or focusing only on promoter regions.</p>
<p>To obtain predicted nucleosome coverage distributions we simply calculate the predicted occupancy at each position in the genome as described above. To obtain nucleosome coverage distributions from different experimental data-sets we proceeded as follows. As has been observed previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Stein1">[20]</xref>, especially for ChIP-seq data-sets, the variance in read coverage along the genome is too large to be consistent with the known overall nucleosome coverage of roughly <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e341" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Consequently, a naive normalization in which one assumes read-coverage to be directly proportional to nucleosome occupancy would lead to unrealistically low overall nucleosome coverage. To address this, we normalize the data by rescaling log read-coverage, similar to the normalization procedure we developed previously for next-generation sequencing data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Balwierz1">[60]</xref>.</p>
<p>Specifically, for ChIP-chip data (from a tiling array with 4 bp resolution) we obtain a signal <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e342" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> corresponding to the log-ratio of signal from the nucleosome and background sample for each probe <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e343" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> along the genome. Similarly, for ChIP-seq data we extend each read to length <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e344" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> bp and defined the ‘signal’ <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e345" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> at each genomic position <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e346" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as the logarithm of the number of reads overlapping position <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e347" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We assume that the signal <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e348" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is <italic>proportional</italic> to the logarithm of the probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e349" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that a nucleosome is bound to the corresponding segment in the genome, i.e<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003181.e350"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e350" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(17)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e351" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e352" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are unknown constants. We determine <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e353" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e354" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by demanding that the <italic>average</italic> coverage probability matches the experimentally observed average nucleosome coverage of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e355" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and that all coverage probabilities <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e356" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> must lie in the interval <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e357" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Finally, there is a small number of probes (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e358" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> percent of all probes) with an abnormally high signal <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e359" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and we removed these outliers before fitting <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e360" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e361" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. As shown in Figure S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003181.s002">Text S1</xref>, this procedure leads to highly similar coverage distributions for different data-sets.</p>
<p>Predicted average nucleosome coverage profiles around transcription starts and ends were obtained by simply averaging the predicted nucleosome coverage at different positions relative to TSS and transcription end over all genes. We similarly averaged the experimental coverage profiles relative to transcription starts and ends.</p>

<p>To optimize the concentration and specificity scaling parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e362" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> we used the Melder-Mead algorithm in combination with a simulated annealing algorithm that is implemented in the GNU Scientific Library (GSL). To avoid over-fitting when fitting different models with varying numbers of parameters we used a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e363" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> cross-validation scheme for each model and data-set.

We then ranked the TFs by the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e406" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-statistic <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e407" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. These fits and statistics were obtained separately for both the <italic>in vivo</italic> and the <italic>in vitro</italic> data. Finally, we also created a set of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e408" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> randomized WMs by, for each WM, randomly shuffling the columns of the WM. Note that this randomization conserves both the sequence composition and the information scores of the WMs. We then performed the fitting with these <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e409" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> randomized WMs and obtained <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e410" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-statistics in the precise same way.</p>
<p>For the <italic>in vivo</italic> data we then also fitted models including the top <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e411" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e412" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e413" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e414" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> TFs from the list ranked by their <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e415" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-statistic, re-optimizing all parameters. Finally, to assess the contribution of the nucleosome specificity when TFs are added for the <italic>in vivo</italic> data, we fitted the model including all TFs, but without nucleosome sequence specificity, i.e. setting <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e416" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>

<title>Annotating chromatin related TFs</title>
<p>To annotate TFs with known roles in chromatin dynamics we used the Gene Ontology (GO) annotations available from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome database. We considered a TF ‘chromatin related’ when its GO annotation included any of the following categories:</p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item>
<p>GO:0016568 chromatin modification.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>GO:0006338 chromatin remodeling.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>GO:0008301 DNA bending activity.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>GO:0031491 nucleosome binding.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>GO:0003682 chromatin binding.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>GO:0033698 Rpd3C(L) A histone deacetylase complex which deacetylates histones across gene coding regions.</p>
</list-item></list>
<p>Finally, we also added the TFs identified in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Badis1">[12]</xref> to this list. To calculate the over-representation of ‘chromatin related’ TFs among the top <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e417" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> TFs effecting nucleosome positioning, we performed a simple hypergeometric test.</p>

<title>Protein-protein interactions between TFs, histones, and chromatin remodelers</title>
<p>We first annotated yeast proteins that are either (1) part of chromatin remodeling complexes, (2) histone modification enzymes, or (3) histones themselves. Subunits of chromatin remodeler complexes were taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Smith1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003181-Bao1">[62]</xref>. As subunits of histone modification enzymes we took genes that have GO annotation “covalent chromatin modification” and all children GO categories, i.e. histone methylation, acetylation etcera (108 genes in total). Information about protein-protein interactions were downloaded from the STRING database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.string-db.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.string-db.org</ext-link>, file ‘protein.links.detailed.v9.0.txt.gz’), using only experimental evidence with a cutoff of 400. After determining all known protein-protein interactions between the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e418" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> TFs and the three classes of proteins (histones, histone modification enzymes, and subunits of chromatin remodeling complexes) we calculated enrichment of interactions between each class and the top <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003181.e419" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> TFs that significantly explain nucleosome positioning. To assess the significance of the enrichment we used a simple hypergeometric test. The results are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003181-t001">Table 1</xref>.</p>
