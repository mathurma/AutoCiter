Recent investigations demonstrated that a limiting factor for the evolution of cooperative interactions is the way in which they are organized, cooperators becoming evolutionarily competitive whenever individuals are constrained to interact with few others along the edges of networks with low average connectivity. Despite this insight, the conundrum of cooperation remains since recent empirical data shows that real networks exhibit typically high average connectivity and associated single-to-broad–scale heterogeneity. Here, a computational model is constructed in which individuals are able to self-organize both their strategy and their social ties throughout evolution, based exclusively on their self-interest. We show that the entangled evolution of individual strategy and network structure constitutes a key mechanism for the sustainability of cooperation in social networks. For a given average connectivity of the population, there is a critical value for the ratio <italic>W</italic> between the time scales associated with the evolution of strategy and of structure above which cooperators wipe out defectors. Moreover, the emerging social networks exhibit an overall heterogeneity that accounts very well for the diversity of patterns recently found in acquired data on social networks. Finally, heterogeneity is found to become maximal when <italic>W</italic> reaches its critical value. These results show that simple topological dynamics reflecting the individual capacity for self-organization of social ties can produce realistic networks of high average connectivity with associated single-to-broad–scale heterogeneity. On the other hand, they show that cooperation cannot evolve as a result of “social viscosity” alone in heterogeneous networks with high average connectivity, requiring the additional mechanism of topological co-evolution to ensure the survival of cooperative behaviour.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>In social networks, some individuals interact with more people and more often than others. In this context, one may wonder: under which conditions are social beings willing to be cooperative? Current models proposed in the context of evolutionary game theory cannot explain cooperation in communities with a high average number of social ties. Santos, Pacheco, and Lenaerts show that when individuals are able to simultaneously alter their behaviour and their social ties, cooperation may prevail. Moreover, the structure of the final networks corresponds to those found in empirical data. Their article concludes that the more individuals interact, the more they must be able to promptly adjust their partnerships for cooperation to thrive. Consequently, to understand the occurrence of cooperative behaviour in realistic settings, both the evolution of the complex network of interactions and the evolution of strategies should be taken into account simultaneously.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>FCS acknowledges support from COMP<sup>2</sup>SYS, a Marie Curie Early Stage Training Site, funded by the European Commission through the Human Resources and Mobility activity.

When cooperation is modelled in terms of the prisoner's dilemma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b003">3</xref>] (PD), the solution of the replicator dynamics equation in infinite, well-mixed populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b006">6</xref>] dictates the extinction of cooperators by defectors. Cooperators become evolutionarily competitive, however, whenever individuals are constrained to interact with few others along the edges of sparse graphs as recently concluded in two independent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b008">8</xref>]. Both studies place individuals on the nodes of a static graph, and associate their social ties with the vertices linking the nodes such that, throughout evolution, every individual has the possibility of changing her strategy, but not her social ties. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b007">7</xref>] it has been shown that, under strong selection (fitness is determined by the game payoff), heterogeneous graphs lead to a significant increase in the overall survivability of cooperation, modelled in terms of the most popular social dilemmas, played on networks of different degrees of heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b009">9</xref>]. For the classical PD in which the act of cooperation involves a cost <italic>c</italic> to the provider, resulting in a benefit <italic>b</italic> (<italic>b &gt; c</italic>) for the recipient, a simple relation has been obtained in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b008">8</xref>] for a single cooperator to have a chance to survive in a population of defectors, whenever selection is weak (game payoff introduces a small perturbation onto fitness): <italic>b/c &gt; z,</italic> where <italic>z</italic> stands for the average number of ties each individual has (<italic>z</italic> is the average degree of the graph). Both studies show that <italic>games on graphs</italic> open a window for the emergence of cooperation, showing how “social viscosity” alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b008">8</xref>] can contribute to the emergence of cooperation.</p><p>However, recent data shows that realistic networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b016">16</xref>] exhibit average connectivity values ranging from 2 to 170, with an associated heterogeneity intermediate between single-scale and broad-scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b011">11</xref>], which differs from the connectivity values typically used in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b008">8</xref>]. For instance, the network of movie actors exhibits an average connectivity of 30 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b017">17</xref>], whereas collaboration networks based on co-authorship of published papers vary from average values of 4 (mathematics), to 9 (physics) up to 15 (biology) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b013">13</xref>]. In terms of the simple rule for the evolution of cooperation for graphs, the reported values of <italic>z</italic> require benefits to often exceed costs by more than one order of magnitude for a single cooperator to survive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b008">8</xref>]. None of the previous results on strong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b007">7</xref>] and weak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b008">8</xref>] selection on graphs is capable of explaining how cooperation thrives on such social networks. Other mechanisms have to be at work here that allow for the survival of cooperation.</p><p>In most evolutionary models developed so far, social interactions are fixed from the outset. Such immutable social ties, associated naturally with static graphs, imply that individuals have no control over the number, frequency, or duration of their ties; they can only evolve their behavioural strategy. A similar observation can be made on studies related to the physical properties of complex networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b016">16</xref>]. The analyzed networks constitute but one static snapshot of networks that have been typically produced by some growth process. Yet, networks have naturally evolved before and will continue to evolve after the snapshot has been taken. Indeed, recent longitudinal studies of evolving social networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b018">18</xref>] indicate that global properties seem to remain rather stable, whereas individual patterns of social ties remain evolving in time. Hence, assuming a fixed population size and global average connectivity, one may ask: <italic>What role do changes in the interaction framework play in the evolution of cooperation</italic> and <italic>to which extent will the social dilemmas influence the topology and heterogeneity of the evolving network</italic>?</p><p>Using a minimal model that combines strategy evolution with topological evolution, and in which the requirements of individual cognitive capacities are very small, we investigate under which conditions cooperation may thrive. Network heterogeneity, which now emerges as a result of an entangled co-evolutionary dynamics, will be shown to play a crucial role in facilitating cooperative behaviour.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>A Minimal Co-Evolutionary Model</title><p>Let us consider two types of individuals—cooperators and defectors—who engage in several of the most popular social dilemmas of cooperation (see below). They <italic>are not required to accumulate information on all other players,</italic> only those they are immediately connected with. Moreover, they are able to decide, on an equal footing with all players, those ties that they want to maintain and those they want to change. Given an edge with individuals <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic> at the extremes, we say that <italic>A</italic> (<italic>B</italic>) is satisfied with the edge if the strategy of <italic>B</italic> (<italic>A</italic>) is a cooperator, being dissatisfied otherwise. If <italic>A</italic> is satisfied, she will decide to maintain the link. If dissatisfied, then she may compete with <italic>B</italic> to <italic>rewire</italic> the link (as illustrated and described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020140-g001">Figure 1</xref>), rewiring being attempted <italic>to a random neighbour of B</italic>. The intuition behind this reasoning is the following: simple agents, being rational individuals with limited information, tend to interact with other agents that are close by in a social manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b018">18</xref>]. In this sense, agent <italic>A</italic> is more likely to encounter one of the friends of <italic>B</italic> and become a friend with <italic>B</italic>'s neighbour. Moreover, selecting a neighbour of an inconvenient partner may turn out to be a good choice, since this partner also tries to establish links with cooperators, making it more likely that the rewiring results in a tie to a cooperator. Indeed, for all social dilemmas described below, a link with a cooperator maximizes the fitness of any individual, irrespective of its (fixed) strategy. Consequently, all individuals naturally seek to establish links with cooperators. Hence, rewiring to a neighbour of a defector is certainly a good choice for individuals with local information only.</p><fig id="pcbi-0020140-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020140.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Evolving the Neighbourhood</title><p>Cooperators and defectors interact via the edges of a graph. B (A) is satisfied (dissatisfied), since A (B) is a cooperator (defector). Therefore, A wants to change the link whereas B doesn't. The action taken is contingent on the fitness Π(A) and Π(B) of A and B, respectively.

When both cooperate, they receive the payoff <italic>R</italic> (the reward for mutual cooperation). On the other hand, when both defect, they both obtain the payoff <italic>P</italic> (the punishment for mutual defection). The two remaining possibilities occur when one defects and the other cooperates, resulting in the payoff <italic>T</italic> (the temptation to cheat) for the defector and <italic>S</italic> (the disadvantage of being cheated) for the cooperator. Depending on the relative ordering of these four payoff values and assuming that mutual cooperation is preferred over mutual defection, three well-known social dilemmas emerge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b009">9</xref>]—the <italic>snowdrift</italic> game (SG) (<italic>T &gt; R &gt; S &gt; P</italic>), the <italic>stag-hunt</italic> game (SH) (<italic>R &gt; T &gt; P &gt; S</italic>) and the <italic>prisoner's dilemma</italic> (PD) (<italic>T &gt; R &gt; P &gt; S</italic>). The dilemma follows from the players' payoff preferences. In the SG game, the players are referred to as greedy since they prefer unilateral defection to mutual cooperation (<italic>T &gt; R</italic>). In the SH game, mutual defection is preferred to unilateral cooperation (<italic>S &lt; P</italic>), resulting in an intrinsic fear for the players to cooperate. Finally, both dilemmas are combined in the PD game, making it the most difficult situation for cooperation to arise. We adopt the convention of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b007">7</xref>] and normalize the difference between mutual cooperation (<italic>R</italic>) and mutual defection (<italic>P</italic>) to 1, making <italic>R =</italic> 1 and <italic>P =</italic> 0, respectively. As a consequence, we investigate all dilemmas, summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020140-t001">Table 1</xref>, in a 2-D parameter space, depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020140-g002">Figure 2</xref>, where the payoff <italic>T</italic> (temptation to cheat) satisfies 0 <italic>≤ T ≤</italic> 2 and the payoff <italic>S</italic> (disadvantage of being cheated) satisfies <italic>−</italic>1 <italic>≤ S ≤</italic> 1.

The swifter the response of individuals to the nature of their ties, the easier it gets for cooperators to wipe out defectors. Similar conclusions have been obtained with different co-evolutionary models, both in the context of the SH game [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b023">23</xref>], and in the context of the PD game [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b025">25</xref>], supporting the robustness of the current results. Indeed, both models use different rules for structural updating as well as for strategy updating, leading to results in accord with the general findings reported here. Additional insight is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020140-g003">Figure 3</xref> (upper panel), where we investigate how cooperation wins over defection as a function of <italic>W</italic> for the PD when <italic>T</italic> = 2 and <italic>S</italic> = −1 (corresponding to <italic>b/c</italic> = 2 in the classical PD) and different values of <italic>z</italic> ∈ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b010">10</xref>,40]. For small <italic>W,</italic> cooperators have no chance. Their fate changes as <italic>W</italic> approaches a critical value <italic>W<sub>critical</sub></italic>—which increases monotonically with <italic>z</italic>—cooperators wiping out defectors above <italic>W<sub>critical</sub></italic> (the increase of <italic>W<sub>critical</sub></italic> with <italic>z</italic> is expected, since there are more links to be rewired). Thus, the survival of cooperation relies on the capacity of individuals to adjust to adverse ties, even when the average connectivity is high.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020140-g003">Figure 3</xref> also provides evidence of the detailed interplay between strategy and structure. On the one hand, strategy updating promotes a local assortment of strategies, since cooperators “breed” cooperators and defectors “breed” defectors. On (static) heterogeneous graphs, and for specific values of <italic>T</italic> and <italic>S,</italic> the population will evolve into a cooperative state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b007">7</xref>], and the transient dynamics associated with the approach to such a cooperative state, starting from an equal fraction of cooperators and defectors, has been examined in detail in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b026">26</xref>]. On the other hand, under structural updating, however, one is promoting local assortative interactions between cooperators and disassortative interactions between defectors and cooperators, which constitute “favourable steps” from an individual point of view. Clearly, when simultaneously active, strategy update will reinforce assortativity among cooperators, but will inhibit disassortativity between defectors and cooperators, which overall will benefit the emergence of cooperation. Furthermore, since for any finite <italic>W</italic> graph heterogeneity will develop as a result of structural update (we are starting from homogenous graphs), it will become easier for strategy update to promote cooperation. Nonetheless, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020140-g003">Figure 3</xref> shows that, for small <italic>W,</italic> cooperators become extinct. As <italic>W</italic> approaches <italic>W<sub>critical</sub> ,</italic> there will be, overall, only a small fraction of surviving cooperators. Under structural update alone, a small number of cooperators will lead to the emergence of strongly heterogeneous networks of ties. This is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020140-g003">Figures 3</xref> (lower panel) and 4, where we investigate how the evolved network topology changes with <italic>W,</italic> by plotting the overall network heterogeneity. In the lower panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020140-g003">Figure 3</xref> we plot the maximum value of the connectivity (<italic>k<sub>max</sub></italic>) as a function of <italic>W</italic> for <italic>T =</italic> 2 and <italic>S =</italic> −1. For small <italic>W,</italic> heterogeneity remains low since cooperators react slowly to adverse ties, being wiped out. As <italic>W</italic> approaches <italic>W<sub>critical</sub>,</italic> heterogeneity develops, exhibiting a peak at ≈<italic>W<sub>critical</sub>,</italic> where the interplay between strategy and structure is maximal. Finally, above <italic>W<sub>critical</sub>,</italic> heterogeneity decreases, since individual rewiring is fast enough to wipe out defectors. Indeed, when <italic>W</italic> ~ <italic>W<sub>critical</sub> ,</italic> the small fraction of surviving cooperators promotes them into natural hubs, since they attract links from a neighbourhood whose structure is always evolving due to the sizeable role played by strategy dynamics. Such an entangled co-evolution results in highly heterogeneous graphs. In other words, for <italic>W</italic> ~ <italic>W<sub>critical</sub>,</italic> structural dynamics prevents cooperators from becoming extinct, promoting an underlying heterogeneous network of contacts which provides a favourable topology for cooperation to thrive under strategy dynamics. With increasing <italic>W,</italic> the structural dynamics is fast enough to prevent the fraction of cooperators to be reduced to residual values. More cooperators, in turn, means more competition at sites for rewiring, which leads to a reduction of the overall network heterogeneity as compared with that obtained for <italic>W<sub>critical</sub></italic>.</p><p>For any <italic>W &gt;</italic> 0, individual choices lead to heterogeneous graphs in which some individuals interact more, and more often than, others. In view of the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020140-g002">Figure 2</xref>, we show in the top-left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020140-g004">Figure 4</xref> the cumulative degree distributions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>) for the most difficult challenge to cooperation in our parameter space: the PD with (<italic>T =</italic> 2,<italic>S =</italic> −1), corresponding to <italic>b/c =</italic> 2.

Consequently, for low values of <italic>W</italic> and large <italic>T,</italic> the minority of cooperators is both unable to wipe defectors and not easily wiped out by defectors. This means that surviving cooperators will accumulate many links, leading to the most heterogeneous co-evolutionary networks encountered. Clearly, the nature of the game induces a wide diversity in the emerging topology of co-evolutionary networks. In general, one may state that the temptation to cheat (<italic>T</italic>) induces a more pronounced increase of the heterogeneity than the disadvantage of being cheated (<italic>S</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b007">7</xref>]. Nonetheless, the overall onset of increase of heterogeneity qualitatively follows the wave of cooperation shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020140-g002">Figure 2</xref>. The results shown suggest that the simple adaptive dynamics of social ties introduced here coupled with the social dilemmas accounts for the heterogeneities observed in realistic social networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b011">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Role of Selection Pressure on Strategy and on Structure</title><p>The pairwise comparison rule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020140-b027">27</xref>] based on the Fermi distribution function (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>), has been used in updating both strategies and social ties.

Overall, the critical value grows with increasing intensity of selection <italic>β</italic> and with the average connectivity <italic>z</italic>. The present results convey a simple yet powerful message for the evolution of cooperation: the more individuals interact, the more they must be able to promptly decide upon their partnerships for cooperation to thrive. And, of course, the less important the game is (weak selection), the less alert individuals need be.</p><p>The present work assumes that population size remains constant throughout the co-evolutionary process. This is clearly a simplification, and it remains an open problem: the role of a changing population size. Yet, the message conveyed here is powerful and shows that highly interactive, large social networks can exhibit sustained cooperation even when the benefits do not significantly exceed the costs. Finally, the process by which individuals reassess their social ties may change depending on the social context, the “game” at stake, and the species under consideration. In other words, other (perhaps more sophisticated) mechanisms may be envisaged which will certainly build upon the simple model studied here. Yet, the prospect is quite optimistic since, as shown here, simple mechanisms devoid of large information-processing requirements are capable of promoting sustained cooperation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Graphs.</title><p>We place individuals on the nodes (a total of <italic>N</italic>) of a graph.
