</abstract><abstract>
<p>Ubiquitin-dependent processes control much of cellular physiology. We show that expression of a highly active, Epstein-Barr virus-derived deubiquitylating enzyme (EBV-DUB) blocks proteasomal degradation of cytosolic and ER-derived proteins by preemptive removal of ubiquitin from proteasome substrates, a treatment less toxic than the use of proteasome inhibitors. Recognition of misfolded proteins in the ER lumen, their dislocation to the cytosol, and degradation are usually tightly coupled but can be uncoupled by the EBV-DUB: a misfolded glycoprotein that originates in the ER accumulates in association with cytosolic chaperones as a deglycosylated intermediate. Our data underscore the necessity of a DUB activity for completion of the dislocation reaction and provide a new means of inhibition of proteasomal proteolysis with reduced cytotoxicity.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Constant turnover of proteins is part of normal cellular physiology. Newly synthesized proteins that fail to fold are recognized by dedicated receptors and tagged for immediate degradation. The tag usually consists of a chain of a small protein, ubiquitin, and is recognized by the proteasome. We introduce a new tool to interfere with proteasomal degradation: a ubiquitin-specific protease domain (EBV-DUB) derived from Epstein-Barr Virus. This EBV-DUB, when expressed in mammalian cells, preemptively removes ubiquitin chains (deubiquitylation) and so frustrates substrate recognition and engagement by the proteasome. The natural history of misfolded, secretory proteins is poorly understood because of the strict coupling of recognition, tagging for degradation, and proteolysis. The EBV-DUB uncouples these processes and stabilizes short-lived intermediates, an activity that helped us to address the question of how such misfolded proteins are extracted from the relevant cellular compartments. Our data are consistent with the idea that unfolded substrates targeted for degradation are threaded through a narrow pore of the chaperone protein known as p97. In order to pass through the pore, the protein must first have any already attached ubiquitin chains removed; a second cycle of ubiquitylation is then required to allow engagement of the proteasome. Entry of substrate into the proteolytic chamber again requires removal of ubiquitin. We thus propose two rounds of ubiquitin attachment and removal in the course of the extraction and degradation of misfolded proteins.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Protein quality control and ubiquitin-dependent degradation are essential for cellular homeostasis and survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-ReyesTurcu1">[1]</xref>. The ubiquitin-proteasome-system (UPS) is responsible for the turnover of most cytosolic proteins. Likewise, secreted and membrane proteins that do not fold properly or fail to associate with their requisite partners in the ER are delivered to the cytosol and then destroyed by the UPS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Vembar1">[2]</xref>. To facilitate this reaction, one or several dedicated receptors recognize misfolded ER-luminal proteins, which are then recruited to the dislocation machinery and rendered accessible to the cytosolic ubiquitylation apparatus. For both cytosolic and ER-derived substrates, attachment of polyubiquitin (poly-Ub) chains by an enzymatic E1-E2-E3 cascade is the signal for proteasomal degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Glickman1">[3]</xref>. Poly-Ub chains serve as a recognition signal also for protein dislocation from the ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Hiller1">[4]</xref>. When an ER-derived misfolded protein gains access to the cytosol, the attachment of a poly-Ub chain recruits the cytosolic ATPase p97/VCP/CDC48 (Swiss-Prot ID: P55072) and its associated co-factors Ufd1-Npl4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Flierman1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Ye2">[7]</xref>, believed to provide the force required for extraction of substrate from the ER. It is not known whether these Ub-chains are utilized as a handle to exert a mechanical force or whether they target the dislocated protein directly to the proteasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Flierman1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Ye1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Ikeda1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>The 19S lid of the 26S proteasome and p97/VCP/CDC48 both occur in association with ubiquitin ligase and deubiquitylating activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Crosas1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Rumpf1">[10]</xref>. Ubiquitylation is a dynamic process, tightly controlled by a collection of associated ubiquitin-processing factors, both at the level of the proteasome and at the level of p97 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Crosas1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Rumpf1">[10]</xref>. Ubiquitylation and its reverse reaction, catalyzed by deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs), are crucial for p97-mediated dislocation and for proteasome function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Glickman1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Flierman1">[5]</xref>. Impairment of p97-associated DUB activity can block substrate dislocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Ernst1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Sowa1">[12]</xref>. The removal of poly-Ub chains by DUBs associated with the proteasomal lid precedes the threading of unfolded proteins through a narrow pore into the proteolytic chamber of the core 20S proteasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-ReyesTurcu1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Lee1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Pickart1">[14]</xref>. The removal of Ub prior to degradation also recycles this essential modifier and replenishes the cellular pool of free Ub. It follows that DUB activity can have distinct outcomes for proteasomal turnover of proteins: some DUBs facilitate degradation, whereas others may stabilize proteins destined for degradation.</p>
<p>Removal of glycoproteins from the ER involves multiple distinct enzymatic reactions: ubiquitylation, deubiquitylation, deglycosylation, and ATP-dependent dislocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Vembar1">[2]</xref>. How are the opposing activities of ubiquitylation and debuiquitylation coupled in the course of extraction from the ER and delivery to the proteasome? The activity of DUBs is no less carefully controlled than that of the ligases that carry out ubiquitylation. The catalytic domains of DUBs, both cellular and viral, are flanked by often sizable segments that likely mediate such control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Sowa1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Leggett1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Schlieker1">[16]</xref>. We reasoned that the expression of a highly active DUB protease domain, excised from its normal context, might preemptively remove Ub from substrates targeted for degradation and stabilize them. We chose the protease domain of the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) large tegument protein (BPLF1, Swiss-Prot ID: P03186) for that purpose. We use this EBV-DUB to cause an enzymatic blockade of the UPS and show that its expression uncouples dislocation from degradation. Our data demonstrate that protein dislocation from the ER requires a DUB activity upstream of p97-mediated extraction from the ER. Furthermore, a side-by-side comparison of different experimental strategies that impede degradation of a misfolded ER-luminal substrate enabled us to identify this substrate's interactors at distinct stages en route to degradation. This allows us to propose a timeline for the discrete steps involved.</p>
<p>We further identify the ER-luminal machinery for disulfide bridge formation as a putative target of eeyarestatin-I, a small-molecule inhibitor of dislocation. The cytosolic co-chaperone recruiter BAT3 (Swiss-Prot ID: P46379) surfaces as a specific interactor of an ER-derived—and now cytosolic—substrate when the UPS is blocked by the EBV-DUB. Our data suggest a previously unanticipated function of cytosolic chaperones, namely to cope with ER-derived misfolded proteins that arrive in the cytosol. The consequences of EBV-DUB expression are less toxic than those caused by pharmacological proteasome inhibitors and might find wide application in cell biology.</p>

<title>EBV-DUB Is a Highly Active, Viral Ubiquitin-Specific Protease</title>
<p>We aimed to shift the balance of ubiquitylation towards deubiquitylation through enforced expression of a highly active DUB. To this end we employed the protease domain (aa1-270) of the EBV BPLF1 gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Schlieker1">[16]</xref>. The isolated protease domain (EBV-DUB) hydrolyzed K<sub>48</sub> Ub-linkages more readily (&gt;10-fold) than preparations of the cellular DUB YOD1 (Swiss-Prot ID: Q5VVQ6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The EBV-DUB was an excellent substrate for the activity-based probe HA-Ub-VME <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Borodovsky1">[17]</xref>, but not when the putative catalytic cysteine was substituted to alanine (C61A) or when Ub-binding was abolished through blocking the catalytic cleft of the EBV-DUB by an I173W mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g001">Figure 1A,C</xref>). BPFL1 is active towards both K<sub>48</sub>- and K<sub>63</sub>-linked di-Ub, as well as NEDD8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Gastaldello1">[18]</xref>, but not against linear di-Ub despite its topological similarity to K<sub>63</sub>-linked Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Komander1">[19]</xref>. The cellular function of BPLF1's DUB activity remains largely unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Whitehurst1">[20]</xref>. Our experiments do not address the hydrolysis of poly-Ub chains of other linkage types, including K<sub>11</sub>, or chains of mixed topologies, all of which could contribute to proteasomal targeting to different degrees <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Xu1">[21]</xref>. K<sub>63</sub> linkages have been linked primarily to endocytosis and other non-proteasomal events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Kerscher1">[22]</xref> but could contribute to protein homeostasis as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Peth1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Saeki1">[24]</xref>. As a control for all subsequent experiments, we employed the I173W mutant unable to bind and hydrolyze Ub-chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g001">Figure 1A,C,E</xref>).</p>

<p>Expression of a FLAG tagged variant of the wild-type EBV-DUB in 293T cells resulted in a substantial downward shift of polyubiquitylation in HA-ubiquitin expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast, the expression of a cellular, less active DUB (YOD1 WT) failed to do so. Consistent with previous observations, the catalytically inactive mutant (YOD1 C160S) caused accumulation of polyubiquitylated proteins, presumably due to stalled dislocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Ernst1">[11]</xref>. The efficiency with which the viral DUB eliminated polyubiquitylated conjugates in living cells is even more apparent when the activity of the proteasome is blocked by prior exposure of cells to ZL3VS: polyubiquitylated proteins now accumulated in control cells but were largely absent from EBV-DUB WT cells when examined at similar sensitivity of detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). To corroborate our findings, we repeated our experiments in the absence of co-transfected HA-Ub. Immunoblots using antibodies directed against ubiquitin or specific for Lys48-linked ubiquitin revealed diminished polyubiquitylation in EBV-DUB WT cells, but not in control cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000605.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

<p>A strong reduction in polyubiquitylation should affect protein turnover globally. Therefore we analyzed the effect of EBV-DUB expression on steady-state levels of two short-lived, cytosolic GFP variants: the ubiquitin-fusion degradation (UFD) substrate Ub-G76V-GFP and the N-end rule substrate Ub-R-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Dantuma1">[25]</xref>. Both proteins are unstable and their detection improves upon inhibition of the UPS. Ub-R-GFP is processed by cellular ubiquitin hydrolases, which results in exposure of arginine as the N-terminal destabilizing residue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Bachmair1">[26]</xref>. Ub-G76V-GFP cannot be processed by cellular hydrolases, but the fusion with ubiquitin itself serves as a degradation signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Johnson1">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>Co-expression of Ub-G76V-GFP and EBV-DUB WT gave rise to a population with high GFP fluorescence, best illustrated by the 5.3-fold higher median fluorescence intensity of GFP-positive cells (MFI) as compared to control cells and the 1.8-fold increased MFI compared to cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor ZL3VS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Similarly, Ub-R-GFP and EBV-DUB co-expressing cells exhibited a 4.4-fold higher MFI compared to control cells and a 1.6-fold higher MFI compared to ZL3VS-treated cells, apparent also when titrating ZL3VS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000605.s002">Figure S2</xref>). As expected, the relative fraction of GFP-positive cells increased when protein degradation was impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). ZL3VS is an efficient inhibitor of the chymotryptic and the peptidyl-glutamyl peptide hydrolyzing activities of the proteasome and impairs its tryptic activity by ∼50% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Dantuma1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Groll1">[28]</xref>. Taking this into account, our flow cytometric data on two well-established, short-lived proteins suggest a near complete blockade of the UPS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Dantuma1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Wang1">[29]</xref>. Both the N-end rule and UFD pathway are affected, likely at an ubiquitinyl-dependent step in commitment of the substrate to the proteasome.</p>
<p>Ubiquitylation and protein turnover are central to many cellular processes. Overexpression of a highly active DUB or proteasomal inhibition by small molecules might affect the physiology of a cell in many ways.

<title>Expression of EBV-DUB Blocks Protein Turnover</title>
<p>Does expression of the viral DUB affect protein degradation directly? To allow a direct comparison of an ER-derived and cytosolic substrate, we employed RI<sub>332</sub>, a C-terminally truncated form of ribophorin-I that is commonly used as a model to study dislocation and degradation of ER-luminal proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Ernst1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-deVirgilio1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Mueller1">[34]</xref>. When devoid of its N-terminal signal sequence (ΔSS-RI<sub>332</sub>) the protein fails to enter the ER, cannot be glycosylated, and remains cytosolic, but is otherwise identical to RI<sub>332</sub> (see schematic representation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). The cytosolic UPS substrate ΔSS-RI<sub>332</sub> is turned over in both control and EBV-DUB I173W cells (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 20 min), but its degradation was blocked by expression of EBV-DUB WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). This confirms our flow cytometric data on Ub-R-GFP and Ub-G76V-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) and demonstrates an efficient blockade of the UPS imposed by EBV-DUB WT. An arrest of the UPS should also affect the degradation of ER-derived proteins. When equipped with its natural signal sequence, RI<sub>332</sub> is translocated into the ER and glycosylated but rapidly destroyed in control and EBV-DUB I173W cells (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 44 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-deVirgilio1">[33]</xref>.</p>

The influence of targeting the EBV-DUB to p97 through installation of an UBX-domain (red symbols) versus non-targeted EBV-DUB (black symbols) is tested by direct comparison of model substrate stabilization.

<p>The banding pattern observed in these experiments requires explanation. The lower band at the 0 min chase time point corresponds to ER-luminal, non-glycosylated RI<sub>332</sub> (RI332 no CHO) with its signal sequence removed, while the upper band is the glycosylated form of RI<sub>332</sub> (RI332 +CHO) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Ernst1">[11]</xref>. Removal of the <italic>N</italic>-linked glycan by cytosolic <italic>N</italic>-glycanase converts asparagine at the site of glycan attachment to aspartate (N275D) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Hirsch1">[35]</xref>. As a consequence, deglycosylated RI<sub>332</sub> (RI332-CHO) shows altered electrophoretic mobility. This form was readily apparent in EBV-DUB WT cells after a 90 min chase and beyond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g003">Figures 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000605.s003">S3</xref>) and can arise only as a consequence of glycan removal from previously glycosylated RI<sub>332</sub>. Such deglycosylated intermediates are normally rapidly degraded by the proteasome and therefore escape detection, unless the activity of the proteasome is compromised <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-deVirgilio1">[33]</xref>.</p>
<p>Co-expression of the EBV-DUB stabilized RI<sub>332</sub>, but did not do so completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Since dislocation and proteolysis are at least to some extent coupled processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-deVirgilio1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Mancini1">[36]</xref>, we reasoned that some Ub-chains present on ER-derived dislocation substrates might not be accessible to the EBV-DUB. We therefore targeted the viral DUB domain to p97, the “motor of dislocation,” by equipping it with the UBX domain of YOD1 to copy the strategy employed by this cellular DUB. This chimeric protein (UBX-EBV WT) associated with p97 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000605.s004">Figure S4</xref>) and blocked degradation of the ER-derived RI<sub>332</sub> substrate completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, UBX-fusion).</p>
<p>The degradation of two unrelated membrane proteins—the polytopic transmembrane protein insig-1 and the glycosylated α-chain of the T-cell receptor (TCRα) with one transmembrane helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g003">Figure 3E</xref>)—were likewise affected. Expression of UBX-EBV WT halted the turnover of myc-tagged insig-1, an ER-localized transmembrane protein that regulates cholesterol synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Ikeda1">[8]</xref>. Of note, insig-1-myc is not a glycoprotein but has two alternative start codons yielding two translation products with distinct electrophoretic mobilities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Yang1">[37]</xref>. Also the degradation TCRα, an unstable protein when expressed in the absence of other T-cell receptor subunits, was blocked upon co-expression of UBX-EBV WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). In summary, the EBV-DUB arrests turnover of cytosolic and ER-derived proteins. In all cases, targeting of the viral DUB to p97 improved the stabilization of ER-derived substrates, but its activity towards cytosolic substrates of the UPS persisted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g003">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000605.s005">S5</xref>).</p>

<title>Uncoupling Protein Dislocation and Degradation</title>
<p>The occurrence of the deglycosylated RI<sub>332</sub> intermediate that accumulated in UBX-EBV WT and in EBV WT cells (RI<sub>332</sub> –CHO; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) was informative.

The appearance of deglycosylated intermediates was not specific for the ER-luminal RI<sub>332</sub> but was readily observable as well for TCRα when co-expressed with UBX-EBV WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). For reasons that remain to be determined, we consistently observe greater recovery of label for TCRα at later chase points. It is possible that detergent extraction of newly synthesized TCRα is somehow less efficient than material that has left the site of membrane insertion. We do not observe a similar discrepancy for the other substrates analyzed, insig-1 and RI<sub>332</sub>.</p>

<p>We confirmed cytosolic accessibility of the deglycosylated RI<sub>332</sub> intermediate by a proteinase K protection experiment in mechanically disrupted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). In the absence of detergent, only deglycosylated RI<sub>332</sub> (RI332 – CHO) was accessible to protease. The glycosylated, ER-luminal form (RI332 + CHO) was not affected by the protease under identical conditions and serves as an internal control for membrane integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Proteinase K sensitivity of deglycosylated RI<sub>332</sub> implied that a substantial portion of RI<sub>332</sub>, if not RI<sub>332</sub> in its entirety, was exposed to the cytosol in UBX-EBV WT expressing cells. To further corroborate this result, we performed a fractionation experiment in which we made use of the pore-forming toxin Perfringlolysin O (PFO) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Waheed1">[39]</xref>. UBX-EBV WT cells were pulse labeled and the radiolabeled, deglycosylated intermediate of RI<sub>332</sub> was enriched during a 90 min chase period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). After selective permeabilization of the plasmamembrane by PFO, the cytosolic fraction was separated from cellular remnants by centrifugation, in the presence or absence of added high salt to ensure release of peripherally membrane-associated materials. Only for UBX-EBV WT cells did we see release of the deglycosylated RI<sub>332</sub> (RI332 – CHO) into the supernatant fraction (S), even more pronounced in the presence of high salt (S'). However, glycosylated RI<sub>332</sub> (RI332 + CHO) was retained in the pellet fraction under all conditions, consistent with an ER-luminal localization. PFO permeabilization did not damage intracellular compartments, as verified by complete retention of the ER-resident chaperone PDI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) in the particulate fraction.</p>
<p>We conclude that the deglycosylated form of RI<sub>332</sub> was indeed dislocated from the ER and arrived in the cytosol. Combined, our observations show that expression of UBX-EBV WT uncouples dislocation and degradation of RI<sub>332</sub>. We wondered if the deglycosylated intermediate of RI<sub>332</sub> once cytosolic would remain associated with the ER or whether it might travel to a different location. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that RI<sub>332</sub> localized to the ER in UBX-EBV WT expressing cells, with no evidence of obvious aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). In light of the fractionation data, this suggests that upon dislocation, a sizable fraction of deglycosylated RI<sub>332</sub> remains loosely associated with the cytosolic face of the ER-membrane.</p>

<title>A DUB-Catalyzed Reaction Is Essential for Protein Dislocation</title>
<p>We blocked dislocation from the ER by the expression of YOD1 C160S, which causes stabilization of ER resident, glycosylated RI<sub>332</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Ernst1">[11]</xref>. We previously proposed that p97-mediated dislocation is stalled under these conditions, because Ub removal is required to allow threading of the dislocation substrate through p97's central pore <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Ernst1">[11]</xref>. If this interpretation is correct, then it should be possible to reverse this block by expression of a DUB capable of attacking the hypothetical stalled intermediate and to overcome the YOD1 C160S-imposed block. Indeed, co-expression of comparable levels of UBX-EBV WT and YOD1 C160S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g004">Figure 4E</xref>) resulted in the accumulation of the deglycosylated intermediate of RI<sub>332</sub> indicative of dislocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). Co-expression of the inactive mutant UBX-EBV I173W failed to do so, thus excluding simple competition of the UBX-fusion protein with other p97-interactors as the explanation. Consistently, even the non-targeted EBV-DUB without fused UBX-domain could relieve the blockade of dislocation imposed by YOD1 C160S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g004">Figure 4F</xref>).</p>
<p>We conclude that a DUB-catalyzed reaction is essential for protein dislocation from the ER. Because ubiquitylation by HRD1-SEL1L is required for the initial engagement of the cytosolic dislocation apparatus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Vembar1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Mueller1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Christianson1">[40]</xref>, premature removal of ubiquitin might also inhibit the earliest steps in this pathway, if EBV-DUB has access to these ubiquitylated intermediates. The rate of dislocation as determined by the disappearance of glycosylated RI<sub>332</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g003">Figure 3B</xref>; RI332 + CHO) was not affected compared to control cells in EBV-WT expressing cells, but was lower in cells expressing the p97-targeted variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, UBX-fusion; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000605.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Thus, the non-targeted form of the EBV-DUB interfered exclusively with the degradation of already dislocated RI<sub>332</sub>, while the ER-targeted variant stabilized RI<sub>332</sub> at the initiation of dislocation and through prevention of delivery to the proteasome by preemptive removal of poly-Ub chains from the substrate. Nevertheless, both variants, p97-targeted or not, caused accumulation of deglycosylated, dislocated RI<sub>332</sub> in the cytosol.</p>

<title>Staging a Misfolded ER-Derived Glycoprotein on Its Path to Destruction</title>
<p>What keeps the breakdown intermediate(s) of RI<sub>332</sub> from aggregation?

Through interference with dislocation and degradation by different means, we generated discrete intermediates in the breakdown pathway of RI<sub>332</sub> as explained in the preceding sections. Using affinity tagged RI<sub>332</sub> as a bait, we retrieved interacting proteins from UBX-EBV WT, YOD1 C160S, or p97 QQ-expressing (an ATPase-deficient form of p97) cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Ye1">[6]</xref>, and from cells exposed to the proteasome inhibitor ZL3VS or eeyarestatin I, an inhibitor of dislocation and possibly membrane insertion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Wang1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Cross1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Fiebiger1">[42]</xref>. As controls, we performed immunoprecipitations from cells that either did not express RI<sub>332</sub> or that co-expressed RI<sub>332</sub> with YOD1 ΔZnf C160S, YOD1 WT, or UBX-EBV I173W, none of which significantly perturb the dislocation/degradation process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Ernst1">[11]</xref>. We performed a total of nine independent large-scale immunopurifications and analyzed each by LC/MS/MS. We identified 836 candidate interactors and enumerated the number of peptides that originated from each one of them. We sought to identify interactions enriched upon inhibition of dislocation/degradation to gain insight into their spatial and temporal occurrence. We therefore normalized our dataset as follows. Each candidate protein was represented by multiple peptide fragments in different experimental conditions, and the maximum number of peptides (MNOP) for a given candidate was based on the condition that yielded the highest peptide count. All interactions between RI<sub>332</sub> and its candidate interactors (retrieved from independent immunoprecipitation experiments) were expressed as a percentage of the MNOP. Such a normalized interaction matrix should facilitate the identification of groups of proteins that responded similarly if certain discrete steps of the dislocation/degradation pathways are perturbed.</p>

<p>When a protein is terminally misfolded, a family of substrate recognition molecules targets the substrate to the dislocation machinery. A snapshot of this type of intermediate was provided by co-expression of YOD1 C160S or mutant p97 (QQ). Specifically enriched interaction partners of RI<sub>332</sub> under these conditions clustered in group 2 and include glycan-binding and modifying proteins (OS9, UGGT2), general ER-luminal substrate recruiting factors and chaperones (SEL1L, Endoplasmin/GRP94, DNAJC3/P58IPK), p97, and the cytosolic UBR5, implicated in ubiquitylation according to the N-end rule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Ye1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Hirsch2">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Tasaki1">[46]</xref>.

<p>After successful dislocation, misfolded proteins are targeted to the cytosolic proteasome. Group 3 comprised those proteins that were co-immunoprecipitated with RI<sub>332</sub> from UBX-EBV WT or ZL3VS treated cells. Our mass spectrometry data suggested that the deglycosylated intermediate of RI<sub>332</sub> associates with cytosolic chaperones, namely the co-chaperone recruiter BAT3 and the TRiC complex/CCT. The TRiC complex is important for transient stabilization of nascent polypeptide chains prior to their translocation into the ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Leznicki1">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Plath1">[48]</xref>, and BAT3 was recently implicated in integration of tail-anchored proteins into the ER membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Mariappan1">[49]</xref>. Not surprisingly, we can demonstrate an interaction of RI<sub>332</sub> with the proteasome when its activity was blocked by the action of ZL3VS.

<p>The mass spectrometry experiment predicted a strikingly enriched association of PDI/PDIA1 with RI<sub>332</sub>, when cells were treated with eeyarestatin-I. Indeed, we could verify an interaction of these proteins when co-expressed with either YOD1 C160S or p97 QQ or when cells were treated with eeyarestatin-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). More surprisingly, eeyarestatin-I induced the formation of SDS- and β-mercaptoethanol-resistant adducts of PDI. The enrichment of these adducts relative to monomeric PDI in immunoprecipitates of RI<sub>332</sub> was indicative for adduct formation between RI<sub>332</sub> and PDI upon eeyarestatin-I treatment. Similar observations were also made for PDIA3/ERp57 (unpublished data).</p>

<title>A Novel Tool to Block Ubiquitin-Dependent Proteasomal Degradation</title>
<p>The expression of a highly active viral DUB markedly shifts the cellular balance towards deubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g002">Figures 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000605.s001">S1</xref>). Similar to pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome, accelerated or premature Ub removal from substrates should affect their ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Indeed, overexpression of the EBV-DUB blocks the degradation of several model substrates, but without the immediate cytotoxic effects that are commonly observed upon treatment of cells with pharmacological proteasome inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g002">Figure 2C,D</xref>). In view of Ub's role in cell cycle control, through K<sub>11</sub>-linked Ub-chain assembly by the ubiquitin ligase APC/C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Jin1">[50]</xref>, the ultimate demise of cells with an arrested UPS is of course hardly surprising. The greater cytotoxicity of pharmacological inhibition could perhaps be related to ubiquitin-independent functions of the proteasome or reflect the critical importance of free Ub in the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Glickman1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Swaminathan1">[51]</xref>. Interference with the UPS by blocking proteolysis with small molecules or by enzymatic interference with proteasomal targeting are two fundamentally different approaches. Small molecule proteasome inhibitors cause an accumulation of polyubiquitylated proteins and deplete cells of free Ub <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Patrick1">[52]</xref>. Cell viability critically depends on a pool of free Ub and its depletion kills cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Swaminathan1">[51]</xref>. Shifting the cellular balance towards deubiquitylation, as achieved by the EBV-DUB, does not result in accumulation of polyubiquitylated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) and represents a novel means of inhibiting the UPS. Unlike the EBV-DUB, pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome reduces <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis even after relatively short times of exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Ding1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Mazroui1">[31]</xref>. Translation, protein folding, secretion, and dislocation are interdependent processes and the ability to block proteasomal protein degradation without immediately affecting translation provides an additional benefit.</p>

<title>Deubiquitylation Is Essential for Protein Dislocation from the ER</title>
<p>We showed previously that YOD1 C160S causes complete retention of RI<sub>332</sub> in the ER, a substrate otherwise extracted and targeted for degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g007">Figure 7A,B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Ernst1">[11]</xref>. This retention can be reversed at least in part by expression of the p97-targeted EBV-DUB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g004">Figures 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g007">7C</xref>). Combined, these results demonstrate a need for removal of Ub to achieve dislocation. Ramping down the p97-associated DUB activity blocks dislocation but can be rescued by an active DUB. This immediately suggests that DUBs can have opposing functions for the degradation of ER-derived proteins. Some DUBs might impair dislocation by reversing ubiquitylation; others might facilitate dislocation and subsequent degradation. Indeed, TCRα-GFP is stabilized by knockdown of USP13 but destabilized by knockdown of Ataxin-3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Sowa1">[12]</xref>. Moreover, the observed uncoupling of dislocation and degradation by the EBV-DUB suggests that a persistently ubiquitylated state is not essential for the physical extraction of substrate from the ER. Misfolded proteins are escorted to the proteasome by ubiquitin binding proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Elsasser1">[53]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Richly1">[54]</xref>. It is therefore no surprise that the removal of Ub-chains by the EBV-DUB abrogates proteasomal turnover of these proteins. By analogy, p97-mediated extraction would be arrested by the EBV-DUB to a similar extent if persistent substrate modification with Ub-chains were required to exert a mechanical force for such extraction. Indeed, protein dislocation is slowed down, but clearly the reaction continues in cells that express EBV-DUB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g004">Figures 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000605.s003">S3</xref>). Together with the evident requirement of a DUB-catalyzed reaction upstream of p97 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g004">Figure 4E</xref>), these findings suggest that Ub-chains are not required to exert a mechanical force on the dislocation substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Ye2">[7]</xref> but may instead be required only as recognition signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Flierman1">[5]</xref>.</p>

<p>(A) Model of two consecutive ubiquitylation cycles that initiate dislocation and target the substrate to the proteasome, respectively. (B) Expression of catalytically inactive YOD1 C160S impairs deubiquitylation upstream of the p97 AAA ATPase. This jams the central pore of p97 and processive threading of the dislocation substrate is arrested. In consequence, misfolded, glycosylated proteins accumulate in the ER-lumen and as partially dislocated intermediates at the site of dislocation. (C) Expression of the highly active EBV-DUB deubiquitylates misfolded proteins upstream of p97 and thus facilitates processive dislocation mediated by p97. Lack of proper proteasome commitment results in accumulation of a deglycosylated, cytosolic intermediate of the misfolded protein.</p>

<p>Our data are consistent with the following model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g007">Figure 7A</xref>).

Unless p97 is coupled directly to the proteasome, for which there is no firm experimental support at present <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Wang2">[56]</xref>, a second round of ubiquitylation would be required to target the unfolded protein to the proteasome, again necessitating removal of the Ub-chain prior to its insertion into the proteolytic chamber <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Pickart1">[14]</xref>. There is of course also a structural resemblance between the 6-fold symmetrical p97 complex, present in association with Ub-recognizing and -processing factors, and the similarly equipped proteasomal cap complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Elsasser1">[53]</xref>.</p>
<p>The first round of ubiquitylation would be responsible for the engagement and proper assembly of the p97-Ufd1-Npl4 dislocation complex and may involve K<sub>11</sub>-linked ubiquitin chains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Xu1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Alexandru1">[57]</xref>.

Two consecutive rounds of ubiquitylation are conceptually similar to the use of multiple independent ubiquitylation sites on many standard proteasomal substrates: modification of more than a single site on a given substrate requires sequential engagement by a given ligase, or the involvement of more than one ligase.</p>
<p>The p97-targeted EBV-DUB interferes with degradation of ER-derived substrates at two distinct steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). First, it interferes with proper initiation of dislocation by premature removal of ubiquitin. Second, it blocks substrate degradation by removal of the poly-Ub chains that would otherwise have mediated delivery of the misfolded protein to the proteasome. In the absence of a fused UBX-domain, the EBV-DUB affects to a lesser extent the initial stages of dislocation but still strongly inhibits proteasomal proteolysis of cytosolic substrates and ER-derived substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g002">Figures 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g003">3A,B</xref>). The EBV-DUB can even facilitate the dislocation reaction when dislocation is otherwise stalled by expression of YOD1 C160S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g004">Figures 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g007">7B</xref>).</p>
<p>Our data establish the necessity of a DUB-catalyzed reaction upstream of p97-mediated protein extraction from the ER. These observations are most consistent with a model of two consecutive rounds of ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation.</p>

<title>The Natural History of an ER-Luminal Glycoprotein Dislocation Substrate</title>
<p>Using different tools to block protein dislocation and degradation, we identified interacting partners of a misfolded, ER-derived glycoprotein at different stations on its road to destruction. Starting in the ER, eeyarestatin-I was first identified as an inhibitor of dislocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Fiebiger1">[42]</xref>. However, there is no consensus on the identity of its molecular targets or its exact mode of action <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Wang1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Cross1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Wang3">[58]</xref>. Eeyarestatin-I contains two halogenated benzene rings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000605.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Bromobenzene, a hepatotoxic compound, is metabolized to reactive metabolites (e.g. bromobenzene-3,4-oxide) and forms covalent adducts with cellular proteins, including PDIA1, PDIA6, and PDIA3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Koen1">[59]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Lau1">[60]</xref>. Also other halogenated aromatic derivatives covalently modify proteins in a reaction mechanism similar to that involving bromobenzene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Hinson1">[61]</xref>. If the two halogenated benzene rings of eeyarestatin-I would react similarly, formation of covalently cross-linked adducts of PDI might ensue, consistent with our observations that eeyarestatin-I induces SDS-resistant adducts of PDI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). We therefore suggest the possibility that the two halogenated benzene rings of eeyarestatin-I might promote crosslinking of proteins in the ER lumen and that its targets include the machinery for disulfide shuffling. If the machinery for disulfide shuffling in the ER is indeed a molecular target of eeyarestatin-I, then both import into and export from the ER are likely to be affected, explaining the seemingly divergent observations reported for eeyarestatin-I's mechanism of action <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Wang1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Cross1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Fiebiger1">[42]</xref>.</p>
<p>By staging the process of dislocation and degradation we identified several novel and intriguing candidate interactors for the RI<sub>332</sub> dislocation substrate, including proteins important in the maturation of extracellular matrix components (PLOD1, CHPF2, EXT2). Whether the machineries for heparan sulfate synthesis, chondroitin sulfate synthesis, and collagen polymerization merely undergo rapid turnover and are processed via p97 or whether they are otherwise involved in the dislocation reaction remains to be established.</p>
<p>We validated BAT3 as a cytosolic interactor of the deglycosylated intermediate of RI<sub>332</sub>. This result implies not only that RI<sub>332</sub> is dislocated from the ER but also that it remains associated with chaperones, possibly to prevent aggregation. This type of interaction may be an example of how cells cope with dislocated proteins that escape degradation. Could it be that the machineries for translocation and dislocation share certain co-factors? Intriguingly, BAT3 has recently been implicated in proteasomal degradation of newly synthesized defective polypeptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Minami1">[62]</xref>. This might suggest that cytosolic quality control machineries handle defective, ribosome-derived nascent chains similarly to how they deal with defective polypeptides that originate from the ER. The specifically enriched association of the TRiC/CCT with RI<sub>332</sub> in UBX-EBV WT expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000605-g005">Figure 5</xref>) further supports this interpretation: Cytosolic chaperone complexes implicated in the stabilization and quality control of folding intermediates prior to translocation in the ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Leznicki1">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000605-Plath1">[48]</xref> also interact with an ER-derived, dislocated protein.</p>
<p>The approach developed here—expression of the EBV-DUB—stabilizes a range of proteins that are normally degraded in an Ub-dependent manner. Although capable of blocking Ub-dependent protein degradation globally and efficiently, the EBV-DUB is less toxic to cells than pharmacological proteasome inhibitors, providing an extended window of observation. We show that dislocation and degradation of ER-derived misfolded substrates can be uncoupled by the expression of the viral DUB domain and so allows the unprecedented visualization of a deglycosylated dislocation intermediate in the absence of pharmacological proteasome inhibitors. We identify the necessity of a DUB-catalyzed reaction for protein dislocation from the ER and place this activity upstream of p97. The determination of the sets of interacting partners of a misfolded, ER-derived glycoprotein at different stations on its road to destruction helped us characterize the order of events during dislocation and degradation. The expression of this highly active DUB has provided new mechanistic insights into protein quality control. Given its low toxicity and the possibility of achieving cell-type or tissue-specific expression in vivo, the EBV-DUB and variants derived from it may prove to be an attractive alternative to the use of small molecule inhibitors of the proteasome.</p>

<p>EBV-DUB can be targeted to p97 by N-terminal attachment of an UBX domain. (A) 293T cells were transiently transfected with the indicated constructs and homogenized in NP40-containing lysis buffer 24 h after transfection. To control for expression of YOD1 variants and chimeric fusions of the YOD1 UBX-domain to GFP and the EBV-DUB, the lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibodies. Anti-p97 antibodies were used to control for equal loading (two upper panels). Retrieved p97 and Derlin-1 from anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates was detected by immunoblotting with anti-p97 and anti-Derlin-1 antibodies, respectively (lower panels). (B) 293T cells were transiently transfected with the indicated constructs. Cell lysates were prepared as in (A). Retrieved p97 and Derlin-1 in anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates was detected by immunoblotting with anti-p97 and anti-Derlin-1 antibodies, respectively (lower panels). The numbers on the left of individual figures represent the molecular weight standard in kDa.</p>
