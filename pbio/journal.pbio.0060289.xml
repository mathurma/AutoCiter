        <p>The multifunctional signaling protein p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>) is a central regulator and major contributor to the highly invasive nature of malignant gliomas. Here, we show that neurotrophin-dependent regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) of p75<sup>NTR</sup> is required for p75<sup>NTR</sup>-mediated glioma invasion, and identify a previously unnamed process for targeted glioma therapy. Expression of cleavage-resistant chimeras of p75<sup>NTR</sup> or treatment of animals bearing p75<sup>NTR</sup>-positive intracranial tumors with clinically applicable Î³-secretase inhibitors resulted in dramatically decreased glioma invasion and prolonged survival. Importantly, proteolytic processing of p75<sup>NTR</sup> was observed in p75<sup>NTR</sup>-positive patient tumor specimens and brain tumor initiating cells. This work highlights the importance of p75<sup>NTR</sup> as a therapeutic target, suggesting that Î³-secretase inhibitors may have direct clinical application for the treatment of malignant glioma.</p>

          <p>Despite technical advances, clinical prognosis of patients with malignant glioma, with an average survival of less than one year, has not changed. The highly invasive nature of these tumors, together with the recently identified brain tumor-initiating cells, provide disease reservoirs that render these tumors incurable by conventional therapies. Here, we present the first evidence to our knowledge that regulated intramembrane proteolysis of the neurotrophin receptor p75<sup>NTR</sup> is a critical regulator of glioma invasion. Inhibition of this process by clinically relevant Î³-secretase inhibitors dramatically impairs the highly invasive nature of genetically distinct glioblastomas and brain tumor-initiating cells and prolongs survival. These data highlight regulated intramembrane proteolysis as a therapeutic target of malignant glioma and implicate the application of Î³-secretase inhibitors in the treatment of these devastating tumors.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Human malignant glioma (MG) is one of the most common primary central nervous system tumors in adults. These tumors are diffuse, highly invasive, with dismal prognosis, and long-term survivors are rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b002">2</xref>]. MG extend tendrils of tumor several centimeters away from the main tumor mass. These, as well as the recently identified brain tumor-derived stem-like cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b003">3</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b006">6</xref>], herein called brain tumor-initiating cells (BTICs), act as âdisease reservoirs,â rendering these tumors refractory to available treatments such as surgery or radiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b008">8</xref>]. The highly invasive nature of these tumors is the result of genotypic and phenotypic changes that result in the activation of a number of coordinate cellular programs, including those necessary for migration (e.g., motility) and invasion (e.g., extracellular matrix [ECM] degradation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b009">9</xref>] and changes in pathway signaling that impart resistance to conventional treatments by reducing proliferation and increasing resistance to apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b011">11</xref>]. A detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying this invasive behavior is essential for the development of effective therapies.</p>
      <p>Several genes, including those that encode uPA/uPAR, ephrinB3/EphB2, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a disintegrin and metalloproteases (ADAMs), cathepsins, and integrins, have previously been implicated in glioma invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b012">12</xref>]. More recently, gene expression profiling identified several subclasses of gliomas that separate tumors into good and poor prognosis groups of which diffuse infiltrative gliomas are divided into four such subclasses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b013">13</xref>]. One of these four subclasses, designated hierarchical cluster 2B (HC2B), was found to include several genes with specific roles in cell migration and invasion, and membership in this group was found to strongly correlate with poor patient survival. Our understanding of the proteins that initiate, and the pathways that regulate, glioma invasion is continually expanding, such as the recent discovery that CD95 via the activation of the PI3K/Akt/glycogen synthetase kinase (GSK3Î²) pathway regulates glioma invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b014">14</xref>]. However, despite recent advances and efforts to target these specific molecules or pathways, no clinically relevant agents have been identified as yet. Using a discovery-based approach and a series of functional, biochemical, and clinical studies, we have identified the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>) as a critical regulator of glioma invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b015">15</xref>]. We found that p75<sup>NTR</sup>, through a neurotrophin-dependent mechanism, dramatically enhanced migration and invasion of genetically distinct glioma and that robust expression of p75<sup>NTR</sup> was detected in the highly invasive tumor cell population from p75<sup>NTR</sup>-positive glioblastoma patient specimens. In this current study, we investigated the mechanism by which p75<sup>NTR</sup> imparts this highly invasive behavior to malignant glioma, and assessed the use of a clinically applicable agent in abrogating this invasive behavior.</p>
      <p>p75<sup>NTR</sup> elicits a large array of diverse biological responses that are regulated by a complex layer of mechanisms. These intricate layers of control have been proposed to explain the variety of cellular effects triggered by p75<sup>NTR</sup> activation. Key p75<sup>NTR</sup> signaling pathways already identified include Ras homolog gene family, member A (RhoA), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and nuclear factor Îº B (NFkB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b016">16</xref>]. These pathways are believed to be activated by upstream proteins that directly associate with various regions of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> intracellular domain (ICD). These proteins include guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI), ribosome-inactivating protein-2 (RIP-2), and p75<sup>NTR</sup>-associated cell death executor (NADE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b017">17</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b020">20</xref>], which associate with a region referred to as the âdeath domainâ; Schwann cell factor-1 (SC-1); neurotrophin receptor-interacting MAGE homolog (NRAGE); tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF), and neurotrophin receptor interacting factor (NRIF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b021">21</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b023">23</xref>], which associate with the juxtamembrane region of p75<sup>NTR</sup>; and a PDZ-containing protein Fas-associated phosphatease-1 (FAP-1), which associates with the C-terminal Ser-Pro-Val (SPV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b024">24</xref>]. What proteins or biological process are activated by p75<sup>NTR</sup>, however, is highly cell context specific. In addition to associating with other signaling molecules, p75<sup>NTR</sup>, similar to amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch, has been shown to undergo regulated Î±-secretase and Î³-secretase cleavage, referred to as regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP). Cleavage of several type-1 transmembrane receptors has been implicated and shown to be necessary in eliciting some downstream biological responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b025">25</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b028">28</xref>]. Î±-Secretase cleavage of full-length p75<sup>NTR</sup> by a sheddase liberates the extracellular domain (ECD), leaving an unstable membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (CTF) that is cleaved by the Î³-secretase complex to release an ICD with potential signaling capability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b029">29</xref>]. Here, we show for the first time to our knowledge that regulated intramembrane proteolysis of p75<sup>NTR</sup> is a requirement for the highly invasive behavior of p75<sup>NTR</sup>-positive malignant glioma, and designate RIP as a clinical target for the treatment of invasive malignant glioma.</p>

        <title>p75<sup>NTR</sup> Proteolytic Processing Occurs in Patient Specimens Endogenously Expressing p75<sup>NTR</sup></title>
        <p>In a previous study, our laboratory identified p75<sup>NTR</sup> as a potent mediator of invasion in human glioma using a novel invasive glioma mouse model generated by serial in vivo selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b015">15</xref>]. In that study, we found that p75<sup>NTR</sup> was expressed in 22% mid-grade astrocytomas (two of nine) and 85% of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) specimens (17 of 20), and that the p75<sup>NTR</sup>-positive glioma cells in the patient tumor cell population were more migratory than the p75<sup>NTR</sup>-negative glioma cells. Here, we investigate the mechanism underlying this p75<sup>NTR</sup>-induced invasion. In neurons, p75<sup>NTR</sup> is a substrate for sequential Î±- and Î³-secretaseâmediated intramembrane proteolysis generating 24 kDa CTF and 19 kDa ICD fragments, respectively, and the generation of these fragments are required for some of its biological functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b030">30</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b034">34</xref>]. We therefore sought to determine whether intramembrane proteolysis of p75<sup>NTR</sup> occurred in malignant glioma patient specimens. To do this, we assessed whether the generation of the 24-kDa CTF and the 19-kDa ICD occurred in a panel of surgically resected human glioma specimens and normal human brain. Tumor and normal tissue taken at the time of surgery were immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at â80 Â°C. Frozen tumor tissue was digested in lysis buffer and analyzed by western blots using a p75<sup>NTR</sup> cytoplasmic-specific antibody that not only detected the full-length p75<sup>NTR</sup> protein, but also detected p75<sup>NTR</sup>-positive fragments migrating at 24 and 19 kDa, respectively, in the p75<sup>NTR</sup>-positive specimens (eight of nine GBMs and two of five Grade III glioma) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060289-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Hence, p75<sup>NTR</sup> processing occurs in human glioma tumors, and this suggested the possibility that p75<sup>NTR</sup> processing is required for glioma invasion.</p>

            <p>(A) Western blot analysis detected p75<sup>NTR</sup>-positive fragments migrating at 24 and 19 kDa in patient specimens expressing p75<sup>NTR</sup> (eight of nine GBMs, two of five Grade III glioma) but was undetectable in tissue from normal human brain. U87 cells transfected with p75<sup>NTR</sup> and grown in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin (1 Î¼M) were used as a positive control (C). Western blots probed for beta-actin were used as a loading control. Molecular weight markers are indicated on the left.</p>
            <p>(B) The highly invasive glioma cell lines U87R and U251R isolated by serial in vivo selection were treated with the proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin (Epo, 1 Î¼M) and/or the Î³-secretase inhibitor, Compound X (CompX, 2 Î¼M) for 4 h. Western blots for p75<sup>NTR</sup> were probed with an antibody specific to the cytoplasmic domain of p75<sup>NTR</sup> which detects full-length (75 kDa), CTF (indicated by the less than symbol [&lt;]; 25 kDa), and ICD (indicated by the asterisk [*]; 19 kDa) peptides. The ICD is derived from the cleavage of the CTF, which is shown to visibly accumulate in the presence of a Î³-secretase inhibitor.</p>
            <p>(C) p75<sup>NTR</sup> proteolytic processing is a global event in human glioma cells. pcDNA3.1 encoding human p75<sup>NTR</sup> or the empty pcDNA3.1 vector were stably transfected into U87, U251, U118, and U343. Cells expressing p75<sup>NTR</sup> (U87p75, U251p75, U118p75, and U343p75) were treated as described above. Western blot analysis showed that all glioma cell lines tested cleaved the full-length p75<sup>NTR</sup> to generate first the 24-kDa CTF and then the 19-kDa ICD.</p>

        <title>p75<sup>NTR</sup> Is Proteolytically Processed in Invasive Glioma Cells</title>
        <p>To address the possible role(s) of p75<sup>NTR</sup> proteolytic processing in glioma cells, we assessed whether the appearance of the p75<sup>NTR</sup>-positive fragments at 24 and 19 kDa was the result of proteolytic processing of the full-length p75<sup>NTR</sup> in invading glioma cells. We have previously established the highly invasive glioma cell lines U87R and U251R for which p75<sup>NTR</sup> accounts for their invasive behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b015">15</xref>]. The U87R and U251R invasive glioma cells were grown in the absence or presence of the proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin, a compound used to inhibit rapid degradation of proteins often associated with RIP-mediated proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b035">35</xref>]. Western blot analysis showed that in addition to the 75-kDa full-length p75<sup>NTR</sup> protein, 24-kDa and 19-kDa fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060289-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, lane 1 and 5) were present and stabilized in the presence of 1 Î¼M epoxomicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060289-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, lane 2 and 6). These results are in agreement with the model that the full-length p75<sup>NTR</sup> protein is cleaved, releasing the ECD, CTF, and intracellular fragments. Next, we verified that the appearance of the 24-kDa and 19-kDa fragments was the result of sequential cleavage of p75<sup>NTR</sup> by an Î±-secretase and then a Î³-secretase. First, we determined whether treatment of p75<sup>NTR</sup> glioma cells (U87p75<sup>NTR</sup>) using the TNF-Î± protease inhibitor (TAPI)-2, known to inhibit metalloproteases and ADAMs such as tumor necrosis factor-Î± converting enzyme (TACE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b036">36</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b038">38</xref>] and previously shown to inhibit the proteolytic processing of p75<sup>NTR</sup> in neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b039">39</xref>], could inhibit p75<sup>NTR</sup> processing in glioma cells. TAPI-2 inhibited the proteolytic processing of p75<sup>NTR</sup> as indicated by the lack of CTF and ICD, and abrogated p75<sup>NTR</sup>-mediated invasion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060289-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Since TAPI-2 has broad specificity, and glioblastomas are known to produce high levels of many proteases, including members of the MMP, ADAM, and ADAMTS families, leaving the exact identity of the Î±-secretase unclear, we focused our efforts on the second cleavage event. To determine whether the generation of the 19-kDa fragment was the result of cleavage of p75<sup>NTR</sup> by a Î³-secretase, U87R and U251R cells were treated with 2 Î¼M Compound X (Calbiochem), a specific inhibitor of Î³-secretase, for 4 h in the absence or presence of epoxomicin. Western blot analysis of p75<sup>NTR</sup> revealed that in the presence of the Î³-secretase inhibitor, an accumulation of the 24-kDa fragment occurred without subsequent cleavage to the 19-kDa ICD, consistent with the release of the ICD of p75<sup>NTR</sup> by Î³-secretase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060289-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8). The role of processing of p75<sup>NTR</sup> was not limited to a single glioma cell line and was a general mechanism observed in glioma cells established from genetically distinct individuals (U87p75, U251p75, U343p75, and U118p75).We found that in all p75<sup>NTR</sup>-positive glioma cell lines, full-length p75<sup>NTR</sup> was cleaved to generate two fragments of 19 and 24 kDa: ICD and CTF, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060289-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). These results demonstrate that regulated intramembrane proteolysis of p75<sup>NTR</sup> is a global event occurring in highly invasive p75<sup>NTR</sup>-positive human glioma cells.</p>

In contrast, when the proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin was used to stabilize p75<sup>NTR</sup>-ICD, a significant increase in migration and invasion was seen (unpublished data), consistent with increased invasion observed when a cDNA construct mimicking the ICD fragment was ectopically expressed in U87 glioma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060289-g003">Figure 3</xref>Aand 3B). To determine whether Î³-secretase inhibition was confined to glioma invasion or had effects on other biological processes, we assessed the effect of Î³-secretase inhibition on survival and proliferation of p75<sup>NTR</sup>-positive glioma cells. No significant change was observed on either survival or proliferation in vitro (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060289-sg002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

Briefly, cells were seeded in monolayer wells through a cell sedimentation manifold. p75<sup>NTR</sup>-negative U87T, U87pcDNA, U251T, and U251pcDNA cells were used for comparison. Once the sedimentation manifolds were removed, cells were given complete medium containing 2 Î¼M Compound X (CompX). Digital images of the cells were taken before migration at 0 h and then again at 72 h. Best-fit circles were drawn around the area covered by the cells at the 0 h and 72 h time points, and the actual cell area was determined using Axiovision 4.2 imaging software. Quantitative migration scores were calculated as the increase in the area covered by the cells beyond the initial area of the cells.

        <title>Biochemical Characterization of U87 and U251 Glioma Cells Expressing p75<sup>NTR</sup> Wild-Type or Cleavage-Resistant Chimeric p75<sup>NTR</sup> Alleles</title>
        <p>It is well known that Î³-secretase has many substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b041">41</xref>]. To directly test the role of p75<sup>NTR</sup> processing in glioma invasion, we constructed cleavage-resistant chimeric proteins of p75<sup>NTR</sup> by replacing either the transmembrane (<italic>p75FasTM</italic>) or the extracellular stalk domain of p75<sup>NTR</sup> (<italic>p75FasS</italic>) with equivalent domains from the Fas receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b039">39</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060289-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). Both p75<sup>NTR</sup> and Fas receptors are members of the TNF receptor superfamily, and although they each contain similar domains, Fas, unlike p75<sup>NTR</sup>, does not undergo RIP. Since ectopic expression of p75<sup>NTR</sup> in the human glioma cells lines U87 and U251 was sufficient to mediate glioma invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b015">15</xref>], these cell lines were used as a model system to assess the p75<sup>NTR</sup> chimeric mutants. U87 and U251 were therefore stably transfected with the cleavage-resistant p75<sup>NTR</sup> constructs (<italic>p75FasS</italic> and <italic>p75FasTM</italic>). To ensure proper function of all p75<sup>NTR</sup> protein constructs, we assessed their location, topography, and ability to bind neurotrophin in both U87 and U251 glioma cell lines. Receptor orientation and localization at the plasma membrane was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis using a monoclonal antibody specific to the ECD domain of p75<sup>NTR</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060289-sg003">Figure S3</xref>A). As expected, all p75<sup>NTR</sup> constructs were expressed at the plasma membrane with the correct topography. Next, we assessed whether the chimeric constructs could still bind neurotrophin. Previously, we demonstrated that in the absence of p75<sup>NTR</sup>, glioma cells secrete high levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein into the culture medium in vitro. When these same cells express p75<sup>NTR</sup>, the majority of the BDNF is found to be cell associated, presumably bound to p75<sup>NTR</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b015">15</xref>]. To confirm that the p75<sup>NTR</sup> cleavage-resistant chimeric forms retained the ability to bind neurotrophin, ELISA assays were performed to detect BDNF expression in the conditioned medium and total cell lysates of U87 and U251 cells expressing <italic>p75FL</italic>, <italic>p75FasTM</italic>, <italic>p75FasS</italic>, and <italic>p75CRD130</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060289-sg003">Figure S3</xref>B). <italic>p75CRD130</italic> is a neurotrophin-binding mutant created by inserting four amino acids after amino acid residue 130 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b042">42</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b047">47</xref>]. Expression of the chimeric p75<sup>NTR</sup> proteins (<italic>p75FasTM</italic> and <italic>p75FasS</italic>), just like the p75 wild type, resulted in a shift in BDNF localization from the conditioned medium to the cell lysate. This was in contrast to the cells expressing the neurotrophin-binding mutant (<italic>p75CRD130</italic>) or the empty vector (pcDNA) where the bulk of BDNF was detected in the culture medium. These data demonstrate that p75<sup> NTR</sup> cleavage-resistant chimeric constructs <italic>p75FasTM</italic> and <italic>p75FasS</italic> retained their ability to bind neurotrophin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060289-sg003">Figure S3</xref>C). Once we confirmed the correct expression and binding of the various p75<sup>NTR</sup> constructs, western blots using a p75<sup>NTR</sup> cytoplasmic domain-specific antibody were performed to evaluate proteolytic processing of the various p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060289-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). In cells expressing <italic>p75FasS</italic>, only the full-length protein was detected, consistent with inhibition of the Î±-secretase cleavage, whereas the full-length 75 kDa and the 24-kDa fragment were detected in cells expressing the <italic>p75FasTM</italic> construct corresponding to the ectodomain shedding of p75<sup>NTR</sup> by Î±-secretase but with inhibition of the Î³-secretase cleavage. Moreover, in the presence of epoxomicin, no additional p75<sup>NTR</sup> fragments were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060289-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). These results demonstrate the cleavage-resistant chimeric p75<sup>NTR</sup> alleles were expressed with correct biochemical characteristics in U87 and U251 glioma cells. In addition, and consistent with the hypothesis that proteolytic processing of p75<sup>NTR</sup> is required for glioma invasion, only the full-length 75 kDa band was detected in lysates from U87 cells expressing <italic>p75CRD130</italic>, a p75<sup>NTR</sup> construct that was unable to induce glioma invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b015">15</xref>].</p>

            <p>(C) U87 cells stably expressing p75<sup>NTR</sup> or the cleavage-resistant <italic>p75FasS</italic> and <italic>p75FasTM</italic> were implanted into the brains of SCID mice and allowed to grow for 28 d.

Implantation of U87 glioma cells stably transfected with the empty pcDNA vector or p75<sup>NTR</sup> cleavage-resistant chimeras (<italic>p75FasTM</italic> and <italic>p75FasS</italic>), led to the formation of well-circumscribed tumors.

        <p>To determine whether p75<sup>NTR</sup> processing was required for glioma invasion in vivo, U87 glioma cell lines ectopically expressing <italic>p75FasS</italic> and <italic>p75FasTM</italic> were implanted into the brains of immunocompromised (SCID) mice. U87 glioma cells expressing full-length p75<sup>NTR</sup> (U87p75) or control vector (U87pcDNA) were used for comparison. Twenty-eight days after implantation, the mice were sacrificed, and frozen brain sections were stained with antibodies against human nuclei, to visualize all glioma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060289-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, upper panel) or with anti-human p75<sup>NTR</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060289-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, bottom panel). Implantation of U87 glioma cells stably transfected with the control pcDNA vector led to the formation of well-circumscribed tumors, while U87 glioma cells ectopically expressing p75<sup>NTR</sup> formed tumors with highly infiltrative edges. In sharp contrast to the p75<sup>NTR</sup>-expressing U87 tumors, tumors expressing either <italic>p75FasTM</italic> or <italic>p75FasS</italic> formed well-circumscribed tumors similar to the p75<sup>NTR</sup>-negative tumors (U87pcDNA). Comparable results were seen in three independent experiments. In conjunction with the in vitro data, these data suggest that proteolytic processing of p75<sup>NTR</sup> is required for glioma invasion in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060289-g004">Figure 4</xref>C).</p>
        <p>It is well known that the microenvironment of tumors can change the biochemical characterization and function of cells. We have demonstrated in vitro that glioma cells expressing p75<sup>NTR</sup> undergo proteolytic processing to generate first the 24-kDa CTF and then the 19-kDa ICD. To provide evidence that RIP of p75<sup>NTR</sup> occurs in vivo, 7â9-Î¼m cryosections from mice implanted for 3â4 wk with in vivoâselected U87R and U251R, or ectopically expressing p75<sup>NTR</sup>, <italic>p75FasS</italic>, <italic>p75FasTM</italic>, and pcDNA, were assessed for p75<sup>NTR</sup> processing by western blot. The 24- and 19-kDa fragments were found in the highly invasive glioma cells, U87R, U251R, and U87p75<sup>NTR</sup>. In contrast, neither the 24-kDa nor the 19-kDa fragment was seen in cells expressing <italic>p75FasS</italic>, and as expected, only the 24-kDa fragment was detected in cells expressing the <italic>p75FasTM</italic>, consistent with their in vitro characterization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060289-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). These data further support a role for RIP of p75<sup>NTR</sup> in glioma invasion.</p>

        <title>p75<sup>NTR</sup> Proteolytic Processing Occurs in BTICs from Patient Specimens That Endogenously Express p75<sup>NTR</sup></title>
        <p>Our data demonstrated that 85% of GBM specimens (17/20) express p75<sup>NTR</sup>, that the p75<sup>NTR</sup>-positive glioma cells in the original patient tumor cell population were more migratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b015">15</xref>], and that 24- and 19-kDa p75<sup>NTR</sup>-positive fragments are present in p75<sup>NTR</sup>-positive primary Grade III and GBM patient specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060289-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We therefore wanted to determine whether the appearance of these fragments in the malignant glioma patient specimens was the result of intramembrane proteolysis of p75<sup>NTR</sup>. To do this, we established primary cultures from human glioma patient tumors. The recent discovery that human stem cell-like tumor cells, termed BTICs, retain characteristics that closely recapitulate the original patient tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b003">3</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b049">49</xref>] prompted us to establish the primary patient tumor cultures under neural stem cellâpromoting conditions. BTICs share characteristics with neural stem cells (NSCs) such as continuous self-renewal, extensive brain parenchymal migration and infiltration, and potential for full or partial differentiation, properties not found in established glioma cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b051">51</xref>]. Operative samples of human GBM were obtained at the time of surgery, and brain tumor sphere cultures were established in NS-A basal medium plus epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (EF medium). Immunocytochemical analysis of BTICs established from five glioma patients expressed the early neural cell progenitor proteins Nestin, Musashi, hSox2, and CD133 (J. J. P. Kelly, S. Weiss, P. A. Forsyth, and D. L. Senger; unpublished data). In addition, four out of five glioma tumor progenitor cells in vitro expressed high levels of p75<sup>NTR</sup> as detected by immunocytochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060289-g005">Figure 5</xref>A) and western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060289-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). To determine whether p75<sup>NTR</sup> expressed on the BTICs undergoes RIP, BTICs were grown in the absence and presence of Î³-secretase and/or 2 Î¼M epoxomicin. Similar to the glioma cell lines, full-length p75<sup>NTR</sup>, CTF, and ICD were detected, and the 19-kDa ICD fragment was dependent on Î³-secretase cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060289-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). We next determined whether the BTICs retained their expression of p75<sup>NTR</sup> in vivo: BTIC cells were implanted into the brains of SCID mice and allowed to establish for 4â8 wk. Animals were sacrificed, and frozen sections were stained with either an anti-human nuclear antibody (to identify the human BTICs) or anti-p75<sup>NTR</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060289-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). All tumors established from BTICs cells showed highly infiltrative tumors, and consistent with the in vitro data, four out of five tumors showed high expression of p75<sup>NTR</sup> in vivo.</p>

Using an intracranial glioma model, we assessed the therapeutic potential of Î³-secretase inhibitors. Parallel experiments were performed using the genetically distinct U87p75<sup>NTR</sup> and U251p75<sup>NTR</sup> glioma cell lines and the p75<sup>NTR</sup>-positive BTICs established from a patient GBM. Cells were implanted intracerebrally into SCID mice; and 3 d after implantation for U87p75<sup>NTR</sup> and U251p75<sup>NTR</sup> or 5 d after for BTICs, mice were administered subcutaneously (s.c.) either 10 mg/kg Î³-secretase inhibitor or vehicle control (corn oil) once/day for 2â3 wk (three to five mice/group). Tumors were allowed to grow for a total of 4â6 wk, at which time, all animals were sacrificed, their brains removed, frozen in O.C.T. compound, and sectioned. Immunohistochemical staining of the frozen brain sections for anti-human nuclei (unpublished data) or p75<sup>NTR</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060289-g006">Figure 6</xref>Aâ<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060289-g006">6</xref>C) showed that animals implanted with U87p75<sup>NTR</sup>-, U251p75<sup>NTR</sup>-, or p75<sup>NTR</sup>-positive BTICs formed tumors with highly infiltrative edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060289-g006">Figure 6</xref>Aâ<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060289-g006">6</xref>C; upper panels). In sharp contrast, animals implanted with U87p75<sup>NTR</sup>-, U251p75<sup>NTR</sup>-, or p75<sup>NTR</sup>-positive BTICs and given the Î³-secretase inhibitor DAPT developed localized tumors with highly demarcated edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060289-g006">Figure 6</xref>Aâ<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060289-g006">6</xref>C; lower panels). These results strongly suggested Î³-secretase inhibition that results in blocking the generation of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> ICD substantially inhibited the invasive ability of glioma cells in vivo. To establish whether the effects of the Î³-secretase inhibition were confined to glioma invasion or had consequences on other biological functions, we assessed the effect of Î³-secretase inhibition on glioma cell proliferation in vivo and found no significant change (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060289-sg005">Figure S5</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The p75<sup>NTR</sup> signaling cascade is a complex signaling axis that depends on numerous factors, including cellular context and specific protein interactions that influence biological outcomes to regulated intramembranous proteolysis of p75<sup>NTR</sup>. For example, a recent report showed that in primary cultures of cerebellar neurons, p75<sup>NTR</sup> ectodomain shedding and subsequent Î³-cleavage is necessary for the growth inhibitory signal of myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b033">33</xref>]. Conversely, in retinal ganglion cells, neurotrophin-induced activation of p75<sup>NTR</sup> was shown to promote neurite growth in a RIP-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b066">66</xref>]. Ligand-dependent induction of p75<sup>NTR</sup> cleavage has also been reported in other cell systems, including sympathetic neurons and glial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b034">34</xref>]. Similarly, we have shown that glioma migration is neurotrophin dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b015">15</xref>] and that this neurotrophin-induced invasion is dependent on RIP of p75<sup>NTR</sup>.</p>
      <p>To assess the role of RIP in p75<sup>NTR</sup>-mediated glioma invasion, we used a pharmacological and molecular approach both in vitro and in vivo to demonstrate that (1) p75<sup>NTR</sup> proteolytic processing occurs in glioma cell lines, surgically resected tumor specimens, and BTICs isolated from patient specimens; (2) cleavage-resistant alleles of p75<sup>NTR</sup> are insufficient to mediate glioma invasion; and (3) pharmacological inhibition with a clinically applicable Î³-secretase inhibitor results in a dramatic decrease of glioma invasion both in vitro and in vivo and significantly prolonged survival of animals bearing p75<sup>NTR</sup>-positive intracranial tumors. Together, these data highlight the potential of using pharmacological inhibition to interfere with RIP as a therapeutic intervention for highly infiltrative p75<sup>NTR</sup>-positive gliomas.</p>
      <p>One of the initial steps in regulating RIP is the shedding of the ECD by an Î±-secretase. This shedding event is required for subsequent cleavage of the CTF to generate an ICD. In order to show that both of these proteolytic events were important in the processing of p75<sup>NTR</sup>, we made a series of chimeric molecules with the Fas receptor, a related family member that does not generate CTF and ICD fragments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b067">67</xref>]. The means by which the ECD is shed from the full-length p75<sup>NTR</sup> protein and what its biological role is are not fully understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b068">68</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b070">70</xref>]. Glioma cells are known to express many proteases, including serine, cysteine, and metalloproteinases that are involved in invasion and tumor progression. The ADAM metalloproteinase disintegrins, including ADAM17 and ADAM10, have been described as prominent sheddases for p75<sup>NTR</sup> as well as other transmembrane type-1 receptors such as APP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b071">71</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b073">73</xref>], with recent in vivo evidence establishing a correlation with glioma invasion and an increase in ADAM17 under hypoxic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b074">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b075">75</xref>]. The use of inhibitors targeting these proteinases may thus result in preventing RIP of p75<sup>NTR</sup>. Here, we have shown that the broad-range metalloproteinase inhibitor TAPI-2 was able to prevent both proteolytic processing of p75<sup>NTR</sup> in glioma and p75<sup>NTR</sup>-mediated invasion. Although a possible therapeutic strategy for highly invasive p75<sup>NTR</sup>-positive tumors, previous clinical attempts to inhibit the protease-rich environment of tumors using broad-spectrum MMP inhibitors have so far proven to be ineffective as anti-cancer agents, with phase II and III trials failing to show efficacy or survival benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b076">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b077">77</xref>]. The reason for this lack of efficacy may result in part from the fact that glioblastomas produce high levels of proteases, many of which have been suggested to help facilitate tumor cell survival and invasiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b074">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b078">78</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b083">83</xref>]. Attempts, therefore, to inhibit the ectodomain shedding of p75<sup>NTR</sup> in a clinical setting may prove difficult.</p>
      <p>The second proteolytic event with possible direct therapeutic importance is mediated by the Î³-secretase complex, which is composed of several proteins including presenilin, nicastrin, APH-1, and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN-2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b084">84</xref>]. This protein complex is known to be essential in the normal processing of amyloid Î²-peptides from Î²-APP. Abnormal accumulation of amyloid Î²-peptides with the formation of plaques is believed to be the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. Given the connection between Alzheimer disease and Î³-secretase, there has been great interest in developing compounds that can inhibit this protein complex with some of these compounds already in phase II/III clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b085">85</xref>]. The exact molecular mechanism(s) by which the ICD fragment of p75<sup>NTR</sup> exerts the invasive behavior of glioma cells is unknown. As is the case with the Notch signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b086">86</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b087">87</xref>], there have been recent studies to suggest that the ICD fragment can translocate to the nucleus, but whether it acts as part of a transcriptional complex is unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b030">30</xref>]. In addition, myelin-associated glycoprotein binding to cerebellar neurons induces Î±- and Î³-secretase proteolytic cleavage of p75<sup>NTR</sup>, and the resulting ICD fragment is necessary for both the activation of the small molecular weight GTPase, RhoA, and inhibition of neurite outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b033">33</xref>]. Whether these processes or others are regulated by the p75<sup>NTR</sup> ICD fragment in glioma cells remains to be determined.</p>
      <p>In our present study, we show that neurotrophin-induced p75<sup>NTR</sup> proteolytic processing is required for p75<sup>NTR</sup>-mediated glioma invasion in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, daily administration of the Î³-secretase inhibitor DAPT to animals bearing p75<sup>NTR</sup>-postive intracranial tumors significantly prolonged survival. These results are intriguing and support the possible clinical application of Î³-secretase inhibitors for the treatment of these deadly tumors. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that we are inhibiting the processing of other proteins that may be involved in glioma invasion since Î³-secretase is known to mediate the proteolytic processing of several transmembrane proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b052">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b057">57</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b061">61</xref>]. The biochemical evidence presented here, however, supports the hypothesis that the anti-invasive effect of Î³-secretase inhibition is at least in part the result of inhibition of p75<sup>NTR</sup> RIP. Moreover, the fact that we did not observe any significant effects on proliferation or survival of the human glioma cells in vivo suggests that the dominant mechanism of activity is the inhibition of p75<sup>NTR</sup>-mediated glioma invasion.</p>
      <p>Excitingly, we also found that a large percentage (four out of five) BTICs from primary glioma patient tissue express high levels of p75<sup>NTR</sup>. This rare population of cells with stem-like properties and the ability to repopulate the tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b003">3</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b006">6</xref>] have been shown to be resistant to our current therapies (radiation and temozolomide) and thus may represent a âdisease reservoirâ for these devastating tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b088">88</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b089">89</xref>]. Unlike the U87 parental cells, these cells are highly invasive in vivo, and treatment with a Î³-secretase inhibitor dramatically blocked their invasive nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060289-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Several recent studies have demonstrated strong similarities between BTICs and neural stem and progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b090">90</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b091">91</xref>]. However, whether human glioblastoma stem cells arise from mutated neural stem cells or a more mature cell type that acquires self-renewal capacity remains to be determined. Interestingly, a small population of cells (0.3%) within the stem cell niche of the adult rat subventricular zone has neurosphere-forming capacity, express p75<sup>NTR</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b092">92</xref>], and appear to be maintained from birth through adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b093">93</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b095">95</xref>]. In addition, the more migratory p75<sup>NTR</sup> glioma cell population in clinical glioblastoma patient specimens also represents a small percentage of the main tumor mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b015">15</xref>]. It is intriguing to note that glioma cells that express high levels of p75<sup>NTR</sup> seem to possess many characteristics of BTICs, including self-renewal, extensive brain parenchymal migration, and potential for differentiation (J. J. P. Kelly and S. Weiss, unpublished data). Whether p75<sup>NTR</sup> is an early brain tumor stem cell marker, at least for some GBMs, remains to be determined.</p>
      <p>In a previous study, we postulated that p75<sup>NTR</sup> itself may be a valid target for the treatment of glioma, and now we propose that abrogation of the cellular processing of p75<sup>NTR</sup> represents an additional therapeutic target. Although these inhibitors may have application in malignant glioma, they may have an even broader application for cancer, as p75<sup>NTR</sup> has also been implicated in other cancers, including melanoma, specifically the more aggressive melanomas that metastasize to the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b096">96</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060289-b098">98</xref>]. Thereby, therapies that target the processing of p75<sup>NTR</sup> may also be beneficial for other metastatic cancers.</p>

At 3 wk for animals bearing U87p75<sup>NTR</sup> tumors or 4 wk for animals bearing BTIC tumors, animals were sacrificed, the brains were removed, frozen in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound, and cryosectioned into 7â9-Î¼m sections. The cryosections were used for tumor immunohistochemistry staining and for assessment of in vivo p75<sup>NTR</sup> cleavage. For survival studies (eight animals per group), U87p75<sup>NTR</sup> glioma cells were implanted intracerebrally into SCID mice. Animals were given daily s.c. injections of 10 mg/kg Î³-secretase inhibitor DAPT or vehicle (corn oil) alone, once/day beginning on day 3. Animals were followed until sacrifice was required.</p>

          <p>(A) A total of 7.5 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> U87p75 or U87pcDNA cells were plated in collagen III-coated six-well plates and treated with either normal growth medium or medium supplemented with TAPI-2 at 20 Î¼M overnight. Western blots for p75<sup>NTR</sup> were probed with an antibody specific to the cytoplasmic domain of p75<sup>NTR</sup>, which detects full-length (75 kDa), CTF (indicated by the less than symbol [&lt;]; 25 kDa) and ICD (indicated by an asterisk [*]; 19 kDa) peptides. In cell lysates from U87p75 glioma cells, peptides corresponding to the full-length, CTF, and ICD fragments were detected, whereas only the full-length p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptor was detected in cells treated with TAPI-2.</p>
          <p>(B) A total of 5 Ã 10<sup>4</sup> U87p75 or U87pcDNA cells were plated into the upper chambers of Transwell plates coated with brain-like matrix (collagen III with plasma fibronectin, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, and laminins added as minor components). The cells were treated with either normal growth medium, or medium supplemented with 20 Î¼M TAPI-2 for 4 h. Cells were fix/stained with 1% crystal violet in ethanol, and the cells on the under side of the membrane (migrated cells) were counted by light microscopy (<italic>n</italic> = 7; double asterisks [**] indicate <italic>p</italic> = 0.019).</p>

          <p>(A) Expression and topography of the full-length, chimeric constructs (<italic>p75FasTM</italic> and <italic>p75FasS</italic>) and the neurotrophin-binding mutant <italic>p75CRD130</italic> at the plasma membrane were confirmed by flow cytometric analysis using a p75<sup>NTR</sup> extracellular domain-specific antibody. U87pcDNA and U251pcDNA glioma cells were used as controls.</p>
          <p>(BâD) The p75<sup>NTR</sup> cleavage-resistant constructs retain their ability to bind ligand (C and D). Conditioned medium (B) and total cell lysates (C) from U87 and U251 cells expressing full-length p75, <italic>p75FasTM</italic>, <italic>p75FasS</italic>, and <italic>p75CRD130</italic> were analyzed by ELISA for their ability to bind BDNF. The p75<sup>NTR</sup>-negative U87pcDNA and U251pcDNA were used for comparison. Expression of p75<sup>NTR</sup> full-length or the cleavage-resistant chimeric proteins (<italic>p75FasTM</italic> and <italic>p75FasS</italic>) produced a shift in BDNF localization from the conditioned medium to the cell lysate, consistent with the binding of BDNF to p75<sup>NTR</sup>. In contrast, cells expressing the ligand-binding mutant <italic>p75CRD130</italic> did not produce a shift in BDNF localization in accordance with the in ability to bind ligand. Values shown are the mean Â± standard error of the mean (s.e.m.) for a single experiment. Similar results were seen in three independent experiments; triple asterisks (âââ) indicate <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 as compared to pcDNA control for each cell line (one-way ANOVA with the Neuman-Keuls post-test).</p>

Three days (U87p75<sup>NTR</sup> and U251p75<sup>NTR</sup>) or 5 d (BTIC) later, mice were administered s.c. 10 mg/kg Î³-secretase inhibitor DAPT or vehicle (corn oil) alone, once/day for 2â3 wk (three to five mice/group). Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected into the tumor-bearing mice 24 h prior to their sacrifice. Frozen brain sections were stained with an antibody against BrdU and counterstained with toluidine blue to visualize the cell nucleus. Cells that had divided during the 24 h prior to sacrifice stained positively for BrdU, and the percentage of BrdU-positive cells were counted. Bar graph represents the percentage of BrdU-positive cells in five consecutive fields. The Î³-secretase inhibitor DAPT had no significant effect on proliferation in vivo of the p75<sup>NTR</sup>-glioma cells as compared to their untreated controls.</p>
