Current modeling approaches, such as constraint-based flux-balance analysis, have proved highly successful in analyzing the capabilities of cellular metabolism, including its capacity to predict deletion phenotypes, the ability to calculate the relative flux values of metabolic reactions, and the capability to identify properties of optimal growth states. Here, we use flux-balance analysis to thoroughly assess the activity of <italic>Escherichia coli, Helicobacter pylori,</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> metabolism in 30,000 diverse simulated environments. We identify a set of metabolic reactions forming a connected metabolic core that carry non-zero fluxes under all growth conditions, and whose flux variations are highly correlated. Furthermore, we find that the enzymes catalyzing the core reactions display a considerably higher fraction of phenotypic essentiality and evolutionary conservation than those catalyzing noncore reactions. Cellular metabolism is characterized by a large number of species-specific conditionally active reactions organized around an evolutionary conserved, but always active, metabolic core. Finally, we find that most current antibiotics interfering with bacterial metabolism target the core enzymes, indicating that our findings may have important implications for antimicrobial drug-target discovery.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Although cellular metabolism is among the most investigated cellular functions, it is not well understood how it changes and adapts on a systems level in response to environmental variations.

Recent analyses also indicate that the deletion phenotype of a substantial subset of metabolic enzymes is growth-condition-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b006">6</xref>], arguing for a selective use of metabolic reactions in distinct environments.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>To thoroughly examine the utilization and relative flux rates of each metabolic reaction in a wide range of simulated environmental conditions, we sampled 30,000 randomly and uniformly chosen optimal growth conditions, as well as all single-carbon-source minimal medium conditions sufficient for growth, using FBA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b002">2</xref>] on the reconstructed metabolic networks of <italic>Helicobacter pylori, Escherichia coli,</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b009">9</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). We found that when assuming optimal growth of the three microorganisms, their metabolism adapts to environmental changes through two distinct mechanisms. The more common mechanism is flux plasticity, involving changes in the fluxes of already active reactions when the organism is shifted from one growth condition to another. For example, changing from glucose- to succinate-rich media alters the flux of 264 <italic>E. coli</italic> reactions by more than 20%. Less commonly, environmental changes can also induce structural plasticity, resulting in changes in the metabolism's active wiring diagram, turning on previously zero-flux reactions and inhibiting previously active pathways. For example, when shifting <italic>E. coli</italic> cells from glucose- to succinate-rich media, 11 previously active reactions are turned off completely, while nine previously inactive reactions are turned on.</p><p>The two types of response mechanisms described by flux and structural plasticity imply the possible existence of a group of reactions that are not subject to structural plasticity, being active under all environmental conditions. Indeed, some metabolic reactions were found to carry non-zero fluxes in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> under nine different growth conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b006">6</xref>]. In itself, however, this finding is compatible with a scenario in which the active reactions are randomly distributed: if typically a <italic>q</italic> fraction of the metabolic reactions are active under a specific growth condition, for <italic>n</italic> distinct conditions one can predict a non-zero overlap encompassing at least <italic>q<sup>n</sup></italic> fraction of the reactions. Indeed, we find that as we increase the number of inspected conditions, <italic>n,</italic> the number of reactions carrying non-zero flux in each condition decreases rapidly. However, it eventually saturates at a constant value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010068-g001">Figure 1</xref>A–C), identifying a group of reactions that have non-zero flux under <italic>all</italic> 30,000 simulated growth conditions. Specifically, we find that in 138 of 381 <italic>H. pylori</italic> (36.2%), 90 of 758 <italic>E. coli</italic> (11.9%), and 33 of 1,172 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (2.8%), metabolic reactions are always active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010068-g001">Figure 1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010068-g001">1</xref>E). While these reactions respond to environmental changes only through flux-based plasticity, the rest of the reactions are only conditionally active, being turned on only in specific growth conditions and thus being subject to both structural- and flux-based plasticity.</p><fig id="pcbi-0010068-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010068.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The Emergence of the Metabolic Core</title><p>(A–C) The average relative size of the number of reactions that are always active as a function of the number of sampled conditions (black line) for (A) <italic>H. pylori,</italic> (B) <italic>E. coli,</italic> and (C) <italic>S. cerevisiae.</italic> As the number of conditions increases, the curve converges to a constant denoted by the dashed line, identifying the metabolic core of an organism.

In case of the inactivation of the second type, alternative sub-optimal pathways can be used to ensure cellular survival. Interestingly, in the compact core of <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> all 33 reactions were predicted to be indispensable for biomass formation under all growth conditions. Moreover, when assuming a 10% reduction in the growth rate (compared to optimal growth), the size and identity of the <italic>E. coli</italic> metabolic core remains largely unchanged, retaining 83 of the original 90 reactions, of which two are nonessential. This indicates that the concept of the metabolic core is valid under both optimal and suboptimal growth, although with some difference in the identity of individual reactions. Of note, the metabolic core represents a subset of the minimal reaction sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b011">11</xref>] and the overlap of alternative (i.e., degenerate) minimal reaction sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b005">5</xref>]. The minimal reaction set of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b011">11</xref>] contains the metabolic core in addition, however, to reactions necessary for the sustained growth on any chosen substrate, whereas the minimal reaction set of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b005">5</xref>] consists of the 201 reactions that are always active in <italic>E. coli</italic> for all 136 aerobic and anaerobic single-carbon-source minimal environments capable of sustaining optimal growth. The latter finding is in excellent agreement with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010068-g001">Figure 1</xref>B (upper curve), and demonstrates that the analysis of a low number of growth conditions will significantly overestimate the set of reactions that are always active.</p><p>To identify some of the factors that determine the size of the metabolic core, we note that the number of core metabolic reactions systematically decreases as we move from <italic>H. pylori</italic> to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010068-g003">Figures 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010068-g001">1</xref>E), the relative size of the core decreasing from 36.2% of all reactions in <italic>H. pylori</italic> to 11.9% in <italic>E. coli</italic> and 2.8% in <italic>S. cerevisiae.</italic> This trend can be explained as a collective network effect: the relatively small size of the <italic>H. pylori</italic> metabolic network leaves little flexibility for biomass production, requiring the continuous activity of a high fraction of the available metabolic reactions. Indeed, we find that on average approximately 61% of the <italic>H. pylori</italic> reactions are active in a given environmental condition. The larger number of metabolic reactions present in <italic>E. coli</italic> offers a higher degree of metabolic flexibility, allowing for a significant fraction of the biomass to be produced by alternative pathways. Indeed, the average utilization of the <italic>E. coli</italic> metabolic network in a given growth condition is only 35.3%. For <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> whose metabolic network size significantly exceeds that of both <italic>H. pylori</italic> and <italic>E. coli,</italic> there is an even higher metabolic flexibility, and the activity of only 19.7% of the reactions are required in a typical environment.</p><fig id="pcbi-0010068-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010068.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Characterizing the Metabolic Cores</title><p>(A) The number of overlapping metabolic reactions in the metabolic core of <italic>H. pylori, E. coli,</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae.</italic></p><p>(B) The fraction of metabolic reactions catalyzed by essential enzymes in the cores (black) and outside the core in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae.</italic></p><p>(C) The distribution of average metabolic fluxes for the core and the noncore reactions in <italic>E. coli.</italic></p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010068.g003" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>The fact that the core reactions are active under all investigated environmental conditions suggests that they must play a key role in maintaining the metabolism's overall functional integrity. Therefore, the absence of individual reactions that are part of the metabolic core may lead to significant metabolic disruptions. Indeed, using genome-scale deletion-phenotype data obtained in rich growth media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b013">13</xref>], we find that 74.7% of those <italic>E. coli</italic> enzymes that catalyze core metabolic reactions (i.e., core enzymes) are essential, compared with a 19.6% lethality fraction characterizing the noncore enzymes. The gap between the core and noncore enzymes is also significant for <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> for which essential enzymes catalyze 84% of the core reactions, whereas the average essentiality of the conditionally active enzymes is only 15.6% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010068-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). Note that the likelihood of a random concentration of so many essential enzymes in the core is extremely small, with <italic>p</italic>-values of 3.3e<sup>−23</sup> and 9.0e<sup>−13</sup> for <italic>E. coli</italic> and yeast, respectively, even if we presume the presence of errors in the deletion-phenotype data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0010068-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that an organism's ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions rests, to a large extent, on the continuous activity of the metabolic core, regardless of the environmental conditions.</p><p>Intuitively, one could assume that the core represents a subset of high-flux reactions characterizing the activity of metabolic networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b003">3</xref>]. However, our measurements indicate that, on average, the fluxes of the core and noncore reactions are highly comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010068-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). Alternatively, we could also assume that the main biological role of the metabolic core is to ensure the continuous production of biomass under all growth conditions. In contrast, we find that 20 out of the 51 metabolites (39%) considered necessary for biomass production in <italic>E. coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b008">8</xref>] are not produced by any of the core reactions; instead—in a growth-condition-dependent fashion—they are produced by various alternative metabolic pathways. The core, however, contains a large number of reactions for selected anabolic pathways, including those of membrane lipid-, cell envelope-, and peptidoglycan-biosynthesis pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0010068-st001">Table S1</xref>). These core reactions represent network bottlenecks, being the only paths for the synthesis of certain biomass components. Therefore, it appears that the composition of the metabolic core is determined by two factors. First, those metabolic reactions that directly contribute to biomass production tend to be part of the metabolic core of the organism. Second, however, this tendency is offset by network-induced redundancy: reactions or pathways whose end-products can be synthesized by at least two alternative pathways show environmental redundancy and structural plasticity, and are thus eliminated from the core. Therefore, the more reactions a metabolic network possesses (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010068-g001">Figure 1</xref>D), the stronger is the network-induced redundancy, and the smaller is the core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010068-g001">Figure 1</xref>E).</p><p>Given the important functional role played by the metabolic core in a given organism, one would expect significant parts of the core to be conserved in different organisms. Indeed, the <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>H. pylori</italic> cores have 63 reactions in common, and 18 of the 33 core reactions in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> are present in both the <italic>E. coli</italic> and the <italic>H. pylori</italic> metabolic cores (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010068-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Also, when considering enzyme orthologs among 32 divergent bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b013">13</xref>], we find that the metabolic core enzymes of <italic>E. coli</italic> display a high degree of evolutionary conservation, the average core enzyme having orthologs in 71.7% of the reference bacteria (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 1e<sup>−6</sup>). In contrast, the conditionally active noncore enzymes have an evolutionary retention of only 47.7% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b013">13</xref>]. Given the observed correlation between evolutionary retention and the essentiality of gene products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b013">13</xref>], this difference may be a simple consequence of the high-lethality fraction of the core enzymes. However, further analysis indicates that this is not the case: random selection of 90 enzymes with a 74.7% lethality ratio has an average evolutionary retention of only 63.4%. Taken together, these results indicate that major portions of the metabolic core have been conserved, displaying a higher evolutionary retention than the individual essentiality of its participating enzymes would indicate, suggesting that maintaining the core's integrity is a collective need of the organism.</p><p>The requirement for the continuous activity of the core reactions may well also impact the regulation of its catalytic enzymes. We would expect that the activity of core reactions—for which only the flux magnitude needs to be modulated—should display a higher degree of stability and a different regulatory control than the reactions outside of the core. Evidence for such regulatory effects is provided by two measurements. First, we inspected the experimentally determined mRNA half-lives of the <italic>E. coli</italic> metabolic enzymes when cells were grown in Luria-Bertani medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b014">14</xref>]. We found that the distribution of mRNA half-life times for the core enzymes displays a shift to higher values, with the average half-life time of their mRNAs being 14.0 min compared with 10.5 min for the noncore mRNAs (<italic>p</italic> = 0.016). Furthermore, only 2% of the core enzymes have corresponding mRNA half-life times shorter than 5 min, compared to 23% for the ones catalyzing conditionally active noncore reactions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Therefore, the continuous metabolic need for these reactions has apparently affected the mechanisms responsible for mRNA decay of their catalytic enzymes, providing a higher dynamic inertia under environmental changes.</p><p>Additionally, for each enzyme-encoding operon, we counted the number of activating and repressive regulatory links in the <italic>E. coli</italic> transcriptional regulatory network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b016">16</xref>]. As regulatory interactions are currently known for only 13 of the core enzyme-encoding operons, we considered the extended core, representing the set of 234 reactions that are active in more than 90% of the 30,000 simulated growth conditions. The results indicate that the fraction of repressive regulatory links in the extended core is 52.3%, while the fraction of activating interactions is only 35.7%, and the remaining 12% represents regulatory links that can either activate or suppress the enzyme's mRNA synthesis rate. In contrast, for noncore enzyme-encoding operons, there is no difference between the fraction of activating and repressing links, both representing 45% of the regulatory interactions. These results offer evidence for the co-evolution of the core metabolic network and its corresponding regulatory network: given the requirement for the continuously active nonredundant core, regulatory mechanisms have shifted both the mRNA decay rate and the nature of the regulatory interactions, offering a higher regulatory stability for the core enzymes.</p><p>The finding that the core reactions form a single cluster would suggest that the activity of the participating reactions is highly synchronized, with changes in the flux of one reaction affecting the flux of other reactions as well. Thus, we should be able to discover the core by inspecting the correlations between the activities of all metabolic reactions. To test this hypothesis, we calculated the flux correlation coefficient, <italic>C<sub>ij</sub>,</italic> for each reaction pair in the <italic>E. coli</italic> metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b017">17</xref>] by inspecting the flux values of all reactions under each of the 30,000 simulated growth conditions. Using the <italic>C<sub>ij</sub></italic> matrix as the metric of a hierarchical clustering algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b018">18</xref>], we observed the emergence of a group of reactions whose fluxes change simultaneously under environmental shifts. Interestingly, these highly correlated reactions significantly overlap with the metabolic core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010068-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), indicating that when the environmental conditions are altered, the fluxes of the core reactions are increased or decreased in a synchronized fashion.</p><fig id="pcbi-0010068-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010068.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Correlations among <italic>E. coli</italic> Metabolic Reactions</title><p>(A) We calculated the Pearson correlation using flux values from 30,000 conditions for each reaction pair before grouping the reactions according to a hierarchical average-linkage clustering algorithm.

Calculating the correlations between core and noncore enzymes using their corresponding mRNA copy number data (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) for 41 experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b019">19</xref>], we find that the correlations among mRNA copy numbers of the core enzymes are systematically higher than the observed correlations among their noncore counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010068-g004">Figure 4</xref>B), with an average correlation of &lt;C&gt; = 0.23 for core enzymes and &lt;C&gt; = 0.07 for noncore enzymes (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 1e<sup>−4</sup>). Notably, this finding is different from the average correlation of mRNA expression found in 66 “correlated reaction sets” (groups of between two and nine reactions that are turned on and off together), where the frequency with which a correlated reaction set is used does not affect its mRNA correlation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b005">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Previous studies have firmly established that environmental changes induce flux plasticity, altering the flux levels of individual reactions (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b020">20</xref>]). Similarly, the fact that metabolism displays structural plasticity, turning on and off some reactions as the growth conditions are altered, has been observed before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b006">6</xref>]. However, our demonstration of a group of reactions predicted to be active in all environmental conditions and forming a connected metabolic core could substantially improve our understanding of the organization and utilization of metabolic networks. The emergence of the core represents a collective network effect, channeling the production of some indispensable biomass components to a few key reactions that cannot be replaced by alternative pathways under any environmental conditions. The collective origin of the core is supported by the observed changes in the core size. While the number of biomass components that the metabolism needs to produce is comparable in the three organisms (49 for <italic>H. pylori,</italic> 51 for <italic>E. coli,</italic> and 44 for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>), the number of metabolic reactions contributing to them differs. The larger size of a metabolic network significantly increases its capacity and redundancy, decreasing the size of the metabolic core. Therefore, the metabolic core contains reactions that are necessary for optimal cellular performance regardless of the environmental conditions, while the conditionally active metabolic reactions represent the different ways in which the cell is capable of optimally utilizing substrates from its environment.</p><p>The identification of the metabolic core also has important practical implications: given the continuous activity and high degree of essentiality of the core enzymes, they represent potential targets for antimicrobial intervention. Specifically, while many bacterial and yeast gene products are essential, a high fraction of them are essential only in specific environments. For example, recent measurements indicate that 76% of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genes that are inactive in nutrient-rich conditions are in fact not only active, but are also essential in some other growth conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b006">6</xref>]. However, an effective antimicrobial drug needs to be able to kill its target organism under all physiological conditions in which it can exist. Thus pharmacological interventions targeting a specific pathway will not be effective in environments where the pathway is not needed and its corresponding enzyme is turned off. Instead, the most effective antimicrobials must target the activity of the core reactions, as their disruption will have an impact on the microorganism's ability to function under all environmental conditions. Indeed, among the currently used antibiotics, fosfomycin and cycloserine act by inhibiting cell-wall peptidoglycan, while sulfonamides and trimethoprim inhibit tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis, both pathways being present in the <italic>H. pylori</italic> as well as the <italic>E. coli</italic> core (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010068-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In addition, core pathways involved in the synthesis of flavin adenine dinucleotide, 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-octonate, and lipopolysaccharide are among potential antibiotic targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b021">21</xref>].</p><p>This indicates that the core enzymes essential for biomass formation, both for optimal and suboptimal growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0010068-st001">Table S1</xref>), may prove effective antibiotic targets given the cell's need to maintain the activity of these enzymes in all conditions. The fact that not all such core reactions are shared by all bacteria offers the possibility to identify bacterium-specific drug targets. Finally, our results pertaining to the existence of the core and its characteristics are by no means limited to the three studied organisms, but the analysis can be carried over to all organisms for which high-quality metabolic reconstructions are available. Given the large number of sequenced bacterial genomes, such studies could open up new avenues for rapid in silico antimicrobial drug-target identification.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>FBA.</title><p>Starting from the published stoichiometric matrices of the reconstructed <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655, <italic>H. pylori,</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> metabolic networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010068-b009">9</xref>], the steady-state concentrations of all the internal metabolites of an organism satisfy</p><disp-formula id="pcbi-0010068-e001"><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010068.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><!-- <mml:math display='block'><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo stretchy='false'>&lsqb;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy='false'>&rsqb;</mml:mo><mml:mo>&equals;</mml:mo><mml:mstyle displaystyle='true'><mml:munder><mml:mo>&sum;</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:munder><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>&nu;</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle><mml:mo>&equals;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math> --></disp-formula><p>where <italic>S<sub>ij</sub></italic> is the stoichiometric coefficient of metabolite <italic>A<sub>i</sub></italic> in reaction <italic>j,</italic> and ν<italic><sub>j</sub></italic> is the flux of reaction <italic>j</italic>.

Each reaction is subsequently tagged as either active (non-zero flux) or inactive (zero flux). Since there are a very large number of possible combinations of the selected uptake rates, we repeat this process 30,000 times.
