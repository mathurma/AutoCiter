        <p>The world's oceans contain a complex mixture of micro-organisms that are for the most
          part, uncharacterized both genetically and biochemically. We report here a metagenomic
          study of the marine planktonic microbiota in which surface (mostly marine) water samples
          were analyzed as part of the <italic>Sorcerer II</italic> Global Ocean Sampling
          expedition. These samples, collected across a several-thousand km transect from the North
          Atlantic through the Panama Canal and ending in the South Pacific yielded an extensive
          dataset consisting of 7.7 million sequencing reads (6.3 billion bp). Though a few major
          microbial clades dominate the planktonic marine niche, the dataset contains great
          diversity with 85% of the assembled sequence and 57% of the unassembled data being unique
          at a 98% sequence identity cutoff. Using the metadata associated with each sample and
          sequencing library, we developed new comparative genomic and assembly methods. One
          comparative genomic method, termed “fragment recruitment,” addressed questions of genome
          structure, evolution, and taxonomic or phylogenetic diversity, as well as the biochemical
          diversity of genes and gene families. A second method, termed “extreme assembly,” made
          possible the assembly and reconstruction of large segments of abundant but clearly
          nonclonal organisms. Within all abundant populations analyzed, we found extensive
          intra-ribotype diversity in several forms: (1) extensive sequence variation within
          orthologous regions throughout a given genome; despite coverage of individual ribotypes
          approaching 500-fold, most individual sequencing reads are unique; (2) numerous changes in
          gene content some with direct adaptive implications; and (3) hypervariable genomic islands
          that are too variable to assemble. The intra-ribotype diversity is organized into
          genetically isolated populations that have overlapping but independent distributions,
          implying distinct environmental preference. We present novel methods for measuring the
          genomic similarity between metagenomic samples and show how they may be grouped into
          several community types. Specific functional adaptations can be identified both within
          individual ribotypes and across the entire community, including proteorhodopsin spectral
          tuning and the presence or absence of the phosphate-binding gene

          <p>Marine microbes remain elusive and mysterious, even though they are the most abundant
            life form in the ocean, form the base of the marine food web, and drive energy and
            nutrient cycling. We know so little about the vast majority of microbes because only a
            small percentage can be cultivated and studied in the lab. Here we report on the Global
            Ocean Sampling expedition, an environmental metagenomics project that aims to shed light
            on the role of marine microbes by sequencing their DNA without first needing to isolate
            individual organisms. A total of 41 different samples were taken from a wide variety of
            aquatic habitats collected over 8,000 km. The resulting 7.7 million sequencing reads
            provide an unprecedented look at the incredible diversity and heterogeneity in naturally
            occurring microbial populations. We have developed new bioinformatic methods to
            reconstitute large portions of both cultured and uncultured microbial genomes. Organism
            diversity is analyzed in relation to sampling locations and environmental pressures.
            Taken together, these data and analyses serve as a foundation for greatly expanding our
            understanding of individual microbial lineages and their evolution, the nature of marine
            microbial communities, and how they are impacted by and impact our world.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The concept of microbial diversity is not well defined. It can either refer to the genetic
        (taxonomic or phylogenetic) diversity as commonly measured by molecular genetics methods, or
        to the biochemical (physiological) diversity measured in the laboratory with pure or mixed
        cultures. However, we know surprisingly little about either the genetic or biochemical
        diversity of the microbial world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b001">1</xref>],
        in part because so few microbes have been grown under laboratory conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b003">3</xref>], and also because it is likely that there are immense
        numbers of low abundance ribotypes that have not been detected using molecular methods
          [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b004">4</xref>]. Our understanding of microbial
        physiological and biochemical diversity has come from studying the less than 1% of organisms
        that can be maintained in enrichments or cultivated, while our understanding of phylogenetic
        diversity has come from the application of molecular techniques that are limited in terms of
        identifying low-abundance members of the communities.</p>
      <p>Historically, there was little distinction between genetic and biochemical diversity
        because our understanding of genetic diversity was based on the study of cultivated
        microbes. Biochemical diversity, along with a few morphological features, was used to
        establish genetic diversity via an approach called numerical taxonomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b006">6</xref>].
        In recent years the situation has dramatically changed. The determination of genetic
        diversity has relied almost entirely on the use of gene amplification via PCR to conduct
        taxonomic environmental gene surveys. This approach requires the presence of slowly
        evolving, highly conserved genes that are found in otherwise very diverse organisms. For
        example, the gene encoding the small ribosomal subunit RNA, known as 16S, based on
        sedimentation coefficient, is most often used for distinguishing bacterial and archaeal
        species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b010">10</xref>]. The 16S rRNA sequences are highly conserved and can be
        used as a phylogenetic marker to classify organisms and place them in evolutionary context.
        Organisms whose 16S sequences are at least 97% identical are commonly considered to be the
        same ribotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b011">11</xref>], otherwise referred
        to as species, operational taxonomic units, or phylotypes.</p>
      <p>Although rRNA-based analysis has revolutionized our view of genetic diversity, and has
        allowed the analysis of a large part of the uncultivated majority, it has been less useful
        in predicting biochemical diversity. Furthermore, the relationship between genetic and
        biochemical diversity, even for cultivated microbes, is not always predictable or clear. For
        instance, organisms that have very similar ribotypes (97% or greater homology) may have vast
        differences in physiology, biochemistry, and genome content. For example, the gene
        complement of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Escherichia
          coli</named-content> O157:H7 was found to be substantially different from the K12 strain
        of the same species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b012">12</xref>].</p>
      <p>In this paper, we report the results of the first phase of the <italic>Sorcerer II</italic>
        Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) expedition, a metagenomic study designed to address questions
        related to genetic and biochemical microbial diversity. This survey was inspired by the
        British Challenger expedition that took place from 1872–1876, in which the diversity of
        macroscopic marine life was documented from dredged bottom samples approximately every 200
        miles on a circumnavigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b015">15</xref>]. Through the substantial dataset
        described here, we identified 60 highly abundant ribotypes associated with the open ocean
        and aquatic samples. Despite this relative lack of diversity in ribotype content, we confirm
        and expand upon previous observations that there is tremendous within-ribotype diversity in
        marine microbial populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b017">17</xref>]. New techniques and
        tools were developed to make use of the sampling and sequencing metadata. These tools
        include: (1) the fragment recruitment tool for performing and visualizing comparative
        genomic analyses when a reference sequence is available; (2) new assembly techniques that
        use metadata to produce assemblies for uncultivated abundant microbial taxa; and (3) a whole
        metagenome comparison tool to compare entire samples at arbitrary degrees of genetic
        divergence. Although there is tremendous diversity within cultivated and uncultivated
        microbes alike, this diversity is organized into phylogenetically distinct groups we refer
        to as subtypes.</p>
      <p>Subtypes can occupy similar environments yet remain genetically isolated from each other,
        suggesting that they are adapted for different environmental conditions or roles within the
        community. The variation between and within subtypes consists primarily of nucleotide
        polymorphisms but includes numerous small insertions, deletions, and hypervariable segments.
        Examination of the GOS data in these terms sheds light on patterns of evolution and also
        suggests approaches towards improving the assembly of complex metagenomic datasets. At least
        some of this variation can be associated with functional characters that are a direct
        response to the environment. More than 6.1 million proteins, including thousands of new
        protein families, have been annotated from this dataset (described in the accompanying paper
          [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b018">18</xref>]). In combination, these papers
        bring us closer to reconciling the genetic and biochemical disconnect and to understanding
        the marine microbial community.</p>
      <p>We describe a metagenomic dataset generated from the <italic>Sorcerer II</italic>
        expedition. The GOS dataset, which includes and extends our previously published Sargasso
        Sea dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b019">19</xref>], now encompasses a
        total of 41 aquatic, largely marine locations, constituting the largest metagenomic dataset
        yet produced with a total of ~7.7 million sequencing reads. In the pilot Sargasso Sea study,
        200 l surface seawater was filtered to isolate microorganisms for metagenomic analysis. DNA
        was isolated from the collected organisms, and genome shotgun sequencing methods were used
        to identify more than 1.2 million new genes, providing evidence for substantial microbial
        taxonomic diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b019">19</xref>]. Several
        hundred new and diverse examples of the proteorhodopsin family of light-harvesting genes
        were identified, documenting their extensive abundance and pointing to a possible important
        role in energy metabolism under low-nutrient conditions. However, substantial sequence
        diversity resulted in only limited genome assembly. These results generated many additional
        questions: would the same organisms exist everywhere in the ocean, leading to improved
        assembly as sequence coverage increased; what was the global extent of gene and gene family
        diversity, and can we begin to exhaust it with a large but achievable amount of sequencing;
        how do regions of the ocean differ from one another; and how are different environmental
        pressures reflected in organisms and communities? In this paper we attempt to address these
        issues.</p>

        <p>Several size fractions were isolated for every site (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Total DNA was extracted from one or more fractions,
          mostly from the 0.1–0.8-μm size range. This fraction is dominated by bacteria, whose
          compact genomes are particularly suitable for shotgun sequencing. Random-insert clone
          libraries were constructed. Depending on the uniqueness of each sampling site and initial
          estimates of the genetic diversity, between 44,000 and 420,000 clones per sample were
          end-sequenced to generate mated sequencing reads. In all, the combined dataset includes
          6.25 Gbp of sequence data from 41 different locations. Many of the clone libraries were
          constructed with a small insert size (&lt;2 kbp) to maximize cloning efficiency. As
          this often resulted in mated sequencing reads that overlapped one another, overlapping
          mated reads were combined, yielding a total of ~6.4 M contiguous sequences, totaling ~5.9
          Gbp of nonredundant sequence. Taken together, this is the largest collection of
          metagenomic sequences to date, providing more than a 5-fold increase over the dataset
          produced from the Sargasso Sea pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b019">19</xref>] and more than a 90-fold increase over the other large marine metagenomic
          dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b020">20</xref>].</p>

        <title>Assembly</title>
        <p>Assembling genomic data into larger contigs and scaffolds, especially metagenomic data,
          can be extremely valuable, as it places individual sequencing reads into a greater genomic
          context. A largely contiguous sequence links genes into operons, but also permits the
          investigation of larger biochemical and/or physiological pathways, and also connects
          otherwise-anonymous sequences with highly studied “taxonomic markers” such as 16S or
            <italic>recA,</italic> thus clearly identifying the taxonomic group with which they are
          associated. The primary assembly of the combined GOS dataset was performed using the
          Celera Assembler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b021">21</xref>] with
          modifications as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b019">19</xref>] and as given in Materials and Methods. The assembly was performed with quite
          stringent criteria, beginning with an overlap cutoff of 98% identity to reduce the
          potential for artifacts (e.g., chimeric assemblies or consensus sequences diverging
          substantially from the genome of any given cell). This assembly was the substrate for
          annotation (see the accompanying paper by Yooseph et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b018">18</xref>]).</p>
        <p>The degree of assembly of a metagenomic sample provides an indication of the diversity of
          the sample. A few substantial assemblies notwithstanding, the primary assembly was
          strikingly fragmented (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050077-t002">Table 2</xref>).
          Only 9% of sequencing reads went into scaffolds longer than 10 kbp. A majority (53%) of
          the sequencing reads remained unassembled singletons. Scaffolds containing more than 50 kb
          of consensus sequence totaled 20.7 Mbp; of these, &gt;75% were produced from a single
          Sargasso Sea sample and correspond to the <italic>Burkholderia</italic> or
            <italic>Shewanella</italic> assemblies described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b019">19</xref>]. These results highlight the unusual abundance of
          these two organisms in a single sample, which significantly affected our expectations
          regarding the current dataset. Given the large size of the combined dataset and the
          substantial amount of sequencing performed on individual filters, the overall lack of
          assembly provides evidence of a high degree of diversity in surface planktonic
          communities. To put this in context, suppose there were a clonal organism that made up 1%
          of our data, or ~60 Mbp. Even a genome of 10 Mbp—enormous by bacterial standards—would be
          covered ~6-fold. Such data might theoretically assemble with an average contig approaching
          50 kb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b022">22</xref>]. While real assemblies
          generally fall short of theory for various reasons, <italic>Shewanella</italic> data make
          up &lt;1% of the total GOS dataset, and yet most of the relevant reads assemble into
          scaffolds &gt;50 kb. Thus, with few scaffolds of significant length, we could conclude
          that there are very few clonal organisms present at even 1% in the GOS dataset.</p>

        <p>To investigate the nature of the implied diversity and to see whether greater assembly
          could be achieved, we explored several alternative approaches. Breaks in the primary
          assembly resulted from two factors: incomplete sequence coverage and conflicts in the
          data. Conflicts can break assemblies when there is no consistent way to chain together all
          overlapping sequencing reads. As it was possible that there would be fewer conflicts
          within a single sample (i.e., that diversity within a single sample would be lower),
          assemblies were attempted with individual samples. However, the results did not show any
          systematic improvements even in those samples with greater coverage (unpublished data).
          Upon manual inspection, most assembly-breaking conflicts were found to be local in nature.
          These observations suggested that reducing the degree of sequence identity required for
          assembly could ameliorate both factors limiting assembly: effective coverage would
          increase and many minor conflicts would be resolved.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, we produced a series of assemblies based on 98%, 94%, 90%, 85%, and 80%
          identity overlaps for two subsets of the GOS dataset, again using the Celera Assembler.
          Assembly lengths increased as the overlap cutoff decreased from 98% to 94% to 90%, and
          then leveled off or even dropped as stringency was reduced below 90% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050077-t003">Table 3</xref>). Although larger assemblies
          could be generated using lower identity overlaps, significant numbers of overlaps
          satisfying the chosen percent identity cutoff still went unused in each assembly. This is
          consistent with a high rate of conflicting overlaps and in turn diagnostic of significant
          polymorphism.</p>

        <p>In mammalian sequencing projects the use of larger insert libraries is critical to
          producing larger assemblies because of their ability to span repeats or local polymorphic
          regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b023">23</xref>]. The shotgun sequencing
          libraries from the GOS filters were typically constructed from inserts shorter than 2 kb.
          Longer plasmid libraries were attempted but were much less stable. We obtained paired-end
          sequences from 21,419 fosmid clones (average insert size, 36 kb; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b025">25</xref>]) from the 0.1-micron fraction of GS-33. The effect of these long mate pairs
          on the GS-33 assembly was quite dramatic, particularly at high stringency (e.g., improving
          the largest scaffold from 70 kb to 1,247 kb and the largest contig from 70 kb to 427 kb).
          At least for GS-33 this suggests that many of the polymorphisms affect small, localized
          regions of the genome that can be spanned using larger inserts. This degree of improvement
          may be greater than what could be expected in general, as the diversity of GS-33 is by far
          the lowest of any of the currently sequenced GOS samples, yet it clearly indicates the
          utility of including larger insert libraries for assembly.</p>

        <title>Fragment Recruitment</title>
        <p>In the absence of substantial assembly, direct comparison of the GOS sequencing data to
          the genomes of sequenced microbes is an alternative way of providing context, and also
          allows for exploration of genetic variation and diversity. A large and growing set of
          microbial genomes are available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information
          (NCBI; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>). At the time of this study,
          we used 334 finished and 250 draft microbial genomes as references for comparison with the
          GOS sequencing reads. Comparisons were carried out in nucleotide-space using the sequence
          alignment tool BLAST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b026">26</xref>]. BLAST
          parameters were designed to be extremely lenient so as to detect even distant similarities
          (as low as 55% identity). A large proportion of the GOS reads, 70% in all, aligned to one
          or more genomes under these conditions. However, many of the alignments were of low
          identity and used only a portion of the entire read. Such low-quality hits may reflect
          distant evolutionary relationships, and therefore less information is gained based on the
          context of the alignment. More stringent criteria could be imposed requiring that the
          reads be aligned over nearly their entire length without any large gaps. Using this
          stringent criterion only about 30% of the reads aligned to any of the 584 reference
          genomes. We refer to these fully aligned reads as “recruited reads.” Recruited reads are
          far more likely to be from microbes closely related to the reference sequence (same
          species) than are partial alignments. Despite the large number of microbial genomes
          currently available, including a large number of marine microbes, these results indicate
          that a substantial majority of GOS reads cannot be specifically related to available
          microbial genomes.</p>
        <p>The amount and distribution of reads recruited to any given genome provides an indication
          of the abundance of closely related organisms. Only genomes from the five bacterial genera
            <italic>Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, Pelagibacter, Shewanella,</italic> and
            <italic>Burkholderia</italic> yielded substantial and uniform recruitment of GOS
          fragments over most of a reference genome (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050077-t004">Table 4</xref>). These genera include multiple reference genomes, and we observed
          significant differences in recruitment patterns even between organisms belonging to the
          same species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g002">Figure 2</xref>A–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g002">2</xref>I). Three genera,

          roughly 50% of all the recruited reads (though only ~15% of all GOS sequencing reads). By
          contrast, although every genome tested recruited some GOS reads, most recruited only a
          small number, and these reads clustered at lower identity to locations corresponding to
          large highly conserved genes (for typical examples see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g002">Figure 2</xref>E–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g002">2</xref>F). We refer to this pattern as nonspecific recruitment as it reflects
          taxonomically nonspecific signals, with the reads in question often recruiting to
          distantly related sets of genomes. Most microbial genomes, including many of the marine
          microbes (e.g., the ubiquitous genus <italic>Vibrio</italic>), demonstrated this
          nonspecific pattern of recruitment.</p>

        <p>The relationship between the similarity of an individual sequencing read to a given
          genome and the sample from which the read was isolated can provide insight into the
          structure, evolution, and geographic distribution of microbial populations. These
          relationships were assessed by constructing a “percent identity plot” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b027">27</xref>] in which the alignment of a read to a
          reference sequence is shown as a bar whose horizontal position indicates location on the
          reference and whose vertical position indicates the percent identity of the alignment. We
          colored the plotted reads according to the samples to which they belonged, thus indirectly
          representing various forms of metadata (geographic, environmental, and laboratory
          variables). We refer to these plots that incorporate metadata as fragment recruitment
          plots. Fragment recruitment plots of GOS sequences recruited to the entire genomes of

        <p>Characteristic patterns of recruitment emerged from each of these abundant marine
          microbes consisting of horizontal bands made up of large numbers of GOS reads. These bands
          seem constrained to a relatively narrow range of identities that tile continuously (or at
          least uniformly, in the case when abundance/coverage is lower) along ~90% of the reference
          sequence. The uninterrupted tiling indicates that environmental genomes are largely
          syntenic with the reference genomes. Multiple bands, distinguished by degree of similarity
          to the reference and by sample makeup, may arise on a single reference (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050077-sd001">Poster S1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050077-sd001">S1</xref>F). Each of these
          bands appears to represent a distinct, closely related population we refer to as a
          subtype. In some cases, an abundant subtype is highly similar to the reference genome, as
          is the case for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P.
            marinus</named-content> MIT9312 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050077-sd001">Poster S1</xref>) and <italic>Synechococcus</italic> RS9917

          produce complex often overlapping bands in the plots. Though the recruitment patterns can
          be quite complex they are also remarkably consistent over much of the reference genome. In
          these more complicated recruitment plots, such as the one for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. ubique</named-content> HTCC1062,
          individual bands can show sudden shifts in identity or disappear altogether, producing a
          gap in recruitment that appears to be specific to that band (see <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. ubique</named-content> recruitment
          plots on <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050077-sd001">Poster

          indicates that separate bands are indeed evolutionarily distinct at randomly selected
          locations along the genome.</p>
        <p>The amount of sequence variation within a given band cannot be reliably determined from
          the fragment recruitment plots themselves. To examine this variation, we produced multiple
          sequence alignments and phylogenies of reads that recruited to several randomly chosen
          intervals along given reference genomes to show that there can be considerable
          within-subtype variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g003">Figure
            3</xref>A–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g003">3</xref>B). For example, within
          the primary band found in recruitment plots to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. marinus</named-content> MIT9312, individual pairs of overlapping
          reads typically differ on average between 3%–5% at the nucleotide level (depending on
          exact location in the genome). Very few reads that recruited to MIT9312 have perfect
          (mismatch-free) overlaps with any other read or to MIT9312, despite ~100-fold coverage.
          While many of these differences are silent (i.e., do not change amino acid sequences),
          there is still considerable variation at the protein level (unpublished data). The amount
          of variation within subtypes is so great that it is likely that no two sequenced cells
          contained identical genomes.</p>

        <title>Identifying Genomic Structural Variation with Metagenomic Data</title>
        <p>Variation in genome structure in the form of rearrangements, duplications, insertions, or
          deletions of stretches of DNA can also be explored via fragment recruitment. The use of
          mated sequencing reads (pairs of reads from opposite ends of a clone insert) provides a
          powerful tool for assessing structural differences between the reference and the
          environmental sequences. The cloning and sequencing process determines the orientation and
          approximate distance between two mated sequencing reads. Genomic structural variation can
          be inferred when these are at odds with the way in which the reads are recruited to a
          reference sequence. Relative location and orientation of mated sequences provide a form of
          metadata that can be used to color-code a fragment recruitment plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g004">Figure 4</xref>). This makes it possible to visually identify
          and classify structural differences and similarities between the reference and the
          environmental sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g005">Figure 5</xref>).
          For the abundant marine microbes, a high proportion of mated reads in the “good” category
          (i.e., in the proper orientation and at the correct distance) show that synteny is
          conserved for a large portion of the microbial population. The strongest signals of
          structural differences typically reflect a variant specific to the reference genome and
          not found in the environmental data. In conjunction with the requirement that reads be
          recruited over their entire length without interruption, recruitment plots result in
          pronounced recruitment gaps at locations where there is a break in synteny. Other
          rearrangements can be partially present or penetrant in the environmental data and thus
          may not generate obvious recruitment gaps. However, given sufficient coverage, breaks in
          synteny should be clearly identifiable using the recruitment metadata based on the
          presence of “missing” mates (i.e., the mated sequencing read that was recruited but whose
          mate failed to recruit; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The
          ratio of missing mates to “good” mates determines how penetrant the rearrangement is in
          the environmental population.</p>

            <title>Categories of Recruitment Metadata</title>
            <p>The recruitment metadata distinguishes eight different general categories based on
              the relative placement of paired end sequencing reads (mated reads) when recruited to
              a reference sequence in comparison to their known orientation and separation on the
              clone from which they were derived. Assuming orientation is correct, two mated reads
              can be recruited closer together, further apart, or within expected distances given
              the size of the clone from which the sequences were derived. These sequences are
              categorized as “short,” “long,” or “good,” respectively. Alternately, the mated reads
              may be recruited in a mis-oriented fashion, which trumps issues of separation. These
              reads can be categorized as “normal,” “anti-normal,” or “outie.” In addition, there
              are two other categories. “No mate” indicates that no mated read was available for
              recruitment, possibly due to sequencing error. Perhaps most useful of any of the
              recruitment categories, “missing” mates indicate that while a mated sequence was
              available, it was not recruited to the reference. “Missing” mates identify breaks in
              synteny between the environmental data and the reference sequence.</p>

            <title>Fragment Recruitment at Sites of Rearrangements</title>
            <p>Environmental sequences recruited near breaks in synteny have characteristic patterns
              of recruitment metadata. Indeed, each of five basic rearrangements (i.e., insertion,
              deletion, translocation, inversion, and inverted translocation) produced a distinct
              pattern when examining the recruitment metadata. Here, example recruitment plots for
              each type of rearrangement have been artificially generated. The “good” and “no mate”
              categories have been suppressed. In each case, breaks in synteny are marked by the
              presence of stacks of “missing” mate reads. The presence or absence of other
              categories distinguishes each type of rearrangement from the others.</p>

        <p>In theory, all genome structure variations that are large enough to prevent recruitment
          can be detected, and all such rearrangements will be associated with missing mates.
          Depending on the type of rearrangement present other recruitment metadata categories will
          be present near the rearrangements' endpoints. This makes it possible to distinguish among
          insertions, deletions, translocations, inversions, and inverted translocations directly
          from the recruitment plots. Examples of the patterns associated with different
          rearrangements are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g005">Figure
            5</xref>. This provides a rapid and easy visual method for exploring structural
          variation between natural populations and sequenced representatives (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050077-sd001">Poster S1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050077-sd001">S1</xref>B).</p>

        <title>Genomic Structural Variation in Abundant Marine Microbes</title>
        <p>Variation in genome structure potentially results in functional differences. Of
          particular interest are those differences between sequenced (reference) microbes and
          environmental populations. These differences can indicate how representative a cultivated
          microbe might be and shed light on the evolutionary forces driving change in microbial
          populations. Fragment recruitment in conjunction with the mate metadata helped us to
          identify both the consistent and the rare structural differences between the genomes of
          microbial populations in the GOS data and their closest sequenced relatives. Our analysis
          has thus far been confined to the three microbial genera that were widespread in the GOS
          dataset as represented by the finished genomes of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. marinus</named-content> MIT9312,
            <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P.
            ubique</named-content> HTCC1062, and to a lesser extent <italic>Synechococcus</italic>
          WH8102. Each of these genomes is characterized by large and small segments where little or
          no fragment recruitment took place. We refer to these segments as “gaps.” These gaps
          represent reference-specific differences that are not found in the environmental
          populations rather than a cloning bias that identifies genes or gene segments that are
          toxic or unclonable in <italic>E. coli.</italic> The presence of missing mates flanking
          these gaps indicates that the associated clones do exist, and therefore that cloning
          issues are not a viable explanation for the absence of recruited reads. Although the
          reference-specific differences are quite apparent due to the recruitment gaps they
          generate, there are also sporadic rearrangements associated with single clones, mostly
          resulting from small insertions or deletions.</p>
        <p>Careful examination of the unrecruited mates of the reads flanking the gaps allowed us to
          identify, characterize, and quantify specific differences between the reference genome and
          their environmental relatives. The results of this analysis for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. ubique</named-content> and
            <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P.
            marinus</named-content> have been summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050077-t005">Table 5</xref>. With few exceptions, small gaps resulted from
          the insertion or deletion of only a few genes. Many of the genes associated with these
          small insertions and deletions have no annotated function. In some cases the insertions
          display a degree of variability such that different sets of genes are found at these
          locations within a portion of the population. In contrast, many of the larger gaps are
          extremely variable to the extent that every clone contains a completely unrelated or
          highly divergent sequence when compared to the reference or to other clones associated
          with that gap. These segments are hypervariable and change much more rapidly than would be
          expected given the variation in the rest of the genome. Sites containing a hypervariable
          segment nearly always contained some insert. We identified two exceptions both associated
          with <italic>P. ubique.</italic> The first is approximately located at the 166-kb position
          in the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P.
            ubique</named-content> HTCC1062 genome. Though no large gap is present, the mated reads
          indicate that under many circumstances a highly variable insert is often present. The
          second is a gap on HTCC1062 that appears between 50 and 90 kb. This gap appears to be less
          variable than other hypervariable segments and is occasionally absent based on the large
          numbers of flanking long mated reads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050077-sd001">Poster S1</xref>A). Interestingly, the long mated reads around
          this gap seem to be disproportionately from the Sargasso Sea samples, suggesting that this
          segment may be linked to geographic and/or environmental factors. Thus, hypervariable
          segments are highly variable even within the same sample, can on occasion be unoccupied,
          and the variation, or lack thereof, can be sample dependent.</p>

        <p>Hypervariable segments have been seen previously in a wide range of microbes, including
            <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P.
            marinus</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b028">28</xref>], but
          their precise source and functional role, especially in an environmental context, remains
          a matter of ongoing research. For clues to these issues we examined the genes associated
          with the missing mates flanking these segments and the nucleotide composition of the
          gapped sequences in the reference genomes. In some rare cases the genes identified on
          reads that should have recruited within a hypervariable gap were highly similar to known
          viral genes. For example, a viral integrase was associated with the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. ubique</named-content> HTCC1062
          hypervariable gap between 516 and 561 kb. However, in the majority of cases the genes
          associated with these gaps were uncharacterized, either bearing no similarity to known
          genes or resembling genes of unknown function. If these genes were indeed acquired through
          horizontal transfer then we might expect that they would have obvious compositional
          biases. Oligonucleotide frequencies along the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. ubique</named-content> HTCC1062 and
            <italic>Synechococcus</italic> WH8102 genomes are quite different in the large
          recruitment gaps in comparison to the well-represented portions of the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050077-sd001">Poster S1</xref>).
          Surprisingly, this was less true for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. marinus</named-content> MIT9312, where the gaps have been linked
          to phage activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b028">28</xref>]. These results
          suggest that these hypervariable segments of the genome are widespread among marine
          microbial populations, and that they are the product of horizontal transfer events perhaps
          mediated by phage or transposable elements. These results are consistent with and expand
          upon the hypothesis put forward by Coleman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b028">28</xref>] suggesting that these segments are phage mediated,
          and conflicts with initial claims that the HTCC1062 genome was devoid of genes acquired by
          horizontal transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b029">29</xref>].</p>
        <p>Though insertions and deletions accounted for many of the obvious regions of structural
          variation, we also looked for rearrangements. The high levels of local synteny associated
          with <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P.
            ubique</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. marinus</named-content> suggested that large-scale rearrangements
          were rare in these populations. To investigate this hypothesis we used the recruitment
          data to examine how frequently rearrangements besides insertions and deletions could be
          identified. We looked for rearrangements consisting of large (greater than 50 kb)
          inversions and translocations associated with <italic>P. marinus;</italic> however, we did
          not identify any such rearrangements that consistently distinguished environmental
          populations from sequenced cultivars. Rare inversions and translocations were identified
          in the dominant subtype associated with MIT9312 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050077-t006">Table 6</xref>). Based on the amount of sequence that
          contributed to the analysis, we estimate that one inversion or translocation will be
          observed for every 2.6 Mbp of sequence examined (less than once per <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. marinus</named-content> genome).</p>

        <p>A further observation concerns the uniformity along a genome of the evolutionary history
          among and within subtypes. For instance, the similarity between GOS reads and
            <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P.
            marinus</named-content> MIT9312 is typically 85%–95%, while the similarity between
          MIT9312 and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P.
            marinus</named-content> MED4 is generally ~10% lower. However, there are several
          instances where the divergence of MIT9312 and MED4 abruptly decreases to no more than that
          between the GOS sequences and MIT9312 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050077-sd001">Poster S1</xref>G). These results are consistent either with
          horizontal transfer (recombination) or with inhomogeneous selectional pressures. Similar
          patterns are present in the two high-identity subtypes seen on the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. ubique</named-content> HTCC1062
          genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050077-sd001">Poster
          S1</xref>D). Other regions show local increases in similarity between MIT9312 and the
          dominant subtype that are not reflected in the MIT9312/MED4 divergence (e.g., near
          positions 50 kb, 288 kb, 730 kb, 850 kb, and 954 kb on MIT9312; also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050077-sd001">Poster S1</xref>G). These
          latter regions might reflect either regions of homogenizing recombination or regions of
          higher levels of purifying selection. However, the lengths of the intervals (several are
          10 kb or more) are longer than any single gene and correspond to genes that are not
          extremely conserved over greater taxonomic distances (in contrast to the ribosomal RNA
          operon). Equally, if widespread horizontal transfer of an advantageous segment explains
          these intervals, the transfers occurred long enough ago for appreciable variation to
          accumulate (unpublished data).</p>

        <title>Extreme Assembly of Uncultivated Populations</title>
        <p>The analyses described above have been confined to those organisms with representatives
          in culture and for which genomes were readily available. Producing assemblies for other
          abundant but uncultivated microbial genera would provide valuable physiological and
          biochemical information that could eventually lead to the cultivation of these organisms,
          help elucidate their role in the marine community, and allow similar analyses of their
          evolution and variation such as those performed on sequenced organisms. Previous assembly
          efforts and the fragment recruitments plots showed that there is considerable and in many
          cases conflicting variation among related organisms. Such variation is known to disrupt
          whole-genome assemblers. This led us to try an assembly approach that aggressively
          resolves conflicts. We call this approach “extreme assembly” (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). This approach currently does not make use of
          mate-pairing data and, therefore produces only contigs, not scaffolded sequences. Using
          this approach, contigs as large as 900 kb could be aligned almost in their entirety to the
            <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P.
            marinus</named-content> MIT9312 and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. ubique</named-content> HTCC1062 genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g002">Figure 2</xref>J–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g002">2</xref>L). Consistent patterns of fragment recruitment (see below) generally provided
          evidence of the correctness of contigs belonging to otherwise-unsequenced organisms.
          Accordingly, large contigs from these alternate assemblies were used to investigate
          genetic and geographic population structure, as described below. However, the more
          aggressive assemblies demonstrably suffered from higher rates of assembly artifacts,
          including chimerism and false consensus sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, the more stringent primary assembly was
          employed for most assembly-based analyses, as manual curation was not practical.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>As just noted, many of the large contigs produced by the more aggressive assembly methods
          described above did not align to any great degree with known genomes. Some could be
          tentatively classified based on contained 16S sequences, but the potential for
          computationally generated chimerism within the rRNA operon is sufficiently high that
          inspection of the assembly or other means of confirming such classifications is essential.
          An alternative to an unguided assembly that facilitates the association of assemblies with
          known organisms is to start from seed fragments that can be identified as belonging to a
          particular taxonomic group. We employed fragments outside the ribosomal RNA operon that
          were mated to a 16S-containing read, limiting extension to the direction away from the 16S
          operon. This produced contigs of 100 kb or more for several of the ribotypes that were
          abundant in the GOS dataset. When evaluated via fragment recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g002">Figure 2</xref>M–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g002">2</xref>O), these assemblies revealed patterns analogous to those seen for the
          sequenced genomes described above: multiple subtypes could be distinguished along the
          assembly, differing in similarity to the reference sequence and sample distribution, with
          occasional gaps. Hypervariable segments by definition were not represented in these
          assemblies, but they may help explain the termination of the extreme assemblies for
            <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P.
            marinus</named-content> and SAR11 and provide a plausible explanation for termination of
          assemblies of the other deeply sampled populations as well.</p>
        <p>This directed approach to assembly can also be used to investigate variation within a
          group of related organisms (e.g., a 16S ribotype). We explored the potential to assemble
          distinct subtypes of SAR11 by repeatedly seeding extreme assembly with fragments mated to
          a SAR11-like 16S sequence. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g007">Figure 7</xref>
          compares the first 20 kb from each of 24 independent assemblies. Eighteen of these
          segments could be aligned full-length to a portion of the HTCC1062 genome just upstream of
          16S, while six appeared to reflect rearrangements relative to HTCC1062. The rearranged
          segments were associated with more divergent 16S sequences (8%–14% diverged from the 16S
          of HTCC1062), while those without rearrangements corresponded to less divergent 16S
          (averaging less than 3% different from HTCC1062). In each segment, many reads were
          recruited above 90% identity, but different samples dominated different assemblies.
          Phylogenetic trees support the inference of evolutionarily distinct subtypes with
          distinctive sample distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g008">Figure

          we identified 16S genes directly from the primary GOS assembly. In total, 4,125 distinct
          full-length or partial 16S were identified. Clustering of these sequences at 97% identity
          gave a total of 811 distinct ribotypes. Nearly half (48%) of the GOS ribotypes and 88% of
          the GOS 16S sequences were assigned to ribotypes previously deposited in public databases.
          That is, more than half the ribotypes in the GOS dataset were found to be novel at what is
          typically considered the species level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b030">30</xref>]. The overall taxonomic distribution of the GOS ribotypes sampled by shotgun
          sequencing is consistent with previously published PCR based studies of marine
          environments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050077-t007">Table 7</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b031">31</xref>]. A smaller amount (16%) of GOS
          ribotypes and 3.4% of the GOS 16S sequences diverged by more than 10% from any publicly
          available 16S sequence, thus being novel to at least the family level.</p>

        <p>A census of microbial ribotypes allows us to identify the abundant microbial lineages and
          estimate their contribution to the GOS dataset. Of the 811 ribotypes, 60 contain more than
          8-fold coverage of the 16S gene (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050077-t008">Table
            8</xref>); jointly, these 60 ribotypes accounted for 73% of all the 16S sequence data.
          All but one of the 60 have been detected previously, yet only a few are represented by
          close relatives with complete or nearly complete genome sequencing projects (see Fragment
          Recruitment for further details). Several other abundant 16S sequences belong to
          well-known environmental ribotypes that do not have cultivated representatives (e.g.,
          SAR86, <italic>Roseobacter</italic> NAC-1–2, and branches of SAR11 other than those
          containing <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P.

          dominant organisms in these near-surface samples.</p>

          ubiquitously abundant; these are dominated by relatives of SAR11 and SAR86. Many of the
          ribotypes that are dominant in one or more samples appear to reside in one of three
          separable marine surface habitats. For example, several SAR11, SAR86, and alpha
            <italic>Proteobacteria,</italic> as well as an <italic>Acidimicrobidae</italic> group,
          are widespread in the surface waters, while a second niche delineated by tropical samples
          contains several different SAR86, <italic>Synechococcus</italic> and
            <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> (both cyanobacterial groups), and a
            <italic>Rhodospirillaceae</italic> group. Other ribotypes related to
            <italic>Roseobacter</italic> RCA, SAR11, and gamma <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> are
          abundant in the temperate samples but were not observed in the tropical or Sargasso
          samples. Not surprisingly, samples taken from nonmarine environments (GS33, GS20, GS32),
          estuaries (GS11, GS12), and larger-sized fraction filters (GS01a, GS01b, GS25) have
          distinguishing ribotypes. Furthermore, as the complete genomes of these dominant members
          are obtained, the capabilities responsible for their abundances may well lend insight into
          the community metabolism in various oceanic niches.</p>

            <p>The relative abundance of various ribotypes (rows) in each filter (columns) is
              represented by the area of the corresponding spot (if any). The listed ribotypes each
              satisfied the following criteria in at least one filter: the ribotype was among the
              five most abundant ribotypes detected in the shotgun data, and was represented by at
              least three sequencing reads. Relative abundance is based on the total number of 16S
              sequences in a given filter. Order and grouping of filters is based on the clustering
              of genomic similarity shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g011">Figure
                11</xref>. Ribotype order was determined based on similarity of sample distribution.
              A marked contrast between temperate and tropical groups is visible. Estuarine samples
              GS11 and GS12 contained a mix of ribotypes seen in freshwater and temperate marine
              samples, while samples from nonmarine habitats or larger filter sizes were pronounced
              outliers. The presence of large amounts of <italic>Burkholderia</italic> and
                <italic>Shewanella</italic> in one Sargasso Sea sample (GS00a) makes this sample
              look much less like other Sargasso and tropical marine samples than it otherwise
              would. Note that 16S is not a measure of cell abundance since 16S genes can be
              multicopy.</p>

        <title>Sample Comparisons</title>
        <p>The most common approach for comparing the microbial community composition across samples
          has been to examine the ribotypes present as indicated by 16S rRNA genes or by analyzing
          the less-conserved ITS located between the 16S and 23S gene sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b017">17</xref>]. However, a clear
          observation emerging from the fragment recruitment views was that the reference ribotypes
          recruit multiple subtypes, and that these subtypes were distributed unequally among
          samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g002">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g008">8</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050077-sd001">Poster S1</xref>D, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050077-sd001">S1</xref>F, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050077-sd001">S1</xref>I).</p>
        <p>We developed a method to assess the genetic similarity between two samples that
          potentially makes use of all portions of a genome, not just the 16S rRNA region. This
          similarity measure is assembly independent; under certain circumstances, it is equivalent
          to an estimate of the fraction of sequence from one sample that could be considered to be
          in the other sample. Whole-metagenomic similarities were computed for all pairs of
          samples. Results are presented for comparisons at ≥98% and 90% identity. No universal
          cutoff consistently divides sequences into natural subsets, but the 98% identity cutoff
          provides a relatively high degree of resolution, while the 90% cutoff appears to be a
          reasonable heuristic for defining subtypes. For instance, a 90% cutoff treats most of the
          reads specifically recruited to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. marinus</named-content> MIT9312 as similar (those more similar to
          MED4 notably excepted), while reasonably separating clades of SAR11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g007">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g008">8</xref>). Reads with no qualifying overlap alignment to any
          other read in a pair of samples are uninformative for this analysis, as they correspond to
          lineages that were so lightly sequenced that their presence in one sample and absence in
          another may be a matter of chance. For the 90% cutoff, 38% of the sequence reads
          contributed to the analysis. The resulting similarities reveal clear and consistent
          groupings of samples, as well as the outlier status of certain samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g010">Figures 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g011">11</xref>).</p>
        <p>The broadest contrast was between samples that could be loosely labeled “tropical”
          (including samples from the Sargasso Sea [GS00b, GS00c, GS00d] and samples that are
          temperate by the formal definition but under the influence of the Gulf Stream [GS14,
          GS15]) and “temperate.” Further subgroups can be identified within each of these
          categories, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g010">Figures 10</xref>
          and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g011">11</xref>. In some cases, these groupings
          were composed of samples taken from different ocean basins during different legs of the
          expedition. A few pairs of samples with strikingly high similarity were observed,
          including GS17 and GS18, GS23 and GS26, GS27 and GS28, and GS00b and GS00d. In each case,
          these pairs of samples were collected from consecutive or nearly consecutive samples.
          However, the same could be said of many other pairs of samples that do not show this same
          degree of similarity. Indeed, geographically and temporally separated samples taken in the
          Atlantic (GS17, GS18) and Pacific (GS23, GS26) during separate legs of the expedition are
          more similar to one another than were most pairs of consecutive samples. The samples with
          least similarity to any other sample were from unique habitats. Thus, similarity cannot be
          attributed to geographic separation alone.</p>
        <p>The groupings described above can be reconstructed from taxonomically distinct subsets of
          the data. Specifically, the major groups of samples visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g010">Figure 10</xref> were reproduced when sample similarities were
          determined based only on fragments recruiting to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. ubique</named-content> HTCC1062
          (unpublished data). Likewise, the same groupings were observed when the fragments
          recruiting to either HTCC1062 or <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. marinus</named-content> MIT9312, or both, were excluded from the
          calculations (unpublished data). Thus, the factors influencing sample similarities do not
          appear to rely solely on the most abundant organisms but rather are reflected in multiple
          microbial lineages.</p>
        <p>It is tempting to view the groups of similar samples as constituting community types.
          Sample similarities based on genomic sequences correlated significantly with differences
          in the environmental parameters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050077-t001">Table
            1</xref>), particularly water temperature and salinity (unpublished data). Samples that
          are very similar to each other had relatively small differences in temperature and
          salinity. However, not all samples that had similar temperature and salinity had high
          community similarities. Water depth, primary productivity, fresh water input, proximity to
          land, and filter size appeared consistent with the observed groupings. Other factors such
          as nutrients and light for phototrophs and fixed carbon/energy for chemotrophs may
          ultimately prove better predictors, but these results demonstrate the potential of using
          metagenomic data to tease out such relationships.</p>
        <p>Examining the groupings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g011">Figure 11</xref>
          in light of habitat and physical characteristics, the following may be observed. The first
          two samples, a hypersaline pond in the Galapagos Islands (GS33) and the freshwater Lake
          Gatun in the Panama Canal (GS20) are quite distinct from the rest. Salinity—both higher
          and lower than the remaining coastal and ocean samples—is the simplest explanation.</p>
        <p>Twelve samples form a strong temperate cluster as seen in the similarity matrix of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g011">Figure 11</xref> as a darker square bounded by
          GS06 and GS12. Embedded within the temperate cluster are three subclusters. The first
          subcluster includes five samples from Nova Scotia through the Gulf of Maine. This is
          followed by a subcluster of four samples between Rhode Island and North Carolina. The
          northern subcluster was sampled in August, the southern subcluster in November and
          December. Though all samples were collected in the top few meters, the southern samples
          were in shallower waters, 10 to 30 m deep, whereas most of the northern samples were in
          waters greater than 100 m deep. Monthly average estimates of chlorophyll
            <italic>a</italic> concentrations were typically higher in the southern samples as well
            (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050077-t001">Table 1</xref>). All of these
          factors—temperature, system primary production, and depth of the sampled water body—likely
          contribute to the differences in microbial community composition that result in the two
          well-defined clusters. The final temperate subgroup includes two estuaries, Chesapeake Bay
          (GS12) and Delaware Bay (GS11), distinguished by their lower salinity and higher
          productivity. However, GS11 is markedly similar not only to GS12 but also to coastal
          samples, whereas the latter appears much more unique. Interestingly, the Bay of Fundy
          estuary sample (GS06) clearly did not group with the two other estuaries, but rather with
          the northern subgroup, perhaps reflecting differences in the rate or degree of mixing at
          the sampling site.</p>
        <p>Continuing to the right and downward in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g011">Figure 11</xref>, one can see a large cluster of 25 samples from the tropics and
          Sargasso Sea, bounded by GS47 and GS00b. This can be further subdivided into several
          subclusters. The first subcluster (a square bounded by GS47 and GS14) includes 14 samples,
          about half of which were from the Galapagos. The second distinct subcluster (a square
          bounded by GS16 and GS26) includes seven samples from Key West, Florida, in the Atlantic
          Ocean to a sample close to the Galapagos Islands in the Pacific Ocean. Loosely associated
          with this subcluster is a sample from a larger filter size taken en route to the Galapagos
          (GS25). The remaining samples group weakly with the tropical cluster. GS32 was taken in a
          coastal mangrove in the Galapagos. The thick organic sediment at a depth of less than a
          meter is the likely cause for it being unlike the other samples. Sample 00a was from the
          Sargasso Sea and contained a large fraction of sequence reads from apparently clonal
            <italic>Burkholderia</italic> and <italic>Shewanella</italic> species that are atypical.
          When this sample is reanalyzed to exclude reads identified as belonging to these two
          groups, sample GS00a groups loosely with GS00b, GS00c, and GS00d (unpublished data).
          Finally, three subsamples from a single Sargasso sample (GS01a, GS01b, GS01c) group
          together, despite representing three distinct size fractions (3.0–20, 0.8–3.0, and 0.1–0.8
          μm, respectively; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050077-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>The complete set of sample similarities is more complex than described above, and indeed
          is more complex than can be captured by a hierarchical clustering. For instance, the
          southern temperate samples are appreciably more similar to the tropical cluster than are
          the northern temperate samples. GS22 appears to constitute a mix of tropical types,
          showing strong similarity not only to the GS47–GS14 subcluster to which it was assigned,
          but also to the other tropical samples.</p>
        <p>These results may be compared to the more traditional view of community structure
          afforded by 16S sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g009">Figure 9</xref>).
          Some of the same groupings of samples are visible using both analyses. Several ribotypes
          recapitulated the temperate/tropical clustering described above. Others were restricted to
          the single instances of nonmarine habitats. Several of the most abundant organisms from
          the coastal mangrove, hypersaline lagoon, and freshwater lake were found exclusively in
          these respective samples. However, while several ribotypes recapitulated the
          temperate/tropical distinction revealed by the genomic sequence, others crosscut it. A few
          dominant 16S ribotypes, related to SAR11, SAR86, and SAR116, were found in every marine
          sample. The brackish waters from two mid-Atlantic estuaries (GS11 and GS12) contained a
          mixture of otherwise exclusively marine and freshwater ribotypes; similarity of these
          sites to the freshwater sample (GS20) was minimal at the metagenomic level, while the
          greater similarity of GS11 to coastal samples visible at the metagenomic level was not
          readily visible here. A fuller comparison of metagenome-based measurements of diversity
          based on a large dataset of PCR-derived 16S sequences will be presented in another paper
          (in preparation).</p>

        <title>Variation in Gene Abundance</title>
        <p>Differences in gene content between samples can identify functions that reflect the
          lifestyles of the community in the context of its local environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b032">32</xref>]. We examined the relative abundance of genes belonging to specific
          functional categories in the distinct GOS samples. Genes were binned into functional
          categories using TIGRFAM hidden Markov models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b018">18</xref>], which are well annotated and manually curated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b033">33</xref>].</p>
        <p>The results can be filtered in various ways to highlight genes associated with specific
          environments. One catalog of possible interest is genes that were predominantly found in a
          single sample. We identified 95 TIGRFAMs that annotated large sets of genes (100 or more)
          that were significantly more frequent (greater than 2-fold) in one sample than in any
          other sample (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050077-t009">Table 9</xref>). Not
          surprisingly, this approach disproportionately singles out genes from the samples
          collected on larger filters (GS01a, GS01b, and GS25) and from the nonmarine environments,
          particularly the hypersaline pond (sample GS33). Another contrast might be between the
          temperate and tropical clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g010">Figures
            10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g011">11</xref>). We identified 32
          proteins that were more than 2-fold more frequent in one or the other group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050077-t010">Table 10</xref>). The presence of various
            <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic>-associated genes in this list highlights some of the
          potential challenges with this sort of approach. Overrepresentation may reflect: a direct
          response to particular environmental pressures (as the excess of salt transporters
          plausibly do in the hypersaline pond); a lineage-restricted difference in functional
          repertoire (as exemplified by the excess of photosynthesis genes in samples containing
            <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic>); or a more incidental “hitchhiking” of a protein found
          in a single organism that happens to be present.</p>

        <p>We explored whether clearer and more informative differences could be discovered between
          communities by focusing on groups of samples that are highly similar in overall

          of this approach. Samples GS17 and GS18 from the western Caribbean Sea and samples GS23
          and GS26 from the eastern Pacific Ocean were all very similar based on the presence of
          abundant ribotypes and overall similarity in genetic content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g009">Figures 9</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g011">11</xref>). Despite these similarities, several genes are found to be up to seven times
          more common in the pair of Caribbean samples than the Pacific pair (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050077-t011">Table 11</xref>). No genes are more than 2-fold higher in the
          Pacific than the Caribbean pair of samples. Several of the most differentially abundant
          genes are related to phosphate transport and utilization. It is very plausible that this
          is a reflection of a functional adaptation: these differences correlate well with measured
          differences in phosphate abundance between the Atlantic and eastern Pacific samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b035">35</xref>], and phosphate abundance plays a critical role in

          this gene is located at 672 kb lying roughly in the middle of a 15-kb segment of the

          more variable than the flanking regions, and thus are not hypervariable in the sense used
          previously (unpublished data). Nor are they particularly conserved when present,
          indicating that they are not the result of a recent lateral transfer. Phylogenetic
          analyses outside these segments did not produce any evidence of a Pacific versus Caribbean

          Caribbean far exceeds the number that can be attributed to HTCC1062- and MIT9312-like

        <title>Biogeographic Distribution of Proteorhodopsin Variants</title>
        <p>Variation in gene content is only one aspect of the tremendous diversity in the GOS data.
          The functional significance of all the polymorphic differences between homologous proteins
          remains largely unknown. To look for functional differences, we analyzed members of
          proteorhodopsin gene family. Proteorhodopsins are fast, light-driven proton pumps for
          which considerable functional information is available though their biological role
          remains unknown. Proteorhodopsins were highly abundant in the Sargasso Sea samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b019">19</xref>] and continue to be highly abundant
          and evenly distributed (relative to <italic>recA</italic> abundance) in all the GOS
          samples. A total of 2,674 putative proteorhodopsin genes were identified in the GOS
          dataset. Although many of the sequences are fragmentary, 1,874 of these genes contain the
          residue that is primarily responsible for tuning the light-absorbing properties of the
          protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b041">41</xref>], and these properties have been shown to be selected
          for under different environmental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b042">42</xref>]. Variation at this residue is strongly correlated
          with sample of origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g012">Figure 12</xref>). The
          leucine (L) or green-tuned variant was highly abundant in the North Atlantic samples and
          in the nonmarine environments like the fresh water sample from Lake Gatun (GS20). The
          glutamine (Q) or blue-tuned variant dominated in the remaining mostly open ocean
          samples.</p>

              to the U.S. and Canadian coast. The Q variant is abundant in warmer waters further
              from land. The M variant is moderately abundant in a wide range of samples with no

        <p>Given our limited understanding of the biological role for proteorhopsin, the reason for
          this differential distribution is not immediately clear. In coastal waters where nutrients
          are more abundant, phytoplankton is dominant. Phytoplankton absorbs primarily in the blue
          and red spectra; consequently, the water appears green [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b043">43</xref>]. Conversely, in the open ocean nutrients are rare and
          phytoplanktonic biomass is low, so waters appear blue because in the absence of impurities
          the red wavelengths are absorbed preferentially [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b044">44</xref>]. It may be that proteorhodopsin-carrying microbes
          have simply adapted to take advantage of the most abundant wavelengths of light in these
          systems.</p>
        <p>Proteorhodopsins encoded on reads that were recruited to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. ubique</named-content> HTCC1062
          account for a fraction (~25%) of all the proteorhodopsin-associated reads, suggesting that
          the remainder must be associated with a variety of marine microbial taxa (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b045">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b047">47</xref>]). Phylogenetic analysis of the SAR11-associated
          proteins revealed that each variant has arisen independently at least two times in the
          SAR11 lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). Consistent
          with other findings that proteorhodopsins are widely distributed throughout the microbial
          world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b048">48</xref>], we conclude that multiple
          microbial lineages are responsible for proteorhodopsin spectral variation and that the
          abundance of a given variant reflects selective pressures rather than taxonomic effects.
          Similar mechanisms seem to be involved in the evolution and diversification of opsins that
          mediate color vision in vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b049">49</xref>].</p>

      <p>Our results highlight the astounding diversity contained within microbial communities, as
        revealed through whole-genome shotgun sequencing carried out on a global scale. Much of this
        microbial diversity is organized around phylogenetically related, geographically dispersed
        populations we refer to as subtypes. In addition, there is tremendous variation within
        subtypes, both in the form of sequence variation and in hypervariable genomic islands. Our
        ability to make these observations derived from not only the large volumes of data but also
        from the development of new tools and techniques to filter and organize the information in
        manageable ways.</p>

        <title>Variation and Diversity</title>
        <p>Our data demonstrate to an unprecedented degree the nature and evolution of genetic
          variation below the species level. Variation can be analyzed in several ways, including
          observed differences in sequence, genomic structure, and gene complement. The observed
          patterns of variation shed light on the mechanisms by which marine prokaryotes evolve.
          Gene synteny seems to be more highly conserved than the nucleotide and protein sequences.
          This variation is seen over essentially the entire genome in every abundant group of
          organisms sufficiently related for us to recognize a population by fragment recruitment.
          (These include, but are not limited to, the organisms shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050077-sd001">Poster S1</xref>.) Notably, we found no evidence of widespread
          low-diversity organisms such as <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. anthracis</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b050">50</xref>].</p>
        <p>Phylogenetic trees and fragment recruitment plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g007">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g008">8</xref>) indicate that the variation within a species is not an
          unstructured swarm or cloud of variants all equally diverged from one another. Instead,
          there are clearly distinct subtypes, in terms of sequence similarity, gene content, and
          sample distribution. Similar findings have been shown for specific organisms, based on
          evaluation of one or a few loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b051">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b053">53</xref>]. These results rule out certain trivial models of
          population history and evolution for what is commonly considered a bacterial “species.”
          For instance, it argues against a recent explosive population growth from a single
          successful individual (selective sweep) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b054">54</xref>]. Equally, it argues against a perfectly mixed population, suggesting instead
          some barriers to competition and exchange of genetic material.</p>
        <p>In principle, this variation could reflect some combination of physical barriers (true
          biogeography), short-term stochastic effects, and/or functional differentiation. Given the
          confounding variables of geography, time, and environmental conditions in the current
          collection of samples, it is difficult to definitively separate these effects, but various
          observations argue for functional differentiation between subtypes (i.e., they constitute
          distinct ecotypes). First, individual subtypes may be found in a wide range of locations;
            <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P.
            ubique</named-content> HTCC1062 was isolated in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of
          Oregon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b055">55</xref>], but closely related
          sequences are relatively abundant in our samples taken in the Atlantic Ocean. Second,
          geography per se cannot fully explain differences in subtype distributions, as multiple
          subtypes are found simultaneously in a single sample. Third, the collection of samples in
          which a given subtype was found generally exhibits similar environmental conditions. A
          strong independent illustration of this comes from the correlation of temperature with the
          distribution of <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b056">56</xref>]. Fourth, the extensive variation within each subtype
          (i.e., the fact that subtypes are not clonal populations) indicates that it cannot be
          chance alone that makes genetically similar organisms have similar observed
          distributions.</p>
        <p>Taken together, these results argue that subtype classification is more informative for
          categorizing microbial populations than classification using 16S-based ribotypes, or
          fingerprinting techniques based on length polymorphism, such as T-RFLPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b057">57</xref>] or ARISA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b058">58</xref>]. For example, the grouping of such disparate
          microbial populations under the umbrella <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. marinus</named-content> dilutes the significance of the term
          “species.” Indeed, numerous papers have been devoted to comparing and contrasting the
          differences and variability in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. marinus</named-content> isolates to better understand how this
          particularly abundant group of organisms has evolved and adapted within the dynamic marine
          environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b052">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b056">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b059">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b066">66</xref>]. Prior to the widespread use of marker-based
          phylogenetic approaches, microbial systematics relied on a wide range of variables to
          distinguish microbial populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b067">67</xref>]. Subtypes bring us back to these more comprehensive approaches since they
          reflect the influences of a wide range of factors in the context of an entire genome.</p>
        <p>Although subtypes are a salient feature of our data, variation within a ribotype does not
          stop at the level of subtypes. Variation within subtypes is so extensive that few GOS
          reads can be aligned at 100% identity to any other GOS read, despite the deep coverage of
          several taxonomic groups. Related findings have been shown for the ITS region in various
          organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b052">52</xref>], and in a limited number of organisms for individual protein coding and
          intergenic regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b068">68</xref>]. High levels of diversity within the ribotype can be
          convincingly demonstrated in the 16S gene itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b069">69</xref>]. The applicability of these results over the entire
          genome were recently shown for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. marinus</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b028">28</xref>] using data from the Sargasso Sea samples taken as a
          pilot project for the expedition reported here [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b019">19</xref>]. We have definitively demonstrated the generality of
          these findings, greatly increased our understanding of the minimum number of variants of a
          given organism, and shown that these observations apply to the entire genome for a wide
          range of abundant taxonomic groups and across a wide range of geographic locations.</p>
        <p>Average pairwise differences of several percent between overlapping <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. marinus</named-content> or SAR11
          reads imply that this variation did not arise recently. If one uses substitution rates
          estimated for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E.
            coli</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b070">70</xref>], one
          could conclude that on average any two <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. marinus</named-content> cells must have diverged millions of
          years ago. Mutational rates are notoriously variable and hard to estimate, and assumptions
          of molecular clocks are equally chancy, but clearly within-subtype variants have persisted
          side by side for quite some time. This raises a question related to the classic “Paradox
          of the Plankton”: how can so many similar organisms have coexisted for so long [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b071">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b072">72</xref>]? One explanation, which we favor, is that not only
          subtypes but also individual variants are sufficiently different phenotypically to prevent
          any one strain from completely replacing all others (discussed further below; see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b071">71</xref>] for a recent theoretical treatment).
          An alternative is that recombination might prevent selective sweeps within ecotypes, as
          proposed by Cohan (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b073">73</xref>]).</p>

        <title>The Significance of Within-Subtype Variation</title>
        <p>Given the apparent generality of subtypes and intra-subtype variation, it is important to
          understand if and how these subpopulations are functionally distinct. At the level of DNA
          sequence, a substantial fraction of substitutions are silent in terms of amino acid
          sequence, and others may be nonsynonymous but functionally neutral. However, two organisms
          that differ by 5% in their genetic sequence (e.g., 100,000 substitutions in 2 Mbp of
          shared sequence) will inevitably have at least minor functional differences such as in the
          optimal temperature or pH for the activity of some enzyme. At the level of gene content,
          the observation of hypervariable segments ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b028">28</xref>] and here) implies that there is an additional dimension to functional
          variability. Hypervariable genomic islands with preferential insertion sites could
          potentially be associated with a wide range of functions, though to date they have been
          most closely examined for their role in pathogenicity (for a review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b074">74</xref>]). However, given their apparent
          variability within even a single sampling site, it seems unlikely that these elements
          reflect a specific adaptive advantage to the local population. Identifying the source(s),
          diversity, and range of functionality associated with these islands by fully sequencing a
          large number of these segments and understanding how their individual abundances fluctuate
          should be quite informative.</p>
        <p>Some might still argue that these differences must be moot for the purpose of
          understanding the role these organisms play in an ecosystem. Yet even small differences in
          optimal conditions may have profound effects. They may prevent any single genotype from
          being universally fittest, allowing and/or necessitating the coexistence of multiple
          variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b069">69</xref>]. Moreover, variation within subtype might afford a form of functional
          “buffering,” such that the population as a whole may be more stable in its ecosystem role
          than any one clone could be (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b051">51</xref>]). That is, while any one strain of <italic>Prochlorococcu</italic>s might
          thrive and provide energy input to the rest of the community at a limited range of
          temperatures, light conditions, etc., the ensemble might provide such inputs over a wider
          range of environmental conditions. In this way, microdiversity might provide system
          stability or robustness through functional redundancy and the “insurance effect” (reviewed
          in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b075">75</xref>]). Thus, while the extent of
          microdiversity suggests that knowing the behavior of any one isolate in exquisite detail
          might not be as useful to reductionist modeling as one might hope, this buffering could
          afford a more stable ensemble behavior, facilitating the development and maintenance of an
          ecosystem and allowing for system-level modeling.</p>
        <p>A direct equation of subtypes with ecotypes is tempting, but not entirely clear-cut. The
          correlation of <italic>PstS</italic> distribution with phosphate abundance suggests a
          functional adaptation, but within <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> and SAR11 the presence
          or absence of <italic>PstS</italic> subdivides subtypes without apparent respect for
          phylogenetic structure. This contrasts markedly with the distribution of
          proteorhodopsin-tuning variants within SAR11, which, despite a few convergent
          substitutions, are strongly congruent with phylogeny. It is interesting to ask what
          distinguishes pressures or adaptations that respect (or that lead to) lineage splits from
          those that show little or no phylogenetic structuring. These two specific examples
          plausibly reflect two different mechanisms (i.e., convergent but independent mutation in
          proteorhodopsin genes and the acquisition by horizontal transfer of genes involved in
          phosphate uptake). Yet, we must wonder: given the evidence that proteorhodopsin has been
          transferred laterally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b048">48</xref>], and that
          only a small number of mutations, in some circumstances even a single base-pair change,
          are required to switch between the blue-absorbing and green-absorbing forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b040">40</xref>], why should proteorhodopsin variants show any lineage
          restriction? Perhaps this relates to the modularity of the system in question:
          proteorhodopsin tuning may be part of a larger collection of synergistic adaptations that
          are collectively not easily evolved, acquired, or lost, while the <italic>PstS</italic>
          and surrounding genes may represent a functional unit that can be readily added and
          removed over relatively short evolutionary time scales. If so, perhaps subtypes are indeed
          ecotypes, but rapidly evolving characters can lead to phenotypes that crosscut or
          subdivide ecotypes.</p>
        <p>Phage provide one possible mechanism for rapid evolution of microbial populations or
          strains, and have been found in abundance with this and other marine metagenomic datasets
            [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b020">20</xref>]. It has been proposed that hypervariable islands are
          phage mediated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b028">28</xref>]. However, there
          are reasons to be cautious about invoking phage as an explanation for rapidly evolving
          characteristics. While we see variability of <italic>PstS</italic> and neighboring genes
          in both SAR11 and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P.
            marinus</named-content> populations, this variation does not seem to be linked to recent
          phage activity. Initially, the distribution of <italic>PstS</italic> seems similar to the
          variation associated with the hypervariable islands, which may be phage mediated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b028">28</xref>]. Indeed, phosphate-regulating genes
          including <italic>PstS</italic> have been identified in phage genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b064">64</xref>], presumably because enhanced
          phosphate acquisition is required during the replication portion of their life cycle.
          However, the regions containing the <italic>PstS</italic> genes in both SAR11 and
            <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> do not behave in the same fashion as clearly
          hypervariable regions, being effectively bimorphic (modulo the level of sequence variation
          observed elsewhere in the genome), whereas clearly hypervariable regions are so diverse
          that nearly every sampled clone falling in such a region appears completely unrelated to
          every other. Nor do the other genes in <italic>PstS</italic>-containing regions appear to
          be phage associated. These observations suggest that differences in <italic>PstS</italic>
          presence or absence arose in the distant past, or that different mechanisms are at work.
          It seems likely that phage may mediate lateral transfer of <italic>PstS</italic> and other
          phosphate acquisition genes, but it is unclear whether these genes then can become fixed
          within the population. Phage require enhanced phosphate acquisition as part of their life
          cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b064">64</xref>], so regulatory or
          functional differences in these genes may limit their suitability for being acquired by
          the host cell for its own purposes. The rate of phage-mediated horizontal transfer of
          genes may reflect a combination of the gene's value to the host and to the agent mediating
          the transfer (e.g., phage), suggesting that <italic>PstS</italic> may have much greater
          immediate value than do proteorhodopsin genes and their variants.</p>
        <p>In practical terms, these results highlight the limitations associated with marker-based
          analysis and the use of these approaches to infer the physiology of a particular microbial
          population. At the resolution used here, marker-based approaches are not always
          informative regarding differences in gene content (e.g., the <italic>PstS</italic> gene as
          well as neighboring genes), especially those associated with hypervariable segments.
          Though phosphate acquisition is known to vary within different strains of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. marinus</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b064">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b076">76</xref>], our results clearly show that this variability can
          happen within a single subtype (as represented by MIT9312), effectively identifying
          distinct ecotypes. Given the correct samples from the appropriate environments, other core
          genes might also show similar variation and allow us to more fully assess the reliability
          of reference genomes as indicators of physiological potential.</p>

        <title>Tools and Techniques</title>
        <p>Analysis of the GOS dataset has benefited from the development of new tools and
          techniques. Many of these approaches rely on fairly well-known techniques but have been
          modified to take greater advantage of the metadata.</p>
        <p>The technique of fragment recruit and the corresponding fragment recruitment plots have
          proven highly useful for examining the biogeography and genomic variation of abundant
          marine microbes when a close reference genome exists. Ultimately, this approach derives
          from the percent identity plots of PipMaker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b027">27</xref>]. Similar approaches have been used to examine variation with respect to
          metagenomic datasets. For example, hypervariable segments and sequence variation have been
          visualized in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P.
            marinus</named-content> MIT9312 using the Sargasso Sea data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b028">28</xref>] and in human gut microbes <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Bifidobacterium longum</named-content>
          and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Methanobrevibacter
            smithii</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b077">77</xref>].</p>
        <p>Our primary advance associated with fragment recruitment plots is the incorporation of
          metadata associated with the isolation or production of the sequencing data. While simple
          in nature, the resulting plots can be extremely informative due to the volume of data
          being presented. Being able to present the sequence similarity and metadata visually
          allows a researcher to quickly identify interesting portions of the data for further
          examination. This is one of the first tools to make extensive use of the metadata
          collected during a metagenomic sequencing project. The use of sample and recruitment
          metadata is just the beginning. It is not difficult to imagine displaying other variations
          such as water temperature, salinity, phosphate abundance, and time of year with this
          approach. Even sample independent metadata such as phylogenetic information may produce
          informative views of the data. The usefulness of this and related approaches will only
          grow as the robust collection of metadata becomes routine and the variables that are most
          relevant to microbial communities are further elucidated.</p>
        <p>The greatest limitation of fragment recruitment is the lack of appropriate reference
          sequences, particularly finished genomes. Using a series of modifications to the Celera
          Assembler referred to as “extreme assembly,” we have produced large assemblies for
          cultivated and uncultivated marine microbes. On its own, the extreme assembly approach
          would be excessively prone to producing chimeric sequences. However, when extreme
          assemblies are used as references for fragment recruitment, the metadata provides
          additional criteria to validate the sampling consistency along the length of the scaffold.
          Chimeric joins can be rapidly detected and avoided. This argues that future metagenomic
          assemblers could be specifically designed to make use of the metadata to produce more
          accurate assemblies, and that metagenomic assemblies will be improved by using data from
          multiple sources. Finding ways to represent the full diversity in these assemblies remains
          a pressing issue.</p>
        <p>Extreme assembly can produce much larger assemblies but it is still limited by overall
          coverage. While many ribotypes are presumably present in sufficient quantities that
          reasonable assemblies of these genomes might be expected, this did not occur even for the
          most abundant organisms, including SAR11 and <italic>P. marinus.</italic> Many of the
          problems can be attributed to the diversity associated with the hypervariable segments
          where the effective coverage drops precipitously. If these are indeed commonplace in the
          microbial world, it is unlikely that complete genomes will be produced using the small
          insert libraries presented here. However, the ability to bin the larger sequences based on
          their coverage profiles across multiple samples, oligonucleotide frequency profiles, and
          phylogenetic markers suggests that large portions of a microbial genome can be
          reconstructed from the environmental data. This in turn should provide critical insights
          into the physiology and biochemistry of these microbial lineages that will inform culture
          techniques to allow cultivation of these recalcitrant organisms under laboratory
          conditions.</p>
        <p>Not every technique described herein relies on metadata. The marker-less, overlap-based
          metagenomic comparison provides a quantitative approach to comparing the overall genetic
          similarity of two samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g010">Figures 10</xref>
          and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050077-g011">11</xref>). In essence, genomic
          similarity acts as a proxy for community similarity. Marker-based approaches such as ARISA
          including the use of 16S sequences described herein can also be used to infer community
          similarity, though these approaches more aptly generate a census of the community members
            [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b069">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b078">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b079">79</xref>]. This census is
          biased to the extent that 16S genes can vary in copy number and relies on linkage of the
          marker gene to infer genome composition. While our metagenome comparison does not directly
          provide a census, the sensitivity can be tuned by restricting the identity of matches.
          This means that even subtype-level differences can be detected across samples. It would
          also identify the substantial gene content differences between the K12 and O157:H7
            <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content>
          strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b012">12</xref>]. Such large-scale gene
          content differences have yet to be seen between closely related marine microbes, but may
          be a factor in other environments. Although the requisite amount of data will vary with
          the complexity of the environment or the degree of resolution required, we have found that
          10,000 sequencing reads is sufficient to reliably measure the similarity of two surface
          water samples (unpublished data). This analysis may become a general tool for allocating
          sequencing resources by allowing a shallow survey of many samples followed by deep
          sequencing of a select number of “interesting” ones.</p>
        <p>The application of this technique for comparing samples along with detailed analysis of
          fragments recruiting to a given reference sequence can also help explicate differences
          among communities in gene content or sequence variation. For example, recent metagenomic
          studies have reported differences in abundance of various gene families or differing
          functional roles between samples. Some of these differences correspond to plausible
          differences in physiology and biochemistry, such as the relative overabundance of
          photosynthetic or light-responsive genes in surface water samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b032">32</xref>]. Other differences however are less obvious, such as the abundance of
          ribosomal proteins at 130 m or the abundance of tranposase at 4,000 m [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b020">20</xref>]; some of these may reflect “taxonomic
          hitchhiking,” such that a sample rich in Archaea or <italic>Firmicutes</italic> or
            <italic>Cyanobacteria,</italic> etc., has an overrepresentation of genes more reflective
          of their recent evolutionary history than of a response to environmental conditions. Being
          able to control or account for these taxonomic effects is crucial to understanding how
          microbial populations have adapted to environmental conditions and how they may behave
          under changing conditions. The metagenomic comparison method described here provides a new
          tool to more accurately measure the impact of taxonomic effects.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, this study reveals the wealth of biological information that is contained
          within large multi-sample environmental datasets. We have begun to quantify the amount and
          structure of the variation in natural microbial populations, while providing some
          information about how these factors are structured along phylogenetic and environmental
          factors. At the same time, many questions remain unanswered. For example, although
          microbial populations are structured and therefore genetically isolated, we do not
          understand the mechanisms that lead to this isolation. Their isolation seems contradictory
          given overwhelming evidence that horizontal gene transfer associated with hypervariable
          islands is a common phenomenon in marine microbial populations. Whatever the mechanism,
          the role and rate at which gene exchange occurs between populations will be crucial to
          understanding population structure within microbial communities and whether these
          communities are chance associations or necessary collections. The hypervariable islands
          could be a source for tremendous genetic innovation and novelty as evidenced by the rate
          of discovery of novel protein families in the GOS dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b018">18</xref>]. However, it is not clear whether these entities are
          the main source of this novelty or whether this novelty resides in the vast numbers of
          rare microbes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b004">4</xref>] that cannot be
          practically accessed using current metagenomic approaches. Altogether, this research
          reaffirms our growing wealth and complexity of data and paucity of understanding regarding
          the biological systems of the oceans.</p>

        <p>A more detailed description of the sampling sites provides additional context in which to
          understand the individual samples. The northernmost site (GS05) was at Compass Buoy in the
          highly eutrophic Bedford Basin, a marine embayment encircled by Halifax, Nova Scotia, that
          has a 15-y weekly record of biological, physical, and chemical monitoring (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mar.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/ocean/BedfordBasin/index.htm" xlink:type="simple">http://www.mar.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/ocean/BedfordBasin/index.htm</ext-link>). Other
          temperate sites included a coastal station sample near Nova Scotia (GS4), a station in the
          Bay of Fundy estuary at outgoing tide (GS06), and three Gulf of Maine stations (GS02,
          GS03, and GS07). These were followed by sampling coastal stations from the New England
          shelf region of the Middle Atlantic Bight (Newport Harbor through Delaware Bay;
          GS08–GS11). The Delaware Bay (GS11) was one of several estuary samples along the Global
          Expedition path. Estuaries are complex hydrodynamic environments that exhibit strong
          gradients in oxygen, nutrients, organic matter, and salinity and are heavily impacted by
          anthropogenic nutrients. The Chesapeake Bay (GS12) is the largest estuary in the United
          States and has microbial assemblages that are diverse mixtures of freshwater and
          marine-specific organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b080">80</xref>]. GS13
          was collected near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, inside and north of the Gulf Stream, and
          GS14 was taken along the western boundary frontal waters of the Gulf Stream off the coast
          of Charleston, South Carolina. The vessel stopped at five additional stations as it
          transited through the Caribbean Sea (GS15–GS19) to the Panama Canal. In Panama, we sampled
          the freshwater Lake Gatun, which drains into the Panama Canal (GS20). The first of the
          eastern Pacific coastal stations GS21, GS22, and GS23 were sampled on the way to Cocos
          Island (~500 km southwest of Costa Rica), followed by a coastal Cocos Island sample
          (GS25). Near the island, ocean currents diverge and nutrient rich upwellings mix with warm
          surface waters to support a highly productive ecosystem. Cocos Island is distinctive in
          the eastern Pacific because it belongs to one of the first shallow undersea ridges in the
          region encountered by the easterly flowing North Equatorial Counter/Cross Current in the
          Far Eastern Pacific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b081">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b082">82</xref>]. After departing Cocos Island, the
          vessel continued southwest to the Galapagos Islands, stopping for an open ocean station
          (GS26). An intensive sampling program was then conducted in the Galapagos. The Galapagos
          Archipelago straddles the equator 960 km west of mainland Ecuador in the eastern Pacific.
          These islands are in a hydrographically complex region due to their proximity to the
          Equatorial Front and other major oceanic currents and regional front systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b083">83</xref>]. The coastal and marine parts of the
          Galapagos Islands ecosystem harbor an array of distinctive habitats, processes, and
          endemic species. Several distinct zones were targeted including a shallow-water, warm seep
          (GS30), below the thermocline in an upwelling zone (GS31), a coastal mangrove (GS32), and
          a hypersaline lagoon (GS33). The last stations were collected from open ocean sites (GS37
          and GS47) and a coral reef atoll lagoon (GS51) in the immense South Pacific Gyre. The open
          ocean samples come from a region of lower nutrient concentrations where picoplankton are
          thought to represent the single most abundant and important factor for biogeochemical
          structuring and nutrient cycling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b084">84</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b087">87</xref>]. In the atoll
          systems, ambient nutrients are higher, and bacteria are thought to constitute a large
          biomass that is one to three times as large as that of the phytoplankton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b088">88</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b090">90</xref>].</p>

          the turbidity of the water, was pumped through a 20-μm nytex prefilter into a 250-l

          was artificially set at the length of the dataset divided by 50 to allow unitigs of

          overlapped one another; if so, they were merged into a single pseudo-read that replaced
          the two original reads; further, only overlaps of 98% identity or higher were used to
          construct unitigs. A second assembly was conducted in the same fashion with the exception
          of using a 94% identity cutoff to construct unitigs. Finally, series of assemblies at

        <p>An all-against-all comparison of unassembled (but merged and duplicate-stripped)

          overlapper component of the Celera Assembler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b021">21</xref>]. The code was modified to find overlap alignments
          (global alignments allowing free end gaps) starting from pairs of reads that share an
          identical substring of at least 14 bp. An alignment extension was then performed with
          match/mismatch scores set to yield a positive outcome if an overlap alignment was found
          with ≥65% identity. Overlaps involving alignments of ≥40 bp were retained for various
          analyses. For the GOS dataset described here, this process resulted in a dataset of 1.2
          billion overlaps. Due to the 14-bp requirement and certain heuristics for early
          termination of apparently hopeless extensions, not all alignments at ≥65% were found. In
          addition, some of the lowest-identity overlaps are bound to be chance matches; however,
          this was a relatively uncommon event. Approximately one in 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> pairs of
          800-bp random sequences (all sites independent, A = C = G = T = 25%) can be aligned to
          overlap ≥40 bp at ≥65% identity using the same procedure. At a 70% cutoff, the value is

        <title>Extreme assembly.</title>
        <p>Like many assembly algorithms, the extreme assembler proceeds in three phases: overlap,
          layout, and consensus. The overlap phase is provided by the all-against-all comparison
          described above. The consensus phase is performed by a version of the Celera Assembler,
          modified to accept higher rates of mismatch. The layout phase begins with a single
          sequencing read (“seed”) that is chosen at random or specified by the user and is
          considered the “current” read. The following steps are performed off one or both ends of
          the seed. (1) Starting from the current fragment end, add the fragment with the best
          overlap off that end and mark the current fragment as “used,” thus making the added
          fragment the new current fragment. (2) Mark as used any alternative overlap that would
          have resulted in a shorter extension. The simplest notion of “best overlap” is simply the
          one having the highest identity alignment, but more complicated criteria have certain
          advantages. A simple but useful refinement is to favor fragments whose other ends have
          overlaps over those which are dead ends. For an unsupervised extreme assembly, when the
          sequence extension terminates because there are no more overlaps, a new unused fragment is
          chosen as the next seed and the process is repeated until all fragments have been marked
          used.</p>

          were filtered in several steps to identify the reads that were aligned over more or less
          their entire length. Reads had to be aligned for more than 300 bp at &gt;30% identity

          more than 100 bp at &gt;30% identity with less than 20 bp of overhang off either end.
          Identity was calculated ignoring gaps. In some instances a read might be placed, but the
          mate would not be placed under these criteria. In such cases, if 80% or more of the mate

        <p>Given a set of genes identified on the GOS sequences, we can identify the scaffolds on
          which these genes were annotated. A vector indicating the number of sequences contributed
          by every sample is determined for every gene. This vector reflects the number of sequences
          from every sample that assembled into the scaffold on which the gene was identified after
          normalizing for the proportion of scaffold covered by the gene. For example, if a 10-kb
          scaffold contains a 1-kb gene, then each sample will contribute one GOS sequence for every
          ten GOS sequences it contributed to the entire scaffold. The vectors are then summed and
          normalized to account for either the total number of GOS sequences obtained from each

          (identified as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b018">18</xref>]). Unless

        <p>The rate of discovery was estimated by determining the number of rearrangements in a

          (i.e., which were recruited in the correct orientation at the expected distance from each
          other). For a given read, if the mate was recruited at greater than or equal to 80%
          identity, then the expected amount of sequence examined should be the current (as opposed
          to mate) read length minus 500 bp. This produces an estimate of the search space to be ~47
          Mbp. Given 18 rearrangements, this leads to an estimate of one rearrangement per 2.6

        <title>Note Added in Proof</title>
        <p>Recently, Gomez-Consarnau et al. provided credible evidence for the biological role of
          proteorhodopsins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050077-b104">104</xref>]. These results
          indicate that proteorhodopsins blur the line between heterotrophic and autotrophic
          microbes by allowing a wide range of organisms to harness light energy for respiration and
          growth. This reinforces the notion that the differential distribution of proteorhodopsin
          variants identified here reflects functional adaptation to the wavelengths of available
          light. Furthermore, these adaptations may be driven by the makeup of the microbial
          community. Thus, these distributional differences could reflect competition between
          microbes for light resources.</p>
