<abstract>
<p>Neuronal oscillatory activity has been reported in relation to a wide range of cognitive processes including the encoding of external stimuli, attention, and learning. Although the specific role of these oscillations has yet to be determined, it is clear that neuronal oscillations are abundant in the central nervous system. This raises the question of the origin of these oscillations: are the mechanisms for generating these oscillations genetically hard-wired or can they be acquired via a learning process? Here, we study the conditions under which oscillatory activity emerges through a process of spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) in a feed-forward architecture. First, we analyze the effect of oscillations on STDP-driven synaptic dynamics of a single synapse, and study how the parameters that characterize the STDP rule and the oscillations affect the resultant synaptic weight. Next, we analyze STDP-driven synaptic dynamics of a pre-synaptic population of neurons onto a single post-synaptic cell. The pre-synaptic neural population is assumed to be oscillating at the same frequency, albeit with different phases, such that the net activity of the pre-synaptic population is constant in time. Thus, in the homogeneous case in which all synapses are equal, the post-synaptic neuron receives constant input and hence does not oscillate. To investigate the transition to oscillatory activity, we develop a mean-field Fokker-Planck approximation of the synaptic dynamics. We analyze the conditions causing the homogeneous solution to lose its stability. The findings show that oscillatory activity appears through a mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking. However, in the general case the homogeneous solution is unstable, and the synaptic dynamics does not converge to a different fixed point, but rather to a limit cycle. We show how the temporal structure of the STDP rule determines the stability of the homogeneous solution and the drift velocity of the limit cycle.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Oscillatory activity in the brain has been described in relation to many cognitive states and tasks, including the encoding of external stimuli, attention, learning and consolidation of memory. However, without tuning of synaptic weights with the preferred phase of firing the oscillatory signal may not be able to propagate downstream—due to distractive interference. Here we investigate how synaptic plasticity can facilitate the transmission of oscillatory signal downstream along the information processing pathway in the brain. We show that basic synaptic plasticity rules, that have been reported empirically, are sufficient to generate the required tuning that enables the propagation of the oscillatory signal. In addition, our work presents a synaptic learning process that does not converge to a stationary state, but rather remains dynamic. We demonstrate how the functionality of the system, i.e., transmission of oscillatory activity, can be maintained in the face of constant remodeling of synaptic weights.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is generally believed that synaptic plasticity is the basis for learning and memory. According to Hebb's rule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004878.ref001">1</xref>], which is considered the foundation for current views on learning and memory, the interaction strength between two neurons that are co-activated potentiates. This rule has been extended to the temporal domain by taking into account the effect of the causal relation of pre- and post-synaptic firing on the potentiation and depression of the synapse, which is known as spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). STDP has been identified in numerous systems in the brain, and a rich repertoire of causal relations has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004878.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004878.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Considerable theoretical efforts have been devoted to investigating the possible computational implications of STDP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004878.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004878.ref029">29</xref>]. STDP can be thought of as a process of unsupervised learning (for other views such as reward modulated STDP see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004878.ref030">30</xref>], for example). It has been shown that certain STDP rules can give rise to the emergence of response selectivity at the level of the post-synaptic neuron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004878.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004878.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004878.ref020">20</xref>], whereas other STDP rules can provide a homeostatic mechanism that balances the excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004878.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004878.ref029">29</xref>]. Furthermore, STDP in combination with other plasticity rules has been shown to lead to structure formation in networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004878.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004878.ref032">32</xref>].</p>
<p>Although 'spike-timing' is explicitly emphasized by the term STDP, most theoretical studies have focused on very basic temporal structures of neuronal activity. Many studies, for example, assume that neuronal firing follows homogeneous Poisson process statistics and that the correlations are instantaneous in time (with a possible small time shift to reflect delayed reactions). However, neuronal oscillatory activity has been reported in such cognitive processes as the encoding of external stimuli, attention, learning and consolidation of memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004878.ref033">33</xref>]. Thus, although the specific role of these oscillations in the learning process remains to be determined, it is clear that neuronal oscillations are abundant in the central nervous system. This raises the question of the mechanisms that generate these oscillations: are they genetically hard-wired into the system or can they be acquired via a learning process?</p>
<p>The effect and possible computational role of oscillations on STDP has been addressed in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004878.ref034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004878.ref042">42</xref>]. However, in all of these studies the oscillatory activity was either an inherent property of the neuron or inherited via feed-forward connections from inputs that were oscillating and had a clear preferred phase. A recent numerical study indicated that oscillations may emerge in a large scale detailed thalamocortical model with STDP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004878.ref043">43</xref>]. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether STDP can give rise to the emergence of oscillatory activity by itself, and if so, under what conditions.</p>
<p>This paper is organized as follows. First, we define the STDP rule and the architecture of the feed-forward model network. Next, we examine the learning dynamics of a single plastic synapse onto a post-synaptic cell, for the case where both pre- and post-synaptic neurons are oscillating. We then investigate the emergence of oscillations in a post-synaptic cell as a result of STDP in a population of feed-forward inputs each of which are oscillating, albeit in different phases such that their net contribution has no defined oscillatory behavior. In this case, if the synaptic weights are uniform or random then the total input to the post-synaptic neuron will have none or very little oscillatory component. We analyze the stability of the homogeneous solution, and show that when the homogeneous solution is not stable the post- synaptic neuron begins to oscillate. However, the synaptic weights themselves do not converge to a fixed point, but rather to a <italic>limit cycle</italic> solution. Finally, we discuss our results and suggest an intuitive explanation for the limit cycle solution.</p>

<p>The structure of the profile, and in particular the ‘preferred phase’, is governed by the temporal kernel of the STDP rule.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004878.g004">Fig 4A</xref> shows the synaptic weight profile at different times. The red line depicts the weight profile averaged over the first minute, and is not identically flat due to the inherent stochasticity of the learning dynamics. Due to such random fluctuations a small preference for a certain phase is generated, which in turn is then amplified by the synaptic dynamics (<italic>m</italic><sub>1</sub>&gt;0). As a result, after several minutes of STDP-driven dynamics the synaptic weights profile developed a pronounced phase preference. However, this profile was not stable, but rather drifted in time, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004878.g004">Fig 4B</xref>.</p>

<title>The case of zero drift velocity</title>
<p>The zero drift velocity corresponds to a fixed point solution for the synaptic weights. In this case, the input to the post-synaptic neuron is a weighted sum of inhomogeneous Poisson processes that the intensities of which are each cosine modulated in time. Hence, the total input to the post-synaptic neuron is also cosine modulated.

Part of the reason for such minor influences of this non-linearity is that higher order Fourier modes of the post-synaptic activity are orthogonal to the pre-synaptic activity.</p>
<p>How can one understand intuitively the source of this drifting behavior? Consider the case of a temporally symmetric Mexican hat STDP rule (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004878.e005">eq (5)</xref> with <italic>T</italic><sub>+</sub> = T<sub>−</sub>: = <italic>T</italic> = 0, red line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004878.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). This rule potentiates synapses with a similar phase preference as the post-synaptic neuron see e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004878.g002">Fig 2A2</xref>. Let us assume that by some mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking the synaptic weight profile develops a preferred phase, and without loss of generality assume <italic>ψ</italic> = 0, the vertical gray dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004878.g006">Fig 6B</xref>. Consequently, the post-synaptic neuron will oscillate with a phase <italic>φ</italic><sub><italic>post</italic></sub> = <italic>ψ</italic> + <italic>dν</italic>, the vertical blue dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004878.g006">Fig 6B</xref>. This in turn will cause the synaptic dynamics to generate a ‘force’ that will pull the peak of the weight profile, <italic>ψ</italic>, towards <italic>φ</italic><sub><italic>post</italic></sub> = <italic>ψ</italic> + <italic>dν</italic> and hence, will induce a positive drift velocity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>STDP is known to be able to act as an unsupervised learning algorithm that learns prominent features of the input layer (pre-synaptic population) statistic; namely, the spatial structure of the correlations. Via a local synaptic STDP learning rule, spatial (or stimulus) selectivity can emerge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004878.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004878.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004878.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004878.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004878.ref047">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004878.ref049">49</xref>]. Here, we focused on temporal aspects and showed how temporal selectivity may emerge. Specifically, we found that although the net activity of the input layer (pre-synaptic population) was constant in time, the homogeneous state was not always stable and the post-synaptic neuron developed temporal phase preferences via a mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking. This instability depends on the sign of the real part of the Fourier transform of the STDP rule (potentiation minus depression) which is time shifted by the post-synaptic delay <italic>d</italic> at angular frequency <italic>ν</italic> (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004878.e070">eq (33)</xref>). However, in contrast to previous studies, we found that in many cases this selectivity is not static, but rather it drifts in time.</p>
<p>One can view <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004878.g006">Fig 6B</xref> as a graphic illustration of a search for a self-consistent solution with zero drift. Assume that the post-synaptic neuron oscillates at some constant phase, without loss of generality <italic>φ</italic><sub><italic>post</italic></sub> = 0. The STDP will shape the synaptic weight profile symmetrically around <italic>φ</italic><sub><italic>post</italic></sub> according to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004878.e090">eq (40)</xref>, the black line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004878.g006">Fig 6B</xref>. Accordingly, the synaptic weight profile and the <italic>input</italic> to the post synaptic neuron will have a phase of <italic>ψ</italic> = <italic>φ</italic><sub><italic>post</italic></sub> = 0, the vertical dashed gray line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004878.g006">Fig 6B</xref>. However, the response of the post neuron to its inputs dictates <italic>φ</italic><sub><italic>post</italic></sub> = <italic>ψ</italic> + <italic>dν</italic> (shown by the vertical blue line), which is inconsistent with our initial assumption <italic>φ</italic><sub><italic>post</italic></sub> = 0. In order to satisfy the self-consistent condition we need to introduce a temporal shift to the STDP rule (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004878.e005">eq (5)</xref> with <italic>T</italic><sub>+</sub> = <italic>T</italic><sub>−</sub> ≡<italic>T ≠</italic> 0) that will align the initial assumption of the post phase at <italic>φ</italic><sub><italic>post</italic></sub> = 0 with <italic>ψ</italic> + <italic>dν</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004878.g006">Fig 6C</xref>. Further increases in the temporal shift <italic>T</italic> of the STDP rule will generate a ‘force’ that will pull the weight profile to the left and will result in a negative drift velocity, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004878.g006">Fig 6D</xref>.</p>
<p>A quasi-periodic behavior of synaptic weights has been observed in the past. Gilson and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004878.ref048">48</xref>], studied the effect of general correlation structure on STDP-driven synaptic dynamics. Analyzing the homogeneous fixed point they assumed the synaptic dynamics will flow in the direction of the strongest spectral component (of the input layer correlations), and consequently will converge to a stable fixed point that will reflect the structure of the spectral component. In the additive learning rule (i.e., <italic>μ</italic> = 0) or in the case where the neuronal response covariance is negative the existence of a stable fixed point is not guaranteed. Thus, it was shown that for the special case of additive STDP synaptic dynamics may be dominated by eigenvalues with large imaginary part that will result in quasi periodic behavior. This pathology disappears for any positive <italic>μ</italic>.</p>
<p>Here, the limit cycle solution is not a pathology but a robust feature of the synaptic dynamics (see for example limit cycle solution with <italic>μ</italic> &gt; 0 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004878.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The main difference from the work of Gilson and colleagues is that, typically, here there is no stable fixed point solution (note that response covariance of input layer neurons can be negative). Even in the special case where a non-homogeneous fixed point exists it is: One, Not generic but requires a set of parameters that will solve <italic>V</italic> = 0. Two, due to the inherent <italic>U</italic>(1) symmetry of the problem this solution will be only marginally stable.</p>
<p>Theoretical investigations of STDP typically derive non-linear equations for the dynamics of the synaptic weights. In general, non-linear dynamics is known to give rise to a wide range of behaviors, including convergence to a fixed point, line attractors, oscillatory activity, and chaos. However, to the best of our knowledge, the existing theoretical research describes STDP as a process that relaxes to a steady state fixed point (except for pathological cases). On the other hand, empirical findings show synaptic dynamics as highly volatile and even chaotic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004878.ref050">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004878.ref058">58</xref>]. This raises the question of how can the central nervous system retain its functionality in the face of constant remodeling of synaptic weights? Here we have shown an example in which synaptic weights did not converge to a stable fixed point, but rather remained dynamic. Yet, functionality, in this case oscillating activity of the post-synaptic neuron, was maintained as an emergent property of global order parameters <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004878.e096"><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi.1004878.e096g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004878.e096" xlink:type="simple"/><mml:math display="inline" id="M96"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004878.e097"><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi.1004878.e097g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004878.e097" xlink:type="simple"/><mml:math display="inline" id="M97"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mo>˜</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> that converge to a stable fixed point.</p>
