<p>Conformational ensembles are increasingly recognized as a useful representation to describe fundamental relationships between protein structure, dynamics and function. Here we present an ensemble of ubiquitin in solution that is created by sampling conformational space without experimental information using “Backrub” motions inspired by alternative conformations observed in sub-Angstrom resolution crystal structures. Backrub-generated structures are then selected to produce an ensemble that optimizes agreement with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) Residual Dipolar Couplings (RDCs). Using this ensemble, we probe two proposed relationships between properties of protein ensembles: (i) a link between native-state dynamics and the conformational heterogeneity observed in crystal structures, and (ii) a relation between dynamics of an individual protein and the conformational variability explored by its natural family. We show that the Backrub motional mechanism can simultaneously explore protein native-state dynamics measured by RDCs, encompass the conformational variability present in ubiquitin complex structures and facilitate sampling of conformational and sequence variability matching those occurring in the ubiquitin protein family. Our results thus support an overall relation between protein dynamics and conformational changes enabling sequence changes in evolution. More practically, the presented method can be applied to improve protein design predictions by accounting for intrinsic native-state dynamics.</p>

<p>Knowledge of protein properties is essential for enhancing the understanding and engineering of biological functions. One key property of proteins is their flexibility—their intrinsic ability to adopt different conformations. This flexibility can be measured experimentally but the measurements are indirect and computational models are required to interpret them. Here we develop a new computational method for interpreting these measurements of flexibility and use it to create a model of flexibility of the protein ubiquitin. We apply our results to show relationships between the flexibility of one protein and the diversity of structures and amino acid sequences of the protein's evolutionary family. Thus, our results show that more accurate computational modeling of protein flexibility is useful for improving prediction of a broader range of amino acid sequences compatible with a given protein. Our method will be helpful for advancing methods to rationally engineer protein functions by enabling sampling of conformational and sequence diversity similar to that of a protein's evolutionary family.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It has long been known that a protein's native state is best represented as an ensemble of conformations rather than as a single structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Hartmann1">[1]</xref>. Conformational ensembles provide a detailed structural picture of protein dynamics. As motions are crucial for many aspects of protein function, such as molecular recognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Lee1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Lange1">[4]</xref> and catalysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-WolfWatz1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Schnell1">[10]</xref>, an ensemble description of proteins is also useful for improving applications of molecular modeling such as protein-small molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Wei1">[11]</xref> and protein-protein docking methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Chaudhury1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Prasad1">[13]</xref> as well as protein design <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Fu1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Liang1">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>Two related concepts characterizing and interpreting properties of protein conformational ensembles have been proposed: The first suggests a correspondence between the conformational heterogeneity present in crystal structures and the native-state dynamics of proteins observed in simulations and using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. Several studies provide support for this idea. Zoete et al. concluded that the conformational changes present in a large number of crystal structures of HIV-1 protease reflect the inherent flexibility of the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Zoete1">[20]</xref>. Vendruscolo and coworkers showed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Best1">[21]</xref> that side chain relaxation order parameters, reflecting motions on the picosecond to nanosecond time scale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Bremi1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-LeMaster1">[28]</xref>, could be described using ensembles of crystal structures of the same protein or proteins with high sequence identity. Similarly, modeling “Backrub” motions, a type of conformational change inspired by alternate side chain and backbone conformations observed in high-resolution crystal structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Davis1">[29]</xref>, has led to improvements in modeling NMR side chain relaxation order parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Friedland1">[30]</xref>, side chain conformations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Smith1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Georgiev1">[32]</xref> and structural changes upon mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Smith1">[31]</xref>. Lange et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Lange1">[4]</xref> showed that ensembles derived from ensemble-average-restraint molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of ubiquitin using Residual Dipolar Coupling (RDC) data describing picosecond to millisecond motions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Chou1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Zhang1">[41]</xref> encompassed conformations similar to those of ubiquitin in different crystal structures alone and in complex with different partner proteins. These findings support the idea that conformational states pre-existing in solution are selected upon binding. Strong experimental evidence for this conformational selection model was also provided earlier by Wright and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Boehr2">[42]</xref> validating previous theoretical suggestions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Ma1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Tsai1">[44]</xref>.</p>
<p>The second concept proposes a link between the dynamics of a single protein and the conformational variability explored within its family of homologous proteins. This link was suggested based on the similar conformational variability observed in an MD simulation of myoglobin and in structures of different members of the globin family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Elber1">[45]</xref>. Similarly, Gaussian network models have suggested common dynamical features of proteins in the same family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Keskin1">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Maguid1">[47]</xref>. Recently, Lee and colleagues proposed that side chain dynamics measured by NMR relaxation are conserved across members of the PDZ domain family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Law1">[48]</xref>. Several studies extended the notion of a relationship between the dynamics of a single protein and properties of its homologs to the sequence level, showing that modeled sequences consistent with a single protein structure had characteristics in common with a multiple sequence alignment of the protein's natural family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Kuhlman1">[49]</xref>. Further investigating the relation between protein dynamics and family sequence variability, other work suggested that sequence diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Georgiev1">[32]</xref> and overlap between modeled and evolutionarily observed sequences could be increased by incorporating conformational flexibility of the protein backbone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Fu1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Ding1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Saunders1">[50]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Larson2">[51]</xref>.</p>
<p>To combine the two concepts outlined above, here we ask whether conformational ensembles reflecting variability observed in protein crystal structures of a single sequence can be simultaneously related to experimentally determined native-state solution dynamics of an individual protein, and to the conformational and sequence variability of the protein's family. To address these questions, we investigate two related hypotheses using ubiquitin as a model system: First, we test whether ensembles generated using the Backrub motional mechanism (“Backrub ensembles”), a model inspired by heterogeneity observed in experimental protein structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Davis1">[29]</xref>, capture properties of ubiquitin solution state dynamics derived from amide backbone RDC measurements in 23 alignment media <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Lakomek1">[35]</xref>. The motions modeled using the Backrub mechanism are related to those described by the 1D-Gaussian Axial Fluctuation (GAF) approach, which has been used to model residual dipolar coupling (RDC) measurements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Bernado1">[52]</xref>. Furthermore, we compare the structural variation in modeled Backrub ensembles to that seen in a set of 46 crystal structures of ubiquitin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Lange1">[4]</xref>. Second, we test whether the conformational heterogeneity present in Backrub ensembles that are consistent with the solution dynamics of an individual ubiquitin sequence resembles the structural diversity observed in the UBQ subfamily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Kiel1">[53]</xref>. Furthermore, we predict sequences compatible with ubiquitin Backrub ensembles using computational protein design as implemented in Rosetta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Kuhlman2">[54]</xref> and test whether these sequences are similar to the sequences of the UBQ subfamily.</p>
<p>Supporting our hypotheses, we find Backrub ensembles that are simultaneously consistent with native-state dynamics reflected in RDC measurements, the conformational variability observed in ubiquitin complex structures, and the conformational and sequence diversity of ubiquitin homologs. As an additional validation of our approach, we show that Backrub ensembles give similar agreement with the RDC data as ensembles generated from RDC-restrained MD simulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Lange1">[4]</xref>, and support previous observations of ubiquitin core flexibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Best1">[21]</xref> and binding by conformational selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Lange1">[4]</xref>. Notably, we discover that a common set of Backrub sampling parameters are simultaneously able to best fit the RDC data and allow sampling of sequences most similar to those of the ubiquitin family. Our method to model Backrub ensembles and sequences consistent with these ensembles may thus be useful for providing insights into the relationship between native state dynamics and sequence diversity and for characterizing evolutionary sequence changes. These results also support the idea that Backrub ensembles will be useful for engineering new protein functions through experimental selection from computationally designed libraries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Treynor1">[55]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Humphris1">[56]</xref> that contain sequences accommodated by exploiting intrinsic native-state dynamics.</p>

<p>We set out to investigate the hypothesized relations between conformational changes reflecting observed heterogeneity in protein crystal structures, native-state protein dynamics and evolutionarily sampled conformational and sequence diversity in two steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000393-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>First, to test relation 1, we generated ensemble descriptions of ubiquitin dynamics using the Rosetta scoring function and several parameterizations of the Backrub motional model (described below) without using experimental restraints. Subsequently we selected ensembles according to their agreement with RDC measurements (Test 1). This approach is significantly different from many of the methods applied earlier to find ensembles compatible with NMR restraints <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Lange1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Richter1">[57]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-LindorffLarsen1">[58]</xref>, which incorporated experimental data directly in the refinement process. Similar to previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Lange1">[4]</xref>, we compare the resulting Backrub-generated conformational ensembles with an ensemble of 46 crystal structures of ubiquitin (Test 2).</p>
<p>Second, we use the insight gained from the comparison of Backrub ensembles with characteristics of solution-state dynamics to evaluate relation 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000393-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We investigate whether Backrub ensembles that sample the conformational space available on the RDC timescale have similar conformational variability to that explored by ubiquitin homologs (Test 3). Moreover, we test whether sequences consistent with Backrub ensembles fitting RDC measurements of a single ubiquitin sequence, as predicted by computational protein design using Rosetta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Kuhlman2">[54]</xref>, show overlap with the sequences of the natural UBQ subfamily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Kiel1">[53]</xref> (Test 4).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Strategy to test relation 1</title>
<p>To test relation 1, our approach first uses unrestrained conformational sampling with the Backrub motional model to generate a large set of initial conformations, starting from the ubiquitin crystal structure (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1UBQ). We use a Monte Carlo protocol consisting of rotamer changes and Backrub moves. Backrub moves involve selection of a random peptide segment, followed by a rigid body rotation of all atoms in that segment about an axis defined by the endpoint C-alpha atoms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Smith1">[31]</xref>. The peptide segment length is chosen at random to be either 2 or 3 residues (denoted in the following as “maximum segment length of 3”; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000393-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) or between 2–12 residues (“maximum segment length of 12”; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000393-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). 10,000 Backrub-Monte-Carlo simulations are run to generate 10,000 possible conformations in an initial set (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> for details). The Backrub motional mechanism thus directly accounts for correlated motions of continuous peptide segments of up to length 3 or 12. Applying these moves repeatedly in randomly chosen regions of the protein using Monte Carlo sampling allows for correlated motions of residues distant in sequence yet close in tertiary structure. Correlations between side-chain and backbone dynamics have also been observed in numerous NMR studies, such as for Ribonuclease H on the relaxation time scale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Mandel1">[59]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Mandel2">[60]</xref> and on the RDC time scale for ubiquitin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Lakomek3">[61]</xref> and Protein G <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Bouvignies1">[38]</xref>.</p>

<p>Subsequently we select ensembles from the resulting structures based on their agreement to the RDC measurements as measured by the Q-factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000393-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), defined as:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000393.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>An ensemble selection approach similar to the one described above has been successfully applied to model relaxation order parameters using snapshots from MD trajectories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Chen1">[62]</xref>. In the following sections, “RDC-optimized” ensembles are defined as those undergoing the Q-factor optimization process described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000393-g002">Figure 2C</xref> and “non-RDC-optimized” ensembles are generated by choosing random ensembles of 50 structures.</p>
<p>To validate our approach, we compare the Backrub-generated conformational ensembles to reference methods such as snapshots from an MD simulation in explicit solvent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Wong1">[63]</xref> and a set of representations of the dynamics commonly used to interpret the motional information present in RDC measurements. One such representation uses the ‘model-free’ formalism, which provides five parameters describing the movement of each residue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Lakomek1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Meiler1">[64]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Tolman2">[66]</xref>. Another approach is ensemble-average-restrained (EAR) molecular dynamics, in which an ensemble of molecules (the “EROS” ensemble) is optimized with respect to a molecular mechanics force field potential in combination with ensemble-average restraints on the NMR measurements, including RDCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Lange1">[4]</xref>. We reason that sampling methods that result in low Q-factors more closely approximate the conformational space relevant to motions on the RDC timescale than other models that describe the experimental data less well.</p>

<title>Correspondence between Backrub conformational ensembles and RDC measurements of ubiquitin dynamics (Test 1)</title>
<p>We first tested whether Q-factors of Backrub ensembles selected according to the strategy described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000393-g002">Figure 2C</xref> decreased as the ensemble size was increased (2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 structures per ensemble). This behavior would be expected if our description captures dynamical information contained in the measurements. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000393-g003">Figure 3A</xref> shows the Q-factors of RDC-optimized ensembles of varying size generated with a Backrub maximum segment length of 12 and a simulation temperature of kT = 1.2 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). There is a clear trend that the Q-factors of RDC-optimized ensembles decrease as the ensemble size increases. This trend indicates that adding more structures allows a better representation of the RDC measurements and further suggests that these ensembles are representative of conformations that are populated on the timescale of the experiments (even though the Monte Carlo simulations are agnostic to timescale). This result is not simply explained by inclusion of more degrees of freedom and overfitting, as cross-validation analysis supports an optimal ensemble size of around 50 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000393.s010">Table S1</xref>). We use this ensemble size in the experiments below.</p>

<title>Varying the temperature and the maximum segment length affects the agreement of RDC-optimized Backrub ensembles with RDC measurements</title>
<p>The RDC-optimized Backrub ensemble described above has a Q-factor of 0.086 over regions of regular secondary structure (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) and was found by comparing motional models using different Backrub sampling parameters. The first Backrub parameter we varied was the maximum segment length (as described above and illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000393-g002">Figure 2A and B</xref>, the longest peptide segment rotated about an axis defined by the segment endpoint C-alpha atoms). The Backrub conformational change observed in ultra-high resolution X-ray structures consisted of concerted 2- and 3-residue Backrub moves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Davis1">[29]</xref>; thus we first tested a maximum segment length of 3. In a previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Friedland1">[30]</xref>, we showed that ensembles of structures generated using this maximum segment length improved predictions of side-chain relaxation order parameters. To test the relevance of larger-scale changes, we also tested a maximum segment length of 12, which included moves of all intermediate segment lengths from 2–12. To measure the effect of varying the amplitude of motion, we tested a range of temperatures for the Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations from kT = 0.3 to 4.8. Each simulation was run for 10,000 steps. The resulting mean pair-wise root mean squared deviations (RMSDs) to the ubiquitin X-ray structure 1UBQ of the Backrub ensembles spanned the range of 0.2 Å to 0.5 Å for the maximum segment length of 3 simulations, and spanned the range of 0.3 Å to 3.2 Å for the maximum segment length of 12 simulations (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> for details).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000393-g003">Figures 3B</xref> shows the RDC-optimized ensembles of size 50 with lowest Q-factor for different initial Backrub starting sets of 10,000 structures with maximum segment length of 12 and different simulation temperatures. Simulation temperatures of kT = 0.3, 0.6, 1.2, 2.4 and 4.8 gave mean pair-wise RMSD values to the ubiquitin X-ray structure 1UBQ of 0.3 Å, 0.5 Å, 0.9 Å, 2.1 Å and 3.2 Å, respectively. For the maximum segment length of 12, the lowest Q factor is 0.086 at kT = 1.2 and for the maximum segment length of 3 the lowest Q factor is 0.089 at kT = 2.4 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000393.s011">Table S2</xref> for results for all parameters). To compare these two ensembles, we performed cross-validation with four RDC datasets of N-C′ couplings and four datasets of H-C′ couplings (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> for details). The resulting R<sub>free</sub> values for these ensembles were 18.0% and 21.3%, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000393.s010">Table S1</xref>). Thus the ensemble generated using a maximum segment length of 12 appears to be a better representation of the dynamics in the RDC measurements; we focus on this ensemble in the analyses below.</p>
<p>The structural variability of the ensemble is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000393-g004">Figure 4A</xref>.

<title>RDC-optimized Backrub ensembles match RDC measurements comparably to or better than other methods</title>
<p>We compared the Q-factor of the RDC-optimized Backrub ensemble to the Q-factors from various other ubiquitin ensembles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000393-g003">Figure 3C</xref>): the Self-Consistent RDC-based Model-free (SCRM) description (an analytical description of the RDCs with five parameters per residue that does not provide an explicit all atom structural representation of the motions) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Lakomek1">[35]</xref>, an ensemble of 46 X-ray structures of ubiquitin alone and in different complexes (henceforth called the ubiquitin X-ray ensemble) as used in reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Lange1">[4]</xref>, three sets of NMR structures (1D3Z, 1UD7, and 1G6J), three molecular dynamics (MD) ensemble-average-restraint (EAR) ensembles (1XQQ, 2NR2, EROS PDB code 2K39) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Lange1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Richter1">[57]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-LindorffLarsen1">[58]</xref>, and snapshots from a 100-nanosecond MD simulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Wong1">[63]</xref>. We also examined the root mean squared error in the RDCs as a measure of quality of fit, and the results were similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000393.s002">Figure S1A</xref>). The RDC-optimized Backrub ensemble has lower Q-factors than ensembles generated using other methods, except for the SCRM description <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Lakomek1">[35]</xref> and the EROS ensemble, both of which were fit with the same dataset of RDC measurements as the Backrub ensembles. Not surprisingly, the SCRM Q-factor is the lowest because it is an analytical description fit to the RDCs. The EROS ensemble was created with an approach where the RDCs are incorporated into the potential function of an ensemble MD simulation and this approach gives very low Q-factors. An analysis of structural quality measures of Backrub and other conformational ensembles is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000393.s001">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000393.s003">Figure S2</xref>. The RDC-optimized Backrub ensembles also have similar R<sub>free</sub> values from cross-validation: 18.0%, 16.1%, 20.0%, 17.8%, and 23.3%, respectively for the RDC-optimized Backrub ensemble, the EROS ensemble, the 1D3Z structures, the ubiquitin X-ray ensemble and the ensemble of MD snapshots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000393.s010">Table S1</xref>).</p>
<p>One important criterion with which the various ensembles of ubiquitin can be assessed, as mentioned above, is whether an ensemble matches the RDCs better than any single structure within it. If this is the case, dynamical information contained in the experimental measurements can be interpreted by analyzing the conformational variability in the ensemble. The RDC-optimized Backrub ensemble, the MD-EAR ensembles (1XQQ, 2NR2 and EROS PDB code: 2K39) and, the ubiquitin X-ray ensemble and the ensemble of MD structures have improved Q-factors over the best single structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000393-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). The two MD-EAR ensembles that were fit to relaxation NMR measurements (1XQQ and 2NR2) have small fractional improvement in Q-factor, suggesting that the dynamic information present in the RDCs may be different from the information present on the shorter time scale relaxation measurements; this observation is supported by the different pattern of order parameters observed between these two classes of measurements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Lakomek1">[35]</xref>. The Backrub and the EROS ensembles show the largest fractional Q-factor improvement. Note that this does not contradict the fact that Backrub moves were able to improve modeling of faster time-scale picosecond-nanosecond side-chain motions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Friedland1">[30]</xref>; the Backrub ensembles used in our previous work were not selected for agreement with the RDCs and the simulation temperature used was lower, resulting in smaller motional amplitudes.</p>
<p>The three sets of NMR structures (1D3Z, 1UD7, and 1G6J) do not show an improvement in the Q-factor over the best single structure. For the 1D3Z NMR structures, a subset of the RDCs were used in the refinement and, as a result, the Q-factor (Q = 0.107; calculated over all 23 datasets used in this paper) is lower than for the other NMR structures. The Q-factor of the lowest single 1D3Z NMR structure indicates that the 1D3Z NMR structure is a good representation of the average structure.</p>
<p>We also used the strategy described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000393-g002">Figure 2C</xref> to generate RDC-optimized ensembles consisting of structures from the various ubiquitin ensembles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000393.s002">Figure S1B</xref>). The Q-factor decreased substantially for the ubiquitin X-ray ensemble (34% lower Q-factor), the MD-EAR ensembles, (41%, 49% and 31% decrease in Q-factor for 1XQQ, 2NR2, and EROS, respectively) and the ensemble of snapshots from the 100-ns MD simulation (64% decrease). These findings are consistent with the results above that all ensemble types except the three sets of NMR structures provide insight into the RDC dynamics. The Q factors of the RDC-optimized ensembles of ubiquitin X-ray structures (Q = 0.089) and the MD snapshots (Q = 0.069) are quite similar to the Q factors of the best RDC-optimized Backrub ensemble. This latter result suggests that the 100 ns explicit water MD simulation, although short in comparison to the RDC timescale, may allow regions of ubiquitin to locally sample conformations in agreement with the RDC measurements; this is consistent with the observation from other studies that relatively short MD simulations capture a significant fraction of the motions measured by RDCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Nederveen1">[67]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Showalter1">[68]</xref>. Longer timescales or analyses of multiple trajectories may be needed to sample combinations of these conformations throughout the ubiquitin structure. This idea was suggested by Henzer-Wildman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-HenzlerWildman1">[8]</xref> to explain the ability of adenylate kinase to sample substates in nanoseconds along the open-closed trajectory that exchanged on the order of micro- to milliseconds.</p>

<title>Correspondence of conformational variability in Backrub ensembles and structural heterogeneity of ubiquitin in multiple crystal structures (Test 2)</title>
<p>To characterize the conformational variability of different regions of the protein in our ensembles, we calculated C-alpha difference distance matrices (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000393.s004">Figure S3A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Elber1">[45]</xref>. These matrices show the motion of each residue with respect to all other residues. For clarity, we collapse these matrices onto a single dimension that represents the average C-alpha difference distance with respect to other residues in the protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000393.s004">Figure S3B</xref>). This metric is sensitive to motions relative to those of other residues in the ensemble, as opposed to C-alpha RMSD, which is sensitive to changes relative to one conformation in the ensemble. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000393-g004">Figures 4B and 4D</xref> show these C-alpha difference distance values mapped onto the ubiquitin structure (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).</p>
<p>Supporting relation 1, the pattern of motion of the ubiquitin X-ray ensemble and the RDC-optimized Backrub ensemble show substantial similarities. In both these ensembles the most flexible regions are the C-terminal end of the helix and the N-terminal end of beta strand 2. This result is consistent with the suggestion of Lange et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Lange1">[4]</xref> that the native state dynamics of ubiquitin encompass the conformational flexibility found in crystal structures of ubiquitin bound to different partners, supporting a conformational selection model for binding. Moreover, the patterns of motions of the RDC-optimized Backrub ensemble are similar to the EROS and the MD ensembles despite their different amplitudes. In addition, RDC-optimized and non-RDC-optimized ensembles are similar to each other with respect to the average C-alpha difference distance matrices shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000393-g004">Figure 4B</xref>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000393.s001">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000393.s005">Figure S4</xref> give a more detailed comparison of RDC-optimized and non-RDC-optimized conformational ensembles.</p>
<p>We also investigated the differences between the RDC-optimized Backrub and the ubiquitin X-ray ensemble flexibilities in light of the errors in the calculated RDC values in these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000393-g004">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000393.s004">Figure S3C</xref>). The differences in flexibility of these ensembles are mainly around the C-terminus of beta strand 1 and the alpha-helix. In the C-terminal tail of beta strand 1, residue 6 has some of the highest errors in the Backrub ensemble. Since the flexibility is low in this region in both the X-ray ensemble and the EROS ensemble, the Backrub model may overestimate the flexibility. In the helix, the relative amplitude of flexibility is also higher in the Backrub ensemble than in the X-ray ensemble; however, the pattern of flexibility is quite similar (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000393.s004">Figure S3C</xref>). Interestingly, the helix C-terminal residues in the X-ray ensemble show less agreement between experimental and back-calculated RDCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000393.s004">Figure S3C</xref>), implying that the high flexibility in this region for the Backrub ensemble is likely to be a better representation of the RDC data. This observation agrees with the amplitude and pattern of flexibility in this region of the EROS ensemble. In addition, we observe correspondingly higher flexibility in the helix in a structural alignment of members of the ubiquitin family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000393-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), as discussed further below (Test 3).</p>
<p>As a final point of comparison, we applied a Gaussian network model (GNM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Yang1">[69]</xref>. These models have been used to describe slow motions in proteins. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000393-g004">Figure 4C</xref> shows the GNM computed B-factors mapped onto the ubiquitin structure, displaying conformational variability similar to the other methods and the X-ray ensemble, although some differences compared to the X-ray ensemble are apparent, such as along the alpha-helix and in beta strand 2.</p>

<title>Structural and functional insights from ubiquitin conformational ensembles</title>
<p>We showed above that our RDC-optimized Backrub ensemble (i) gives similar Q-factors to reference ensembles including an RDC-restrained MD ensemble (EROS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Lange1">[4]</xref>, a ubiquitin X-ray ensemble and an ensemble of snapshots from a 100-nanosecond MD trajectory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Wong1">[63]</xref> and (ii) has similar regions of structural variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000393-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). As an additional point of comparison and validation of our approach, we asked whether the RDC-optimized Backrub ensemble also supports other structural and functional insights derived from previous ensemble descriptions of ubiquitin. Lindorff-Larsen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-LindorffLarsen1">[58]</xref> as well as Richter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Richter1">[57]</xref> used MD simulations with side chain and backbone relaxation order parameters as restraints. These ensembles displayed liquid-like flexibility of side chains buried in the protein core. The RDC-optimized Backrub ensemble also has this property, with buried or near buried residues 13, 23, 44, 61, and 67 correctly modeled as flexible with calculated order parameters close to their respective values from NMR relaxation experiments. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000393-g005">Figure 5</xref>, Ile 13 chi2, Ile 44 chi2, and Leu 67 chi2 have modeled order parameters within 0.04 of the experimental values. Ile 13 chi 1 and Ile 61 chi2 have modeled order parameters that are substantially lower than the experimental values but these differences can be due to the short timescale of the relaxation measurements compared to the longer timescale of the RDCs fit by the RDC-optimized Backrub ensemble. (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000393.s006">Figure S5</xref> for comparison to more side chains analyzed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-LindorffLarsen1">[58]</xref>.) Side chain order parameters derived from the 100 ns MD simulation discussed earlier are also shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000393.s006">Figure S5</xref> for comparison. In several cases, the side chain order parameters from the MD simulation are higher than those obtained from the relaxation experiments, possibly due to sampling limitations at the side chain level. Exceptions are the modeled order parameters for L15 chi2 and I61 chi2, which are significantly lower than the measured relaxation order parameters (this may be because the timescale of the MD simulation is longer than the rotational correlation time of the molecule).</p>

<p>Ubiquitin has several hotspots shown to be important in recognition of different binding partners: Ile 44, Asp 58, and His 68. These were identified as rigid in the order parameters of the EROS ensemble <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Lange1">[4]</xref>. Residues Ile 44 and His 68 are also among the most rigid in the Backrub ensemble according to analysis by order parameters and C-alpha distance difference value (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000393.s005">Figure S4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000393.s004">S3B</xref>, respectively). Likewise the secondary structure residues observed to be most flexible by order parameters calculated from the EROS ensemble are those in the N-terminus of strand 2 which our analysis also observes to be quite flexible. We find flexible regions in the C-terminus of the alpha helix that is reflected in the C-alpha distance difference value of the EROS ensemble but not in its order parameter.</p>

<title>Strategy to test relation 2</title>
<p>Our results above provide support for the hypothesis of a correspondence between the properties of Backrub-derived conformational ensembles, solution-state dynamics reflected in NMR measurements and a conformational ensemble of 46 experimental crystal structures of ubiquitin. To broaden this result and shed light more generally on a link between protein dynamics and evolution, we next ask whether there is also a correspondence between the dynamics of a single protein sequence and the conformational variability explored in its protein family to accommodate sequence changes during evolution (relation 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000393-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In order to test this relation, we first compare the conformational variability present in the RDC-optimized Backrub ensemble with that observed in a structural alignment of 20 members of the UBQ subfamily (Test 3). Second, we extend this comparison from structural variation to sequence variation by comparing sequences modeled on Backrub ensembles to the sequences of the natural UBQ subfamily (Test 4).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2i">
<title>Individual and family conformational variation (Test 3)</title>
<p>To test the correspondence of the conformational variability of an individual protein and that of its family, we constructed an ensemble from the available structures of proteins in a multiple sequence alignment of the UBQ subfamily (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> for details) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Kiel1">[53]</xref>. We performed a multiple structure alignment of this 20-member UBQ subfamily ensemble using MAMMOTH-mult <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Lupyan1">[70]</xref> resulting in 66 positions that aligned in all proteins (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). These aligned positions had at most 85% and an average of 21% pair-wise sequence identity. We calculated the C-alpha average distance difference matrix for these aligned positions and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000393-g004">Figure 4D</xref> shows the average values for each residue in the matrix mapped onto the 1UBQ structure, as described for Test 2.</p>
<p>The resulting UBQ subfamily ensemble shows high variability in the C-terminus of the helix and in the N-terminus of beta strand 2, which is strikingly similar to the regions of high flexibility in the RDC-optimized Backrub ensemble. Thus, we find similar conformational variability in the structures of the ubiquitin homologs and in an ensemble fit to the solution state dynamics of ubiquitin. This correspondence in pattern of flexibility holds despite the different motional amplitudes of these ensembles: 2.0 Å and 0.9 Å pair-wise RMSD to the 1UBQ X-ray structure, respectively, for the UBQ subfamily ensemble and the RDC-optimized Backrub ensemble.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2j">
<title>Modeling of sequence space (Test 4)</title>
<p>We proposed in hypothesis 2 and showed above that there are similarities in the conformational variability of a single protein and that of its homologs. Here we extend this idea to ask whether the sequences compatible with a structural ensemble describing the dynamics of a single protein are similar to the sequences of the natural family members. We first tested whether there is a difference between the sequence spaces consistent with the RDC-optimized and non-RDC-optimized Backrub ensembles. We performed computational protein design with Rosetta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Kuhlman2">[54]</xref> using simulated annealing of rotamer conformations and amino acid identities on each backbone in an ensemble to determine low-scoring sequences compatible with that ensemble. All positions were allowed to vary to any amino acid and 1000 low-energy sequences were generated for each ensemble. In the following, we use the term ‘sequence space’ to describe the high-dimensional space of possible sequences of a protein.</p>
<p>To compare the sequence space coverage of the various ensembles, we used the BLOSUM62 matrix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Henikoff1">[71]</xref> to calculate the distances between all pairs of sequences. This resulted in a distance matrix of size NxN (where N is the number of sequences compared) representing a sequence space of dimensionality N. To visualize the relative sequence space coverage of different sets of sequences we collapsed this sequence space into two dimensions using multidimensional scaling, retaining the two dimensions containing the most variation in sequence distances (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).</p>
<p>The sequence spaces sampled by the RDC-optimized and non-RDC-optimized Backrub ensembles with optimal Backrub parameters (maximum segment length of 12 and kT = 1.2) are very similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000393-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). This is consistent with the idea that the Backrub method captures a significant portion of near-native protein motions, even without directly incorporating the RDC information into the model. In the following, we use results for non-RDC-optimized ensembles; the results are similar for RDC-optimized ensembles.</p>

<p>Next we compared the 2-D sequence space of designs on various non-RDC-optimized Backrub ensembles to the sequence space of designs on the ubiquitin X-ray ensemble. Different non-RDC-optimized Backrub ensembles of maximum segment length of 12 with varying amplitude (kT = 0.3, 1.2 and 4.8) sample largely separate sets of sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000393-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Sequences move further away from the sequences sampled using the fixed backbone with increasing amplitude of motion in the ensemble. Notably, the Backrub sampling parameters used to generate ensembles which sample a range of sequences most similar to the 46-member ubiquitin X-ray ensemble are the same parameters that gave the lowest Q-factor (maximum segment length of 12 with kT = 1.2), supporting the hypothesis that the Backrub ensembles are sampling similar conformational heterogeneity to the ensemble of ubiquitin X-ray structures (Test 2). Sequences obtained from the MD ensemble are likewise most similar to the kT = 1.2 amplitude ensemble (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000393.s007">Figure S6C and D</xref>), although spanning a somewhat larger region of sequence space.</p>
<p>Finally, to test whether there exists a link between the conformational heterogeneity of solution dynamical ensembles and the sequence space compatible with these ensembles (Test 4), we compared the 2-D sequence space of designs on various Backrub ensembles to the sequence space of the UBQ subfamily of the ubiquitin αβ roll subfold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000393-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). The subfamily sequences we used came from a high quality manually curated alignment of 36 homologues created using 3D structural analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Kiel1">[53]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000393-g006">Figure 6C</xref>, the sequences in these naturally occurring proteins represent a subset of the sequence space of the non-RDC-optimized Backrub ensemble (maximum segment length of 12 with kT = 1.2). In contrast, the UBQ subfamily sequences barely or do not at all overlap with the sequences from design simulations using the fixed backbone, or the kT = 0.3 and kT = 4.8 ensembles. We obtain similar results when considering core residues only (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000393.s007">Figure S6B</xref>).</p>
<p>The sequence logo representations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000393-g007">Figure 7A–H</xref> for residues in buried core regions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) support the correspondence between the sequence diversity in Backrub ensembles and the natural family. The predominant amino acid in the UBQ subfamily is generally recapitulated in the non-RDC-optimized Backrub ensembles of maximum segment length 12 with kT = 0.3 and kT = 1.2 (e.g. positions 5, 27, 43, 50, 56, 61, and 69). One notable exception is that the designed sequences fail to recapitulate the frequently observed glutamine at position 41. Kiel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Kiel1">[53]</xref> use this position as the main indicator in categorizing subgroups of the UBQ subfamily because its presence correlates with the structure of a nearby loop. The side chain amide nitrogen atom of Gln 41 forms a buried hydrogen bond with the backbone of residue 36, which may be responsible for structural specificity of the loop conformation that we are not accounting for in the design simulations. Several positions, such as residues 21, 25, 45, 55, 61, 65, and 68, have high sequence entropy in the natural family. The Backrub ensemble designs recapitulate high sequence entropy for these residues. Especially for residues 45, 55, 61, and 65 the high entropy underscores one of the uses of flexible backbone design, as with a fixed backbone or low temperature Backrub ensemble only a few amino acid types predominate at those positions failing to capture the substantial natural sequence plasticity within the family. We also generated designs compatible with the trajectory of the 100-ns MD simulation, which showed similar results to the RDC-optimized Backrub ensemble overall, but with higher sequence entropy for several positions (as reflected also in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000393.s007">Figure S6</xref>).</p>

<p>Taken together, our results thus indicate that the conformational sampling methods we use here to match RDC dynamics produce variability similar to the conformational heterogeneity of X-ray ensembles (both using different ubiquitin structures as well as structures from the UBQ subfamily) and may lead to significant overlap between sequences consistent with modeled ensembles and the sequence space covered by the natural family. Additionally, it appears from the similarity of sequences from RDC-optimized and non-RDC-optimized ensembles that the RDCs have led us to determine optimal Backrub sampling parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000393-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) that can be used prospectively to make modeling predictions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work, we describe the application of the Backrub motional model to create ensembles of structures consistent with RDC measurements and to sample the conformational and sequence space of the UBQ subfamily.</p>
<p>The main new aspect of our work is that we link the conformational dynamics of a single sequence, as reflected by both RDC data and Backrub ensembles, to conformational diversity observed in crystal structures of ubiquitin and its family, and to evolutionary sampled sequence diversity. We achieve this by applying computational protein design to select low-energy sequences consistent with Backrub ensembles. The fact that low-Q factor Backrub ensembles sample a similar sequence space to that of the ubiquitin X-ray ensemble extends results by other groups demonstrating the correspondence of solution-state dynamics and crystallographic heterogeneity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Best1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Lakomek1">[35]</xref>. In addition, we find that this designed sequence space consistent with optimal Backrub ensembles encompasses the sequence space of the UBQ subfamily, providing evidence for the idea suggested by Davis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Davis1">[29]</xref> that the Backrub motional mechanism may facilitate amino acid changes during evolution.</p>
<p>We find that RDC-optimized ensembles created with only certain Backrub sampling parameters were able to reach the lowest Q-factors, indicating that the conformational space sampled by these Backrub parameters is the most similar (compared to other parameters) to the conformations giving rise to the RDC measurements. However, while we see significant improvements in Q-factors during the selection protocol, we also find substantial similarities between RDC-optimized and non-RDC-optimized Backrub ensembles in patterns of C-alpha RMSD, order parameters and designed sequence space. This somewhat surprising observation could mean that the selection procedure primarily optimizes for subtle differences in NH-vector orientations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000393.s008">Figure S7</xref>), while other dynamical features that are commonly characterized (such as the anisotropy of motions) are essentially indistinguishable between RDC-optimized and non-RDC-optimized Backrub ensembles. Analysis by cross-validation shows an improvement in R<sub>free</sub> for RDC-optimized over non-RDC-optimized ensembles, indicating that other aspects of the peptide plane orientation are better represented in the RDC-optimized ensembles. Notably, there are defined Backrub parameters that simultaneously give the best agreement with the RDC data (after selection) and the best sequence space overlap with the natural family, irrespective of whether we apply selection or not. This could indicate that it is primarily the mechanism and amplitude of motions that are important, and that, as long as the amplitude is in the correct range defined by the appropriate sampling parameters, the Backrub motional model can sample relevant motions without requiring RDC data. Hence, the Backrub motional model may be useful (i) to predictively sample conformations similar to ensembles of bound conformations and (ii) to use with design to sample the sequence space of the natural family. Such sampling of sequences likely to be accommodated by a given protein fold may help improve engineering of new protein structures, functions and interactions. For example, coupling backbone ensemble generation and sequence design may be useful to computationally predict sequence libraries enriched in functional members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Humphris1">[56]</xref>.</p>
<p>There are several potential limitations of the Backrub method, as applied here. As we implement Backrub in a Monte Carlo protocol, the timescale of conformational transitions is not taken into account. Also, the method used here limits the backbone conformational space sampled to those conformations accessible with the Backrub mechanism, a restriction which can be alleviated for example with the addition of small phi/psi changes to the method or by using analytical methods for local loop closure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Coutsias1">[72]</xref>, which is a superset of the Backrub move. Nevertheless, Backrub changes have an interesting similarity to the 1D-Gaussian Axial Fluctuation (GAF) analytical model, a simple motional model that has been used with success to fit RDCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Bernado1">[52]</xref>. A dipeptide Backrub move (a tripeptide Backrub move is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000393-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) is similar to motions described by the 1D-GAF model; thus the Backrub Monte Carlo protocol, which includes moves of longer peptide segments incorporated into a Monte Carlo scheme, can be viewed as a extension of the analytical GAF model to discrete structural ensembles.</p>
<p>As necessitated by the scarcity of proteins with sufficient RDC data, we limit our study here to one protein and further work is needed to extend modeling of protein native state dynamics and tolerated sequence space to more proteins. However, the usefulness of the Backrub mechanism for modeling protein motions is supported by several studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Davis1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Georgiev1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Betancourt1">[73]</xref>. Our studies on ubiquitin provide an interesting benchmark case for future analyses of the correspondence of individual and family variation.</p>
<p>Analysis of the generated ubiquitin Backrub ensembles allows several fundamental insights on the relationship between structure, function, sequence and dynamics. The ubiquitin core flexibility and a binding mechanism by conformational selection have been pointed out previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Lange1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-LindorffLarsen1">[58]</xref>. Furthermore, our study allows characterization of differences between computationally predicted and evolved protein sequences that may lead to testable hypotheses on effects not modeled in the simulations, such as evolutionary pressures to conserve functional residues. An example is the discrepancy between the predictions and the naturally occurring glutamine residue at position 41 in ubiquitin. A likely explanation why our design simulations fail to predict this preference for glutamine is that we are not taking into account avoidance of certain non-native conformations due to evolutionary pressure enforcing structural specificity.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have tested a method for sampling conformational diversity using Backrub conformational changes and shown that it can generate ensembles consistent with millisecond-timescale measurements of protein dynamics. This method is computationally more efficient than molecular dynamics-based methods, allowing it to be applied to a variety of protein modeling tasks such as sequence design. Notably, we find that the method recapitulated many of the structural properties of the RDC-optimized Backrub ensembles even when the RDC measurements were not incorporated in the sampling procedure, despite the fact that the RDCs were necessary to determine the amplitudes of motion in the Backrub ensembles. We additionally find that the sequence diversity tolerated by non-RDC-optimized Backrub ensembles is similar to that of both the ubiquitin X-ray ensemble and the UBQ subfamily X-ray ensemble. This result needs to be tested on more proteins and, if validated, should be useful in making prospective predictions to numerous applications, such as protein-protein or protein-small-molecule docking, protein interface design, and enzyme design.</p>

<title>Generation of conformational ensembles</title>
<p>To generate protein conformational ensembles, we ran “Backrub” Monte Carlo simulations, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Friedland1">[30]</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Smith1">[31]</xref>. Briefly, this method randomly makes one of three types of moves: (a) a rotamer change (50% of the time), (B) a local backbone conformational changes (Backrub move) consisting of a rigid body rotation of a random peptide segment about the axis connecting the endpoint C-alpha atoms (25% of the time), or (c) a composite move with a Backrub change and one or two rotamer changes (25% of the time). After each move, the positions of the C-beta and H-alpha atoms are modified to minimize bond angle strain as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Smith1">[31]</xref>. This results in bond angle changes of the main chain atoms of one to four standard deviations. The mean values and standard deviations are very similar to those computed in a set of 240 high-resolution crystal structures (better than 1.3 Å) with less than 25% sequence identity culled from the Dunbrack database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Wang2">[75]</xref>, except for some perturbation to the N-CA-C angle (mean and standard deviations are 111.5° and 4.1° in the Backrub ensembles and 111.0° and 2.5° in the crystal structure set). See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000393.s003">Figure S2</xref> for details on the structural quality analysis for all structures and ensembles used in this study.</p>
<p>We ran a Backrub Monte Carlo simulation at kT = 0.1 from the starting PDB conformation (using 1UBQ, which has the highest resolution (1.8 Å) of the unbound ubiquitin structures; similar results were obtained for maximum segment length of 3 with PDB entries 1UBI and 1CMX and worse Q factors were obtained for PDB entries 1FXT, 1AAR, 1F9J, and 1TBE) for 10,000 steps with a maximum segment length of 3 or 12, matching the segment length used later. The lowest energy structure from this simulation is used as the starting conformation for 10,000 randomly seeded Backrub simulations at one of 5 different temperatures (kT = 0.3, 0.6, 1.2, 2.4, or 4.8) run for an additional 10,000 steps. The last structure from each of these simulations is used to form the starting set of 10,000 structures.</p>
<p>From this initial set of 10,000 structures, ensembles are selected to match the RDCs by minimizing the Q-factor of the ensemble. First, structures are randomly chosen to create a starting ensemble of a given size (2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 50 or 100 structures), and the Q-factor of the ensemble is calculated (see below). Next, a random structure in this ensemble is chosen and replaced with a randomly chosen structure from the initial ensemble of 10,000 structures; then the new Q-factor of the ensemble is calculated. If the new Q-factor is lower than before the replacement, the change is kept, otherwise it is reverted. These structure replacements are repeated until the Q-factor changes by less than 0.001 in 5000 steps. By repeating this method 1000 times, 1000 RDC-optimized Backrub ensembles are created. There are a very large number of possible subsets of a given size. For example, there are 4*10<sup>^</sup>61 different sub-ensembles of size 20 from the initial ensemble of size 10,000, too many to be evaluated. The approach described here does not guarantee that the ensemble with the lowest Q-factor will be found, but it starts from many random starting points to broadly sample the space of possible sub-ensembles and the selection process converges to a low Q-factor solution within 10,000 Backrub-generated structures for all Backrub Monte Carlo temperatures (except kT = 4.8; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000393.s009">Figure S8</xref>).</p>

<title>Calculating RDCs from a structure or structural ensemble</title>
<p>RDCs are calculated from a single structure and an ensemble of structures as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Meiler2">[76]</xref>. Briefly, we first find the alignment tensor from a structure (or set of structures) and the experimental couplings. This is done using the equation T = A<sup>−1</sup> D<sub>exp</sub>, where T is the alignment tensor, A<sup>−1</sup> is the Moore-Penrose inverted matrix of projection angles for the amide bonds (or averaged projection angles for a set of structures), and D<sub>exp</sub> is the vector of experimental couplings.

<title>Sources of error</title>
<p>There are several sources of error in our analysis to consider when assessing the significance of the results. First, there is error in the RDC measurements due to experimental uncertainty. The uncertainty in these values is estimated to be 0.3 Hz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000393-Lakomek1">[35]</xref>. To calculate the resulting uncertainty in the Q-factor, we added Gaussian-distributed noise of mean amplitude 0.3 Hz to the RDC measurements (see section below) in 1000 Monte Carlo trials. This resulted in a value of Q<sub>experimental_error</sub> = 0.036.</p>
<p>A second source of error results from not finding the ensemble with the lowest possible Q-factor from a given initial structure set. We estimated this error by repeating the selection procedure many times and evaluating the variance in the resulting Q-factors. We take explicit steps to minimize this error by enforcing two convergence criteria on the optimization: 1) ensemble selection is not finished until 5000 steps have passed without a change in Q of more than 0.001, and 2) enough RDC-optimized ensembles are generated from random starting structures such that the difference in the Q-factors of the best and 10th best RDC-optimized ensemble is not more than 0.005. Thus, this Q<sub>optimization_error</sub> is on the order of 0.005.</p>
<p>A third important source of error is due to insufficient sampling of conformational space with the Backrub Monte Carlo protocol and the 10,000 structures that we use to select ensembles from. We estimated this Q<sub>sampling_error</sub> by running the structure generation protocol at each temperature 10 times, thus creating 10 sets of 10,000 Backrub-generated structures at each temperature. The standard deviations of the minimum Q-factors over these 10 sets of 10,000 structures are 0.0151, 0.0104, 0.0025, 0.0039, and 0.0049 for kT = 0.3, 0.6, 1.2, 2.4 and 4.8, respectively for a maximum segment length of 12. The standard errors of the mean of these values are 0.0048, 0.0033, 0.0008, 0.0012, and 0.0015, respectively.</p>

<p>To estimate the sequence space compatible with different structures and ensembles, we used Rosetta computational protein design to generate 1000 low-energy sequences for each single structure or 20 sequences per ensemble member for ensembles of size 50. To find a low-scoring sequence, each design simulation consists of 20 rounds of Monte Carlo simulated annealing with the number of steps in each round equal to the number of rotamers created for the simulation. The backbone of each structure or ensemble member is kept fixed during the design simulations and all positions were allowed to vary to any of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids, adding extra conformers at one standard deviation around the mean rotamer for chi 1 and 2 dihedral angles.

<p>The procedure was repeated with the sequences of core residues only, where core residues were defined by counting the number of neighbor residues with C-beta atoms within 10 Å of the C-beta atom of the residue of interest (or C-alpha atoms for glycine). The cutoff value used (greater than or equal to 18) was chosen so that approximately one third of the residues fell into the core category (excluding the flexible C-terminus), resulting in 21 buried positions: residues 3, 5, 17, 21, 23, 25, 26, 27, 30, 41, 43, 45, 50, 55, 56, 59, 61, 65, 67, 68, and 69.</p>
