<abstract>
<p>Activating transcription factor 3 (Atf3) is rapidly and transiently upregulated in numerous systems, and is associated with various disease states. Atf3 is required for negative feedback regulation of other genes, but is itself subject to negative feedback regulation possibly by autorepression. In cardiomyocytes, Atf3 and Egr1 mRNAs are upregulated via ERK1/2 signalling and Atf3 suppresses Egr1 expression. We previously developed a mathematical model for the Atf3-Egr1 system. Here, we adjusted and extended the model to explore mechanisms of Atf3 feedback regulation. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref> of an autorepressive loop for Atf3 tuned down its expression and inhibition of Egr1 was lost, demonstrating that negative feedback regulation of Atf3 by Atf3 itself is implausible in this context. Experimentally, signals downstream from ERK1/2 suppress Atf3 expression. Mathematical modelling indicated that this cannot occur by phosphorylation of pre-existing inhibitory transcriptional regulators because the time delay is too short. De novo synthesis of an inhibitory transcription factor (ITF) with a high affinity for the Atf3 promoter could suppress Atf3 expression, but (as with the Atf3 autorepression loop) inhibition of Egr1 was lost. Developing the model to include newly-synthesised miRNAs very efficiently terminated Atf3 protein expression and, with a 4-fold increase in the rate of degradation of mRNA from the mRNA/miRNA complex, profiles for Atf3 mRNA, Atf3 protein and Egr1 mRNA approximated to the experimental data. Combining the ITF model with that of the miRNA did not improve the profiles suggesting that miRNAs are likely to play a dominant role in switching off Atf3 expression post-induction.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Activating transcription factor 3 (Atf3) is an important regulatory transcription factor which is associated with inflammation, restraint of the immune response and cancer. In this work, we develop a series of mathematical models to understand how Atf3 may be regulated. Informed with data from the literature and our own experiments, we show that self-regulation of Atf3 does not allow for variation between experimentally observed Atf3 mRNA and Atf3 protein expression profiles. A fast-acting signal via phosphorylated RSK is also shown to be implausible for similar reasons. Extending our mathematical model further, we postulate for the first time, that the observed dynamical variation in Atf3 mRNA and protein can be described by microRNAs downstream of RSKs. The further inclusion of an inhibitory transcription factor for Atf3 expression has little effect on these findings.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The concept of immediate early genes (IEGs) was initially established in relation to viral infection of bacterial or eukaryotic cells (e.g. herpesvirus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Everett1">[1]</xref>). Here, IEGs are defined as the genes encoding the first phase of mRNAs expressed from the viral genome, relying entirely on pre-existing host proteins. Early and delayed genes are expressed later and require production of new proteins. In mammalian cells, IEGs became defined as those which are regulated by pre-existing transcription factors (TFs) such that increases in IEG mRNA expression are not suppressed by protein synthesis inhibitors (e.g. cycloheximide) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Woodgett1">[2]</xref>. Many IEGs encode transcriptional regulators that are required to modulate downstream gene expression (i.e. second phase genes) and some are inhibitory factors required to terminate transcription. With the discovery of miRNAs that influence mRNA expression and translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Mendell1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Pasquinelli1">[4]</xref>, some adjustment of the IEG concept is necessary according to whether mRNA regulation is transcriptional or post-transcriptional. Synthesis, production and degradation of miRNAs may be insensitive to inhibitors of protein synthesis as would be any (post-transcriptional) effects on mRNA expression.</p>
<p>Cardiomyocytes, the contractile cells of the heart, withdraw from the cell cycle perinatally. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes are therefore highly synchronized and, because they do not divide, form a good model for the study of IEG regulation. In these cells, endothelin-1 (ET-1), a Gq protein-coupled receptor (GqPCR) agonist, elicits maximal activation of the entire pool of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2, the prototypic mitogen-activated protein kinases) within 3–5 min <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Sugden1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Sugden2">[6]</xref>. The earliest IEGs are substantially and maximally upregulated within 15–30 min, with second phase RNAs being detected within 1 h <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Cullingford1">[7]</xref>. ERK1/2 play a major role in the response and promote upregulation of ∼70% of ET-1-responsive transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Cullingford1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Kennedy1">[8]</xref>. Recent data indicate that ERK1/2 act together with their downstream substrates p90 ribosomal S6 kinases (RSKs) to regulate RNA expression, with RSKs being required to increase expression of ∼50% of the RNAs upregulated by ET-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Amirak1">[9]</xref>. As in other systems, upregulation of cardiomyocyte IEG mRNAs is acute and transient. For example, activating transcription factor 3 (Atf3) and early growth response 1 (Egr1) mRNAs (each regulated via ERK1/2) are both upregulated maximally by ET-1 within ∼30 min <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Giraldo1">[10]</xref>. However, expression of Egr1 mRNA returns to basal by ∼2 h and expression of Atf3 mRNA declines close to basal levels over ∼4 h. This raises the question of negative feedback regulation.</p>
<p>Atf3 is emerging as an extremely important feedback regulator of transcription. Particular emphasis is placed on its role in inflammation and Atf3 is essential for restraining the immune response, but Atf3 is also associated with cancer and cardiac dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Okamoto1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Zhou1">[14]</xref>. However, although it is stress-regulated and stress-regulating, Atf3 is upregulated in many systems by growth stimuli including peptide growth factors and GqPCR agonists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Cullingford1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Schweighofer1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Nagashima1">[17]</xref>. Atf3 forms homo- or heterodimers that bind to ATF/CRE sites in gene promoters to regulate transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Hai2">[18]</xref>. It is largely regulated at the level of expression, being present at very low levels in quiescent cells and induced as an IEG by a range of extracellular stimuli and cellular stresses. ERK1/2 are particularly implicated in promoting Atf3 mRNA expression and several TFs may be involved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Tamura1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Mayer1">[21]</xref>. Atf3 is generally viewed as a transcriptional repressor, particularly when acting as homodimers, and it may repress transcription from its own promoter to limit expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Wolfgang1">[22]</xref>. In cardiomyocytes, Atf3 operates in a negative feedback system with Egr1 and, by binding to the Egr1 promoter, Atf3 inhibits Egr1 transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Giraldo1">[10]</xref>. Mathematical modelling of the system demonstrated that this, in itself, could suffice for the transient nature of the Egr1 response. The pivotal role that Atf3 plays in biological systems renders it essential to understand the mechanisms that regulate Atf3 expression. Here, we have developed our original mathematical model to determine whether Atf3 serves as a negative feedback regulator of its own transcription (as suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Wolfgang1">[22]</xref>) and to explore other mechanisms that may switch off Atf3 mRNA expression. We demonstrate that self-regulation by Atf3 on its own promoter (or, indeed, self-regulation by any transcription factor) is implausible and miRNAs are likely to play a dominant role in switching off Atf3 expression post-induction.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Atf3 mRNA and protein are rapidly and transiently upregulated in cardiomyocytes exposed to ET-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) and, since loss of Atf3 produces sustained expression of Egr1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), Atf3 negatively regulates Egr1 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Giraldo1">[10]</xref>. The initial deterministic ordinary differential equation model generated for this Atf3-Egr1 negative feedback system (detailed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Giraldo1">[10]</xref>) made the following assumptions: Atf3 and Egr1 are co-regulated through ERK1/2; ERK1/2 increase transactivating activities of TFs pre-bound to each promoter (i.e. the TF/promoter constitutes a single entity regulated by ERK1/2); since ERK1/2 activity remains high for at least 30 min <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Clerk1">[23]</xref>, we did not switch off the protein kinase signal. This model predicted that Atf3 alone could suffice to to switch off Egr1 transcription.</p>

<p>To address questions relating to Atf3 transcription we developed the original model further (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Full details of reaction equations, mathematical modelling and additional parameterisation are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003597.s001">Text S1</xref>. We allowed for the rate of dephosphorylation (i.e. inactivation) of ERK1/2 following stimulation with ET-1, considering that phosphorylation of ERK1/2 is maximal at ∼3 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Amirak1">[9]</xref>) and declines by ∼90% by 1 h with a return to baseline by 2 h <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Clerk1">[23]</xref>. The modelling profile for ERK1/2 phosphorylation is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). We allowed for the rate of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of TFs bound to each of the Atf3 and Egr1 promoters. In other cells, phosphorylation of CREB and/or c-Jun TFs is implicated in the upregulation of Atf3 transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Lu1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Liang1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Cai1">[25]</xref>. In cardiomyocytes exposed to ET-1, accumulation of phosphorylated (i.e. activated) CREB and c-Jun TFs each requires ERK1/2 signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Clerk2">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Harrison1">[27]</xref>, making them prime exemplary candidates for the model. Experimentally, maximal phosphorylation of CREB is detected at ∼10 min and declines to ∼25% maximal by ∼60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). The time course for phosphorylated c-Jun is delayed (maximal at ∼45–60 min, declining to ∼50% maximal at 2 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g001">Figure 1G</xref>), because of the additional increase in expression of c-Jun protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Clerk2">[26]</xref>. ET-1 also increases expression of Myc mRNA (maximal at 1 h) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Amirak1">[9]</xref> that promotes expression of Atf3 over a longer time frame in cells treated with serum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Tamura1">[19]</xref>, so the signal could be perpetuated over a much longer time period. Here, for the Atf3 promoter, the model was initially developed using the profile for phosphorylated CREB that will give the most rapid rate at which Atf3 transcription is terminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g001">Figure 1H</xref>). The Egr1 promoter is most likely regulated by ternary complexes of Elk1/SRF that can be stimulated either by phosphorylation of Elk1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-McMahon1">[28]</xref> or an increase in SRF binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Wu1">[29]</xref>. Elk1 is rapidly and transiently phosphorylated in cardiomyocytes exposed to phenylephrine with a similar profile to CREB following exposure to ET-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Babu1">[30]</xref>. SRF is upregulated by ET-1 with maximal expression of SRF mRNA at ∼1 h <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Cullingford1">[7]</xref> and this is likely to perpetuate the response given that our data indicate that, in the absence of Atf3 expression, Egr1 expression is sustained over at least 2 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, for the TF regulating Egr1 transcription, we used a similar rate of TF phosphorylation as for CREB with delayed dephosphorylation. Binding of the TF to the Egr1 promoter was competitive with Atf3 and was modelled in the absence or presence of Atf3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g001">Figure 1I</xref>). Egr1 mRNA expression remained sensitive to negative feedback regulation by Atf3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g001">Figure 1J</xref>). With these adjustments, Atf3 mRNA and protein were predicted to decline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g001">Figure 1K</xref>), but the profiles were delayed relative to the experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, merely switching off the signal to promote Atf3 transcription/translation alone cannot account for its subsequent downregulation, indicating that a negative feedback system also operates for Atf3.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Model extension 1: Atf3 protein inhibits Atf3 transcription</title>
<p>Previous studies used a protein overexpression approach with reporter assays for the Atf3 promoter to provide evidence that Atf3 operates in an autorepression loop and, by binding to an element immediately downstream of the TATA box, it inhibits its own transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Wolfgang1">[22]</xref>. Since it is difficult to test this experimentally with an endogenous system, we extended the mathematical model developed for the Atf3-Egr1 feedback system to determine whether a direct Atf3 autorepression loop is feasible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The development of this and subsequent mathematical models is detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003597.s001">Text S1</xref>. The model extension requires three new parameters. The association constant for Atf3 protein with Atf3 DNA (<italic>K</italic><sub>11</sub>) was assumed to have an initial value of 0.1 nM. The forward and reverse rates of the Atf3 protein for Atf3 DNA, λ<sub>1</sub> and λ<sub>−1</sub>, were also required. λ<sub>−1</sub>/λ<sub>1</sub> was assumed to have a similar value to <italic>K</italic><sub>11</sub>, but a slow rate of reversal giving a value of λ<sub>1</sub> = 1×10<sup>5</sup> (Ms)<sup>−1</sup>. With the initial parameters, there was little effect on Atf3 mRNA, Atf3 protein or Egr1 mRNA profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g002">Figure 2, B–D</xref>, solid lines) compared with the original model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g001">Figure 1K</xref>). Decreasing the disassociation constant of Atf3 protein and Atf3 DNA by 10<sup>6</sup> produced profiles that were more representative of the experimental data for Atf3 mRNA and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g002">Figure 2, B and C</xref>, dashed lines), but acute inhibition of Egr1 mRNA expression was lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, dashed line). Decreasing the ratio of λ<sub>−1</sub>/λ<sub>1</sub> (informed by a sensitivity analysis) 2 orders of magnitude had no effect on the results. Increasing the ratio 2 orders of magnitude decreased the amount of Atf3 and increased the amount of Egr1 as expected (not shown). We conclude that Atf3 is unlikely to act in an autorepressive manner on its own promoter. If it did, the rate of accumulation of Atf3 mRNA/protein would be reduced such that it could then not significantly influence other gene promoters (in this case Egr1) producing a redundant system. Thus, the Atf3 autorepressive loop is implausible.</p>

It is therefore unlikely that the enhancement of Atf3 mRNA expression induced by ET-1 seen in the presence of BI-D1870 is due to its effects on phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and suggests that a negative feedback system downstream of RSKs (or other kinases that may be inhibited by BI-D1870) moderates Atf3 mRNA expression. Interestingly, the effects of BI-D1870 over 2 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) produced a profile for Atf3 mRNA expression that resembled the predicted profile for Atf3 mRNA in the modifications to the original model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g001">Figure 1K</xref>) suggesting that an input from RSKs might suffice to switch off Atf3 transcription. We therefore extended the mathematical model to test the hypothesis that RSKs (as exemplar kinases) phosphorylate nuclear TFs (RTF) to negatively regulate Atf3 transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Experimentally, maximal phosphorylation of RSKs occurs at 5–15 min, declining to ∼25% the maximal level by ∼30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g003">Figure 3D</xref>); this profile was modelled mathematically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g003">Figure 3E</xref>, cyan line; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003597.s001">Text S1</xref> for details). The predicted profile for phospho-RTF binding to the Atf3 promoter is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g003">Figure 3E</xref> (red line). Because different signals are applied to different proteins, we assumed that the negative signal from phospho-RSK and phospho-RTF was competitive with the positive signal from phospho-ERK1/2 and phospho-TF. New parameters were required for the rate of RSK phosphorylation by phospho-ERK1/2 (<italic>k</italic><sub>9</sub>), the rate of RSK-P dephosphorylation (<italic>d<sub>10</sub></italic>), rates of association and disassociation of RTF for Atf3 DNA (<italic>λ</italic><sub>2</sub> and <italic>λ</italic><sub>−2</sub>) and the rates of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of RTF bound to Atf3 DNA (<italic>k</italic><sub>10</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>−10</sub>). A fit-by-eye to the RSK data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) yielded <italic>k</italic><sub>9</sub> = 1×10<sup>5</sup> (Ms)<sup>−1</sup> and <italic>d<sub>10</sub></italic> = 5.9×10<sup>−4</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>. We assumed that <italic>λ</italic><sub>2</sub> = <italic>λ</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>λ</italic><sub>−2</sub> = <italic>λ</italic><sub>−1</sub>, <italic>k</italic><sub>10</sub> = <italic>k</italic><sub>5</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>−10</sub> = <italic>k</italic><sub>−5</sub>, and that the total amount of RSKs is equal to the amount of ERK1/2 (i.e. <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> = <italic>E</italic><sub>0</sub>). With the initial parameters, the profiles for Atf3 mRNA and protein remained similar to the original model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g001">Figure 1K</xref>), although the amount of each was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g003">Figure 3, F and G</xref>) and acute inhibition of Egr1 mRNA remained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g003">Figure 3H</xref>). With the competition between phospho-TF and phospho-RTF for Atf3 DNA, increasing the rate of association of phospho-RTF with the Atf3 promoter may produce a profile that approaches that of the experimental data , but acute inhibition of Egr1 mRNA expression becomes lost (not shown). We conclude that the time delay between activation of ERK1/2 relative to RSKs is too small (1–2 min) to result in differential effects on mRNA expression over 0.5–4 h if both act directly on transcription from the same promoter. A greater time delay may be elicited by termination of transcription by an IEG encoding an inhibitory TF (ITF) and/or upregulation of a miRNA (or another factor) promoting Atf3 mRNA degradation and inhibiting Atf3 protein synthesis.</p>

<title>Model extension 4: Upregulation of one or more miRNAs that regulate Atf3 mRNA and/or protein expression</title>
<p>Transcriptomics studies using Affymetrix exon arrays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Amirak1">[9]</xref> identified several miRNAs that are regulated in cardiomyocytes by ET-1 within 1 h and whose upregulation is inhibited by BI-D1870 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003597-t001">Table 1</xref>; since we have not performed miRNA profiling of cardiomyocytes, this is unlikely to be a full representation of miRNAs in this category). Atf3 expression may be regulated by miRNAs (e.g. Mir663 suppresses Atf3 mRNA expression in endothelial cells subjected to shear stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Ni1">[32]</xref>). We therefore tested the hypothesis that upregulation of one or more miRNAs (we retained the assumption that this is downstream of RSKs as exemplar kinases) is required to downregulate Atf3 mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). This extension to the model introduces eight new parameters. With little/no published information on rates of miRNA turnover, we informed the model as follows. The rate of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation for RTF binding to miDNA was assumed to be equal to the rate of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of TFs bound to Egr1 and Atf3 DNA by ERK-P (<italic>k</italic><sub>16</sub> = <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub>; <italic>k</italic><sub>−16</sub> = <italic>k</italic><sub>−3</sub>). The rate of miDNA transcription was assumed to be the same as that of Atf3 transcription (<italic>k</italic><sub>17</sub> = <italic>k</italic><sub>6</sub>) and the rate at which premiRNA is converted to miRNA (<italic>k</italic><sub>18</sub>) was assumed to be double the rate of Atf3 translation (0.5/s). The rate at which miRNA associates with Atf3 mRNA (<italic>k</italic><sub>19</sub>) was assumed to be equivalent to the rate set for Atf3 protein binding to Egr1 DNA (1×10<sup>5</sup> (Ms)<sup>−1</sup>) and the reverse rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>−19</sub>) was set at 5×10<sup>−5</sup>/s, the value that gave the best qualitative fit to the experimental data. The rates of decay of premiRNA (<italic>d</italic><sub>6</sub>) and miRNA (<italic>d</italic><sub>7</sub>) were assumed to be ∼24 h in line with recently published data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Gantier1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Nazarov1">[34]</xref>.

<p>miRNAs may increase mRNA degradation (within a complex with Ago2) or silence mRNA expression (within Ago1, Ago3 or Ago4). Computational modelling has been used to predict/confirm that the increase in mRNA degradation induced by miRNAs lies within the range 1.3- to 6.4-fold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Baccarini1">[35]</xref>. We first assumed that potential miRNA(s) had a negligible effect on the rate of degradation (i.e. the rate of degradation of the miRNA/mRNA complex was similar to the free mRNA). In this case, the total Atf3 mRNA (i.e. free Atf3 mRNA + miRNA/mRNA complex) dynamical profile did not match the experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, solid line). However, since the miRNA/mRNA complex is assumed to be translationally incompetent, the protein profile was significantly affected and approximated to the experimental profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g005">Figure 5D</xref>, solid line). If we assumed that potential miRNA(s) increased the rate of degradation of Atf3 mRNA from the miRNA/mRNA complex 2-fold, the total Atf3 mRNA profile approached that of the experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, long dashed line). Increasing the rate of degradation 4-fold gave a profile that approximated to the experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, short dashed line). The protein profile was relatively unaffected by increasing the rate of degradation of the miRNA/mRNA complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g005">Figure 5D</xref>), indicating that miRNAs have a dominant effect on protein expression irrespective of their effect on mRNA expression. In all cases, the predicted Egr1 mRNA profile approximated to the experimental data over the 2 h period studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g005">Figure 5E</xref>), although subsequently Egr1 mRNA levels were predicted to increase as Atf3 protein is lost.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In considering mechanisms of regulation of IEG expression, the emphasis is usually on the signals and transcriptional regulators required for upregulation. Here, we explored possible mechanisms associated with downregulation of IEG expression and termination of the response. We focused on Atf3 as an IEG in which there is great interest because of its association with inflammation, cancer and cardiac dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Okamoto1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Zhou1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>The report that Atf3 can bind to its own promoter to inhibit transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Wolfgang1">[22]</xref> is, at first sight, attractive. The experimental approaches used remain the most appropriate, but all such studies are potentially subject to artefacts resulting from overexpression or elimination of a single transcription factor in isolation. Developing a mathematical model provides an alternative means of testing the hypothesis. In this case, the model demonstrated that such a negative feedback loop is implausible in the context of our cardiomyocyte system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This raises the question of whether any such self-regulating transcriptional system can operate. For an inhibitory TF, the model prediction is that a redundant feedback loop is most likely to be generated in which the TF serves to regulate only its own expression, restricting the possibility that it accumulates to a sufficient degree to operate in an efficient inhibitory loop with another gene. The scenario would differ in the case of a positive TF driving expression of second phase genes. Here, self-regulation can provide a means of moderating downstream gene expression.</p>
<p>Our experimental data suggest that, whereas ERK1/2 themselves promote upregulation of Atf3, downstream activation of RSKs (or other BI-D1870-sensitive kinases) is potentially important in terminating Atf3 mRNA and, presumably, protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g003">Figure 3, A and B</xref>). This resulted in the development of three further extensions to the model. Whilst we have included biologically appropriate mechanisms at each model revision one outcome of this has been an increase in the signalling cascade complexity. This in itself has led to a more robust signalling response.</p>
<p>The initial concept, that delayed activation of RSKs may result in delayed activation of a pre-existing inhibitory TF for signal termination, appeared attractive. However, model extension 2 demonstrated that direct activation of the putative RSK-responsive RTF was almost simultaneous with activation of the ERK1/2-responsive TF and simply titrated down the levels of Atf3 mRNA rather than altering the profile. Thus, the delay between activation of ERK1/2 and activation of RSKs is insufficient for this scenario to be viable and a greater delay is required before initiation of the negative signal. Interestingly, since a delay is necessary, this also negates the possibility of other acute events (e.g. histone deacetylation) being responsible for terminating Atf3 mRNA expression. The timing strongly suggests that a second transcriptional event is required, either to produce an alternative inhibitory TF (termed ITF, model extension 3) and/or one or more miRNAs (model extension 4). Here, developing first model extensions 3 and 4 independently and then combining the two strongly suggested that an ITF would not affect Atf3 mRNA and protein expression whereas miRNA(s) most probably would suffice to generate the profiles seen experimentally. Interestingly, the miRNA effect was particularly dominant on the Atf3 protein profile. The model also demonstrated that a modest increase in the rate of degradation of Atf3 mRNA by the miRNA within the range predicted by other computational models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Baccarini1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Khanin1">[36]</xref> could suffice for the Atf3 mRNA profiles to approximate to the experimental data. Further studies of cardiomyocyte miRNAs are clearly required.</p>

<p>Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were prepared as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Marshall1">[37]</xref> and exposed to 2 µM PD184352 (to inhibit the ERK1/2 cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Davies1">[38]</xref>) or 10 µM BI-D1870 (to inhibit RSKs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Sapkota1">[31]</xref>) for 70 min, to 100 nM ET-1 for 1 h or to inhibitor for 10 min prior to addition of ET-1 (1 h). PD184352 and BI-D1870 were from Enzo Life Sciences and were dissolved in DMSO. ET-1 was from Bachem UK. RNA was extracted and quantitative PCR performed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Giraldo1">[10]</xref>. Affymetrix microarray data for cardiomyocytes exposed to ET-1 in the absence or presence of PD184352 or BI-D1870 were published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003597-Amirak1">[9]</xref>. The data are available from ArrayExpress (accession nos. E-MIMR-3, E-MIMR-37, E-MEXP-3393, E-MEXP-3394, E-MEXP-3678, E-MEXP-3679). Probeset sequences that were significantly upregulated and not assigned to a protein-coding gene were analysed by BLAST search against the rat and mouse genomes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/seq/BlastGen/BlastGen.cgi?taxid=10116" xlink:type="simple">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/seq/BlastGen/BlastGen.cgi?taxid=10116</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/seq/BlastGen/BlastGen.cgi?taxid=10090" xlink:type="simple">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/seq/BlastGen/BlastGen.cgi?taxid=10090</ext-link>; cross-species megaBLAST) to identify those which recognise miRNAs.</p>

<title>Sensitivity analysis</title>
<p>A thorough local sensitivity analysis of each of the mathematical models was undertaken in which each parameter value was varied 10- and 100-fold above and below its originally determined value in fitting to the experimental data (phosphorylated ERK, phosphorylated RSK, phosphorylated CREB, phosphorylated c-Jun, Atf3 mRNA, Atf3 and Egr1 mRNA). Varying the parameter values associated with the extension of our original mathematical model whereby phosphorylation of transcription factors for Atf3 and Egr1 were explicitly included, did not give any unexpected results, for instance variation in the rate of MKK1/2 or ERK phosphorylation did not affect the fit to the data. The fit to Egr1 mRNA data was found to be most sensitive to those parameters which decrease the amount of available Atf3 (decreasing Atf3 transcription, decreasing Atf3 translation, increasing Atf3 mRNA and Atf3 degradation) and the rate at which Atf3 supresses Egr1 mRNA.</p>
<p>A sensitivity analysis of the two models in which either Atf3 protein or RSKs inhibit Atf3 transcription showed that no increase or decrease in parameters associated with each model improved the fits shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003597-g003">3</xref>, respectively. The fit of each model was particularly sensitive to how much Atf3 was produced (for instance increasing the rate of RTF association for Atf3 DNA 10-fold simply decreases the amount of Atf3 such that the amount of Egr1 mRNA increases, removing the transiently observed decrease around 2 h).</p>
<p>We found that the fits between the remaining three models (ITF inhibition of Atf3, miRNA regulation of Atf3 mRNA and a combination of the two) and the experimental data were particularly robust to variations in parameters associated with them. For instance increasing the rate of phosphorylation or reverse phosphorylation of the ITF bound transcription factor 100-fold or any of the degradation rates associated with ITF mRNA or protein did not alter the transiently observed behaviour of the model solutions; any increase or decrease in ITF simply affected the Atf3 concentration. Similar results were found for the miRNA model extension and the combined extension of ITF and miRNA upregulation.</p>
