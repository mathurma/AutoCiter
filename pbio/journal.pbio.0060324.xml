        <p>The timing of spiking activity across neurons is a fundamental aspect of the neural population code. Individual neurons in the retina, thalamus, and cortex can have very precise and repeatable responses but exhibit degraded temporal precision in response to suboptimal stimuli. To investigate the functional implications for neural populations in natural conditions, we recorded in vivo the simultaneous responses, to movies of natural scenes, of multiple thalamic neurons likely converging to a common neuronal target in primary visual cortex. We show that the response of individual neurons is less precise at lower contrast, but that spike timing precision across neurons is relatively insensitive to global changes in visual contrast. Overall, spike timing precision within and across cells is on the order of 10 ms. Since closely timed spikes are more efficient in inducing a spike in downstream cortical neurons, and since fine temporal precision is necessary to represent the more slowly varying natural environment, we argue that preserving relative spike timing at a ∼10-ms resolution is a crucial property of the neural code entering cortex.</p>

          <p>Neurons convey information about the world in the form of trains of action potentials (spikes). These trains are highly repeatable when the same stimulus is presented multiple times, and this temporal precision across repetitions can be as fine as a few milliseconds. It is usually assumed that this time scale also corresponds to the timing precision of several neighboring neurons firing in concert. However, the relative timing of spikes emitted by different neurons in a local population is not necessarily as fine as the temporal precision across repetitions within a single neuron. In the visual system of the brain, the level of contrast in the image entering the retina can affect single-neuron temporal precision, but the effects of contrast on the neural population code are unknown. Here we show that the temporal scale of the population code entering visual cortex is on the order of 10 ms and is largely insensitive to changes in visual contrast. Since closely timed spikes are more efficient in inducing a spike in downstream cortical neurons, and since fine temporal precision is necessary in representing the more slowly varying natural environment, preserving relative spike timing at a ∼10-ms resolution may be a crucial property of the neural code entering cortex.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The precision of neuronal spike trains is at the center of a fundamental debate in neuroscience as to what aspects of neuronal signaling are important in representing information in the brain. Individual neurons can have extremely precise and repeatable responses to the visual stimuli that strongly drive them (down to 1-ms variability) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b005">5</xref>], but they exhibit seemingly degraded temporal precision of firing activity in response to suboptimal stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b010">10</xref>]. In the presence of natural scenes, the activity of individual neurons is sparse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b011">11</xref>] and precisely timed across repeated presentations of the visual stimulus, even though natural stimuli tend to vary on a time scale that is several times slower [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b012">12</xref>]. However, in most natural circumstances, the brain does not have access to multiple repetitions of the same identical stimulus, and, therefore, it is the precision of spiking across neuronal sub-populations on single trials that is ethologically relevant. While synchrony across neurons in the retina and visual cortex has been reported at various time scales, which can depend on the visual stimulus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b013">13</xref>], the temporal precision of the neural code directly entering primary visual cortex, and its dependence on the stimulus, are still unknown. We used natural visual stimuli to investigate the spike timing precision of populations of geniculate neurons that serve as the direct input to visual cortex. We show that the response of individual neurons is less precise across stimulus repetitions when luminance contrast is reduced. However, this reduction in the precision of spike timing is not observed at the level of the neuronal population. Therefore, spike timing precision in populations of geniculate neurons is relatively insensitive to global changes in visual contrast and remains constant on the order of ∼10 ms. Since closely timed spikes from either a single neuron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b014">14</xref>] or several neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b015">15</xref>] are more likely to induce a spike in the downstream cortical neuron to which they are projecting, and since fine temporal precision is necessary in representing the more slowly varying natural environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b012">12</xref>], preserving the relative timing of spikes at a resolution of ∼10 ms may be a crucial aspect of the neural code entering primary visual cortex.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>A short movie of a natural scene recorded from a “cat-cam” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b016">16</xref>] was presented repeatedly to anesthetized cats while recording extracellular activity of multiple single units in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in vivo. To test how spike timing precision in individual cells and cell populations was affected by the properties of the visual stimulus, each group of cells was stimulated with both a high-contrast (HC) version and a low-contrast (LC) version of the movie. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g001">Figure 1</xref>A shows the firing activity of a typical ON-center geniculate cell in response to a 500-ms section of the movie presented at both high and low contrast. Each line in the raster plot corresponds to a single repeat and shows the spikes generated during one presentation of this movie section. The peri-stimulus time histogram (PSTH) shows the summed response across 64 repeated presentations. The geniculate neurons exhibited a typical pattern of response in which brief intervals of silence lasting 15 ms or more alternated with firing “events” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b006">6</xref>], or groups of closely spaced spikes lasting up to 100 ms (median: 30 ms), which consistently occurred at approximately the same time on each movie presentation. A 63% reduction of the luminance contrast in the movie resulted in a 23% reduction in the neuronal firing rate, from 10.5 spikes/s at HC to 8.1 spikes/s at LC on average across cells (see full distribution in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060324-sg001">Figure S1</xref>A), and in a latency increase of 3.4 ms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060324-sg001">Figure S1</xref>B). The firing rate reduction and latency increase are visible as a decrease in height and a shift in time in the PSTH events at LC in the particular example of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g001">Figure 1</xref>A.</p>

      <p>PSTH events are typically wider in duration at LC than at HC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b017">17</xref>] (as in the example rasters and PSTHs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, where the average event full width at half-height is 7 ms at HC, 11 ms at LC). Therefore, it has been assumed that suboptimal stimulation leads to a decrease in the temporal precision of the response. However, the widening of the PSTH events from the HC to LC condition could, in principle, arise from several sources, which have different functional implications: either an increase in the inter-spike intervals (ISIs) within the event on each trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, left), or an increased variability in the timing of the events themselves from trial to trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, right), or some combination of both factors. Further analyses were performed to test these two possibilities. First, over all cells, the distribution of (within-trial) ISIs was very similar at HC and LC. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g001">Figure 1</xref>C, both distributions peak at 2.5 ms and have similar full width at half-height (8 ms at HC, 6 ms at LC). If ISIs were longer at LC than HC, the ISI distribution would be wider at LC than HC, which is the opposite of what we find. The fact that the ISI distribution at LC decays faster than at HC is simply due to the higher firing rate at HC, as is the case for Poisson processes (e.g., see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b003">3</xref>]). Second, the timing of events showed significantly more across-trial variability (or “jitter”) at LC (10.9 ± 1.6 ms mean ± standard deviation) than HC (8.2 ± 1.3 ms), with a 2.7-ms difference on average across cells (paired <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, <italic>n</italic> = 45 cells; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). These results suggest, therefore, that overall spike timing variability is primarily due to across-trial variability in the timing of the event as a whole.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, to compare within-cell and across-cell variability, correlation analysis is necessary. Therefore, we first re-examined and validated these single-cell precision findings in terms of correlation measures. First, we quantified the average PSTH event duration by measuring the width of the PSTH autocorrelation function, in which the temporal relationship between individual spikes is lost. We also quantified the temporal precision of individual spikes in a spike train by measuring the width of the spike autocorrelation function (i.e., the autocorrelation of the full spike train). As detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060324-sg002">Figure S2</xref>, the width of the PSTH autocorrelation includes two possible sources of spike timing variability (within-trial and across-trial), whereas the temporal width of the spike autocorrelation function corresponds only to the within-trial variability. The PSTH autocorrelation and spike autocorrelation functions are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g002">2</xref>B for four typical LGN cells at HC (top) and LC (bottom), with the temporal widths in each condition indicated. The PSTH autocorrelation functions were significantly wider at LC than at HC on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g002">Figure 2</xref>C; mean ± standard deviation: HC: 10.0 ± 2.5 ms; LC: 13.5 ± 3.1 ms; paired <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>p</italic> = 5 × 10<sup>−17</sup>, <italic>n</italic> = 45), whereas spike autocorrelations did not show a significant difference in width between LC and HC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g002">Figure 2</xref>D; HC: 8.4 ± 2.8 ms; LC: 8.5 ± 3.8 ms; paired <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.46, <italic>n</italic> = 45), thus confirming that spike timing variability is primarily due to across-trial event-timing variability (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This result was found not only with natural movies, but also with spatiotemporal white noise visual stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060324-sg003">Figure S3</xref>), and was not related to the cell X or Y type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060324-sg004">Figure S4</xref>) nor to the occurrence of LGN bursts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060324-sg005">Figure S5</xref>). These results indicate that decreasing the overall contrast increases the timing variability of groups of spikes (events), but preserves the relative inter-spike timing precision within each group of spikes (as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, bottom right), at a time scale on the order of ∼10 ms.</p>

      <p>The analyses reported above involved the global level of contrast in the full movie (HC versus LC). To further elucidate the relationship between spike timing precision and contrast, we computed the local contrast experienced by each cell as the visual stimulus unfolds in time. Local values of spatiotemporal contrast ranged from 6% to 50% root-mean-squared (RMS) contrast (see Methods). We classified each firing event as corresponding to one in four levels of local contrast: 6–13%, 13–20%, 20–34%, and 34–50%. For each of these contrast levels, we computed the PSTH autocorrelation and spike autocorrelation of each cell, as above. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g002">Figure 2</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g002">2</xref>F, the results presented above for two global levels of contrast (HC and LC) were confirmed with four levels of local contrast. The width of the PSTH autocorrelation significantly decreased as contrast increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g002">Figure 2</xref>E; paired <italic>t</italic>-test; left to right pairwise comparisons: <italic>p</italic> = 1 × 10<sup>−6</sup>, <italic>p</italic> = 1 × 10<sup>−7</sup>, <italic>p</italic> = 2 × 10<sup>−4</sup>, <italic>n</italic> = 45 cells), while spike autocorrelation did not show a significant difference in width across the four different levels of local contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g002">Figure 2</xref>F; paired <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05 in all pairwise comparisons, <italic>n</italic> = 45 cells).</p>
      <p>If the relative timing of spikes is preserved at different levels of contrast in single cells, what does it imply across the population? The activity of local groups of cells with neighboring receptive fields can be significantly correlated if the visual input itself has strong spatial and temporal correlations, as is the case with natural scenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b020">20</xref>]. Although it had been proposed that retinal and/or LGN neurons could remove these correlations through high-pass filtering achieved by lateral inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b022">22</xref>], more recent neurophysiological studies suggest that the cells do not de-correlate their inputs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b023">23</xref>], and thus significant correlations from natural scenes remain present. The strength of pairwise correlation, defined as the area under the cross-correlation function (in the HC condition), decreased with the distance between the receptive fields of two cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g003">Figure 3</xref>A), following the decrease of spatial correlation strength in the visual stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, inset). We focused our analysis on pairs of cells that displayed sufficient cross-correlation in the HC condition (<italic>n</italic> = 41, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g003">Figure 3</xref>A) due to strong correlations in their visual input. Neurons with partially overlapped receptive fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g003">Figure 3</xref>B) typically receive similar visual input and therefore tend to share response events, as is evident in the two typical LGN X ON cells shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g003">3</xref>C.

      <p>The increased variability in event timing in the LC condition for individual neurons, reported above (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g002">Figure 2</xref>), could coexist with a range of effects across a population of neighboring cells, involving within-trial and across-trial variability in the relative timing of spikes from several cells. Since the above result indicates that within cells, event times are more variable across trials at lower stimulus contrast, we then tested the hypothesis that event timing across cells, both within trial and across trials, is also more variable at lower stimulus contrast. From the perspective of a downstream layer 4 V1 neuron receiving direct thalamic input, incoming spike trains that arrive simultaneously from a pair of LGN neurons may be represented by superimposing both spike trains into a single combined spike train. The ISI distribution for these combined spike trains is largely invariant to changes in contrast and peaks at 2.5 ms for both levels of contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g003">Figure 3</xref>D; full width at half-height: 6 ms at HC, 4 ms at LC), as was the case for single-cell spike trains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). The across-cell event-time variability can be estimated by merging events from both cells that overlap in time and measuring the variability in the median time of the combined event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g003">Figure 3</xref>E; mean ± standard deviation of the event-time variability: 9.9 ± 1.0 ms at HC, 13.0 ± 1.4 ms at LC; <italic>n</italic> = 41 cell pairs). Across-cell event-time variability ranged between 8 and 19 ms, larger than but still on the same order of magnitude as that for single cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). Its average value was slightly higher in the LC than in the HC condition (by 3.1 ms on average across cell pairs; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, <italic>n</italic> = 41). However, it should be noted that this measure only indicates how the timing of combined firing events varies across repetitions of an identical stimulus. As argued above, it is the precision of spiking across neurons on single trials that is relevant for the neural population code.</p>
      <p>To quantify further the relative precision of spiking across the neuronal population, we computed cross-correlation in pairs of cells. While all pairs under study displayed stimulus-induced correlation, a few pairs also showed correlation on a finer time scale (&lt;1 ms), suggesting that they received common input from the same retinal ganglion cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b015">15</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g004">4</xref>B shows the spike and PSTH cross-correlation functions for a pair of cells that shared input from the same retinal afferent (as in 4/41 pairs) and a pair of cells that did not. Importantly, since we are focusing on the neural representation of the visual scene rather than the details of the synaptic connectivity of LGN populations, our measure of spike correlation incorporates “signal” correlations (inherited from correlations present in the visual stimulus) as well as “noise” correlations (arising from other sources such as shared input from a common retinal afferent). Both are integral components of the neural code in natural viewing conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b024">24</xref>] and, taken together, reflect the relationships between the correlation structure of the visual scene and the functional properties of the local neuronal circuit. Across all pairs of cells under study, the temporal width of spike cross-correlation only showed a small difference between HC and LC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g004">Figure 4</xref>C; mean ± standard deviation: 14.7 ± 4.7 ms at HC, 15.7 ± 4.3 ms at LC; <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.05, <italic>n</italic> = 41 pairs; see also control analyses in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060324-sg003">Figures S3</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060324-sg005">S5</xref>). Moreover, the PSTH cross-correlation was very similar to spike cross-correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). To investigate how spike timing precision of cell pairs is influenced by local visual contrast, we computed the spike and PSTH cross-correlation at different contrast levels: 6–13%, 13–20%, 20–34%, and 34–50%, as done previously for individual cells. The cross-correlation was based only on the events for which the local contrasts in both receptive fields were at the same level. Consistent with the results presented above, there was no trend in the width of spike and PSTH cross-correlations as a function of local contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g004">Figure 4</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g004">4</xref>F; some of the pairwise <italic>t</italic>-tests showed statistical significance, but not as a monotonic decrease in correlation width with increasing contrast). These results indicate that within-trial spike timing precision across cells is invariant to the change in contrast of the natural scene, despite the increased variability in event timings for individual cells across trials with decreasing contrast.</p>

In almost all cell pairs, cross-correlation width was significantly greater than the width of the autocorrelation functions of both cells, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g005">Figure 5</xref>A (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060324-sg008">Figure S8</xref> for the case of pairs lying close to the unity line, i.e., with similar within-cell and across-cell precision). This finding indicates that spike timing precision was coarser in neuronal pairs than in individual neurons. This decrease in precision can be explained by the fact that, in general, the events are not perfectly aligned across both cells, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g005">Figure 5</xref>B. Even if cells have wider PSTH events at LC than HC, the overall increase in event time variability from HC to LC by 3 ms is small in the face of pairwise variability, which is on average 8 ms greater than single-cell variability.</p>

      <p>Another way to compare pairwise variability with contrast-based variability is by computing, for each shared event, the difference in event time between both cells (and its variability) and the difference in event time between the HC and LC condition (and its variability). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g005">Figure 5</xref>C, the difference in event times between two cells is more variable (i.e., has a wider distribution) than the difference in event times between HC and LC. The standard deviations of the distributions across all events are 16 ms (HC) and 18 ms (LC) across cells, and only 11 ms across contrast (<italic>n</italic> = 4,205 events). In other words, the variability in event timing across cells is approximately 1.5 times larger than the variability in event timing across levels of contrast. Therefore, in the face of across-cell variability, the smaller changes in variability due to changes in contrast are negligible. Thus, spike timing precision across most neighboring cells is relatively insensitive to contrast.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In response to movies of natural scenes, spike timing precision across LGN relay cells remained on the order of ∼10 ms, irrespective of contrast. The absolute timing of LGN firing events changed from trial to trial, and more so at low contrast than at high contrast, but the relative timing of spikes occurring in the same trial was insensitive to changes in stimulus contrast—not only within cells but also across correlated neighboring cells. While it is well known that the response properties of single cells are strongly modulated by contrast adaptation, which has effects including slower temporal dynamics and increased gain and selectivity at lower contrast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b026">26</xref>], our results indicate that the temporal precision of the LGN population code is globally maintained in the face of a reduction in contrast.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, while in individual neurons PSTH autocorrelations were consistently wider at low contrast than high contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g002">Figure 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g002">2</xref>E), the width of the PSTH (and spike) cross-correlation was independent of contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g004">4</xref>E, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g004">4</xref>F). This surprising result can be explained by the large variability in event timing across populations of neurons, which is about 1.5 times larger than the variability in event timing caused by changes in contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). A related finding is that while in individual neurons, the PSTH autocorrelations were consistently wider than the spike autocorrelations, in cell pairs, PSTH and spike cross-correlation had very similar widths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g004">Figure 4</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g004">4</xref>F). This finding suggests that correlations between cells arose mostly from correlations present in the visual input in our experimental conditions, and that neural “noise” (or across-trial variability arising from intrinsic properties of the system) shows little correlation across neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060324-sg007">Figure S7</xref>). Nevertheless, it should be noted that the presence of weak, pairwise noise correlations does not rule out the possibility of stronger, higher-order correlations at the population level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b029">29</xref>].</p>
      <p>Downstream from the LGN, the influence of stimulus contrast on the timing of spikes across V1 cells has only been recently addressed. Spike timing precision across cells in anesthetized macaque V1 reportedly decreased for low-contrast grating stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b010">10</xref>], whereas we found that it was contrast-independent in the cat LGN for natural stimuli. Further, a recent study in cortical slices suggested that the degree of noise correlation between two neighboring cortical cells increased with firing rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b030">30</xref>], unlike the thalamic signal and noise correlations reported here that were invariant to contrast-driven changes in firing rates. These discrepancies may be attributable to differences in the experimental preparations and in the visual stimuli, or they could be explained by specific contrast adaptation mechanisms that occur in cortex but not in precortical areas. For example, in the peripheral auditory system, adaptation to a constant stimulus reduces the firing rate but does not impair spike timing precision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b031">31</xref>], in a similar fashion as what we found in the visual thalamus.</p>
      <p>Preserving spike timing across cells at a ∼10-ms resolution may be a crucial aspect of the neural population code in natural conditions, given that the representation of spatiotemporally varying natural scenes requires a finer temporal precision than the time scale of the visual stimulus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b012">12</xref>]. Furthermore, a 10-ms temporal resolution could facilitate “temporal coding” under the hypothesis that the neural representation of sensory information relies on specific temporal patterns of spikes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b034">34</xref>]. However, the existence or preservation of specific temporal patterns is beyond the scope of the present study. Downstream from the thalamus, spike timing precision may well vary along the visual pathway. Single-cell studies found that trial-to-trial variability is similar in the LGN and V1 when a V1 cell is presented with its preferred stimulus, but that V1 cells become more variable for suboptimal stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b035">35</xref>]. In the presence of natural movies, which combine optimal and nonoptimal stimulation for each cell, recent studies in primate V1 indicate that some visual information is present in the phase of local field potentials at low frequency (&lt;12 Hz) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b036">36</xref>] and that power associated with spiking activity is only informative at frequencies under 12 Hz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b037">37</xref>]. Therefore, the relevant time scale in V1 is probably on the order of tens of milliseconds, only slighter longer than what we found in the LGN. The small increase in variability in V1 trial-to-trial spike timing compared to the LGN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b035">35</xref>] may be explained by nonlinearities in the spiking mechanism and may coexist with lower variability in V1 membrane potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b038">38</xref>]. It is also possible that temporal precision is higher between cortical cells receiving input from geniculate cells that share a common retinal afferent, in a divergent–convergent pattern of connectivity. In any case, it is difficult to relate these previous results to population coding. The degree of spike timing precision across V1 cells, especially in natural viewing conditions, is not well quantified, and how it would be affected by contrast or other variables is unknown. Further studies are needed to elucidate how the functional architecture of the thalamocortical circuit constrains spike timing precision across cells and how it affects the neural code entering V1.</p>
      <p>Preserving synchrony across cells could have a number of functional advantages. Synchronous spikes from several thalamic neurons are reportedly needed to drive cortical cells to threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b039">39</xref>]. Recent studies have suggested that the cortical response is sensitive to the timing of thalamic inputs and that the “window of opportunity” for integration of excitatory inputs at the thalamocortical synapse remains unchanged in the face of adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b040">40</xref>]. Therefore, the relative timing of spikes in thalamic neurons could be an important aspect of the population neural code entering primary sensory cortices and could benefit from being insensitive to some properties of the sensory world while maintaining sensitivity to other, presumably more interesting, features.</p>

Surgical and experimental procedures were performed in accordance with United States Department of Agriculture guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the State University of New York, State College of Optometry. As described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b041">41</xref>], cats were initially anaesthetized with ketamine (10 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> intramuscular) followed by thiopental sodium (20 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> intravenous during surgery and at a continuous rate of 1–2 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> intravenous during recording; supplemented as needed). A craniotomy and duratomy were performed to introduce recording electrodes into the LGN (anterior, 5.5; lateral, 10.5). Animals were paralyzed with atracurium besylate (0.6–1 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> intravenous) to minimize eye movements, and were artificially ventilated. Geniculate cells were recorded extracellularly from layer A of LGN with a multielectrode matrix of seven electrodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b042">42</xref>]. The multielectrode array was introduced in the brain with an angle that was precisely adjusted (25–30 degrees antero-posterior, 2–5 degrees lateral-central) to record from iso-retinotopic lines across the depth of the LGN. A glass guide tube with an inner diameter of ∼300 μm at the tip was attached to the shaft probe of the multi-electrode to reduce the inter-electrode distances to approximately 80–300 μm. Layer A of LGN was physiologically identified by performing several electrode penetrations to map the retinotopic organization of the LGN and center the multielectrode array at the retinotopic location selected for this study (5–10 degrees eccentricity). Recorded voltage signals were conventionally amplified, filtered, and passed to a computer running the RASPUTIN software package (Plexon). For each cell, spike waveforms were identified initially during the experiment and were verified carefully off-line by spike-sorting analysis. Cells were classified as X or Y according to their responses to counterphase sinusoidal gratings. Cells were eliminated from this study if they did not have at least 2 Hz mean firing rates in response to all stimulus conditions, or if the maximum amplitude of their spike-triggered average in response to spatiotemporal white noise stimuli was not at least five times greater than the amplitude outside of the receptive field area.</p>

As in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b017">17</xref>], to improve temporal resolution, movies were interpolated by a factor of two (from 25 to 50 Hz) using commercial software (MotionPerfect, Dynapel Systems Inc.) and then presented at 60 frames per second, i.e., at 1.2× speed. Following interpolation, the intensities of each movie frame were rescaled to have a mean value of 125 (where the full range of intensity values was 0–255). Each movie spanned 48 × 48 pixels at an angular resolution of 0.2 degree per pixel. The first movie (presented to 28 of the cells included in the final analysis) was 750 frames and lasted 12.5 s, while the second movie (presented to the remaining 17 cells) was 600 frames long and lasted 10 s. The stimuli were presented at 60 frames per second with a 120-Hz monitor refresh rate, such that each frame was displayed twice. Each movie was repeated 64–120 times at each of two global levels of luminance contrast: 0.4 (high contrast, or HC) and 0.15 (low contrast, or LC) RMS contrast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b017">17</xref>].</p>
        <p>In addition to “cat-cam” natural movies, as a control for each cell we also used visual stimulation consisting of spatiotemporal binary white noise shown at high contrast (0.55 RMS contrast) and low contrast (0.20 RMS contrast). The spatial resolution and refresh rate of the white noise stimulus were the same as those of the natural scene movies. Each cell in the reported data was stimulated with the natural scenes movies as well as the white noise stimuli with an equal number of repeats (120 repeats at each level of contrast for 28/45 cells, 64 repeats at each level of contrast for 17/45 cells).</p>

        <title>Receptive fields.</title>
        <p>For each cell, the spatiotemporal receptive field was estimated by standard spike-triggered-average techniques based on spatiotemporal white noise stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b044">44</xref>]. The spatial receptive field was fitted with a difference of two-dimensional Gaussians. The distance between receptive fields was defined as the distance between the centers of the Gaussians. The diameter of each receptive field was estimated as the average length of the major and minor axes of the one–standard deviation ellipse that defines the receptive field center. The overlap between two receptive fields was evaluated as the normalized dot product of the two receptive fields, computed after each receptive field had been normalized so that its dot product with itself was one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b046">46</xref>].</p>

        <title>Properties of neural response.</title>
        <p>For each cell at each level of contrast (HC or LC), a single PSTH was computed as the cumulative response of the cell over all 64–120 repeats of the same short movie. Each PSTH was therefore 10 or 12.5 s long, depending on the duration of the stimulus presented to the cell. ISIs were computed as the time intervals between consecutive spikes; in the case of pairs of cells, we merged the spike trains from both cells and computed the ISIs from the combined spike train. Bursts were identified as groups of spikes separated from each other by 4 ms or less, where the first spike is preceded by a period of silence of 100 ms or more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b047">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b049">49</xref>]. The degree of burstiness exhibited by each neuron was defined as the percentage of spikes belonging to a burst.</p>

        <title>Correlation analysis.</title>
        <p>Previous studies typically define temporal precision of single neurons as the standard deviation of the spike times within an identified event across trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b035">35</xref>]. In this study, we first defined a related measure which is the (temporal) width of the central peak in the PSTH autocorrelation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b050">50</xref>]. The width of PSTH events and the width of the PSTH autocorrelation function are directly related, by a factor of √2 in the Gaussian approximation. In computing the PSTH (and its autocorrelation), all spike trains that the cell produced in response to multiple repeats of an identical stimulus were collapsed into one “lumped” spike train (i.e., a PSTH with a 1-ms bin size, of the same duration as a single presentation of the movie, i.e., 10 or 12.5 s). In the PSTH autocorrelation measure, the relative timing of spikes within a given trial or across all trials were confounded. To investigate within-trial temporal precision, we therefore computed a different measure: the width of the central broad peak in the spike autocorrelation, which we defined as the autocorrelation function of the full (several minutes long) spike train without collapsing the trials together [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b052">52</xref>].</p>
        <p>Although analysis of single cells was a necessary first step, the primary focus of this study was on spike timing variability across cells. Two definitions of cross-correlation were used: spike cross-correlation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b052">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b053">53</xref>] and PSTH cross-correlation, which is the cross-correlation between two PSTHs. Spike cross-correlation width gives the spike timing variability across cells within each trial. PSTH cross-correlation has a different meaning: it is approximately equivalent to the “shuffled” or “shifted” spike correlation, in which each spike train of one cell is paired with a spike train of the other cell recorded during a different repeat of the same stimulus. The PSTH cross-correlation averages correlations from all possible pairwise combinations of repeats (actually including the non-shuffled one, which is only one in thousands of combinations and therefore has a negligible contribution).</p>
        <p>All four types of correlation functions (spike or PSTH, auto- or cross-correlation) were made analogous to Pearson's correlation coefficient by (i) subtracting the product of the average firing rates, and (ii) dividing by a normalization factor (see below), such that correlation could take values between −1 and +1. To determine the existence of a central peak or trough in a correlation function, we found the Gaussian function that best fit the central ±100 ms, in a least-mean-square sense. The standard deviation of this Gaussian provides a measure of the correlation width. In the case of autocorrelation, the height <italic>A<sub>i</sub></italic> of the best-fitting Gaussian was measured for each cell <italic>i</italic> and was subsequently set to 1 to normalize the autocorrelation function. In the case of cross-correlation between cells <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic>, the best-fitting Gaussian was normalized by a factor of <inline-formula id="pbio-0060324-ex001"><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.0060324.ex001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>
					, where <italic>A<sub>i</sub></italic> and <italic>A<sub>j</sub></italic> are the heights of each respective autocorrelation function before normalization. The area under the Gaussian curve after normalization was used to define the strength of the cross-correlation between two neurons.
				</p>
        <p><italic>Inclusion criterion for pairs</italic>: A pair of cells was included in the final pairwise analysis if its spike cross-correlation function peaked at a value of 0.065 or higher, an arbitrary threshold below which the cross-correlation function could not be well fitted by a Gaussian function.</p>

        <title>Correlations in the visual stimulus.</title>
        <p>For all pairs of pixels corresponding to the receptive field centers of pairs of cells, we measured the correlation function between both time series (i.e., the time series of the intensity values of each pixel across all frames of the movie). Correlation strength was defined as the area under the Gaussian curve that best fit the cross-correlation function. The resulting spatial profile of correlation in the visual input, i.e., the graph of correlation strength as a function of the distance between two pixels, was fitted (in the least-mean-square sense) to an exponential function with a negative exponent, which is the form expected for spatial correlations in a signal with a power spectrum decreasing as 1/<italic>f</italic><sup>2</sup> with spatial frequency.</p>

        <title>Event analysis.</title>
        <p><italic>Single-cell event analysis</italic>: PSTH “events” were first defined in the PSTH at HC as times of firing interspersed with periods of silence lasting at least 20 ms. If the standard deviation of all spike times constituting an event was less than 20 ms, an attempt was made to break up the event into several events, a procedure in which the spikes were fitted to a mixture-of-Gaussians model using the Expectancy Maximization (EM) algorithm for maximum likelihood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060324-b054">54</xref>]. PSTH events at LC were then defined by aligning LC spikes to existing HC events if possible, with a preference for an HC event that occurred earlier rather than after the LC spike (since it is known that spikes tend to be more delayed at LC than HC). If no corresponding HC event was found, a new event was created at LC, with a corresponding empty event at HC. The timing of an event on a given repeat was defined as the median time of all spikes composing this event. For each event at a given contrast level, the event time variability was the standard deviation of the timing of the event across repeats. We computed for each cell its average event time variability across all events.</p>
        <p><italic>Pairwise event analysis:</italic> Starting from the single-cell event analysis above, each event from the first cell was matched to one or several events in the second cell with which it overlapped in time. If several events in one cell could be matched to a single event in the other cell, these events were merged into one. The list of all events that could be matched across the two cells constituted the list of “shared events.” For each shared event at a given contrast level, the event time variability was the standard deviation of the timing of the event across repeats and across both cells. We computed for each cell pair its average event time variability across all events.</p>
        <p><italic>Event-by-event analysis of event time difference, within cells and across cells:</italic> For all pairs (cell A and cell B), for each pairwise event that existed in the four cases (cell A at HC, cell A at LC, cell B at HC, and cell B at LC), we computed within-cell HC-LC event time difference as the average event time at LC minus the average event time at HC, for each of the two cells (cell A and cell B). In other words, we hold the cell fixed and varied across two contrast levels. We also computed across-cell event time difference at a given contrast level (HC or LC) as the average event time for cell A minus the average event time for cell B. In this case, we hold contrast fixed and varied across two cells. Therefore, each pairwise event yielded four different data points (2 × 2) to compare the distributions of across-cell and within-cell event time difference, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060324-g005">Figure 5</xref>C.</p>

        <title>Local spatiotemporal contrast.</title>
        <p>For each cell, we computed the local value of spatiotemporal contrast as follows. For each firing event determined as above, we identified the smallest rectangle in the image that encompassed the cell's receptive field (e.g., 3 × 4 pixels) and extracted from the movie the luminance values of these pixels at the six previous frames. Six movie frames at 60 Hz correspond to a duration of ∼100 ms, matching the temporal kernel of the cells. The RMS contrast of this spatiotemporal patch of the movie was computed as the standard deviation over all the corresponding pixel values (e.g., 3 × 4 × 6 values). In the LC movie, local contrast values in the 45 cells ranged from 6–20% RMS contrast. In the HC movie, they ranged from 14–50%. For each cell, each firing event (in either the HC or LC condition) was assigned one in four levels of local contrast: 6–13%, 13–20%, 20–34%, or 34–50%. Correlation analysis was then performed as described above on small sections of data corresponding to individual events. We restricted the cross-correlation analysis to the firing events for which both cells experienced a value of local contrast that fell into the same range (out of the four ranges defined above).</p>
