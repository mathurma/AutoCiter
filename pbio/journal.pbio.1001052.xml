            </related-article><abstract>
        <p>FUS/TLS is a nucleic acid binding protein that, when mutated, can cause a subset
                    of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS). Although FUS/TLS is normally
                    located predominantly in the nucleus, the pathogenic mutant forms of FUS/TLS
                    traffic to, and form inclusions in, the cytoplasm of affected spinal motor
                    neurons or glia. Here we report a yeast model of human FUS/TLS expression that
                    recapitulates multiple salient features of the pathology of the disease-causing
                    mutant proteins, including nuclear to cytoplasmic translocation, inclusion
                    formation, and cytotoxicity. Protein domain analysis indicates that the
                    carboxyl-terminus of FUS/TLS, where most of the ALS-associated mutations are
                    clustered, is required but not sufficient for the toxicity of the protein. A
                    genome-wide genetic screen using a yeast over-expression library identified five
                    yeast DNA/RNA binding proteins, encoded by the yeast genes
                        <italic>ECM32</italic>, <italic>NAM8</italic>, <italic>SBP1</italic>,
                        <italic>SKO1</italic>, and <italic>VHR1</italic>, that rescue the toxicity
                    of human FUS/TLS without changing its expression level, cytoplasmic
                    translocation, or inclusion formation. Furthermore, <italic>hUPF1</italic>, a
                    human homologue of <italic>ECM32</italic>, also rescues the toxicity of FUS/TLS
                    in this model, validating the yeast model and implicating a possible
                    insufficiency in RNA processing or the RNA quality control machinery in the
                    mechanism of FUS/TLS mediated toxicity. Examination of the effect of FUS/TLS
                    expression on the decay of selected mRNAs in yeast indicates that the
                    nonsense-mediated decay pathway is probably not the major determinant of either
                    toxicity or suppression.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Of all the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to, one of the most
                    devastating is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly known as Lou
                    Gehrig's Disease. This disorder, which comes in both inherited and random
                    forms, is characterized by degeneration of spinal motor neurons, leading to
                    paralysis and death. The cause of the sporadic form is unknown, but new insight
                    has come from studying the genetic variations that lead to the rarer familial
                    forms. One such gene, accounting for 5%–10% of inherited
                    ALS, is FUS/TLS, which encodes a protein that normally lives in the nucleus of
                    the cell and is involved in the life-cycle of messenger RNA (mRNA).
                    ALS-associated mutations in FUS/TLS cause the protein to mislocalize outside the
                    nucleus into stress granules. Understanding the basis for the toxicity of
                    mislocalized FUS/TLS could lead to new approaches to the treatment of ALS. We
                    have made a yeast model for FUS/TLS cellular toxicity that recapitulates the
                    mislocalization, granular accumulation, and cell death. We have exploited the
                    yeast model to obtain information about what part of the protein is required for
                    proper localization and what part is essential for toxicity. We have also
                    identified several human genes that, when over-expressed in yeast, are able to
                    rescue the cell from the toxicity of mislocalized FUS/TLS. These genes all have
                    functions in mRNA quality control, implicating changes in this pathway in the
                    pathology of ALS.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease after one
                of its most famous victims) is a relentlessly progressive, fatal neurodegenerative
                disease with a prevalence of ∼5 people out of 100,000 each year and an average
                age of onset of ∼60 years. Patients with ALS suffer from degeneration of motor
                neurons in the brain and spinal cord, which leads to progressive muscular weakness.
                ALS accounts for ∼1/300 to 1/400 of all deaths, which means that about 1,000,000
                people now alive in the United States will develop ALS. Death typically occurs
                3–5 years after disease onset, due to respiratory paralysis. There is no
                effective treatment for the disease; the only approved ALS drug (riluzole) extends
                the lifespan of some ALS patients by only about 3 months.</p>
      <p>While most forms of ALS are sporadic and idiopathic (sALS), ∼10% of cases
                are inherited in a Mendelian fashion and are designated familial ALS (fALS). As is
                the case for Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, which also have
                ∼10% familial forms, genetic analysis has identified several genes that
                cause fALS. The first mutations were identified in <italic>SOD1</italic>, which
                encodes the ubiquitously expressed copper/zinc superoxide dismutase; these variants
                cause ∼20% of fALS worldwide. More than 150 different ALS mutations,
                spanning virtually the entire coding sequence of the highly conserved
                    <italic>SOD1</italic> gene, have been identified—nearly all of them
                exhibiting autosomal dominant inheritance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Rosen1">[1]</xref>. Although inclusions containing
                aggregated SOD1 protein have been found in the spinal motor neurons of patients with
                SOD1-dependent fALS, they are generally not found in the sporadic disease.</p>
      <p>More recently, other genes have been identified that collectively account for a
                significant percentage of the remaining fALS cases. These include the genes coding
                for alsin (ALS2), vesicle associated membrane protein B (VAPB) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Nishimura1">[2]</xref>, senataxin (SETX) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Chen1">[3]</xref>, TAR-DNA-binding

                have been associated with increased risk for sALS, most recently ataxin-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Elden1">[8]</xref>. Studies of these
                genes have provided important information about the biochemical processes that may
                underlie ALS. Putative mechanisms of toxicity targeting motor neurons include
                glutamate excitotoxicity, oxidative damage, proteasome inhibition, mitochondrial
                dysfunction, ER stress, axonal transport defects, growth factor signaling
                deficiency, and glial cell dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Rothstein1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Ilieva1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Two of the genes associated with fALS, FUS/TLS and TDP-43, are of special interest
                because inclusions containing these proteins have been identified in motor neurons
                of both sporadic and familial patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Neumann1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Pesiridis1">[15]</xref>. In addition, both of these
                genes have been linked to rare forms of frontotemporal lobar degeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Burrell1">[16]</xref>, indicating
                that they play crucial roles in other neurons. FUS/TLS and TDP-43 are both
                predominantly nuclear RNA binding proteins, although they have also been reported to
                bind DNA in vitro. Both FUS/TLS and TDP-43 are believed to carry out important
                functions in multiple steps of RNA processing, including transcription, splicing,
                transport, translation, and decay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-LagierTourenne1">[17]</xref>. The finding that both
                are fALS genes (each accounts for about 5% of familial ALS cases), and are
                involved in sALS, raises the possibility that RNA processing or quality control
                (damage repair and decay of prematurely terminated messages) may be central to ALS
                pathology. However, the precise connections between RNA biology and ALS remain to be
                discovered.</p>
      <p>The FUS/TLS protein, which is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues, contains an
                N-terminal putative transcriptional activation domain (residues 1–267) rich in
                serine, tyrosine, glutamine, and glycine residues, followed by a canonical RNA
                binding domain (residues 285–371). The C-terminal region has a zinc finger
                domain (residues 422–453) interrupting a long stretch rich in arginines and
                glycines (residues 285–501). The extreme C-terminal 25 amino acids (residues
                501–526) also are rich in arginines and glycines, and the majority of the
                ALS-associated mutations are found among them. Among other postulated functions,
                FUS/TLS is known to be a component of a large nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex that
                functions in shuttling mRNA out of the nucleus.</p>
      <p>Variants of FUS/TLS have previously been studied for their role in liposarcoma, in
                which the N-terminal transcriptional activation domain of FUS/TLS is translocated
                into another chromosomal locus, resulting in gene fusions and production of chimeric
                oncoproteins (e.g. FUS-ERG, FUS-CHOP, and FUS-CREB312). The fusion proteins are
                aberrant transcription factors that contribute to the tumorigenic process by
                altering the expression of many target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Xia1">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Mutations in FUS/TLS found in fALS are largely clustered at the extreme C-terminus of
                the protein. Postmortem histological analysis from patients with FUS/TLS mutations
                indicates that the normally nuclear protein is now found more predominantly in the
                cytosol, where it forms punctate inclusions. This
                mislocalization/inclusion-formation has been proposed to cause either a loss of
                normal protein function in the nucleus, a gain of toxic function in the cytosol, or
                both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Kwiatkowski1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-LagierTourenne1">[17]</xref>. Recently, Dormann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Dormann1">[19]</xref> reported that some of the
                disease-causing mutations affect a non-classical PY nuclear localization signal
                (NLS) in the extreme C-terminus of FUS/TLS and disrupt transportin-mediated nuclear
                import of the protein. As a result, FUS/TLS distribution increases in the cytosol,
                where the protein can be recruited into stress granules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Bosco1">[20]</xref>. These results have led to the
                hypothesis that nuclear import defects and consequent cellular stress may be
                necessary, and possibly sufficient, for FUS/TLS pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Dormann1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Bosco1">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Since FUS/TLS-immunoreactive inclusions are reported to be a common feature in both
                sporadic and familial ALS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Deng1">[13]</xref>, it is likely that an understanding of FUS/TLS-associated
                fALS could also provide valuable information about the more common sporadic form of
                the disease. Additionally, the involvement of FUS/TLS in other neurodegenerative
                diseases, such as a subset of FTLD (atypical FTLD-U) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Neumann2">[21]</xref>, neuronal intermediate
                filament inclusion disease (NIFID) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Neumann3">[22]</xref>, and polyglutamine disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Doi1">[23]</xref>, suggests that several
                neurodegenerative diseases may have similar underlying pathogenic mechanisms. A
                better understanding of the normal and aberrant functions of FUS/TLS might therefore
                provide clues to uncovering the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases beyond ALS.
                With this in mind, we set out to create a model for FUS/TLS-dependent cytotoxicity
                in a genetically and biochemically tractable organism.</p>
      <p>With uniquely available genetic and biochemical tools, yeast has proven to be a
                valuable system to study the functions of human proteins involved in many diseases,
                including neurodegenerative disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Willingham1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Gitler1">[29]</xref>. Although yeast is a simple
                single-cell eukaryote, many fundamental cellular processes are conserved between
                yeast and higher eukaryotes, and a number were first discovered in <italic>S.
                    cerevisiae</italic> or its distant relative, <italic>S. pombe</italic>. If
                expression of FUS/TLS in yeast can be shown to recapitulate some of the relevant
                features of human FUS/TLS-dependent proteotoxicity, then genetic screens can be used
                to dissect the pathways and processes involved.</p>
      <p>In this article, we report a yeast model of FUS/TLS-dependent cytotoxicity, in which
                over-expression and mislocalization of wild-type or mutant FUS/TLS recapitulates the
                phenotypes of toxicity and inclusion formation observed in the human disease.
                Certain features of the model have allowed us to conclude that cytosolic
                localization of large amounts of even the wild-type FUS protein is sufficient to
                cause toxicity, supporting a hypothesis that had been put forward based on studies
                in mammalian cells. A genetic screen using this yeast model for suppressors of
                toxicity identifies, among other genes, the yeast gene <italic>ECM32</italic>, an
                RNA helicase involved in RNA quality control, as one that rescues FUS/TLS toxicity
                when over-expressed. In addition, <italic>hUPF1</italic>, a human homolog of
                    <italic>ECM32</italic>, rescues FUS/TLS toxicity, as do its interacting partners
                    <italic>hUPF2</italic> and (to a lesser extent) <italic>hUPF3</italic>. The
                rescue does not involve a decrease in FUS/TLS expression or a change in its
                localization or inclusion formation, but it does depend on intact functional domains
                of <italic>hUPF1</italic>. Since <italic>hUPF1</italic> plays an important function
                in mRNA quality control, our data raise the possibility that this pathway might be
                involved in the pathogenesis of FUS/TLS<italic>-</italic>associated ALS, and
                possibly of the disease in general. We have investigated the role of one aspect of
                RNA quality control, nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), using the yeast model but find
                no evidence that NMD disruption is responsible for FUS/TLS toxicity or that its
                upregulation is important for suppression.</p>
      <p>Independently, Sun et al. (2010, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Sun1">[30]</xref>) have developed a similar yeast model for
                FUS/TLS-associated ALS and have identified all of the same suppressor genes, plus
                some additional ones, in a similar screen. In addition, they have found genes that,
                when deleted, modulate FUS/TLS toxicity in yeast, and have implicated stress
                granules (discrete cytoplasmic phase-dense particles, observed in cells exposed to
                heat, oxidative, hyperosmolarity, and UV stress, where non-translating mRNAs are
                stored) in this process.</p>

        <title>Expression and Localization of Human FUS/TLS in Yeast: Over-expression of
                    FUS/TLS Is Toxic</title>
        <p>Unlike wild type FUS/TLS, which is largely found in the nucleus and somewhat
                    diffusely in the cytosol, the mutant proteins associated with fALS are
                    predominantly aggregated in the cytoplasm of neurons, where they are proposed to
                    be toxic. To determine whether the budding yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>
                    may serve as a model for investigating the molecular mechanisms of FUS/TLS
                    cytotoxicity, we generated yeast strains expressing FUS/TLS. The human
                        <italic>FUS/TLS</italic> gene, in both wild type and mutant (R521G and
                    H517Q) forms, was N-terminally fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) and
                    placed under the control of the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter, whereby
                    expression is tightly controlled by switching the carbon source in the medium.
                    In these strains, expression of both WT and mutant FUS/TLS is highly induced by
                    shifting to galactose medium. When either mutant or wild-type protein is
                    over-expressed (induced by 2% galactose), the majority of the protein
                    forms punctate aggregates in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001052-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001052.s001">Figure S1</xref>),

                    yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Johnson1">[28]</xref>.
                    Previous studies also indicate that Htt103Q forms SDS-insoluble aggregates,
                    which cannot pass through a 0.2 µM cellulose acetate membrane; however,

                    Htt103Q was trapped by the membrane; however, FUS/TLS aggregates, like TDP43,

        <p>To check for a possible correlation between toxicity and aggregation, all eight
                    proteins (N-terminally GFP tagged) were checked using fluorescence microscopy.
                    As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001052-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, all
                    the proteins, when over-expressed, show aggregation; however, only constructs 4
                    (which lacks the extreme C-terminal 15 residues) and 5 (the full-length protein)
                    are toxic. Interestingly, the aggregates formed by constructs 4 and 5 appear
                    slightly different from each other and also may differ from the aggregates
                    formed by the other constructs. These data suggest that toxicity of FUS/TLS in
                    yeast involves mechanisms beyond protein aggregation, a hypothesis supported by
                    the results of the suppressor screen (see below).</p>
        <p>To test the possible effects of the GFP tag on toxicity, we expressed constructs
                    3–5 without the N-terminal GFP fusion. Consistent with non-tagged
                    constructs, construct 3, which lacks the residues from 371 to 526, is not toxic,
                    and constructs 4 and 5 are still toxic. Interestingly, the construct lacking the
                    15 amino acids at the extreme C-terminal end (construct 4), where most of the
                    fALS mutations are clustered, is more toxic to yeast than the full-length
                    protein (construct 5). This result is consistent with the recent finding that
                    patients with a nonsense mutation of FUS/TLS at position 495 have more rapidly

                    end of the C-terminus (residues 510–526), in a region enriched with

                    residues play a critical role for the function of the protein. One regulatory
                    process involving arginine residues is dimethylation, which is an important
                    signal for the nuclear/cytoplasmic translocalization of a series of RNA binding
                    proteins. That more than 20 arginine residues are indeed dimethylated by the

                    disease-causing mutations clustered in this NLS affect the nuclear localization
                    of the protein. The toxicity of the protein and the age of disease onset
                    correlate with the protein's cytosolic mislocalization and aggregation

                    punctate granules in the yeast cytosol, we posited that its NLS might not be
                    functional in this organism. If so, over-expression of even the wild-type
                    protein would recapitulate the toxicity of the human mutants, as observed,
                    through a failure in nuclear localization. To test this directly, we compared

                            of FUS/TLS (GFP_FUS) and Hrp1 (GFP_Hrp1) as shown in top part of (A).
                            Expression of protein from yeast containing above constructs was induced
                            by 2% galactose for 6 h. Localization and aggregation of protein
                            was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. (B) Hrp1 NLS was added to the
                            c-terminal end of FUS/TLS (FUS_plus) or was used to replace nuclear
                            localization signal of FUS/TLS (FUS_switch), as shown on part top of
                            (B). Protein expression from yeast containing above constructs was
                            induced by 0.1% galactose for 6 h. Protein localization and
                            aggregation was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. (C) The same

                            medium. Cell growth was monitored using a Bioscreen machine for 2 d at
                            30°C. Typically, at least 10 replicates were done for each.</p>

        <p>To determine if the failure in nuclear localization contributes to toxicity, we
                    tested two constructs, one in which the HRP1 NLS was simply appended to the
                    human protein (FUS_plus) and another in which the HRP1 NLS was used to replace
                    the FUS/TLS (FUS_switch; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001052-g005">Figure
                        5B</xref>). Both constructs dramatically increased nuclear localization of
                    FUS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001052-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) and both
                    reduced toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001052-g005">Figure
                    5C</xref>). Aggregation was also reduced when FUS was retargeted to the nucleus,
                    but this is probably due to a generally lower level of FUS expression in these
                    constructs. Toxicity was not completely ameliorated, likely because some
                    residual cytoplasmic FUS persisted even when augmented with the HRP1 NLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001052-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). This relationship
                    between mislocalization and toxicity is consistent with data from neuronal cells
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Dormann1">[19]</xref> and
                    suggests that the wild-type protein is toxic in yeast because the nonfunctional
                    NLS mimics the mislocalization effect of the disease-producing mutations in
                    human cells.</p>

        <title>Genome Wide Screen to Identify Genes Whose Over-expression Rescues the
                    Toxicity of FUS/TLS in Yeast</title>
        <p>The ability of yeast expressing human FUS/TLS to recapitulate several salient
                    features of disease prompted us to perform a genome-wide over-expression screen.
                    By identifying yeast genes that modify FUS/TLS toxicity, we hoped to identify
                    pathways or proteins that would illuminate pathogenic mechanisms. We screened an
                    over-expression library containing a collection of yeast open reading frames,
                    fully sequenced and placed under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter.
                    A total of 5,535 genes are covered in this library (representing 95% of
                    the yeast genome). We transformed each of the 5,535 genes into the yeast strain
                    expressing the moderately toxic one copy of FUS/TLS (untagged FUS/TLS integrated
                    into the yeast genome at the <italic>HIS3</italic> locus) and selected for those
                    that suppress FUS/TLS toxicity upon over-expression. All of the positive
                    over-expression plasmids were retransformed into a fresh yeast strain and
                    validated for their suppressive effects. Surprisingly, after three rounds of
                    retesting, only a handful of yeast genes could suppress FUS/TLS toxicity, all of
                    which are listed in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001052-t001">Table
                        1</xref>. FUS expression is very toxic in yeast, and the identified
                    suppressors do not completely abolish the effect of FUS on yeast growth. As
                    observed for a similar screen in a yeast alpha-synuclein toxicity model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Cooper1">[26]</xref>, several
                    transcription factors that down-regulate the GAL1 promoter activity also
                    suppress the toxicity of FUS/TLS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001052-t001">Table 1</xref>, bottom section). These modifiers were not specific to
                    FUS/TLS; they also suppress other toxic proteins expressed under GAL1 promoter
                    control, such as TDP-43.</p>

        <title>hUPF1, a Human Homolog of <italic>ECM32</italic>, Rescues Toxicity of

        <p>Based on sequence similarity (∼30% identity and ∼50%
                    similarity in the helicase domain), <italic>hUPF1</italic>, a gene playing an
                    important role in the pathway of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), is the closest

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-LykkeAndersen1">[39]</xref>.
                    Because of this homology, we hypothesized that the toxicity of FUS/TLS may be
                    rescued by yeast expression of <italic>hUPF1</italic>. The full-length
                        <italic>hUPF1</italic> gene was cloned into a yeast expression vector and
                    tested on the toxicity of FUS/TLS. Over-expression of <italic>hUPF1</italic>
                    rescues the toxicity of both 1XFUS and 2XFUS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001052-g007">Figure 7A and B</xref>). To check for possible
                    direct interaction between hUPF1 and FUS/TLS, we co-expressed red fluorescent
                    protein-tagged hUPF1 and GFP-tagged FUS/TLS. hUPF1 is expressed mainly in the
                    cytosol in yeast but does not co-localize with FUS/TLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001052-g007">Figure 7C</xref>), suggesting the rescue effect by
                    hUPF1 might be indirect. However, more data are needed to rule out possible
                    over-expression artifacts.</p>
        <p>Next, we investigated whether the expression of <italic>hUPF2</italic>, another
                    nonsense-mediated decay pathway gene whose protein product is known to form a
                    complex with the UPF1 protein, might also rescue FUS toxicity in yeast, and
                    found that it did, to an equal extent as that of <italic>hUPF1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001052-g007">Figure 7</xref>). However,
                    over-expression of human <italic>UPF3</italic>, another protein known to
                    interact with UPF1, showed only moderate rescue compared to
                        <italic>hUPF1</italic> and <italic>hUPF2</italic> (suppression of toxicity
                    of 1XFUS but not of 2XFUS). We then examined the expression of the next closest
                    human homologue of <italic>ECM32</italic>, <italic>IGHMBP2</italic>
                    (∼25% identity), a ribosome-associated helicase implicated in DNA

        <p>hUPF1 has an N-terminal hUPF2 binding domain and a C-terminal ATPase/Helicase

                    domains, we tested the constructs expressing only the hUPF2 binding domain
                    (hUPF1-418) or the ATPase/Helicase domain (hUPF419-1118). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001052-g008">Figure 8C</xref>, neither domain
                    rescues the toxicity of FUS/TLS to the extent that the full-length wild type
                    protein rescues. To further test whether ATPase/Helicase activity is required
                    for the rescue, we checked the full-length protein with ATPase/Helicase
                    partially inactivated by a point mutation (R844C) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Sun2">[41]</xref> and found that FUS/TLS
                    toxicity cannot be fully rescued when ATPase/Helicase activity of hUPF1 is
                    inhibited. It is noteworthy that hUPF1(R844C) still has 60% of the
                    activity of wild-type hUPF1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Sun2">[41]</xref>, so it is quite possible that fully inactivated hUPF1
                    would not rescue at all. These data suggest that both domains of hUPF1 and
                    functional ATPase/Helicase activity are required for its rescue of FUS/TLS
                    toxicity.</p>

        <p>To prevent the potential accumulation of deleterious nonsense fragments of
                    polypeptides in the cytoplasm, mRNAs that retain an intron containing an

      <p>Many essential cellular functions are conserved in the simple eukaryote yeast.
                Studies from this organism have provided valuable information for our understanding
                of many critical cellular functions, including cell cycle regulation, DNA
                replication, RNA synthesis and processing, protein synthesis, protein trafficking,
                and signal transduction. This simple system has also been utilized to study
                functions of proteins involved in human diseases, including neurodegenerative
                diseases. Although a yeast model usually cannot recapitulate all of the cellular
                processes in human cells, it has proven to capture key aspects of molecular
                pathology for several neurodegenerative disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Khurana1">[27]</xref>. With its ease of
                high-throughput manipulations for both genetics and biochemistry, the yeast model
                organism provides invaluable tools for studying molecular mechanisms of human
                diseases. For those human proteins for which yeast cytotoxicity models are
                available, toxicity from each protein is usually quite different. Genetic modifiers
                identified from those yeast models usually do not overlap, supporting the use of
                yeast models for studying functions of human proteins specifically.</p>
      <p>In this article, we report a yeast model of FUS/TLS-associated proteotoxicity when
                the protein is mislocalized to the cytoplasm. The model faithfully recapitulates the
                cytosolic aggregation and cytotoxicity observed in spinal motor neurons in the human
                disease. We exploited this model to test various hypotheses about FUS-mediated
                cytotoxicity. Comparison of the aggregates isolated from the model with those from
                yeast models of huntingtin toxicity and TDP-43 toxicity showed that they differed
                from the former but were similar to the latter; two yeast genes known to affect
                huntingtin aggregation when over-expressed also failed to affect FUS/TLS
                localization or aggregation. Clustering of fALS-associated FUS mutations in regions
                of potential arginine dimethylation prompted us to investigate the effects of
                deletion of either of the major yeast arginine methyltransferases on FUS/TLS
                cytosolic localization and toxicity, but neither their deletions nor introduction of
                known chemical inhibitors of yeast arginine methyltransferase activity had any
                effect on these properties. Over-expression of the major yeast and human arginine
                methyltransferaaes also failed to modulate FUS/TLS toxicity in yeast. However, we
                have no data at present to indicate that human FUS/TLS is a substrate for the yeast
                arginine methyltransferases (even though they are close homologues of the major
                human arginine methyltransferase, PRMT1), so we cannot conclude from this experiment
                that arginine methylation may play no role in FUS/TLS toxicity in mammalian cells.
                It does not seem to be a major factor in toxicity in yeast.</p>
      <p>Initially, the observation that both WT and mutant FUS localized to the cytoplasm and
                were equally toxic was unexpected. However, recent work on the C-terminal FUS
                mutations provides a satisfying explanation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Dormann1">[19]</xref>. These mutations prevent the
                nuclear import of FUS, increasing cytoplasmic accumulation in stress granules and,
                eventually, producing toxic and insoluble aggregates. FUS uses an unusual nuclear
                localization signal (NLS) of the bPY-type. Although yeast has this same bPY-type
                nuclear localization system, divergence in the recognition signal would cause toxic
                mislocalization of even the WT FUS protein in yeast. Indeed, when we compared the
                ability of the WT FUS NLS signal and a known functional yeast bPY-type NLS to drive
                a GFP reporter into the nucleus, the FUS signal was nonfunctional. Next, we reasoned
                that if cytoplasmic mislocalization of FUS was responsible for increased toxicity,
                then restoring nuclear localization with a recognition sequence that does function
                in yeast should reduce toxicity. This proved to be correct. Thus, our work provides
                an independent validation of Haass' recent model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Dormann1">[19]</xref>, recapitulating the
                observation that cytoplasmic mislocalization is important in the toxicity of FUS.
                This mechanistic link between mutations and toxicity is in contrast to TDP-43, where
                ALS mutations increase aggregation in vitro (as opposed to transport) and enhance
                toxicity in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Johnson1">[28]</xref>. In agreement, the accompanying manuscript demonstrates
                that FUS mutations do not alter aggregation or toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Sun1">[30]</xref>. The lack of an effect of ALS
                mutations in yeast separates two aspects of FUS pathology—(1) mislocalization
                and (2) cytoplasmic toxicity. Since the NLS is nonfunctional in yeast, our system
                models the cytoplasmic-dependent toxicity, but not the mechanism of mislocalization
                itself. Because the link between mislocalization and ALS mutants has been
                established, we view the inability to model mislocalization not as a liability but
                rather as a strength, in that it allows us to focus on toxicity itself.</p>
      <p>We also expressed a series of FUS/TLS constructs with various domains deleted and
                found that the C-terminal region of the protein was necessary but not sufficient for
                toxicity. In an independent, more detailed study using a similar yeast model of
                FUS/TLS toxicity, Sun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Sun1">[30]</xref> conclude that, in contrast to TDP-43, determinants in
                both the N- and C-terminal regions of FUS are required to couple aggregation to
                toxicity in vivo and for spontaneous aggregation in vitro, suggesting that FUS
                aggregates by a mechanism distinct from that of TDP-43. They also find that FUS is
                intrinsically aggregation-prone and that the aggregates formed by purified FUS in
                vitro closely resemble the aggregates observed in affected neurons in human
                disease.</p>
      <p>Some of the aggregates formed by the various deletion constructs appeared to differ
                from one another slightly when viewed microscopically. We have not yet characterized
                the nature of the aggregation in any of these cases, but if different morphological
                aggregates are indeed toxic and similar-looking aggregates are not always toxic, as
                we in fact observe, our data lend support to the conclusion that aggregation and
                toxicity may not be tightly coupled in this system.</p>
      <p>Using a yeast over-expression library screen, we identified five yeast genes that,
                when over-expressed, rescue the toxicity of FUS/TLS. Strikingly, all five genetic
                modifiers are, like FUS, DNA/RNA binding proteins. We have compared genetic
                modifiers from other yeast models and found that these five genes are not identified
                as suppressors in other yeast models for neurodegenerative diseases, including
                Parkinson's disease (over-expression of α-synuclein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Outeiro1">[25]</xref>), TDP-43-dependent ALS
                (over-expression of wild-type TDP-43 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Johnson1">[28]</xref>), and Huntington's
                disease (over-expression of polyQ-expanded huntingtin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Willingham1">[24]</xref>), indicating that they are
                specific to FUS/TLS. We also note that genetic screens from other yeast models
                usually identify many more genetic modifiers. The very limited number of hits from
                our FUS/TLS yeast model suggests that the toxicity of FUS/TLS may stem from its
                effect on a limited number of cellular functions. Our screening results are similar
                to results obtained independently by Sun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Sun1">[30]</xref>, who found 23 over-expression
                suppressors (including all of the genes we identified) and also carried out a screen
                for yeast genes that modify toxicity when deleted. Further, they provide compelling
                evidence that stress granules and P-bodies are likely to be involved in FUS/TLS
                effects in yeast. We have also found a correlation between mutant FUS/TLS and stress
                granules that may be relevant to ALS pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Bosco1">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Most importantly, we found that expression of <italic>hUPF1</italic> (or of its
                physical interacting partner <italic>hUPF2</italic> and, to a lesser extent,
                    h<italic>UPF3</italic>) rescues FUS/TLS toxicity. Among other roles,
                    <italic>hUPF1</italic> plays a very important function in mRNA quality control,
                including nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), a critical cellular mechanism of mRNA
                surveillance that functions to detect nonsense mutations and prevent the expression
                of truncated or erroneous proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Isken1">[43]</xref>. It has been proposed that a principal event underlying
                neurodegeneration occurs when cytotoxic, truncated proteins are expressed from
                normally degraded nonsense-containing RNAs and pseudogene transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001052-Connolly1">[44]</xref>. Our finding
                that <italic>hUPF1</italic> and <italic>hUPF2</italic> rescue the toxicity of
                FUS/TLS is broadly consistent with this hypothesis; however, our results from
                examination of the level of specific NMD mRNA substrates (see below) suggest that
                NMD cannot be the sole RNA pathway affected by FUS or its suppressors in yeast. Our
                results do suggest the possibility that disruption of some part of the RNA quality
                control process might be related to the toxicity mechanism of FUS/TLS.</p>
      <p>Because <italic>ECM32</italic>, <italic>hUPF1</italic>, or <italic>hUPF2</italic>
                expression all rescue FUS toxicity without dissolving the cytosolic aggregates or
                changing the expression level of FUS or its mislocalization, it is likely that
                toxicity involves disruption of some essential cellular function that is either
                restored or compensated for by the introduction of these genes. One possibility is
                that FUS over-expression sequesters RNA and/or protein molecules involved in
                nonsense-mediated decay, which is an essential function in yeast. Yeast contains no
                FUS homologue, but many of the other proteins important for RNA quality control are
                conserved between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and humans.</p>
      <p>To check the possible direct effect of FUS on the NMD pathway, we determined pre-mRNA
                levels of <italic>CYH2</italic> and <italic>MER2</italic>, which are among the
                reported substrates of the NMD pathway in yeast. If this pathway is impaired by FUS
                over-expression, it is then expected that both pre-mRNAs would be accumulated.
                However, only <italic>CYH2</italic> pre-mRNA is increased by FUS expression in our
                assay, suggesting that FUS may interfere with other RNA quality control systems,
                rather than exerting a direct effect on the NMD pathway. It is worth mentioning that
                    <italic>CYH2</italic> pre-mRNA was accumulated to a much higher level than
                    <italic>MER2</italic> in our assay (5-fold versus 2-fold; unpublished data);
                this may help to explain no detected accumulation of <italic>MER2</italic> pre-mRNA
                when FUS is over-expressed.</p>
      <p>In addition, co-expression of hUPF1 and yeast <italic>ECM32</italic>, two suppressors
                of FUS toxicity, had different effects on the accumulated <italic>CYH2</italic>
                pre-mRNA level caused by over-expression of FUS. Together with their different
                rescuing effects on other yeast neurodegenerative disease models, these data suggest
                that hUPF1 and <italic>ECM32</italic> may rescue FUS toxicity through different
                mechanisms.</p>
      <p>It is important to emphasize that we are not claiming that this is a yeast model of a
                human disease. It is a model for the cytotoxicity of a human protein whose
                mislocalization to the cytosol causes a devastating neurologic disorder. It appears
                to recreate the salient features of that part of the pathology: cytosolic
                localization, aggregation in stress granules, and cell death. It has allowed us to
                determine the parts of the protein essential for toxicity, to test hypotheses about
                the factors responsible for localization, and to identify suppressor genes in both
                the yeast and human genome. We believe that the fact that wild type and mutant are
                both toxic in this model is not a failing of the model. Both wild-type and mutant
                are mislocalized to the same extent in yeast because the FUS nuclear localization
                signal, where the mutations occur, is not efficient in the microbe, and so if the
                neurotoxicity of the mutants is entirely due to their mislocalization, as has been
                hypothesized by others, then the wild type protein <italic>should</italic> also be
                toxic in our model, exactly as observed.</p>
      <p>In summary, our yeast model recapitulates multiple features of disease-causing mutant
                protein FUS/TLS pathology, including aggregation, cytosolic localization, and
                toxicity, which should make it valuable for studying the function and mechanism of
                toxicity of this protein in human neurodegenerative disorders. In addition, our
                model is amenable to high-throughput small molecule screens to identify compounds
                that suppress FUS/TLS toxicity. Like TDP-43, which saw a number of cell culture and
                animal models follow its identification as an ALS/FTLD protein, we envisage a
                similar trajectory for FUS/TLS. By importing our yeast findings into mammalian cell
                culture and neuronal systems, we anticipate creating a yeast discovery/mammalian
                confirmation paradigm that will yield critical insights into FUS/TLS pathobiology
                and potentially provide therapeutic targets or pathways for exploitation.</p>

                    vortex, and protein extract was prepared by collecting the supernatant
                    (centrifuge 5,000 rpm, 5 min). Protein concentration was determined by Bradford
                    assay. 2% of SDS was added to the protein sample before the sample was
                    boiled for 5 min. 10-fold dilutions of protein samples was prepared in 96-well
                    plates, and loaded onto the prepared manifold (V&amp;P scientific) with
                    cellulose acetate membrane (pore size 2 µ; Whatman). Vacuum was applied
                    and all the liquid was sucked through the manifold. After washing 5 times with
                    0.2% SDS, the manifold was dissembled carefully, and cellulose acetated
                    membrane was used for Western blotting to detect protein.</p>

        <p>Indirect immunofluorescence of yeast cells with FUS antibody was adapted from
                    chapter 40 of “Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology.” Yeast
                    cells were grown to early log phase in the selective raffinose medium, and
                    expression of the interested protein was induced for 6 h by 2% galactose.
                    Cells were fixed in freshly made fixation buffer (50 mM Kpi pH 6.5, 1 mM MgCl2,
                    and 4% formaldehyde) for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed
                    two times with PM buffer (0.1 M Kpi pH 7.5, 1 mM MgCl2) and resuspended with PM
                    buffer with protease inhibitors (Roche). Cells were then treated with zymolase
                    for 20 min. Spheroblasts were harvested at 2,000 rpm and washed once with PM
                    with protease inhibitors. Cells were then spotted onto poly-l-lysine coated well
                    of the slide. We immersed the slide for 5 min each in methanol and acetone
                    (pre-cooled to −20°C). Cells were then blocked by PBS-block (1XPBS,
                    1% dried milk, 0.1%BSA, 0.1% octyl glucoside) for 1 h,
                    followed by incubation with primary antibody (Abcam, 1∶100 dilution),
                    wash, incubation with secondary antibody conjugated with fluorescein
                    (Invitrogen, 1∶100 dilution), and wash.</p>
        <p>5 µl of mounting solution (Santa Cruz Biotech) was added to each well, and
                    cells were viewed using fluorescence microscope. To visualize nucleus, DAPI
                    (1∶1,000) was included in the mounting solution.</p>
