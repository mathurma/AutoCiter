<article-title>One Lipid, Two Synaptic Plasticity Pathways</article-title>
</related-article>
<abstract>
<p>Synaptic communication is a dynamic process that is key to the regulation of neuronal excitability and information processing in the brain. To date, however, the molecular signals controlling synaptic dynamics have been poorly understood. Membrane-derived bioactive phospholipids are potential candidates to control short-term tuning of synaptic signaling, a plastic event essential for information processing at both the cellular and neuronal network levels in the brain. Here, we showed that phospholipids affect excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission by different degrees, loci, and mechanisms of action. Signaling triggered by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) evoked rapid and reversible depression of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents. At excitatory synapses, LPA-induced depression depended on LPA<sub>1</sub>/G<sub>αi/o</sub>-protein/phospholipase C/myosin light chain kinase cascade at the presynaptic site. LPA increased myosin light chain phosphorylation, which is known to trigger actomyosin contraction, and reduced the number of synaptic vesicles docked to active zones in excitatory boutons. At inhibitory synapses, postsynaptic LPA signaling led to dephosphorylation, and internalization of the GABA<sub>Aγ2</sub> subunit through the LPA<sub>1</sub>/G<sub>α12/13</sub>-protein/RhoA/Rho kinase/calcineurin pathway. However, LPA-induced depression of GABAergic transmission was correlated with an endocytosis-independent reduction of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, possibly by GABA<sub>Aγ2</sub> dephosphorylation and subsequent increased lateral diffusion. Furthermore, endogenous LPA signaling, mainly via LPA<sub>1</sub>, mediated activity-dependent inhibitory depression in a model of experimental synaptic plasticity. Finally, LPA signaling, most likely restraining the excitatory drive incoming to motoneurons, regulated performance of motor output commands, a basic brain processing task. We propose that lysophospholipids serve as potential local messengers that tune synaptic strength to precedent activity of the neuron.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Neuronal networks are modules of synaptic connectivity that underlie all brain functions, from simple reflexes to complex cognitive processes. Synaptic plasticity allows these networks to adapt to changing external and internal environments. Membrane-derived bioactive phospholipids are potential candidates to control short-term synaptic plasticity. We demonstrate that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), an important intermediary in lipid metabolism, depresses the main excitatory and inhibitory synaptic systems by different mechanisms. LPA depresses inhibitory synaptic transmission by reducing the number of postsynaptic receptors at inhibitory synapses; whereas it depresses excitatory synaptic transmission by decreasing the size of the ready-to-use synaptic vesicle pool at excitatory terminals. Finally, we demonstrate that LPA signaling contributes to the performance of motor output commands in adult animals. Our data documents that synaptic strength and neuronal activity are modulated by products of membrane phospholipid metabolism, which suggests that bioactive phospholipids are candidates in coupling brain function to the metabolic status of the organism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Activity-dependent plasticity of neuronal networks refers to the adaptive changes in their properties in response to external and internal stimuli. In a prominent form of central nervous system (CNS) plasticity, synaptic strength results in an increase (potentiation) or decrease (depression) of transmission efficacy, depending on the neuron’s precedent activity (activity-dependent synaptic plasticity). Short-lived processes that modify synaptic strength occur in practically all types of synapses [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and short-term synaptic plasticity is essential in regulating neuronal excitability and is central to information processing at both cellular and neuronal network levels [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Homeostatic adjustment of synaptic weights counteracts neuronal rate disturbances that affect self-tuning neuronal activity within a dynamic range via Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent sensors [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The number of receptors in the surface membrane and at synaptic sites, and the size of the readily releasable pool (RRP) of synaptic vesicles (SVs), are important determinants of synaptic strength, short-term plasticity, and intersynaptic crosstalk [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Unmasking the feedback mechanisms that are believed to sense neuron activity and adjust synaptic strength (i.e., activity-dependent, coupled messenger synthesis and/or release) would help to explain how circuits adapt during synaptic homeostasis, experience-dependent plasticity, and/or synaptic dysfunctions that underlie cognitive decline in many neurological diseases.</p>
<p>The ligand-gated ionotropic channels—A-type GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) and AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs)—mediate fast synaptic transmission at the vast majority of inhibitory and excitatory synapses, respectively, in the mammalian brain [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Cell surface stability of receptors is further regulated by post-translational phosphorylation, palmitoylation, and/or ubiquitination. In particular, AMPAR and GABA<sub>A</sub>R phosphorylation modulates the receptor’s biophysical properties and membrane trafficking. Hence, the coordinated activity of kinases and phosphatases plays a pivotal role in controlling synaptic strength and neuronal excitability. Key residues within the intracellular domains of diverse AMPAR and GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunits are targeted by a number of kinases, including protein kinases A and C, calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II, and tyrosine kinases of the Src family. Generally, phosphorylation stabilizes the receptor on the surface and, conversely, dephosphorylation appears to be important for receptor endocytosis [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a strong candidate to function as a local messenger that rapidly affects synaptic strength. A membrane-derived bioactive phospholipid that affects all biological systems, LPA is an important intermediary in lipid metabolism and has a vital role in de novo biosynthesis of membrane phospholipids [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The nervous system is markedly modulated by LPA signaling. LPA, autotaxin (the main LPA-synthesizing enzyme), and many subtypes of LPA-specific G-protein-coupled receptors (LPA<sub>1–6</sub>) are enriched in the brain [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Downstream signaling cascades mediating LPA signaling include mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, adenylyl cyclase inhibition or activation, phospholipase C (PLC) activation/Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization and/or protein kinase C (PKC) activation, arachidonic acid release, Akt/PKB activation, and the activation of small GTPase RhoA and subsequent Rho kinase (ROCK) stimulation [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Many subtypes of LPA receptors (LPARs) are expressed in the brain; in particular, LPA<sub>1</sub> is highly expressed and is the most prevalent receptor subtype in both the embryonic and adult brains [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Accordingly, LPA targets all CNS cell types to modulate developmental processes including neurogenesis, migration, differentiation, and morphological and functional changes [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, little is known about how LPA signaling influences neuron physiology and neuronal connectivity or integrates incoming synaptic drive. Presynaptic LPA<sub>2</sub> at glutamatergic synapses mediates neuronal network hyperexcitability in an epileptic mouse model [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In addition, LPA<sub>1</sub>-deficient mice manifest alterations in managing diverse neurotransmitters [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Endogenous ROCK activity, an intracellular partner in LPA signaling, is necessary to maintain afferent AMPAergic and GABA<sub>A</sub>ergic synaptic strength in motoneurons [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As a conventional link in synaptic plasticity, activity-dependent LPA production occurs downstream of noxious activation of glutamate receptors in models of neuropathic pain [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, whether LPA signaling is actually able to modulate synaptic strength and mediate activity-dependent synaptic plasticity remains unresolved.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to investigate whether LPA regulates synaptic strength and plasticity of motoneuron excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Here, we show that LPA—mainly via LPA<sub>1</sub>—induced rapid and reversible depression in synaptic strength (short-term depression [STD]), and operated as an autocrine messenger mediating activity-dependent STD at inhibitory synapses. At glutamatergic synapses, presynaptic LPA signaling reduced the size of the RRP of SVs. At GABAergic synapses, postsynaptic LPA action mediated dephosphorylation and endocytosis-dependent internalization of the GABA<sub>Aγ2</sub> subunit. Strikingly, LPA signaling regulated the performance of motor output commands in vivo. Therefore, LPA seems to have important implications for synaptic plasticity, pathology, and information processing in the brain.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The hypoglossal motor system was used as an experimental model to test the hypothesis that LPA regulates synaptic function. Hypoglossal motoneurons (HMNs) are arranged in the hypoglossal nucleus (HN) at the dorsal medulla, being easily accessible for functional studies in animal models. In vitro, AMPAR- and GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated neurotransmission incoming to HMNs can be feasibly isolated and are well characterized [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. From an experimental point of view, a considerable advantage of this system is that the inspiratory-related afferent activity in HMNs, almost exclusively mediated by AMPAergic signaling, persists even in the in vivo decerebrated preparation [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Interestingly, HMNs underpin essential motor commands for normal suckling behavior in the neonate, a vital activity altered in LPA<sub>1</sub>-deficient mice [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In addition, <italic>lpa</italic><sub><italic>1–6</italic></sub> mRNAs are expressed by HMNs in the adult mouse (Allen Mouse Brain Atlas, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mouse.brain-map.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://mouse.brain-map.org/</ext-link>; [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]). Altogether, previous findings point to this motor system as a suitable model to investigate the role of LPA in the control of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic neurotransmission at the CNS.</p>

<title>Anatomical Support for a Role of Lysophospholipids at Excitatory and Inhibitory Synapses</title>
<p>To explore a possible role of LPA in shaping the normal motor output of the HN, it was necessary to determine the predominant isotype of its main target receptors expressed in this motor nucleus. Assessment of the expression levels of mRNAs for LPA<sub>1–6</sub> receptors in microdissected HN from neonatal (P7) rats revealed that <italic>lpa</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> mRNA was 1.5 to 12.5 times more abundant than <italic>lpa</italic><sub><italic>2–6</italic></sub> transcripts (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Subsequently, confocal analysis of double immunolabeled HN from P7 pups showed LPA<sub>1</sub>-immunoreactive (ir) puncta, patches, and fiber-like structures colocalizing with SMI32-positive HMN perikarya and dendrite-like structures (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B–1D</xref>). Three-dimensional reconstructions agreed with a cytoplasmic and membrane localization of LPA<sub>1</sub> in perikarya and main dendritic branches of HMNs (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>). Triple immunofluorescence for LPA<sub>1</sub>, SMI32, and the vesicular glutamate (VGLUT2) or GABA (VGAT) transporters as synaptic markers confirmed that LPA<sub>1</sub>-ir puncta were colocalizing with excitatory (VGLUT2-ir) or inhibitory (VGAT-ir) presynaptic structures (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G, 1H, 1J, and 1K</xref>). Both excitatory and inhibitory inputs were also found apposed to SMI32-ir neuropil or somata coexpressing LPA<sub>1</sub> (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1H and 1I</xref>). Although LPA<sub>1</sub> expression in other neural cell types is not excluded, this expression pattern supports pre and/or postsynaptic roles of LPA<sub>1</sub> at the main excitatory and inhibitory inputs on HMNs, suggesting a potential contribution of LPA to motoneuron physiology.</p>

<p>(A) Schematic diagram of the in vitro experimental model used to analyze the effects of LPA on synaptic transmission incoming to HMNs. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings (Rec) were obtained from somata of HMNs in neonatal brain stem slices. Experiments were performed as in our previous published study [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. ePSCs were evoked by electrical stimulation (Stim) of the VLRF. A micropipette (arrow) near to a HMN before patch performance is illustrated in the inset. (B) Top, schematic representation of the experimental protocol carried out to study drug effects on ePSCs. Motoneurons were initially allowed to stabilize (Stabil.) with normal artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) to obtain baseline control recordings. Slices were then superfused for 10 min with aCSF alone (vehicle) or with LPA or s-LPA (drug) before current responses were acquired again. Finally, a last round of acquisition was taken after a 10 min washout with drug-free aCSF. Bottom, examples of eEPSCs<sub><bold>AMPA</bold></sub> (left panels) and eIPSCs<sub><bold>GABAA</bold></sub> (middle panels) recorded from HMNs before and following exposure to LPA (2.5 μM) or s-LPA (40 μM) for 10 min and after washing.

<p>The two major species of LPA (approximately 70%) found in the brain [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], monounsaturated (18:1, or LPA) and saturated (18:0, or s-LPA), were used in this study. While LPA activates LPA<sub>1–3</sub>, s-LPA has high affinity for LPA<sub>1/2</sub>, but is a comparatively poor agonist against LPA<sub>3</sub> [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Unless stated otherwise, LPA was used at a similar concentration (2.5 μM) to that found in serum (1–5 μM) [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In general, unsaturated LPAs are more potent than s-LPA in activating LPARs and inducing biological activities [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Accordingly, a higher concentration was used for s-LPA (40 μM) than for LPA (2.5 μM) to achieve a similar effect on neurotransmission. Both phospholipids, added for 10 min to the bath solution, strongly attenuated the amplitude of eEPSCs<sub>AMPA</sub> and eIPSCs<sub>GABAA</sub> (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). The effects were reversed after 10 min of washing. Thus, LPA modulated rapidly and reversibly the strength of AMPAR- and GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated synaptic transmission in motoneurons.</p>
<p>The tested dose (2.5 μM) of LPA had a proportionately higher effect on inhibitory than on excitatory inputs (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>). Further, differential sensitivity to LPA was studied by applying various concentrations, ranging from 1 nM to 20 μM. After subtracting vehicle-induced changes (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.s019" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>), an effect on both currents was detectable at concentrations as low as 10 nM and increased with LPA concentration to a similar maximum reduction in both currents (approximately 70%) at 10–20 μM (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). Dose-response relationships were well fitted (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; r<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.99) by biphasic (two slopes) five-parameter logistic equations, suggesting that LPA affects synaptic neurotransmission by multiple mechanisms. It remains to be determined whether this is the consequence of the recruitment of diverse isoreceptors and/or downstream signaling pathways. In any case, from the nanomolar to first-order micromolar range, LPA diminished inhibitory inputs (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.0 ± 0.17 μM) in greater proportions (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) than excitatory ones (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.8 ± 0.08 μM), but at higher concentrations, LPA affected both synaptic systems similarly (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>).</p>

<title>LPA Operates Presynaptically at Excitatory Inputs</title>
<p>As in our previously published study [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], a combined electrophysiological analysis was performed to identify the LPA synaptic site of action. LPA signaling on AMPAR-mediated transmission is likely not attributable to changes in postsynaptic sensitivity to glutamate. LPA did not alter the amplitude in both the miniature quantal EPSCs<sub>AMPA</sub> (mEPSCs<sub>AMPA</sub>) and postsynaptic currents evoked by exogenous glutamate pulses (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.s019" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002153.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). For that reason, we sought evidence for a presynaptic mechanism by recording spontaneous AMPAergic synaptic currents under facilitated spontaneous glutamate release (sEPSCs<sub>AMPA</sub>). In this condition, synaptic activity was a mixture of action potential-dependent and -independent events. After LPA treatment, the sEPSCs<sub>AMPA</sub> amplitude, but not frequency (10.8 ± 1.0 Hz, <italic>p</italic> = 0.761), reversibly decreased to a value similar to that recorded for mEPSCs<sub>AMPA</sub> in control condition (before: 36.0 ± 3.8 pA; LPA: 24.0 ± 2.0 pA; <xref rid="pbio.1002153.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A–3C</xref>). This agrees with a LPA-induced full inhibition of action potential-dependent events.</p>

<p>In addition, we evaluated eEPSCs<sub>AMPA</sub> facilitation using paired-pulse and repetitive afferent stimulation protocols as in our previously published study [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Under repetitive stimulation, a change in the amount of facilitation is considered to be attributable to a presynaptic change in the release probability of neurotransmitter quanta [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In the control condition, paired-pulse stimulation displayed a strong facilitation of eEPSCs<sub>AMPA</sub> over the entire range of interstimulus intervals tested, but this was more pronounced at shorter interstimulus intervals (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002153.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). Facilitated PPR (paired-pulse ratio) showed a marked and reversible increase at 25 ms and 50 ms intervals after application of either s- or LPA (abbreviated as s-/LPA; <xref rid="pbio.1002153.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002153.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). On average, LPA and s-LPA increased the magnitude of PPR by 12.8% and 29.3% at 25 ms, respectively. The finding that LPA also reversibly potentiated the facilitation index of eEPSCs<sub>AMPA</sub> under repeated VLRF stimulation provided additional evidence in support of these outcomes (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.s019" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002153.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>At this point in our study, the attenuation of eEPSCs<sub>AMPA</sub> induced by LPA was related to a reduction in the glutamate release probability, which is believed to be determined by the number of fusion-competent SVs or the size of the RRP of SVs [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This idea was further strengthened by a subsequent analysis of eEPSCs<sub>AMPA</sub> amplitude using the minimal stimulation paradigm, designed to stimulate only one fiber and a single or small number of release sites. As in our previous study [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], the intensity of the stimulation was set to elicit eEPSCs<sub>AMPA</sub> with 30% to 40% failure (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). In this context, LPA treatment evoked a significant reduction of the mean amplitude of eEPSCs<sub>AMPA</sub> elicited by minimal stimulation and an enhancement of the eEPSCs<sub>AMPA</sub> failure rate (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002153.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). The presynaptic action of LPA on glutamatergic inputs is further supported because LPA<sub>1</sub>-ir puncta colocalize with Munc13-1, a presynaptic active zone (a.z.) marker [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], in VGLUT2-containing boutons (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F and 3G</xref>). The LPA<sub>1</sub> association with a region of the presynaptic membrane compromised in the fusion of SVs supports that LPA signaling has a direct relationship with the machinery involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release.</p>

<title>LPA Signaling Reduces the Size of RRP of SVs via MLCK in Excitatory Boutons</title>
<p>LPA induces smooth muscle contraction in a PLC-dependent, ROCK-independent manner that involves myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation by MLC kinase (MLCK) [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These findings point to MLCK as a potential kinase mediating the presynaptic action of LPA on excitatory neurotransmission.

<p>MLC phosphorylation stimulates actomyosin interactions [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration regulates MLCK activity and modulates the RRP size in the calyx of the Held synapse [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, LPA signaling, through its modulatory control on MLCK and the actomyosin cytoskeleton, might regulate clustering and spatial distribution of SVs within excitatory (S-type, spherical SVs-containing) boutons (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.s019" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>). Electron microscopy analysis, performed as in our previous study [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], showed that, in a MLCK-dependent way, LPA noticeably reduced the number of SVs near the a.z. in S-type boutons attached to HMNs, compared to control conditions (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5G–5L</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002153.s019" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>). In addition, LPA induced a drop (−20.2 ± 6.3%) in the SV population morphologically docked to (i.e., in contact with) the a.z., which corresponds to the release-ready neurotransmitter quanta [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] that was prevented by coaddition of ML-7 (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5M and 5N</xref>). These outcomes robustly support that LPA signaling regulates the size of the RRP of SVs in S-type boutons by a MLCK-dependent mechanism.</p>
<p>Together, these data strongly suggest that the depression of synaptic strength induced by LPA treatment is dependent on a reduction in the probability of release from excitatory glutamatergic terminals. This effect is attributable, at least in part, to a reduction in the size of the RRP of SVs. Our results reaffirm that LPA signaling modulates excitatory synaptic transmission through mechanisms modulating the presynaptic component of the synapse.</p>

<title>LPA-Induced Inhibitory STD Comprises Postsynaptic LPA<sub>1</sub>-RhoA/ROCK-CaN Signaling and GABA<sub>Aγ2</sub> Dephosphorylation</title>
<p>Next, we explored whether LPA modulates GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses by similar mechanisms of action. Amplitude, but not frequency, of miniature quantal IPSCs<sub>GABAA</sub> (mIPSCs<sub>GABAA</sub>) recorded in HMNs was reduced by LPA, in agreement with a postsynaptic site of action (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002153.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Fig</xref>). The molecular cascade downstream of LPA is also distinct, since LPA-induced alterations on mIPSCs<sub>GABAA</sub> were reversed by the ROCK inhibitor H1152 (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002153.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Fig</xref>).

<p>Postsynaptic action and the molecular signaling underlying LPA-induced modulation of GABA<sub>A</sub>ergic system were assessed in primary cultures of spinal motoneurons (SMNs) (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.s019" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002153.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Fig</xref>). The mean amplitude of inward GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated current evoked by exogenous GABA pulses (−4.13 ± 0.98 nA; <italic>n</italic> = 8 SMNs) was robustly reduced by s-LPA (−62.5 ± 10.1%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, one-way ANOVA for repeated measures (RM-ANOVA)), in a ROCK-dependent way (s-LPA+H1152: −3.23 ± 0.49 nA, <italic>p</italic> = 0.345) (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>).

Furthermore, pretreatment with siRNA<sub><italic>lpa1</italic></sub> prevented the effects of (s-)LPA on GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated currents compared to cRNA-treated SMNs, providing conclusive evidence of postsynaptic LPA<sub>1</sub> involvement (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E and 6F</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002153.s019" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002153.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S13 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Phosphorylation of serine 327 on the GABA<sub>Aγ2</sub> subunit (pGABA<sub>Aγ2</sub>) regulates GABA<sub>A</sub>R clustering and synaptic strength at inhibitory synapses [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Therefore, we investigated whether LPA<sub>1</sub>-ROCK signaling regulates phosphorylation of GABA<sub>A</sub>γ<sub>2</sub>. Contrary to expectations of a direct interaction between ROCK and GABA<sub>Aγ2</sub>, s-LPA induced a robust reduction (−83.3 ± 5.2%) of the pGABA<sub>Aγ2</sub>:GABA<sub>Aγ2</sub> ratio in SMNs that was prevented by coaddition of H1152 (+1.6 ± 6.0%) (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6G</xref>). This was also observed in the HN (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.s019" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002153.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S14 Fig</xref>). Strikingly, direct binding of the phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) to GABA<sub>Aγ2</sub> subunits dephosphorylates Ser<sup>327</sup> [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], which leads to a reduction in inhibitory postsynaptic current amplitude [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Therefore, recruitment of CaN (also named Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase 2B), was proposed as a potential link between LPA<sub>1</sub>-ROCK signaling and GABA<sub>Aγ2</sub> dephosphorylation.</p>
<p>Preincubation of SMNs with CaN autoinhibitory peptide (Cap; 50 μM) also prevented (+4.8 ± 16.5%) s-LPA from inducing a reduction in pGABA<sub>Aγ2</sub>:GABA<sub>Aγ2</sub> ratio (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6G</xref>). Expression of GABA<sub>Aγ2</sub> remained unchanged regardless of treatment (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6G</xref>). s-LPA also had no effect on the GABA-evoked currents in SMNs pretreated with Cap for 30 min (Cap: 2.2 ± 0.3 nA; Cap+s-LPA: 2.1 ± 0.3 nA; <italic>n</italic> = 5 SMNs) (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6H</xref>). s-LPA-induced alterations in mIPSCs<sub>GABAA</sub> and eIPSCs<sub>GABAA</sub> in HMNs were also CaN-dependent (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.s019" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002153.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S15 Fig</xref>). Additionally, CaN activity strongly increased in SMNs after incubation with s-LPA, but not with s-LPA plus H1152 or H1152 alone (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6I</xref>). Altogether, these data show that (s-)LPA, specifically acting through postsynaptic LPA<sub>1</sub>-RhoA/ROCK-CaN signaling pathway, regulate GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated neurotransmission, by a mechanism involving dephosphorylation of GABA<sub>Aγ2</sub> subunit at Ser<sup>327</sup>.</p>

<title>LPA Induces Internalization of GABA<sub>Aγ2</sub> Subunit</title>
<p>It is generally accepted that dephosphorylation appears to be important for receptor endocytosis [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. As a next step, we investigated whether LPA-triggered dephosphorylation was accompanied by further subunit internalization. We found that s-LPA (15 min) led to a strong reduction (−99.9 ± 0.01%) in the amount of GABA<sub>Aγ2</sub> allocated in M fraction in SMN cultures. A proportional increase (+109.4 ± 14.1%) in the quantity of GABA<sub>Aγ2</sub> was observed in the C fraction relative to total GABA<sub>Aγ2</sub> (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>). These outcomes suggest a translocation of at least this subunit from the SMN membrane to the cytosol triggered by s-LPA. The s-LPA-induced translocation was prevented by coincubation with either the ROCK inhibitor H1152 or the CaN inhibitor Cap (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>). GABA<sub>Aγ2</sub> compartmentalization in SMNs was maintained after treatment with H1152 or Cap per se (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>).</p>

<p>To explore whether internalization is actually required for LPA-induced GABA<sub>A</sub>ergic STD, and given that GABA<sub>A</sub>R endocytosis is dynamin-dependent [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], we added the dynamin inhibitor dynasore to the bath to block GABA<sub>A</sub>R endocytosis. Dynasore (80 μM for 30 min) fully prevented both a reduction in the GABA<sub>Aγ2</sub> M:T ratio and an increase in the C:T ratio induced by s-LPA, which was not altered by vehicle (−84.5 ± 5.8%). Dynasore per se did not modify GABA<sub>Aγ2</sub> location (−6.4 ± 18.8%) relative to the vehicle condition (100.0 ± 36.7%) (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). Interestingly, electrophysiological recordings showed that preincubation with dynasore had no effect on s-LPA-induced changes in GABA-evoked currents (−48.1 ± 8.7%; <italic>n</italic> = 4 SMNs) (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>). These outcomes support that GABA<sub>Aγ2</sub> internalization by endocytosis is not required for the attenuation in GABA<sub>A</sub>ergic neurotransmission induced by LPA signaling.</p>
<p>CaN-dependent dephosphorylation of Ser<sup>327</sup> at the GABA<sub>Aγ2</sub> subunit is involved in the increase of lateral diffusion and cluster dispersal of surface GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in the dendrites of cultured hippocampal neurons [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Therefore, we investigated whether s-LPA-induced STD under endocytosis inhibition conditions would involve GABA<sub>A</sub>R cluster disarrangement. Double immunolabelling for GABA<sub>Aγ2</sub> and the postsynaptic scaffolding protein, gephyrin, confirmed GABA<sub>Aγ2</sub>-ir clusters at the surface of SMNs, most of them colocalized with gephyrin-ir clusters (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref>). In consonance with phospholipid-evoked GABA<sub>A</sub>R internalization, treatment with s-LPA (10 min) reduced mean fluorescence intensity, but not area, per cluster for these two postsynaptic proteins (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7E–7G</xref>). However, the size of surface GABA<sub>Aγ2</sub>-ir clusters increased in parallel with a reduction in fluorescence when s-LPA was added after pretreatment with dynasore (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7E–7G</xref>). This agrees with s-LPA-induced lateral diffusion and cluster dispersal of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. In addition, the mean area of GABA<sub>Aγ2</sub>-associated clusters of gephyrin was unaltered, but fluorescence was reduced by s-LPA under endocytosis inhibition (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7E–7G</xref>). These results are compatible with s-LPA-induced disorganization of GABA<sub>A</sub>R clusters that concludes in receptor internalization. Effects under the presence of dynasore support that this GABA<sub>A</sub>R disarrangement might involve previous lateral diffusion and cluster dispersal of surface GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs like that reported previously for cultured hippocampal neurons [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p>
<p>In summary, our data highlight a pathway by which, via recruitment of RhoA/ROCK signaling, postsynaptic LPA<sub>1</sub> evokes CaN-dependent dephosphorylation at Ser<sup>327</sup> of the GABA<sub>Aγ2</sub> subunit, which is followed by GABA<sub>A</sub>R cluster dispersion and its concomitant translocation from the plasma membrane to the cytosol (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7H</xref>). The latter does not seem to be required for the reduction in GABA<sub>A</sub>ergic synaptic strength triggered by LPA. Phospholipid-induced synaptic strength depression seems to be mainly supported by GABA<sub>Aγ2</sub> dephosphorylation and subsequent GABA<sub>A</sub>R cluster dispersal.</p>

<title>LPA<sub>1</sub> Is Essential for Activity-Dependent Synaptic Plasticity</title>
<p>Next, the role of LPA signaling in short-term, activity-dependent synaptic plasticity was explored. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation causes a rapid, local, surface dispersal of synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs leading to an inhibitory synaptic depression [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We directly examined the role of LPA<sub>1</sub>-mediated signaling in NMDAR-induced STD of GABA<sub>A</sub>ergic signaling in SMNs. In cRNA-treated SMNs, perfusion of glutamate and glycine (Glut/Gly) for 4 min caused a rapid and reversible depression in GABA-induced current (−59.6 ± 5.3%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) in the presence of TTX, d-tubocurarine, strychnine and NBQX. This activity-dependent plastic event was absent in SMNs precultured with siRNA<sub><italic>lpa1</italic></sub> (−15.2 ± 8.7%; <xref rid="pbio.1002153.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A</xref>), in untreated cells under zero extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (−9.3 ± 11.5%; <italic>n</italic> = 6 SMNs), or in the presence of APV (−5.4 ± 13.9%; <italic>n</italic> = 6 SMNs), demonstrating Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and NMDAR-dependence. LPA<sub>1</sub> knockdown reduced by approximately 40% the magnitude of activity-dependent STD at inhibitory synapses. From an extrapolation of these values to the dose-response curve in <xref rid="pbio.1002153.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>, it could be indirectly estimated that local concentrations of phospholipids achieved in response to those levels of motoneuron activity were first order micromolar, assuming all synthesized and released phospholipids were the monounsaturated form of LPA (18:1).</p>

<p>Findings from activity-dependent synaptic plasticity experiments agree with the notion that motoneurons are potential sources for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, spike-independent synthesis and release of lysophospholipids, which in turn might stimulate autocrine signaling pathways (to modulate inhibitory synapses), at least by way of the LPA<sub>1</sub> receptor. These outcomes also strongly point to lysophospholipids as paracrine retrograde messengers that act on presynaptic LPA<sub>1</sub> to regulate excitatory synapses; however, further research is needed to confirm this possibility.</p>

<p>We began by analyzing the level and pattern of expression of the LPA<sub>1</sub> receptor within the HN of the adult rat. qRT-PCR analysis showed that disparity between <italic>lpa</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> and <italic>lpa</italic><sub><italic>2–6</italic></sub> transcripts in the HN was even more accentuated in adults than at the neonatal stage (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9A</xref>).

These results suggest a gain in relevance of LPA<sub>1</sub>-mediated signaling in the HN during postnatal development, supporting previous observations in the murine brain [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].

A high proportion of VGLUT2-ir inputs (47.9 ± 3.4%; <italic>n</italic> = 55 HMNs) apposed to the perikarya of SMI32-identified HMNs were colocalizing with LPA<sub>1</sub>-ir puncta (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9E and 9F</xref>).

LPA<sub>1</sub>-ir appeared to border and colocalize with SMI32-ir structures (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9G</xref>), supporting cytoplasmic and membrane location of LPA<sub>1</sub> in adult HMNs. Therefore, the molecular machinery to support a role of LPA<sub>1</sub> in modulating excitatory neurotransmission is also present in adults.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study showed that bioactive membrane-derived phospholipids evoke rapid and reversible synaptic depression and mediate activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, mainly via LPA<sub>1</sub>. Phospholipids likely operate as local messengers in activity-dependent GABAergic STD in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, spike-independent manner. Strikingly, at physiological concentrations of nanomolar to first order micromolar, LPA has a greater effect on inhibitory than excitatory inputs. Finally, LPA signaling regulates brain-elemental processing tasks such as performance of motor output commands. These data open a new scenario in which the membrane-phospholipid metabolism actively participates in controlling synaptic strength, and then affects neuronal excitability in physiological and pathological states.</p>
<p>Important determinants of synaptic strength, short-term plasticity and intersynaptic crosstalk mainly involve fine-tuning of the number of neurotransmitter receptors and the RRP size of SVs [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. LPA depresses the main excitatory and inhibitory synaptic systems, affecting both by different degrees, loci, and mechanisms of action. At glutamatergic synapses, and by way of presynaptic G<sub>αi/o</sub>-protein-coupled LPA<sub>1</sub> and PLC-MLCK activation, LPA results in MLC phosphorylation, which might stimulate the actomyosin contractile apparatus [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] to reduce the bulk of the RRP of SVs (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>). Depletion of some RRP of SVs usually underlies short-term forms of synaptic depression [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Ultrastructural correlates for LPA-induced STD further supported that functional synaptic changes are partly explained by a reduction in the size of the RRP of SVs. Changes in the actin cytoskeleton are a prerequisite for exocytosis, enabling docking and fusion of SVs with the plasmalemma [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. As in our results, LPA-dependent contraction of smooth muscle cells involves activation of PLC and MLCK, followed by MLC phosphorylation [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] that promotes actomyosin interactions [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In this context, a physical relationship between p-MLC and glutamatergic synapses on adult and neonatal motoneurons has been recently reported [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. At the calyx of Held synapse, MLCK controls the size of the fast-releasing pool of SVs [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In addition, ROCK regulates p-MLC levels via MLCK inhibition to maintain basal RRP ordering of SVs at excitatory inputs [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Therefore, presynaptic LPA-dependent and ROCK signaling seem to converge onto a common molecular mechanism, namely MLC phosphorylation and size of the RRP at excitatory synapses. It is interesting, then, that the ROCK inhibitor did not actually enhance LPA-induced depression of AMPAR currents. These outcomes suggest that the antagonistic functional actions of ROCK and LPA<sub>1</sub>-signaling, converging on MLCK, results in a push–pull mechanism that regulates the size of the RRP of SVs at excitatory synapses.</p>

<title>Proposed mechanism by which a membrane-derived bioactive phospholipid such as LPA regulates synaptic strength.</title>
<p>LPA affects main excitatory and inhibitory synapses by different degrees, loci, and mechanisms of action. At glutamatergic synapses (left diagram), binding of phospholipids to presynaptic G<sub><bold>αi/o</bold></sub>-protein-coupled LPA<sub><bold>1</bold></sub> indirectly activates MLCK via PLC, promoting MLC phosphorylation and subsequent actomyosin cytoskeleton contraction. This would alter the spatial distribution of SVs within the presynaptic terminal and the RRP size of SVs, which results in rapid and reversible excitatory STD. At the GABAergic synapse (right diagram), LPA—synthesized and/or released in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through NMDAR—interacts with postsynaptic G<sub><bold>α12/13</bold></sub>-coupled LPA<sub><bold>1</bold></sub>, then activates RhoA/ROCK. Subsequently, phosphatase calcineurin acts to dephosphorylate Ser<sup>327</sup> of the GABA<sub><bold>Aγ2</bold></sub> subunit, which in turn undergoes lateral diffusion and internalization by endocytosis. Dephosphorylation of the GABA<sub><bold>Aγ2</bold></sub> component of GABA<sub><bold>A</bold></sub>Rs results in rapid and reversible inhibitory STD.</p>

<p>At GABAergic synapses, LPA dephosphorylates Ser<sup>327</sup> of GABA<sub>Aγ2</sub> subunits and favors GABA<sub>Aγ2</sub> internalization via postsynaptic G<sub>α12/13</sub>-coupled LPA<sub>1</sub>/RhoA/ROCK signaling and subsequent CaN activation (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>). The cell surface stability of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs is regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. GABA<sub>A</sub>R phosphorylation is involved in the modulation of receptor biophysical properties and membrane trafficking [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Phosphorylation stabilizes the GABA<sub>A</sub>R on the surface and, conversely, dephosphorylation is important for receptor endocytosis [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. NMDAR activation causes GABA<sub>A</sub>R cluster dispersal and lateral diffusion by CaN activation and dephosphorylation of Ser<sup>327</sup>GABA<sub>A</sub>γ<sub>2</sub> [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], leading to long-term depression at CA1 inhibitory synapses [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Dispersal could involve receptor clustering at clathrin-coated sites at the plasmalemma, which invaginate and pinch off to form clathrin-coated vesicles. Internalized receptors are then either subject to rapid recycling or are targeted for lysosomal degradation [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Our results indicated that the LPA<sub>1</sub>-RhoA/ROCK-CaN pathway dephosphorylates the GABA<sub>A</sub>γ<sub>2</sub> subunit, which undergoes lateral diffusion, dispersal of clusters, and subsequent endocytosis (<xref rid="pbio.1002153.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>). However, endocytosis does not seem to be crucial for LPA-induced functional depression at GABA<sub>A</sub>ergic neurotransmission, which seemed to be mainly supported by GABA<sub>A</sub>γ<sub>2</sub> dephosphorylation and subsequent clusters dispersal of surface GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. The kinetic recovery suggests rapid replenishment of the synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R content, given that re-establishment of inhibitory synaptic strength occurred with 7 to 10 min washing after LPA-induced depression. The coordinated action of kinases and phosphatases, downstream of LPA<sub>1</sub>-triggered signaling, then plays a pivotal role in controlling neuronal excitability by modulation of GABA<sub>A</sub>γ<sub>2</sub> phosphorylation and receptor recycling.</p>
<p>The present results seem controversial in relation to our previous findings demonstrating a presynaptic role for endogenous baseline ROCK activity in the regulation of AMPAergic and GABA<sub>A</sub>ergic neurotransmission [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; here, we describe that ROCK also acts postsynaptically to mediate LPA-induced depression of the GABA<sub>A</sub>ergic transmission. Whether presynaptic baseline ROCK activity in inhibitory inputs depends on membrane-derived bioactive lipid mediators, such as LPA and/or sphingosine 1-phosphate, remains to be elucidated. Nevertheless, at glutamatergic synapses, ROCK activity is likely independent of LPA<sub>1/3</sub> signaling, because inhibitors of these receptors did not mimic AMPAergic STD induced by ROCK inhibition. However, we cannot discard the involvement of another LPAR in maintaining baseline ROCK activity in the synaptic terminals. Interestingly, although presynaptic ROCK is active in our experimental conditions [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], postsynaptic endogenous activity of ROCK, if any, is even below the level required to reveal its impact on synaptic strength and membrane properties [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] of motoneurons. This could be explained by the differential expression of ROCK isoforms at the two compartments, ROCKα in the postsynaptic site and ROCKβ in the presynaptic one, and/or the lower concentration of ROCKα in motoneurons relative to synaptic structures [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Anyway, data suggest that when motoneuron activity is low, presynaptic ROCK activity maintains inhibitory synaptic strength by stabilizing the size of the RRP of SVs. However, after exogenous addition of LPA or when motoneuron activity rises, and subsequent coupled LPA synthesis and/or release occurs, postsynaptic LPA<sub>1</sub> stimulates ROCK. This leads to deinhibition by GABA<sub>Aγ2</sub> dephosphorylation and receptor endocytosis.</p>
<p>In the rat, the highest LPA concentration in tissue is found in the brain [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Cultured cortical neurons produce LPA at nanomolar concentrations [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], but LPA levels increase up to 10 μM after injury, trauma, or hemorrhage involving blood–brain barrier damage [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Here, physiological concentrations (nanomolar to first order micromolar) of LPA affected GABAergic to a greater degree than glutamatergic inputs, achieving maximal and similar affectation at 10 μM. Thus, it is possible that LPA signaling maintains neuronal excitability around a dynamic range, promoting deinhibition at low levels of neuronal activity and depressing excitatory inputs when activity increases, perhaps as part of a homeostatic mechanism that prevents excitotoxicity. Any candidate for coupling synaptic strength to neuronal activity must be regulated by activity at the postsynaptic site. Interestingly, noxious stimulation of primary afferent neurons induces LPA production in the dorsal horn in a glutamate-dependent manner [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Here, LPA signaling, mainly via LPA<sub>1</sub>, was essential in STD of inhibitory inputs triggered by precedent activity of the neuron. Autocrine LPA signaling was essential for NMDAR-driven GABA-current depression, which depends on extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry passing through NMDARs. Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity occurred independently of the generation of action potentials at the postsynaptic neuron. Postsynaptic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] increase and LPA signaling dependence for activity-dependent STD in cultured motoneurons strongly support that this cell type is a potential source for activity-dependent LPA synthesis and/or release.</p>
<p>Despite the apparent lack of endogenous LPA signaling affecting synaptic strength in our in vitro model, local iontophoretic application of three LPA<sub>1/3</sub> inhibitors increased, in a dose-dependent manner, the baseline inspiratory-related activity of HMNs in the adult rat. This rhythmic inspiratory-related bursting discharge of HMNs is driven mainly by glutamatergic brain stem afferences, with little or no contribution of inhibitory inputs [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. There is an apparent gain in relevance of LPA<sub>1</sub>-mediated signaling in the HN during postnatal development, to the detriment of LPA<sub>2–6</sub>-triggered pathways, as well as excitatory inputs apposed to adult HMNs express LPA<sub>1</sub>. Taken together, these findings support that phospholipids, most likely activating LPA<sub>1</sub> at glutamatergic synapses, controlled physiological inspiratory-related activity of HMNs, presumably by restraining their AMPAergic input drive [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, endogenous LPA signaling physiologically contributes in the performance of normal patterns of motor output commands in adult animals.</p>
<p>Alterations in phospholipid homeostasis affect various pathological conditions, thus attracting increased diagnostic and pharmacological interest [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The exquisite balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs is critical for the proper functioning of the brain, and its imbalance leads to the cognitive impairment associated with neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic syndromes related to obesity, dyslipidemia, lipodystrophy, insulin resistance, and alcoholism [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In particular, LPA production and/or autotaxin are increased in obesity-associated metabolic diseases [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], induced hypercholesterolemia [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], congenital lipodystrophy [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], as well as in ethanol-fed mice [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and in patients with Alzheimer disease [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] or multiple sclerosis [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In addition, phospholipids uptake in mammalian cells depends on their activation status, a critical support for cellular incorporation of nutrition-derived fatty acids. Imported phospholipids are utilized for production of bioactive lipids, such as LPA [<xref rid="pbio.1002153.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], and thereby modify synaptic transmission. Therefore, we can point to LPA as a promising candidate in coupling brain function, by modulating synaptic strength and plasticity, to the metabolic condition of the organism across physiological and pathological states.</p>

<title>Statistics and Data Analysis</title>
<p>Data are expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). The number of analyzed specimens per experimental condition is indicated in figure legends or in the result section. Data were obtained from at least three animals per experimental condition. In ROCK activity, western blotting and qRT-PCR experiments, each individual assay was performed by using tissue samples collected from at least six animals per experimental condition. Quantitative data from ROCK and CaN activity assays, western blot, and qRT-PCR represent the average of, at least, three independent experiments. Applied statistical tests per experimental condition are indicated in figure legends or in results. Post hoc Holm Sidak or Dunn tests were applied for ANOVA for repeated measures or on Ranks, respectively. In all cases, the minimum significance level was set at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05.</p>
