          <title/>
          <p>Most proteins involved in circadian transcriptional feedback loops undergo reversible chemical modifications (called phosphorylation) that regulate their activity in a time-of-day–dependent manner. Doubletime (DBT), a <italic>Drosophila</italic> kinase, phosphorylates the circadian transcriptional repressor PERIOD (PER). Mutations of <italic>dbt</italic> shorten or lengthen the period of circadian behavioral rhythms, or abolish the rhythms altogether in flies. A mutation of the human ortholog of <italic>dbt</italic>, <italic>casein kinase I</italic> (<italic>CKI</italic>)δ, has been associated with certain forms of a heritable sleep disorder. The disorder may reflect altered activity of a human PER protein, as the syndrome can also be caused by mutation of a CKIε/δ phosphorylation site within PER2. In this study, we locate DBT-directed phosphorylation sites in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> PER protein, including a DBT target region of PER that was previously shown to regulate DBT activity. Two PER domains within this region appear to serve as alternative targets for DBT. Phosphorylation of the upstream domain seems to suppress phosphorylation elsewhere in the region, producing a stable PER protein with little activity as a transcriptional repressor. However, when phosphorylation of the upstream domain is blocked, downstream DBT targets appear to be phosphorylated, producing a highly active, but short-lived repressor. Our results suggest that ordered patterns of DBT-directed phosphorylation contribute to the timing of PER's function and disappearance, and thus influence the pace of the circadian clock.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Circadian rhythms (∼24-h rhythms) in physiology and behavior are observed in almost all phyla. In fungi, plants, and animals, cell autonomous, autoregulatory gene and protein interactions promote circadian molecular oscillations. Most of the genes and proteins that make up such clocks are not conserved between phyla, suggesting that circadian clocks may have evolved independently in bacteria, fungi, plants. and animals. Notable exceptions are the protein kinases CK1 and CK2. The former is known to play a central role in both animal and fungal clocks, while CK2 has been shown to be essential for animal and plant circadian rhythmicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b001">1</xref>]. Although in certain cases cycling clock gene transcription can be eliminated without suppressing circadian rhythmicity, protein phosphorylation appears to be essential for persistent clock function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b002">2</xref>].</p>
      <p>The circadian clock of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content> is composed in part of two interconnected feedback loops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b003">3</xref>]. In the <italic>period/timeless</italic> (<italic>per/tim</italic>) loop, CLOCK (CLK) and CYCLE (CYC), two transcription factors of the bHLH/PAS superfamily, heterodimerize and activate <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> transcription during the afternoon and early evening. In turn, after nuclear translocation and binding to CLK/CYC heterodimers, PER, and possibly TIM, repress their own transcription during late night and early morning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b004">4</xref>]. In the <italic>Clock</italic> (<italic>Clk</italic>) loop, circadian transcription of <italic>vrille</italic> (<italic>vri</italic>) and of <italic>Par domain protein 1</italic>ε (<italic>Pdp1</italic>ε) is driven by CLK/CYC heterodimers, and subsequently, VRI negatively regulates the transcription of <italic>Clk</italic>. Still later, Pdp1 renews expression of <italic>Clk</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b005">5</xref>]. <italic>Pdp1</italic> may also have a role in mediating circadian clock output [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b006">6</xref>].</p>
      <p>Most proteins involved in these transcriptional feedback loops are phosphorylated in a time-of-day–dependent manner, and three kinases, casein kinase I (CKI)ε/δ/Doubletime (DBT), CK2, and GSK-3/Shaggy (SGG), have been identified as essential clock components in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Importantly, a mutation of the human ortholog of DBT, CKIδ, has been associated with certain forms of a heritable disorder of sleep, familial advanced sleep phase syndrome (FASPS; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b007">7</xref>]). The disorder may reflect altered phosphorylation of PER2, as FASPS has also been associated with mutation of a putative CKIε/δ phosphorylation site within PER2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b008">8</xref>]. Preliminary studies of the prevalence of FASPS indicate that the disorder may affect as much as 0.3% of the United States population (C. R. Jones and L. J. Ptacek, unpublished data).</p>
      <p>DBT is constitutively expressed at the mRNA and protein level, and is an essential gene for fly development, regulating cell survival and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b011">11</xref>]. Loss of DBT activity is associated with hypophosphorylation and stabilization of PER, indicating its role in determining the rate of PER degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b012">12</xref>]. DBT has been shown to physically interact with PER in vitro and in vivo, and to create a stable complex with PER throughout the circadian cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b010">10</xref>]. PER that has been phosphorylated by DBT is recognized by the Slimb protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b013">13</xref>]. Slimb is a component of the Skp1/Cullin/F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex, which marks proteins for proteosomal degradation in a phosphorylation-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b014">14</xref>]. Enhanced PER degradation in the cytoplasm is predicted to delay nuclear translocation of both PER and TIM, and to thus affect the period of circadian rhythms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b012">12</xref>].</p>
      <p>The mutation <italic>dbt</italic><sup>S</sup>, associated with an amino acid substitution (proline to serine at residue 47 [P47S]), shortens period length by about 6 h. <italic>dbt</italic><sup>L</sup>, with an amino acid substitution of isoleucine for methionine at residue 80 (M80I), lengthens period to 29 h. A third mutation, <italic>dbt</italic><sup>AR</sup>, is associated with a change from histidine 126 to tyrosine (H126Y) and causes arrhythmia. PER protein in this mutant is hypophosphorylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b015">15</xref>]. Each of these mutations maps to the kinase domain of DBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b016">16</xref>]. The short- and long-period alleles of DBT enhance or attenuate, respectively, PER degradation in the nucleus, further demonstrating the importance of timely PER degradation as a critical determinant in establishing 24-h rhythmicity. In addition to influencing protein degradation, DBT appears to affect the timing of nuclear accumulation of PER: The short-period mutant <italic>dbt</italic><sup>S</sup> shows delayed PER nuclear accumulation that is apparently independent of PER protein stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b017">17</xref>], and arrhythmic alleles of <italic>dbt</italic> cause constitutive nuclear accumulation of PER in clock-containing cells of larval and adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b019">19</xref>]. Lastly, in cultured cells reduction of DBT activity by RNA interference (RNAi) has been reported to reduce the potency of PER as a transcriptional repressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b020">20</xref>]. Thus, DBT appears to regulate different aspects of PER function in multiple steps throughout the circadian cycle.</p>
      <p>The mutation <italic>per</italic><sup>S</sup>, which shortens period length to 19 h, was among the first circadian rhythm mutations isolated in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b021">21</xref>]. The mutation replaces serine with asparagine at amino acid (aa) position 589 (S589N) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b023">23</xref>]. Similar, short-period behavioral phenotypes are produced by a wide variety of missense mutations affecting a region of approximately 20 aa encompassing the site of the <italic>per</italic><sup>S</sup> mutation. The prevalence of such mutations suggests that short-period phenotypes may result from loss or depression of function in this region of the PER protein, which we will refer to as the “per-short domain” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b025">25</xref>]. Importantly, the per-short domain has been implicated in the <italic>trans</italic>-regulation of DBT: mutations of this PER domain restore function to a kinase-deficient mutant, <italic>dbt</italic><sup>AR</sup>, suggesting that the wild-type form of the per-short domain may influence a temporal sequence of DBT-dependent phosphorylation(s) of PER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b015">15</xref>].</p>
      <p>In this paper, we describe genetic and biochemical approaches that have allowed the mapping of DBT-directed PER phosphorylation sites. These maps derive from interactions of <italic>Drosophila</italic> DBT and PER in vitro, and their functional significance has been explored in a cultured cell model and in living flies. Our studies have shown that the per-short domain and a neighboring segment of PER are preferentially phosphorylated by DBT. These adjoining domains appear to serve as alternative targets for DBT-directed phosphorylation. Interactions between these PER domains and DBT appear to provide a switch, giving either an unstable, highly active PER repressor, or a stable PER protein with little activity.</p>

        <title>Generation of Enzymatically Active DBT</title>
        <p>Baculoviral expression in Sf9 cells was chosen for DBT production in an effort to recover kinase activity. Initially, efforts made to synthesize this <italic>Drosophila</italic> protein in bacterial cells (<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Escherichia coli</named-content>) failed to produce enzymatically active DBT protein. Importantly, production of active mammalian CKIε using the same conditions in bacterial cells was successful, suggesting a specific problem emanating from the expressed DBT protein. Two baculoviruses were constructed. One expressed wild-type DBT, whereas a second generated a mutant form of DBT in which the putative ATP binding lysine (aa 38) was mutated to alanine (K38A). Several amino acid changes at this site have been previously shown to produce inactive CKI kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b026">26</xref>]. Recombinant proteins were expressed as N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion proteins to facilitate their purification. GST-DBT proteins were isolated 48 h after infection and initially tested for kinase activity using casein as an in vitro substrate. Whereas the fusion protein containing the wild-type DBT sequence produced strong phosphorylation of casein, the K38A mutant showed little or no activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). This result demonstrates that DBT expression in Sf9 cells produces enzymatically active kinase and that the purified kinase activity is dependent on the DBT primary sequence. Recently, Muskus et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b019">19</xref>] showed that a related (K38R) DBT mutant inhibits wild-type DBT function in a cultured cell phosphorylation assay and in behavioral tests of transgenic <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p>

            <title>Activity of Recombinant DBT Purified from Sf9 Cells</title>
            <p>(A) Recombinant DBT purified from Sf9 cells has protein kinase activity. GST-DBT and GST-DBT (K38A) proteins purified from Sf9 cells were incubated with casein and radioactive P-32 labeled γ-ATP in kinase buffer. Casein is strongly phosphorylated by GST-DBT. Mutant GST-DBT (K38A) substantially reduces casein phosphorylation. The lower panel indicates the amount of GST-DBT and GST-DBT (K38A) used in the kinase assay as detected by western blot with anti-DBT antibody. Molecular weight markers are shown on the left.</p>
            <p>(B) DBT mutations affecting behavioral rhythms also affect kinase activity. Either wild-type DBT (DBT), DBT arrhythmic (DBT<sup>AR</sup>), long- (DBT<sup>L</sup>) or short- (DBT<sup>S</sup>) period rhythm mutants were expressed and purified as GST fusion proteins from Sf9 cells, and used to phosphorylate casein. Top: GST-DBT levels measured by anti-GST western blot. Bottom: equal amounts of casein were phosphorylated with wild-type GST-DBT (lane 4) or with mutant GST-DBT proteins: GST-DBT<sup>AR</sup> (lane 1), GST-DBT<sup>L</sup> (lane 2), and GST-DBT<sup>S</sup> (lane 3).</p>

        <title>Enzymatic Activities of DBT Mutants Affecting Circadian Clock Function</title>
        <p>Since DBT functions as a protein kinase, it is important to determine whether period-altering mutations that affect its structure also modify its biochemical activity. Single amino acid changes were introduced into the baculovirus construct, and mutant and wild-type kinases were purified in parallel. Thereafter, brief, timed kinase assays were performed using casein as a substrate (Materials and Methods). Each of the mutations decreased the kinase activity of DBT, but to varying degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). The most dramatic reduction was observed in the presence of the <italic>dbt</italic><sup>AR</sup> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, lane 1). When normalized to the kinase protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), approximately 10% of the wild-type level of activity is preserved in DBT<sup>AR</sup>. The <italic>dbt</italic><sup>L</sup> mutation reduced kinase activity to approximately 30% that of wild type. The <italic>dbt</italic><sup>S</sup> mutation, which speeds up the clock in vivo, also reduced DBT activity by approximately 15% compared to wild type. The reduction of kinase activity by both period-shortening and lengthening mutations of <italic>dbt</italic> suggests complex regulation of the clock by DBT. Indeed, there is a precedent for such regulation in the case of a mammalian ortholog of DBT; the hamster CKI mutant <italic>tau</italic> speeds up the clock by promoting PER phosphorylations only at specific target sites and decreasing PER stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b027">27</xref>].</p>

        </fig>
        <p>PER 1–640, whose phosphorylation was initially observed in this way, was further subdivided to resolve two DBT target regions. A fusion protein containing the N-terminal 365 amino acids of PER was phosphorylated by DBT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g003">Figure 3</xref>, lane 7), whereas a subfragment of this region, containing aa 170–365, was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g003">Figure 3</xref>, lane 9). In addition, PER 149–365 GST fusion protein showed a high level of phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g003">Figure 3</xref>, lane 8), indicating that the phosphorylated region closest to the N-terminus of PER is located between residues 149 and 170.</p>
        <p>Sequences between aa 170 and 580 were not significantly phosphorylated by DBT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g003">Figure 3</xref>, lanes 4, 6, and 9). Also, PER 650–700 was not phosphorylated by DBT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g003">Figure 3</xref>, lane 2); however, strong phosphorylation of PER 570–645 was observed. Thus, a second phosphorylation region should reside between aa 580–645.</p>
        <p>DBT also phosphorylated a fusion protein corresponding to the C-terminal half of PER (encoding residues 650–1,224) (Figure3, lane 17). Despite the presence of a multitude of C-terminal degradation products of this protein, only the highest mobility forms were significantly phosphorylated, suggesting that this DBT target occurs close to the C-terminus of PER. Shorter PER fragments collectively encoding residues 947–1,136 were not phosphorylated by DBT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g003">Figure 3</xref>, lanes 12, 13, and 14). The strong phosphorylation of GST-PER 1,101–1,224 places the C-terminal DBT target within PER 1,136–1,224.</p>
        <p>To summarize, in vitro DBT appears to preferentially phosphorylate sequences in three discrete regions of PER: aa 149–170, aa 580–645, and aa 1,136–1,224. All of these regions are serine- and threonine-rich (17%–26%). However, as further discussed below, a sequence motif previously implicated as a preferential target for phosphorylation in mammalian studies of CKI (S/TXXS/T) is encountered in only one of the target regions of PER. Although we have not determined whether the PER phosphorylation sites detected in vitro correspond to sites phosphorylated in vivo, the limited duration of the in vitro kinase assay is likely to favor phosphorylation of higher affinity sites, rather than secondary, nonspecific sites. Our analysis does not exclude the possibility that DBT phosphorylates PER at other sites in vivo.</p>

        <title>Identification of Individual DBT Phosphorylation Sites in PER</title>
        <p>In order to define individual phosphorylation sites, three fusion proteins were chosen for phosphopeptide analyses. Fusion proteins (GST-PER149–365, GST-PER580–645, and GST-PER1101–1224) from each DBT target region were phosphorylated by recombinant DBT in the presence of radiolabeled ATP, and the resulting phosphorylated PER proteins isolated and subsequently digested with trypsin for further analysis (Materials and Methods). <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060183-t001">Table 1</xref> shows the identified phosphopeptide sequences with phosphorylated residues indicated. The bulk of the radioactivity in the N-terminal PER target was located in one long peptide that contained the last 16 amino acids of GST followed by the first 27 amino acids of the fused PER sequence. The long N-terminal sequence composing the GST portion of the fusion protein precluded a further analysis by Edman sequencing. The recovery of this tryptic phosphopeptide (PER aa 149–176) was consistent with our earlier mapping of a preferential phosphorylation site(s) between aa 149 and aa 170. The amino acid sequence of the latter PER interval contains five serine residues at positions 149, 151, 153, 164, and 169. These residues are therefore potential substrates for DBT in the N-terminus of PER.</p>

        <p>Phosphorylation of GST-PER580–645 was predominantly associated with the three tryptic peptides shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060183-t001">Table 1</xref>. The masses of each of these declined in response to alkaline phosphatase and propanethiol treatment (Materials and Methods). Amino terminal sequencing of these peptides, coupled with mass spectrometry, showed that the modified residues correspond to serines 589, 607, 613, and 629, and threonine 610. However, mass spectroscopy also indicated that none of the three peptides was detectably phosphorylated at multiple sites. Thus, each tryptic fraction proved to be a mixture of alternatively phosphorylated versions of the same peptide. Serine 604 was not amenable to Edman sequencing due to its position at the end of a longer tryptic peptide. This residue is part of a CKI consensus sequence (SKSS) that also includes serine 607, which was shown to be phosphorylated as indicated above.</p>
        <p>Two phosphopeptides were derived from the C-terminal fusion protein GST-PER1101–1224.

        </fig>
        <p>Mutations of the N-terminal and C-terminal PER phosphorylation sites had no detectable effect on PER's activity as a repressor of CLK (compare mutants N5A and 1,134/1,219 to wild-type PER in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). In contrast, all mutations in the per-short downstream (perSD, Figure4) domain reduced PER function in this assay, and a mutation of serine 589, in the per-short domain, enhanced PER's activity as a CLK repressor (Figure5A). With respect to mutations of the perSD domain, the inhibitory effect varied depending on the residue(s) mutated: Strongest effects were seen in combinatorial mutations. For example, when residues 604 and 629 were both mutated to alanine, PER function was disabled to a greater extent than that of either single mutant (compare mutant 604/629 with 604 and 629 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). Little or no repressor activity was observed for a combinatorial PER mutant containing alanine substitutions at all per-short and perSD phosphorylation sites (mutant 6A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g005">Figure 5</xref>A).</p>
        <p>An inverse relationship was observed between S589A and mutations of the perSD domain. These combinations always showed intermediate levels of PER activity that suggested a partial restoration of function by S589A (compare mutant 589/604/629 to 604/629 and 589; 589/629 to 629 and 589; 589/604 to 604 and 589; and 589/607/610 to 607/610 and 589 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g005">Figure 5</xref>A).</p>
        <p>We further tested in the repression assay, a deletion of <italic>per</italic> that removes the complete per-short domain ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b024">24</xref>], see also “<italic>per</italic>Δ<italic>S</italic> transgenes” below). Following transfection of S2 cells with equal amounts of DNA, both PER 589 and PER ΔS appeared to produce greater transcriptional repression than wild-type PER, despite the low levels of PER 589 and PER ΔS protein detected in these assays (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). In contrast, high levels of the PER 6A and PER 604/629 proteins produced only weak repression, suggesting that increased or decreased protein levels are not responsible for the apparent changes in activity levels. To further address this issue, we determined the level of repression associated with wild-type and mutant forms of PER as a function of the amount of protein present in the assay (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). When normalized to the wild-type PER protein levels, measured activities of the PER S589A and PERΔS repressors were higher than that of wild-type PER, indicating approximately twice the activity per unit protein. Together these S2 cell findings suggest that the PER-short domain regulates PER stability and PER's activity as a CLK repressor.</p>
        <p>The functional analysis of phosphorylation sites presented here indicates that DBT-target residues in the per-short and perSD domains are relevant for PER-dependent repression of CLK. The amino acids phosphorylated by DBT in the N- and C-terminus did not have an effect in this assay when mutated, but may be relevant for aspect(s) of PER regulation that are not revealed in the S2 transcription assay.</p>

Serine 589 is included in the per-short domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g004">Figure 4</xref>), a 17–amino acid interval, aa 585–601, throughout which single amino acid substitutions predominantly generate short-period phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b029">29</xref>]. The latter finding suggests that short-period mutations cause a domain-specific loss of PER function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b024">24</xref>]. To further test this hypothesis, a transgenic <italic>Drosophila</italic> strain was constructed with an intragenic PER deletion, termed <italic>per</italic>Δ<italic>S</italic>, affecting the entire per-short domain. The <italic>per</italic>Δ<italic>S</italic> transgene contained the complete sequence encoding PER with a 51-nucleotide (nt) in-frame deletion removing the DNA sequence encoding aa 585–601, thus also lacking serine 589, one of the identified DBT target sites. Further transgenic lines were created by genetic recombination. These carried one or two <italic>per</italic>Δ<italic>S</italic> transgenes in homozygotes (giving two and four copies of the transgene, respectively), or were heterozygous for one transgene. The recombinant flies were alternatively generated in wild-type or <italic>per</italic> null mutant backgrounds, and tested for locomotor activity in constant darkness. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060183-t002">Table 2</xref> shows the results of these behavioral assays (examples of individual locomotor activity records are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060183-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). A progressive shortening of period length, and eventually arrhythmia, was observed as the number of <italic>per</italic>Δ<italic>S</italic> transgenes was increased. It has been suggested that mutations in the per-short domain generate short-period phenotypes through a mechanism that involves premature degradation of nuclear PER proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b030">30</xref>]. However, if this were the only mechanism responsible for decreased period length in such mutants, it might be expected that progressively longer periods would result from increasing <italic>per</italic>Δ<italic>S</italic> copy number, in contrast to our observations. Our results suggest that a qualitative change in PER function contributes to these short period phenotypes.</p>

            <p>mRNA expression of cycling genes making up the circadian clock in flies was measured by northern blot or RNase protection from two time-course experiments (one of which is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060183-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). An average of the normalized values was obtained and plotted. Genes assayed are indicated to the right of their respective profiles.

        <p>In wild-type flies, the expression of <italic>per</italic>, <italic>tim</italic>, <italic>vri</italic>, and <italic>pdp1</italic>ε peaks during the early evening (approximately Zeitgeber time [ZT] 14; see wild type in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g006">Figure 6</xref>I, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g006">6</xref>E, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g006">6</xref>G, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g006">6</xref>A, respectively). In contrast, expression of these genes in flies with one homozygous <italic>per</italic>Δ<italic>S</italic> transgene showed an advanced phase, with peak expression time occurring in the afternoon (∼ZT 10; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g006">Figure 6</xref>I, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g006">6</xref>E, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g006">6</xref>G, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g006">6</xref>A). In each case, a lower amplitude RNA rhythm accompanied the advance phase of RNA expression. Corresponding alterations were observed in the <italic>Clk</italic> mRNA accumulation profile. In wild-type flies, <italic>Clk</italic> expression oscillates with a phase opposite to that of <italic>per</italic>, <italic>tim</italic>, <italic>vri</italic>, and <italic>pdp1</italic>ε. The phase of <italic>Clk</italic> RNA cycling is also advanced in flies carrying one homozygous <italic>per</italic>Δ<italic>S</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g006">Figure 6</xref>C).</p>
        <p>Expression levels of the <italic>per</italic>Δ<italic>S</italic> transcript were also measured. <italic>per</italic>Δ<italic>S</italic> mRNA showed oscillatory expression in animals with one and two homozygous <italic>per</italic>Δ<italic>S</italic> transgenes, with overall high levels of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g006">Figure 6</xref>K and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g006">6</xref>L). The observed increase in mRNA expression from <italic>per</italic>Δ<italic>S</italic> may be caused by an absence of dosage compensation that would regulate the endogenous <italic>per</italic> locus on chromosome X (both transgenes are in Chromosome 3). In fact, trough levels of <italic>per</italic>Δ<italic>S</italic> expression were comparable to peak expression levels of endogenous <italic>per</italic> mRNA in wild-type flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g006">Figure 6</xref>K and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g006">6</xref>L).</p>

To determine whether elevated PERΔS protein accumulation is associated with the heightened suppression of CLK, anti-PER western blots were performed using flies with <italic>per</italic>Δ<italic>S</italic> transgenes in a <italic>per</italic> null background. In flies with one homozygous <italic>per</italic>Δ<italic>S</italic> transgene, PERΔS proteins were expressed rhythmically in light/dark (LD) cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g007">Figure 7</xref>) and also in dark/dark (DD; unpublished data). PERΔS peak levels were advanced in these flies by 4 h when compared to PER accumulation profiles in wild-type flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g007">Figure 7</xref>). However, the abundance of PERΔS did not significantly differ from that seen for PER in wild-type flies. This was unexpected since a high level of <italic>per</italic>Δ<italic>S</italic> mRNA expression was found in these flies. The lack of protein overexpression in the presence of elevated mRNA levels is likely to indicate that PERΔS proteins are not as stable as wild-type PER proteins.</p>

Remarkably, PERΔS proteins accumulated with a modest rhythm despite the behavioral arrhythmicity of these flies. However, the electrophoretic mobility of PERΔS, which by comparison to wild-type PER should reflect the changing phosphorylation states of the protein during a 24-h cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b032">32</xref>], was substantially altered such that chiefly hypophosphorylated protein accumulated throughout the cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g007">Figure 7</xref>). As prior work has indicated that per-short domain mutations enhance DBT activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b015">15</xref>], and we have shown in this study that <italic>per</italic>Δ<italic>S</italic> flies produce elevated levels of <italic>per</italic>Δ<italic>S</italic> RNA, our results could indicate that PERΔS proteins are more efficiently phosphorylated and degraded than their wild-type counterparts. Consistent with this view, previous work has shown that in two mutants of the per-short domain, <italic>per</italic><sup>S</sup> and <italic>per</italic><sup>T</sup>, hyperphosphorylated PER protein levels decline prematurely during the early night [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b030">30</xref>], and a reduction of DBT activity is associated with hypophosphorylation and stabilization of wild-type PER (cf. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b015">15</xref>]).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Initial studies of <italic>dbt</italic> mutations suggested that PER is the primary target of DBT in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> circadian clock. Loss of <italic>dbt</italic> expression led to hypophosphorylation and overaccumulation of PER in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b012">12</xref>]. Mutations of <italic>dbt</italic> that shorten or lengthen behavioral rhythms led to correspondingly earlier or later degradation of PER in fly heads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b012">12</xref>]. The sequence of <italic>dbt</italic> suggested that it encodes an ortholog of the CKI family of protein kinases in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b009">9</xref>]. Direct evidence for DBT kinase activity and PER phosphorylation has been hampered by the absence of specific enzymatic activity in bacterially produced recombinant DBT preparations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b033">33</xref>], even though highly homologous mammalian CKIε (86% primary sequence identity in the kinase domain) has been recovered in an active form from bacterial expression systems. It is possible that for <italic>Drosophila</italic> DBT, protein folding is more sensitive to the cellular environment than the mammalian enzyme. Alternatively, DBT may require posttranslational modification(s) and/or the presence of a stimulating activity or cofactor(s) to produce an active conformation that is not available in bacterial cells. Nevertheless, in this report, we have shown that recombinant DBT can be expressed and recovered in an enzymatically active state from an insect cell line. However, even this insect-derived activity is short-lived (S. Kivimäe, unpublished data).</p>
      <p>Recombinant DBT in vitro preferentially phosphorylates PER protein. No significant phosphorylation was observed when TIM, SGG, and CYC were used as a substrate in vitro. Although no direct DBT phosphorylation of the N-terminal half of CLK was observed, recent studies by others have shown that DBT is required for the generation of a highly phosphorylated and unstable form of CLK in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b034">34</xref>]. Furthermore, to achieve this highly phosphorylated state of CLK, it has been suggested that PER must be present and function as a bridge to physically deliver DBT to CLK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b004">4</xref>]. CLK appears to be present in flies in multiple isoforms, including hypophosphorylated, intermediate-, and highly phosphorylated states. The last form is only observed during the late part of the CLK accumulation cycle and may promote CLK degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b034">34</xref>]. The lack of in vitro phosphorylation of CLK by DBT in our current studies may reflect a DBT phosphorylation target in the C-terminal half of CLK, or a requirement for additional kinases to “prime” a DBT target, or a dependence on PER for DBT-directed phosphorylation of CLK.</p>
      <p>Casein and PER are phosphorylated by enzymatically active recombinant DBT, and mutations of <italic>dbt</italic> that are known to affect the behavioral rhythm also have an effect on kinase activity. The short- and long-period mutations <italic>dbt</italic><sup>S</sup> and <italic>dbt</italic><sup>L</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b012">12</xref>] both reduce the kinase activity of DBT. Importantly, when the <italic>dbt</italic><sup>S</sup> mutation was introduced specifically into the <italic>Drosophila</italic> kinase, the effect was far less severe than a previously reported orthologous substitution; using casein as a substrate, the mutation produced a 15% decrease in activity when composing the fly kinase (this study), but decreased enzyme activity by approximately 55% when introduced into <italic>Xenopus</italic> CKIδ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b035">35</xref>]. Vertebrate CKI and DBT include divergent C-terminal protein segments, and the former enzyme cannot restore DBT function in transgenic <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b036">36</xref>]. These results suggest that any analysis of DBT mutations in a heterologous system should be applied with caution. The comparatively subtle effect of <italic>dbt</italic><sup>S</sup> on DBT activity versus its strong effect on period length could reflect a qualitative change in the mutant enzyme's activity. An assessment of potential differences of this sort might come from further mapping studies of the target specificities of DBT<sup>S</sup> versus DBT on PER substrates in vitro.</p>
      <p>Three distinct regions of PER are preferentially phosphorylated by DBT in vitro. In the C-terminal region of PER, we have identified two phosphorylation targets, serine 1,134 and threonine 1,219. No prior genetic or biochemical studies have suggested a specific role for this PER interval, and our cultured cell assays indicate that both phosphorylation targets can be removed without a detectable effect on PER's function as a CLK repressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Near the N-terminus of PER, a region of 20 amino acids (residues 149–169) contains five serines that are candidate phosphorylation sites for DBT. This interval is located upstream of the PAS domain of PER. A region important for DBT/PER binding in vitro has been mapped to the first 300 amino acids of PER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b009">9</xref>]. However, we have not determined whether there is a closer physical correspondence of the binding and phosphorylation target sequences, or whether elimination of potential DBT targets in this PER interval affects PER/DBT binding. As in the case of our cultured cell studies of serine 1,134 and threonine 1,219, elimination of all phosphorylation targets between aa 149–169, produced no detectable effect on PER-dependent repression in cultured cells.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, two of the putative CKI sites, serine 151 and serine 153, are substrates of casein kinase 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b037">37</xref>]. Transgenic flies carrying S151A and/or S153A mutations showed period lengthening and delayed PER nuclear localization. It will be important in future studies to distinguish CK2 and DBT phosphorylation targets in this region of PER and to determine their individual and/or interactive effects on PER function in vivo.</p>
      <p>Of most interest in this study are phosphorylation sites identified in the third DBT target region of PER, between residues 580–645. This is a genetically well-studied interval previously implicated in the regulation of behavioral rhythms. As described earlier, mutations of a portion of this region, the per-short domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g004">Figure 4</xref>), are predominantly associated with short-period behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b029">29</xref>]. The first mutation to be mapped to this region, <italic>per</italic><sup>S</sup>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b023">23</xref>] eliminates a candidate phosphorylation site at serine 589, and our S2 cell assays indicate that blocking phosphorylation of this site enhances PER's activity as a repressor of CLK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Earlier work has also shown that <italic>per</italic><sup>S</sup> leads to premature nuclear degradation of PER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b030">30</xref>], and our current studies of transgenic <italic>Drosophila</italic> producing a PER protein truncated by 17 amino acids including serine 589 (<italic>per</italic>Δ<italic>S</italic>), similarly indicate a role for this sequence in regulating PER stability and function as a repressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g007">7</xref>). Thus, the wild-type per-short domain appears to promote PER stability while reducing its activity as a transcriptional repressor.</p>
      <p>We note that earlier work has also suggested that the mutation <italic>per</italic><sup>S</sup> enhances DBT activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b015">15</xref>]. If serine 589 is no longer an available DBT target in <italic>per</italic><sup>S</sup>, by what mechanism might DBT function be elevated? Although mutating serine 589 enhances PER's activity as a repressor, this response is partially suppressed by a further mutation of some phosphorylation sites in the perSD region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g005">Figure 5</xref>). As well, little or no repressor activity is detected if all phosphorylation targets are removed from perSD, even in the presence of the <italic>per</italic><sup>S</sup> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the phosphorylation state of serine 589 may influence DBT activity on downstream targets within perSD that are required for PER's function as a CLK repressor. In such a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g008">Figure 8</xref>), dephosphorylation of the per-short domain would promote DBT-directed phosphorylation of perSD, enhancing PER's activity as a repressor and also destabilizing the protein. Reciprocally, phosphorylation of serine 589 would depress activity of DBT with respect to perSD, providing a more stable, but less active, PER protein. In this view, a fully dephosphorylated state would provide the most stable protein, but would provide an inactive form of PER, consistent with our findings in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g005">Figure 5</xref>) and transgenic flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g007">Figure 7</xref>), and with earlier studies of DBT-deficient <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b015">15</xref>]. Further in vivo evidence comes from transgenic flies expressing PER that contains a deletion of a conserved segment (aa 516–568) downstream of the PAS domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b038">38</xref>]. This mutant PER protein displays increased stability and low-amplitude oscillations. More importantly, high levels of a hypophosphorylated form of PER are produced by these truncated proteins, which constitutively accumulate in the nucleus. This protein appears to have little or no activity as a transcriptional repressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b038">38</xref>].</p>

      <p>Earlier studies of PER repression in S2 cells identified a region of PER, distinct from those reported here, that is also required for PER's function as a repressor of CLK-mediated transcription (CLK-CYC inhibition domain [CCID], aa 764–1,034; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b039">39</xref>]). A novel, bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) is found in this region that influences nuclear localization of PER in S2 cells. Recent mapping studies of CCID led to the identification of a smaller, PER-DBT binding domain (PDBD; aa 755–809) that upon deletion increases PER stability, decreases PER phosphorylation, and severely impairs PER function as a transcriptional repressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b040">40</xref>]. A related deletion of PER (aa 768–792) produced similar defects, and impaired nuclear accumulation of PER in cultured cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b041">41</xref>]. Studies of the latter deletion in transgenic flies showed that a hypophosphorylated form of PER is constitutively expressed at high levels and is a very poor repressor. However, repressor function was restored by NLS addition, suggesting that dysfunction of the protein was likely due to its inability to localize to the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b041">41</xref>].</p>
      <p>The arrangement of four of the phosphorylation targets included within the perSD domain (serines 604, 607, and 613, and threonine 610) resembles a CKI phosphorylation motif found in human PER2 that has been implicated in FASPS. In the human PER protein, there are five serines spaced in an arrangement such that every third amino acid residue is a serine. These five serines are thought to be progressively phosphorylated by CKIε/δ, and in certain FASPS subjects, the first serine is mutated to glycine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b042">42</xref>]. It has been proposed that this mutation inhibits the phosphorylation of the remaining serines, thus leading to altered hPER2 levels or activity in FASPS subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b042">42</xref>]. In fact, more-recent studies of this mutation indicate that it may alter PER2′s repressor function because lower levels of <italic>mper2</italic> RNA are found in transgenic mice expressing the similarly mutated mPER2 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b043">43</xref>]. Cultured cell studies have also suggested that the mutation affects mPER2 stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b044">44</xref>]. Accordingly, a role for CKI-directed phosphorylation in the regulation of PER's stability and activity as a transcriptional repressor may be conserved from flies to mammals.</p>

Treated fractions were analyzed by mass spectrometry, and peptide masses of treated and nontreated samples were compared. Alkaline phosphatase hydrolysis reduces peptide mass by 80 Da per phosphorylated residue. As an independent test, phosphopeptides were reacted with propanethiol. This results in a substitution reaction at the phosphorylation site and reduces peptide mass by 21 Da per phosphorylated residue.

Luciferase activity was normalized to cotransfected β-gal activity in each sample. To determine the amount of PER protein present in each luciferase assay, a small sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the presence of PER protein was detected using anti-PER antibodies.

Peptide fractions that responded to both treatments were subjected to Edman sequencing to identify the position of individual phosphorylated amino acids in the peptides.</p>
          <p>(C) is a tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectrum of the PER peptide 1124-EVPDSSPIPSVMGDYNSD-1143, which is phosphorylated at position 10 (S-1134). The MS/MS spectrum shows a doubly charged ion at m/z 994.9 (Pre) corresponding to the mass of the phosphorylated peptide. A loss of 98 Da (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) was observed for this precursor and some fragment ions under low collision-induced dissociation. The peaks labeled y1–7 and b6–9 correspond to the masses of b and y fragment ions of unmodified peptides. The addition of 80 Da (mass of PO<sub>3</sub>) was observed for the b10 (b10+80) and y9 (y9+80) ions, demonstrating that phosphorylation was on the Ser at position 10.</p>
