<abstract>
<p>The transcriptional mechanisms driving lineage specification during development are still largely unknown, as the interplay of multiple transcription factors makes it difficult to dissect these molecular events. Using a cell-based differentiation platform to probe transcription function, we investigated the role of the key paraxial mesoderm and skeletal myogenic commitment factors—mesogenin 1 (Msgn1), T-box 6 (Tbx6), forkhead box C1 (Foxc1), paired box 3 (Pax3), Paraxis, mesenchyme homeobox 1 (Meox1), sine oculis-related homeobox 1 (Six1), and myogenic factor 5 (Myf5)—in paraxial mesoderm and skeletal myogenesis. From this study, we define a genetic hierarchy, with Pax3 emerging as the gatekeeper between the presomitic mesoderm and the myogenic lineage. By assaying chromatin accessibility, genomic binding and transcription profiling in mesodermal cells from mouse and human Pax3-induced embryonic stem cells and Pax3-null embryonic day (E)9.5 mouse embryos, we identified conserved Pax3 functions in the activation of the skeletal myogenic lineage through modulation of Hedgehog, Notch, and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways. In addition, we demonstrate that Pax3 molecular function involves chromatin remodeling of its bound elements through an increase in chromatin accessibility and cooperation with sine oculis-related homeobox 4 (Six4) and TEA domain family member 2 (Tead2) factors. To our knowledge, these data provide the first integrated analysis of Pax3 function, demonstrating its ability to remodel chromatin in mesodermal cells from developing embryos and proving a mechanistic footing for the transcriptional hierarchy driving myogenesis.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Lineage specification during embryonic development relies on the activation of specific transcriptional programs required for defining cellular functions within each tissue. Transcription factors (TFs) play a critical part in gene activation/repression by promoting the formation of regulatory hubs at the elements associated with their target genes. Through hierarchical expression of TFs, cells within the developing embryo gradually shape their genomic landscape and ultimately restrict their differentiation potential. Here, we dissect the complex network of TFs involved in the specification of mesoderm toward the skeletal myogenic lineage by generating embryonic stem cell lines in which TF expression is controlled by a doxycycline-dependent on–off system. Using a combination of cell differentiation and genomic assays, we defined the TF hierarchy “Msgn1→Pax3→Myf5,” in which paired box 3 (Pax3) emerges as the key determinant for the specification of the myogenic fate. We show that Pax3 occupies several sites proximal to myogenic genes and that binding to these elements is associated with increase in chromatin accessibility, a hallmark of active regulatory elements. Although the ability of Pax3 to modulate chromatin accessibility is comparable between myogenic and nonmyogenic cells, Pax3 genomic binding and motif preferences are cell-dependent. In addition, we identify that cooperation with sine oculis-related homeobox 4 (Six4) and TEA domain family member 2 (Tead2) is instrumental for the robust Pax3-mediated myogenic commitment, thus indicating that combination of TFs and chromatin remodeling are both required for lineage commitment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Embryonic development is characterized by a highly regulated cascade of cell fate choices, involving the concerted action of signaling pathways and transcriptional responses, which ultimately results in the specification of progenitors for a specific organ or tissue. The definition of the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that govern this process is essential for an in-depth understanding of embryogenesis and therefore associated congenital diseases. Transcription factors (TFs) modulate the expression of lineage-specific genes by binding genomic elements, located either in proximity to transcription start sites (TSSs) or at distal intra- and intergenic regions, referred to as enhancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref001">1</xref>]. The enhancer landscape is instrumental for lineage-specific transcription, and chromatin remodeling at these sites is associated with transcriptional changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref002">2</xref>]. Although the nucleosome can represent a physical barrier for TF binding to the DNA, a specific class of TFs known as “pioneers” can overcome this inhibition by engaging their targets on nucleosomal DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref003">3</xref>]. Since lineage specification often involves multiple classes of TFs, the interplay between pioneering activity and formation of macromolecular complexes that initiate transcription is critical for the successful activation of the differentiation program.</p>
<p>The skeletal myogenic lineage is specified within the somites, epithelial aggregates of paraxial mesodermal progenitors arising from segmentation of the presomitic mesoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref004">4</xref>]. As the embryo develops, newly formed somites receive cues from the surrounding cells, which result in the specification of the dermomyotome and sclerotome (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref005">5</xref>]). Skeletal muscle progenitor specification occurs within the central domain of the dermomyotome, from which cells delaminate from the epaxial and hypaxial regions to give rise to trunk and limb muscles, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref005">5</xref>]. Although expression of the muscle regulatory factors (MRFs; Myf5, myogenic differentiation protein [MyoD], Mrf4, and myogenin [MyoG]) formally defines the activation of the myogenic program, different sets of TFs act directly or indirectly prior to MRF expression to first specify the somitic mesoderm and subsequently the myogenic fate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref005">5</xref>]. <italic>Msgn1</italic> and <italic>Tbx6</italic> play a fundamental role in the differentiation of neuromesodermal progenitors into presomitic mesoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref007">7</xref>]. <italic>Foxc1/2</italic> TFs are expressed in both presomitic mesoderm and formed somites and are necessary for somitogenesis, as evidenced by the lack of somites in <italic>Foxc1</italic>:<italic>Foxc2</italic> compound null embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref008">8</xref>]. The paired-domain TF <italic>Pax3</italic> is expressed in forming somites and then becomes restricted to the central domain of the dermomyotome, where it is essential for the commitment, survival, proliferation, and migration of myogenic progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref010">10</xref>]. <italic>Paraxis</italic> (also called <italic>Tcf15</italic>) belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of TFs, and it is involved in somite epithelialization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref011">11</xref>]. Similarly, <italic>Meox1/2</italic> regulate epithelialization and somite rostrocaudal patterning, with double-knockout (KO) animals displaying severe defects in the differentiation of somite derivatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref012">12</xref>]. <italic>Six1/4</italic> are expressed in both somites and developing muscles, regulating myogenesis at multiple levels, as demonstrated by the muscle hypoplasia observed in <italic>Six1</italic>-null mice and the severe impairment of hypaxial musculature in <italic>Six1</italic>:<italic>Six4</italic> compound mutant embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the hierarchical expression of these TFs is required for the proper activation of the skeletal myogenic lineage. Msgn1 regulates the expression of several paraxial mesoderm genes, including <italic>Pdgfra</italic>, <italic>Foxc1</italic>, and <italic>Snai1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref016">16</xref>]. <italic>Pax3</italic> expression is impaired in both <italic>Meox1</italic>:<italic>Meox2</italic> and <italic>Six1</italic>:<italic>Six4</italic> compound null embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref013">13</xref>]. The myogenic determinant <italic>Myf5</italic> is a well-known critical downstream target gene of paired box 3 (Pax3), which binds at least two well-characterized enhancers located −57 kb and −111 kb from the <italic>Myf5</italic> TSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref019">19</xref>]. Similarly, sine oculis-related homeobox 1/4 (Six1/4) and mesenchyme homeobox 2 (Meox2) participate in <italic>Myf5</italic> regulation by binding to the enhancers occupied by Pax3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref021">21</xref>]. Nevertheless, key aspects of the molecular mechanism behind the function of these TFs have not been examined, because of the lack of a scalable cellular model able to mimic the specification of the dermomyotome during development. To overcome this limitation, our laboratory has developed a pluripotent stem cell–based model system to recapitulate mouse and human embryonic myogenesis in the dish (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref022">22</xref>]).</p>
<p>Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the mechanisms underlying specification of the skeletal myogenic lineage from mesodermal cells. Using a doxycycline (dox)-inducible mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell–based system, we screened the function of known TFs expressed during the transition from mesoderm to myotome. This revealed a genetic hierarchy involving Msgn1→Pax3→Myf5, in which Pax3 represents the main determinant for the progression of paraxial mesoderm precursors toward the skeletal myogenic lineage. We identify the Pax3 target loci and show that in both differentiating ES cells and developing mouse embryos, Pax3 specifies paraxial mesoderm toward skeletal muscle through chromatin remodeling of these elements. We show that Pax3-induced chromatin remodeling is cell-type independent and that Pax3 myogenic activity requires genetic interaction with Six4 and TEA domain family member 2 (Tead2) TFs.</p>

<title>Robust activation of the myogenic program occurs only upon Pax3 and Myf5 expression</title>
<p>To study the role of TFs involved in the specification of the presomitic mesoderm toward the myogenic lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), we used an inducible cassette exchange system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref023">23</xref>], which allowed for the generation of dox-inducible mouse ES cell lines expressing Msgn1, Tbx6, FoxC1, Pax3, Paraxis, Meox1, Six1, or Myf5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). Following differentiation into embryoid bodies (EBs), we assessed the ability of these TFs to promote mesoderm lineage specification using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). As we demonstrated previously, EB-derived PDGFRα+FLK1− cells represent paraxial mesodermal precursors that, upon Pax3 induction, undergo skeletal muscle commitment and ultimately generate a population of proliferating myogenic progenitors endowed with in vivo regenerative potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref025">25</xref>]. Besides Pax3, only FoxC1 and Msgn1 were able to induce the PDGFRα+FLK1− fraction, whereas Meox1, Myf5, Paraxis, Six1, and Tbx6 were unable to promote paraxial mesoderm in the presence of serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g001">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). To better visualize the mesoderm-promoting activity of these factors, the same analysis was performed using a serum-free differentiation protocol, conditions under which mesoderm does not form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref026">26</xref>]. As expected, the frequency of PDGFRα+ and FLK1+ cells in noninduced cultures was drastically reduced in the absence of serum. Upon dox induction, significant up-regulation of the PDGFRα+FLK1− fraction was observed not only for Pax3, Msgn1, and FoxC1 but also for Tbx6 and Paraxis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). The ability to induce platelet-derived growth factor alpha (PDGFRα) in serum-free conditions correlated with the spatial location of these TFs along the anterior–posterior (AP) axis, with the highest PDGFRα induction observed for the more posterior TFs (Msgn1, Tbx6, Foxc1, and Pax3). These data were further confirmed by gene expression analysis of somitic/myogenic markers, as shown by up-regulation of <italic>Meox1</italic>, <italic>Pax3</italic>, and <italic>Paraxis</italic> following Msgn1 and Tbx6 induction in serum-free differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). Since PDGFRα marks both presomitic mesoderm and somites, we next examined whether the PDGFRα+FLK1− cell fractions isolated from serum- and serum-free cultures were endowed with skeletal myogenic potential. Upon sorting, monolayer cultures from the dox-treated inducible-TF cell lines were assayed for the expression of MYOG. Pax3 and Myf5 induction robustly activated the myogenic program in both differentiation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g001">Fig 1D and 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s001">S1D Fig</xref>), a result in agreement with their function in the myogenic hierarchy. Among the other TFs tested, only Msgn1 displayed a partial capability to induce MYOG in serum-free cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g001">Fig 1D, 1E, 1F and 1G</xref>). These results imply that Msgn1 functions are affected by serum components and that this TF is not sufficient for the transition of PDGFRα+ cells into the myogenic lineage. Although Msgn1 has been reported to regulate paraxial mesoderm commitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref016">16</xref>], this study did not address whether the resulting cells were capable of cell-autonomous differentiation toward one of the other paraxial mesoderm derivatives.</p>

<p>Since transcriptional activity of Six TFs requires expression of the eyes absent (Eya) proteins, we verified whether these important cofactors are expressed. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s001">S1E Fig</xref>, our transcriptomic analyses (described later) indicate these important coactivators are expressed in PDGFRα+ cells, thus suggesting that lack of myogenic activity observed upon Six1 induction is not affected by Eya gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s001">S1D Fig</xref>). Nonetheless, we cannot exclude that other TFs tested in this study may not be functional because of the absence of important cofactors.</p>
<p>Mitotic bookmarking has been proposed to play an important role in cell specification during development because of the faster reactivation of mitotically marked genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref028">28</xref>]. We reasoned that Msgn1 and Pax3 may differ in their ability to bind chromatin during mitosis and ultimately induce the expression of key genes important for the specification of the myogenic lineage. To test this hypothesis, we generated dox-inducible Msgn1-GFP and Pax3-GFP ES cell lines to visualize these proteins without the use of crosslinking agents, which have been reported to affect mitotic binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref029">29</xref>]. Characterization of these lines demonstrated that C-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion enabled the detection of GFP fusion proteins by live cell imaging without affecting Msgn1 and Pax3 function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s001">S1F and S1G Fig</xref>). Although we observed clear localization of Msgn1-GFP to mitotic chromosomes, this was not the case for Pax3-GFP, which was barely detected at condensed chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g001">Fig 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s001">S1G Fig</xref>). Based on these data, we conclude that the inability of Msgn1 to specify the myogenic lineage is not related to mitotic bookmarking but is rather due to its target selectivity.</p>

<title>Pax3: A gatekeeper of the myogenic lineage</title>
<p>To dissect the differences between Msgn1 and Pax3 at the epigenetic level and provide mechanistic insight into the transition from presomitic mesoderm to somite-myotome, we employed the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref030">30</xref>] to map genome-wide changes in chromatin accessibility. For this analysis, we focused on day 4 cells from serum and serum-free differentiation EB cultures upon induction of Msgn1, Pax3, or Myf5. PDGFRα+FLK1− cells isolated from the trunk region of embryonic day (E)9.5 mouse embryos were used as reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, “P+F− E9.5 emb.”). Compared to day 4 noninduced EBs, all TFs provoked changes in chromatin accessibility at genomic regions associated with expected or known targets: <italic>Pax3</italic> and <italic>Paraxis</italic> in the case of Msgn1, the <italic>Myf5</italic> −111 kb enhancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref018">18</xref>] and <italic>Met</italic> for Pax3, and the <italic>Myogenin</italic> promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref032">32</xref>] and <italic>muscle creatine kinase</italic> (<italic>Ckm</italic>) for Myf5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). In agreement with our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), we only observed changes at genes involved in somitogenesis when Msgn1 was induced in serum-free conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s002">S2A Fig</xref>).

In the case of Myf5, we observed only 1,812/7,018 (26%) overlapping peaks between day 4 EBs and E9.5 embryos, likely because the full expression of this gene occurs at later developmental stages (Myf5 protein is detectable from E10.5).</p>

<p>Using the annotation tool GREAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref033">33</xref>], we annotated the differentially accessible genomic regions for each TF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g002">Fig 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s002">S2B Fig</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s009">S2 Table</xref>). Msgn1- and Pax3-induced accessible loci were associated with genes involved in various mesodermal cell categories, including segmentation, muscle, and mesenchymal cell development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g002">Fig 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). In contrast, Myf5 induction increased accessibility at loci involved in later stages of skeletal muscle differentiation, such as <italic>Myog</italic> and <italic>Ckm</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), which is in agreement with the ability of the myogenic determinants to activate the skeletal muscle program in multiple cell types, including nonmesodermal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref034">34</xref>]. This finding indicates that the ability of Myf5 to induce myogenesis also in PDGFRα-negative cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s001">S1B Fig</xref>) involves a mechanism that is distinct from that of Pax3, which occurs only in mesodermal cells (further discussed in this manuscript). In addition, although we observed increased chromatin accessibility at the <italic>Myf5</italic> enhancer following 1-day Pax3 induction, Myf5 mRNA expression increased robustly during the next 5 days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s001">S1E Fig</xref>), which recapitulates the pattern of Myf5 expression in developing embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref036">36</xref>]. This also corresponded to increased chromatin accessibility at the <italic>Myog</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s002">S2C Fig</xref>). Based on these data, we believe that Myf5 downstream targets (such as Myog) are activated only upon robust Myf5 induction, which occurs through sustained Pax3 expression.</p>
<p>To demonstrate these three TFs regulate different subsets of loci, we compared the chromatin accessibility profiles of Pax3-, Msgn1-, and Myf5-induced EB cells to E9.5 embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s002">S2B Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s009">S2 Table</xref>). In agreement with the pairwise comparison of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, combined analysis of these ATAC-seq data shows minimal overlap of the loci characterized by increased chromatin accessibility upon Msgn1, Pax3, and Myf5 induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s002">S2B Fig</xref>), which is further confirmed by gene ontology (GO) analysis of the loci associated to each cluster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s009">S2 Table</xref>). Motif analysis on the accessible peaks induced by each TF (total number from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) confirmed the enrichment for binding sites associated with bHLH factors, such as Msgn1 and Myf5, and paired domain, as in the case of Pax3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g002">Fig 2E and 2F</xref>). We observed enrichment of the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) motif in both Msgn1 and Pax3 peaks, thus suggesting that lineage specification transitions induced by these TFs may be associated with changes in chromosome architecture. This was not the case for the Myf5 peaks enriched for myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) and MEIS motifs, which have been shown to cooperate with the myogenic bHLH proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g002">Fig 2E</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref038">38</xref>].</p>
<p>An interesting hypothesis that can be drawn from these ATAC-seq data is the potential direct involvement of Msgn1 in <italic>Pax3</italic> regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). To investigate this, we compared the chromatin accessibility profile at the Pax3 locus with published Msgn1 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref016">16</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g002">Fig 2F</xref>, Msgn1 binding is detected at intronic elements of the Pax3 gene, and both peaks correspond to ATAC-seq peaks found at the Msgn1-inducible EBs and E9.5 embryos. Western blot and ChIP analyses confirmed the increase in PAX3 protein expression following Msgn1 dox-dependent induction in serum-free cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g002">Fig 2G</xref>) and Msgn1 binding at the Pax3 locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s002">S2G Fig</xref>). Nonetheless, Msgn1-induced PAX3 expression was found to be much lower than that obtained following Pax3 induction, and sustained Msgn1 expression was not sufficient for maintaining Pax3 expression over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g002">Fig 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s002">S2H Fig</xref>). These observations may account for Msgn1 incapability to robustly induce myogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g001">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>) and suggest the requirement of an additional factor for maintaining PAX3 expression in the trunk somites.</p>
<p>Altogether, these data demonstrate the sequential activation of the genes involved in skeletal myogenic lineage specification from presomitic mesoderm, which follows the hierarchy Msgn1→Pax3→Myf5. Pax3 plays a central role in this process by representing the earliest upstream regulator for the robust specification of the myogenic lineage from paraxial mesoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g001">Fig 1D and 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s001">S1C and S1D Fig</xref>).</p>

Given the ability of Pax3 to efficiently drive skeletal myogenesis from mesodermal cells, we set out to decode the molecular mechanisms responsible for its activity in early mesodermal cells (1-day Pax3 induction) and myogenic progenitors (6-day Pax3 induction) using unbiased approaches. Transcriptomic analysis of EB-derived cells identified 422 and 4,647 differentially regulated genes following comparison of noninduced cells to 1-day and 6-day Pax3-induced cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>).

However, whereas the levels of myogenic transcripts (e.g., Myf5, Lbx1, and multiple epidermal growth factor–like domains protein 10 [Megf10]) showed a time-dependent increase in expression, neuronal genes were down-regulated during the 1-day-to-6-day transition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s003">S3A Fig</xref>).

<p>Since Pax3-induced cells displayed up-regulation of somitic markers, we next confirmed that Meox1 expression is impaired in the absence of Pax3 in vivo. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g003">Fig 3E</xref>, we analyzed <italic>Pax3</italic>-null E9.5 mouse embryos from an F1 cross and found impaired expression of the somite marker <italic>Meox1</italic> in the dorsoventral domain, normally characterized by Pax3 expression. Selected potential Pax3 targets, including <italic>Ebf3</italic>, <italic>Eya1</italic>, <italic>Megf10</italic>, and <italic>Vcam1</italic>, were validated by gene expression analysis in 6-hour Pax3-induced cells (e.g., <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). Using FACS, we verified that vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (Vcam1) is strongly up-regulated by Pax3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g003">Fig 3F</xref>).</p>
<p>Using an analogous approach in differentiating human ES cells, we determined the transcriptional changes induced by PAX3 in human mesoderm. As expected, the ability of PAX3 to induce the myogenic program in differentiating human ES cells is conserved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s003">S3C Fig</xref>), and, similar to murine cells, within 1-day of dox-dependent induction (from day 5 cultures of differentiating H9 cells) PAX3 up-regulates genes involved in paraxial mesoderm formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s003">S3D Fig</xref>). Unbiased transcriptomic analysis identified 746 human transcripts subjected to PAX3 regulation (388 up-regulated and 358 down-regulated; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s003">S3E Fig</xref>).

Comparison of murine and human datasets revealed that 8% (60/746) and 51% (381/746) of the genes regulated in inducible-PAX3 (iPAX3) human cells are also differentially expressed in 1-day and 6-day iPax3 mouse cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s010">S3G Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s011">S4 Table</xref>).

<title>Pax3 regulates chromatin accessibility during myogenic specification</title>
<p>To investigate whether Pax3 has a direct function in the regulation of the genes identified in our transcriptomic studies, we analyzed Pax3 genomic occupancy in murine EB-derived cells 1 day and 6 days post dox-mediated induction, using ChIP followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq).

<title>Chromatin accessibility is impaired in <italic>Pax3</italic>-null embryos</title>
<p>To determine whether chromatin remodeling of these elements requires Pax3 in vivo, we analyzed the changes in chromatin accessibility upon Pax3 loss of function in mouse embryos. For this analysis, we performed ATAC-seq on PDGFRα+FLK1− cells isolated from the trunk region of wild-type (WT) and Pax3-null (KO) E9.5 embryos. Clustering of the ATAC-seq data on the Pax3 ChIP-seq peaks classified 3 groups based on the chromatin accessibility signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s005">S5D Fig</xref>). Whereas groups 1 and 2 showed limited or no changes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s005">S5E Fig</xref>), chromatin accessibility of group 3 revealed a Pax3-dependent change in PDGFRα+FLK1− mesodermal cells isolated from mouse embryos as well as from day 4 EBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). These results confirm that activation of the myogenic program by Pax3 during embryogenesis is associated with chromatin remodeling of its binding sites. For example, we observed a dramatic decrease in accessibility at the <italic>Cdon</italic> −49 kb, <italic>Vcam1</italic> +3 kb, and <italic>Myf5</italic> −111 kb elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g004">Fig 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s005">S5F Fig</xref>) and similar results at many other Pax3-bound sites in Pax3-null E9.5 embryos (e.g., <italic>Eya1</italic>, <italic>Jag1</italic>, <italic>Met</italic>, and <italic>Notch2</italic>). In further support of our findings, biregional cell adhesion molecule–related/down-regulated by oncogenes (Cdon) binding protein (Boc) and Cdon transcripts are down-regulated in Pax3-null E9.5 embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s005">S5G Fig</xref>), and analysis of the transcriptomic changes following expression of dominant positive Pax3-FKHR fusion protein in developing murine somites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref043">43</xref>] showed significant up-regulation of several genes identified in our genome-wide studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g004">Fig 4G</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec008">
<title>Pax3 induces chromatin remodeling independently of the activation of the myogenic program</title>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that Pax3 expression in cell types distinct from PDGFRα+ paraxial mesoderm, such as fibroblasts, does not result in efficient activation of the myogenic program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref044">44</xref>]. To assess whether this is due to impaired chromatin remodeling of Pax3-bound sites, we introduced the dox-inducible Pax3 system into NIH3T3 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) and Bend3 endothelial cells. The expression of somitic and myogenic genes was minimal or absent upon Pax3 induction in NIH3T3 and Bend3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g005">Fig 5B</xref>) and accordingly did not result in the activation of the myogenic program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Since the PAX family of TFs has been implicated in epigenetic regulation through interaction with the COMPASS histone methyltransferase (HMT) complex and modulation of monomethylated lysine 4 of histone 3 (H3K4me1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref045">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref048">48</xref>], we evaluated these cells for the deposition of H3K4me1 following Pax3 induction. Following 24 hours of Pax3 induction, H3K4me1 levels in these cells were comparable to EBs at the −111 kb <italic>Myf5</italic> enhancer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s006">S6A Fig</xref>) and drastically reduced at the intragenic <italic>Myf5</italic> site (+0.7 kb from TSS). To investigate the global molecular function of Pax3 in fibroblasts, we performed ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq on 1-day induced iPax3 NIH3T3 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g005">Fig 5D</xref>, ChIP-seq for Pax3 in NIH3T3 cells identified 11,420 peaks, 907 of which were in common to the 1-day EB dataset. Loci occupied by Pax3 only in EB-derived cells were associated with genes involved in neurogenesis and mesoderm development, such as <italic>Fgfr4</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref049">49</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g005">Fig 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s013">S6B Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s009">S2 Table</xref>). In contrast, peaks identified only in NIH3T3 cells were characterized by enrichment for biological process categories such as regulation of apoptosis and protein phosphorylation, such as <italic>Src</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g005">Fig 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s013">S6B Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s009">S2 Table</xref>). Motif analysis of peaks found solely in EBs or NIH3T3 or common to both revealed interesting differences in the modality of Pax3 binding to these different subsets. Whereas EB-derived Pax3 peaks displayed enrichment for paired-type PAX motifs, NIH3T3-only peaks were characterized by homeodomain- and paired-type PAX motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g005">Fig 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s006">S6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s006">S6D and S6E Fig</xref>). Accordingly, selectivity between paired- and homeodomain-type motifs has been suggested to play a role in the pioneering activity of Pax7 in melanotrope versus corticotrope differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref050">50</xref>], thus supporting Pax3’s ability to bind its targets in a context-dependent manner. Next, using ATAC-seq data from 1-day iPax3 EB and iPax3 NIH3T3 cells, we compared chromatin accessibility at Pax3 binding sites in EBs only, common EBs/NIH3T3, and NIH3T3 only. For all subsets, <italic>k</italic>-means clustering showed 3 groups of loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s006">S6F Fig</xref>). Cluster 1 had the highest accessibility, whereas cluster 3 had the lowest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s006">S6G Fig</xref>). Upon dox treatment, we observed subset-specific Pax3-dependent increase in chromatin accessibility in cluster 2, as exemplified by <italic>Fgfr4</italic>, <italic>Vcam1</italic>, and <italic>Src</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g005">Fig 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s005">S5G Fig</xref>). These sites also displayed distinct basal chromatin accessibility, indicative of cell-specific differences at remodeled sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g005">Fig 5G</xref>). Taken together, these findings support the notion that Pax3 has the ability to induce chromatin remodeling, which is conserved among different cell types, and suggest that activation of the myogenic program depends on the selection of sites bound by this TF.</p>

<title>Pax3 requires Six4 and Tead2 for efficient induction of skeletal myogenesis</title>
<p>The studies above strongly support the notion that a major role of Pax3 binding is to promote chromatin remodeling, thereby increasing accessibility of target loci. To identify potential cooperation between Pax3 and other TFs, we analyzed the conserved motifs enriched near Pax3 peaks. To gain a comprehensive assessment of the conserved motifs at Pax3 sites, we performed this analysis on 1-day and 6-day Pax3 ChIP-seq peaks as well as on Pax3 binding sites identified in adult primary myoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref051">51</xref>]. This comparison revealed differences in Pax3 genomic binding among these samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g006">Fig 6A</xref>).

As expected, motif analysis identified the presence of Pax3 binding motifs among the top hits, supporting that our ChIP-seq robustly identified bona fide Pax3 binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Similar to the NIH3T3-specific Pax3 peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g005">Fig 5</xref>), Pax3 peaks in myoblasts were found enriched for both paired-type and homeodomain-type motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), in agreement with Soleimani and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref051">51</xref>].

<p>To verify whether the predicted motifs near Pax3 binding sites are occupied by TFs in vivo, we used available ChIP-seq datasets for Six4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref052">52</xref>], Tead1, Tead4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref053">53</xref>], Jun [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref054">54</xref>], Runt-related transcription factor 1 (Runx1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref055">55</xref>], and upstream stimulatory factor 1 (Usf1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref056">56</xref>]. Six4 is a known regulator of the myogenic lineage, as it binds to the <italic>Myf5</italic> −111 kb and −57 kb enhancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref021">21</xref>], and it is required for the MyoD-mediated myogenic conversion of MEFs and muscle differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref057">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref058">58</xref>]. Jun is a component of the activator protein 1 (AP1) factor, which has been shown to bind enhancers in multiple cell types, including skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref059">59</xref>]. Similarly, Tead and Runx1 factors regulate several myogenic genes in proliferating myoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref055">55</xref>].

Upon <italic>k</italic>-means clustering of these datasets across a region of ±3 kb from the center of the Pax3 6-day ChIP-seq dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g006">Fig 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s014">S7 Table</xref>), we observed a subset of Pax3 binding sites overlapping with Six4, Tead1/4, Runx1, and Usf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g006">Fig 6D</xref>: cluster 1). Visual inspection of the genome tracks confirmed the co-occurrence of binding for these TFs (including Jun at selected sites) and Pax3 at subsets of genes such as <italic>Cdon</italic>, <italic>Megf10</italic>, and <italic>Fgfr4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). We noted that the 4 distinct clusters also differed for recruitment of Pax3 between 1-day and 6-day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g006">Fig 6C</xref>: compare clusters 1, 2, and 4 versus cluster 3), indicating that Pax3 binding at a subset of sites changes during the myogenic specification process. In support of the functional relevance of cluster 1 peaks, GO classification using GREAT showed an enrichment for skeletal muscle biological process categories (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s007">S7C Fig</xref>). Among the other clusters, clusters 2 and 4 displayed an enrichment for myogenic biological process categories, whereas cluster 3 was enriched for terms associated with different aspects of mesoderm specification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s007">S7C Fig</xref>). To assess the biological relevance of these TFs during Pax3-induced myogenesis, we performed knockdown studies using constructs targeting Six4 and Tead2, which represents the highest-expressed Tead factor based on our RNA-seq data. Knockdown of Six4 and Tead2 using two independent shRNA clones induced a &gt;50% reduction of the respective mRNA compared to scramble control (shSCR) counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g006">Fig 6F</xref>) and resulted in the significant reduction of the expression levels of genes found up-regulated in Pax3-induced EB cultures, including genes associated with Notch and Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g006">Fig 6F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s007">S7D Fig</xref>). We then further investigated whether terminal differentiation of Pax3-induced mesoderm into myosin heavy chain (MYHC+) cells required Six4 or Tead2. Knockdown of both genes significantly reduced differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g006">Fig 6G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s007">S7E Fig</xref>), thus confirming that these two TFs participate in the Pax3-mediated activation of the skeletal myogenic program.</p>
<p>Based on these data, we conclude that activation of the skeletal myogenic program during development involves both Pax3-mediated chromatin remodeling and the subsequent recruitment of Six4 and Tead2.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using genomic techniques combined with in vitro and in vivo models, here we provide the first comprehensive analysis of Pax3-mediated myogenic specification in developing mesoderm. In this study, we identified a compendium of Pax3-bound mesodermal enhancers, defined the epigenetic changes resulting from the recruitment of chromatin remodeling complexes at these sites both in vitro and in vivo, and identified cooperation between Pax3 and the TFs Six4 and Tead2 during myogenic lineage commitment. These analyses provide important insights into what can be defined as the “core function” of Pax3 at its binding sites and its cooperation with other transcriptional regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g007">Fig 7</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) Pax3 expression is regulated by Msgn1, expressed in the presomitic mesoderm, as well as by other unidentified factors that contribute to its expression in the formed somites. Pax3, in turn, regulates the myogenic program by inducing, among the others, components of Notch and HH signaling pathways while repressing nonmyogenic lineages.

<title>TF hierarchy during mesoderm patterning</title>
<p>The use of differentiating inducible ES cell lines expressing TFs involved in mesoderm patterning under serum or serum-free conditions highlights the central role of Pax3 in the specification of the myogenic lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Our data demonstrate that, even though Msgn1 lies upstream of Pax3 in the mesoderm genetic hierarchy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref016">16</xref>], it does not efficiently activate the skeletal myogenic program. Nonetheless, we observed that Msgn1 has mitotic bookmarking capability, which we speculate may be involved in Msgn1 role in lineage fate decision of neuromesodermal progenitors. Similar to Msgn1, expression of mesoderm posterior 1 (Mesp1) in serum-free cultures of differentiating mouse ES cells induces partial activation of the skeletal myogenic lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref026">26</xref>], and in vivo analysis of <italic>mesp-b</italic> function in zebrafish embryos demonstrated this transcriptional regulator is necessary for dermomyotome development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref061">61</xref>]. However, although these authors observed that <italic>mesp-b</italic> expression in transgenic embryos directly regulates <italic>meox1</italic> and <italic>ripply1</italic> expression, this was not the case for <italic>pax3</italic>, thus suggesting an indirect role of <italic>mesp-b</italic> in the regulation of this TF. Based on our data, Msgn1 does not induce Mesp1/2, which are up-regulated only upon Tbx6 expression in serum-free condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s007">S7F Fig</xref>). Since partial muscle specification occurs only upon Msgn1 induction under serum-free differentiation conditions, we conclude that other signals are required for the efficient transition of the presomitic progenitors to the myogenic lineage.</p>
<p>In addition, we observed that signaling pathways activated by serum components inhibit Msgn1 paraxial mesoderm inducing activity. In agreement with this hypothesis, Chan and colleagues reported that both Bmp2 and Bmp4 repress Mesp1-mediated myogenic differentiation by promoting the cardiac cell fate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref062">62</xref>]. Pax3 function, in contrast, is independent of the growth factor environment, and its induction results in robust activation of the skeletal myogenic program. Because embryonic myogenic progenitors have been suggested not to be affected by the BMP/transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref063">63</xref>], we predict this may occur through a Pax3-dependent transcriptional regulation of key components of this pathway during development. Accordingly, in our RNA-seq dataset, we observed down-regulation of <italic>Bmp2/4</italic> and up-regulation of the <italic>Sulf2</italic> and <italic>Twsg1</italic>, secreted factors involved in BMP signaling repression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s003">S3H Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref064">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref065">65</xref>], although further studies will be required to investigate whether this process is directly regulated by Pax3. Corroborating our in vitro results, we show the impaired expression of <italic>Meox1</italic> along the dorsoventral axis in <italic>Pax3</italic>-null E9.5 embryos. Previous findings reported for <italic>Paraxis</italic> and <italic>Lfng</italic> in E10.5 splotch-homozygous embryos, a <italic>Pax3</italic>-null allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref066">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref067">67</xref>], further support the notion that Pax3 regulates paraxial mesoderm specification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref025">25</xref>]. Analysis of the ATAC-seq dataset from paraxial mesoderm cells of E9.5 embryos and differentiating inducible Msgn1, Pax3, and Myf5 ES cells revealed that differentially accessible peaks are subdivided into clusters with distinct GO classifications based on the TF of origin. This analysis confirms that Pax3 regulates chromatin accessibility at loci associated with genes involved in the determination of myogenic progenitors and highlights the difference with Myf5, which activates genes further downstream in the muscle differentiation program.</p>

<title>Pax3-mediated modulation of signaling pathway components</title>
<p>Our transcriptomic and epigenetic studies indicate that Pax3 regulates the expression of a subset of genes associated with HH and Notch signaling pathways. During development, Shh secreted from notochord and dorsal neural tube plays an important role in Myf5 and Myod induction (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref068">68</xref>]). Cdon, Boc, and growth arrest specific 1 (Gas1) have been identified as essential ligand-binding components of the HH coreceptor Patched [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref069">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref071">71</xref>] and are required for proper patterning of multiple tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref072">72</xref>]. Since Cdon, Boc, and Gas1 are expressed in the Pax3+ dermomyotome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref073">73</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref075">75</xref>], our data are in agreement with an active and evolutionarily conserved role of Pax3 in binding and remodeling of the regulatory elements responsible for induction of these HH coreceptors. This hypothesis is further supported by the observation that Cdon, Boc, and Gas1 transcripts are up-regulated in the somites of <italic>Pax3</italic><sup><italic>Pax3FKHR/GFP</italic></sup> embryos, a transcriptionally dominant Pax3 allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref043">43</xref>]. At the molecular level, both Cdon and Boc are part of a cell–cell adhesion complex (which also includes N- and M-cadherins) required for the differentiation of skeletal myogenic progenitors through activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42) signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref076">76</xref>]. In accordance, we observed that treatment of Pax3-induced cultures with the p38 inhibitor SB203580 impairs myogenic specification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000153.s007">S7G Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The Notch signaling pathway plays an important role in preventing precocious differentiation of progenitors in the developing muscle (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref077">77</xref>]). Nonetheless, to date, regulatory networks responsible for the expression of these genes during myogenic specification have not been deeply investigated or have been limited to muscle cell lines, such as C2C12. Our data identify an important function for Pax3 in the expression of components of the Notch pathway. Similar to the HH signaling pathway, Pax3-induced changes in chromatin accessibility were detected at loci associated with Notch pathway genes (e.g., <italic>Lfng</italic> and <italic>Notch2</italic>), as well as extracellular matrix proteins required for the establishment of the future muscle stem cell niche (e.g., <italic>Megf10</italic> and <italic>M-cadherin</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref078">78</xref>]). Most of these observations were corroborated by data collected in developing mouse embryos and through analysis of murine and human iPAX3 differentiating ES cultures. Altogether, our data reveal novel Pax3-dependent transcriptional targets accounting for the activation or repression of signaling pathways important for skeletal myogenic lineage specification.</p>

<sec id="sec013">
<title>Pax3 and chromatin remodeling</title>
<p>We demonstrate that Pax3 induction in mesodermal cells results in increased chromatin accessibility at Pax3 targets and epigenetic mark deposition. Histone methylation accounts for diverse functions during transcriptional regulation, and multiple complexes mediate the deposition/erasure of this modification. H3K4me1 and trimethylated lysine 4 of histone 3 (H3K4me3) are deposited by the lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase 2C/D (MLL3/4) and SET1 complexes, respectively, which are characterized by common and specific subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref079">79</xref>]. Although interaction between the HMT complex and Pax3 has not been reported, studies carried out by Rudnicki and colleagues demonstrated that the Pax7-mediated recruitment of the MLL2-ASH2L-WDR5-RBBP5 complex at the <italic>Myf5</italic> −111 kb and −57 kb enhancers is important for the deposition of H3K4me3 in proximity of the <italic>Myf5</italic> TSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref080">80</xref>]. Similarly, other studies focusing on different Pax family members reported their interaction with the MLL3/4 HMT complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref048">48</xref>]. Our data showed that Pax3-mediated increased chromatin accessibility at the <italic>Myf5</italic> −111 kb enhancer is associated with deposition of H3K4me1. These findings demonstrating that chromatin accessibility is diminished at Pax3 loci in paraxial mesoderm cells from <italic>Pax3</italic>-null E9.5 embryos support an active role for Pax3 in the regulation of chromatin remodeling during development.</p>
<p>Based on our work and other published studies, we hypothesize that the general function of Pax proteins in transcriptional regulation is to initiate chromatin remodeling at their binding sites, which in turn may enable binding of other TFs participating in a given lineage-specific program, as outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000153.g007">Fig 7B</xref> for Pax3 and the myogenic lineage. This model is supported by the following observations: (1) Pax3 cooperates with other TFs to activate the myogenic program, as demonstrated by Six4 and Tead2 knockdown; (2) increased chromatin accessibility is observed at Pax3 sites in mesoderm (both in vitro and in vivo) and in NIH3T3 fibroblasts; (3) deposition of H3K4me1 occurs at Pax3 sites also in nonmyogenic cells, such as NIH3T3, even though these cells cannot differentiate into muscle upon Pax3 induction. Of relevance, the related factors Pax7 and Pax2 regulate chromatin accessibility and H3K4me1 deposition in different cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref081">81</xref>]. Pax7-dependent chromatin remodeling enables T-box 19 (Tpit) binding in pituitary cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref050">50</xref>] and correlates with future MyoD occupancy at a subset of enhancers in myogenic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref045">45</xref>]. Alignment of the protein sequences of different Pax members identifies high conservation at the N-terminal region corresponding to the DNA-binding domains (paired and homeodomain), whereas the C-terminal regions show very little homology. Although this observation suggests that recruitment of the HMT complex might involve its interaction with the Pax DNA-binding domains, we detected no increase in H3K4me1 deposition using a Pax3 mutant lacking the C-terminal region, thus raising the possibility that the interaction between Pax TFs and the HMT complex might require the interaction with both the N terminus and C terminus of the protein. Future studies investigating the structure of the C-terminal region will be instrumental for addressing this open question.</p>

<title>Is Pax3 a pioneer TF?</title>
<p>Our data demonstrate that Pax3 modulates chromatin accessibility and H3K4me1 levels, thus establishing a more favorable landscape for the concerted action of cooperating TFs, such as Six4 and Tead2, in the context of myogenic lineage commitment. These findings are compatible with a pioneering function of Pax3 during skeletal myogenic specification, even though additional data would be required to include Pax3 in this category. A recent study demonstrated that pioneer factor binding differs across cell types and that stable occupancy is likely the result of cooperative interactions with other cell-specific TFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref082">82</xref>]. Accordingly, whereas Pax3 expression in NIH3T3 fibroblasts does not activate the skeletal myogenic program and occupies a different subset of loci compared to EB-derived cells, our experiments in NIH3T3 fibroblasts demonstrate that this TF retains the ability to increase chromatin accessibility at a different subset of loci. Coexpression of Pax3, Runx1, Six1, and other mesodermal TFs in NIH3T3 and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) does not enhance myogenic commitment, and in fact, other investigators have reprogrammed fibroblasts into myogenic cells solely by Myod transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref083">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref084">84</xref>]. Furthermore, in a previous study on Pax7, a closely related Pax gene, we observed that chromatin remodeling occurs primarily at sites depleted of repressive histone marks (trimethylated lysine 27 of histone 3 [H3K27me3] and trimethylated lysine 9 of histone 3 [H3K9me3]; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref045">45</xref>]). Based on these data, we speculate that the chromatin status of the cells may represent the main barrier for the Pax3-mediated conversion of nonmesodermal cells into skeletal myogenic progenitors. This hypothesis is in agreement with the enrichment of the CTCF motif at the sites characterized by increased chromatin accessibility upon Pax3 expression in differentiating ES cells, and it is further supported by the observation that pioneer-resistant Pax7-bound loci in melanotrope cells harbor the CTCF sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref081">81</xref>].</p>
<p>In conclusion, our data provide the first comprehensive analysis of Pax3 function during skeletal myogenesis and demonstrate that Pax3-mediated lineage commitment results from the coordinated modulation of signaling pathways and downstream transcriptional effectors.</p>

Knockdown constructs from the TRC library (pLKO) were obtained from the University of Minnesota Genomic Center (UMGC). pLKO.1-blast-SCRAMBLE was a gift from Keith Mostov (Addgene plasmid #26701 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref085">85</xref>]). To purify cells transduced with the knockdown constructs, all pLKO plasmids were modified by replacing the selection gene (puromycin or blasticidin) with the sequence encoding the EGFP (referred hereafter as pLKO-shRNA-PGK-GFP). pSAM2-Pax3-ires-GFP was obtained by subcloning the murine or human Pax3 sequence into the EcoRI site of the pSAM2-ires-GFP lentiviral vector. pFUGW-rtTA and pSAM2-ires-GFP were previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref086">86</xref>].

<p>Inducible mouse ES cell lines were generated by Cre-loxP mediated recombination of the p2lox targeting plasmids into A2lox-cre mouse ES cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref023">23</xref>]. The recombination cassette, located next to the Hprt gene, contains the Tet-responsive element (TRE) driving the expression of one single copy of cDNA, thus ensuring quasi-physiological expression levels. Pax3-ires-GFP and control Ires-GFP mES cell lines were described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref025">25</xref>]. Inducible PAX3 H9 human ES cells were generated by lentiviral transduction of the pSAM2-PAX3-ires-GFP and pFUGW-rtTA constructs and maintained on Matrigel-coated flasks using mTeSR (Stem Cell Technology). mES cells were maintained on mitotically impaired MEFs in KnockOut DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% FBS (Embryomax ES-qualified FBS [Millipore]), 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Invitrogen), 2 mM GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), 0.1 mM Non-Essential Amino Acids (Invitrogen), 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen), and 1,000 U/ml LIF (Millipore). The myogenic differentiation protocol was previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref087">87</xref>]. Briefly, the ES/MEF cell suspension was preplated in a gelatin-coated dish for 30 minutes in order to remove fibroblasts, and the resulting supernatant (enriched for mES cells) was then diluted to 40,000 cells/ml in EB differentiation medium and incubated in an orbital shaker at 80 RPM. EB differentiation medium was composed of IMDM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% FBS (Embryomax ES-qualified FBS), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), 2 mM GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), and 4.5 mM monothioglycerol (MP biomedicals). For serum-free differentiation, FBS was replaced with an equivalent amount of KnockOut Serum Replacement (Invitrogen). Transgene induction was achieved by adding dox (Sigma-Aldrich) to day 3 EBs cultures (final concentration 1 μg/ml) and then maintained throughout the differentiation protocol by replacing the media (including dox) every 2 days. At day 5, EBs were disaggregated, and single cells were incubated for 20 minutes with PDGFRα-PE, FLK1-APC, and VCAM1-biotin-conjugated antibodies (e-Bioscience) followed by 5 minutes of incubation with Streptavidin-PeCy7. PDGFRα+FLK1− cells were sorted using FACSAria II (BD biosciences) and replated on gelatin-coated dishes using serum or serum-free EB differentiation media supplemented with 1 μg/ml dox and 10 ng/ml mouse basic FGF (bFGF; Preprotech). Except Myf5+dox cells from serum-free cultures, which did not express PDGFRα and were replated as bulk, analysis of myogenic potential for the other TFs was performed in PDGFRα+FLK1− cells. Skeletal myogenic differentiation was assessed in cells cultured 4 days as monolayer by withdrawing bFGF and dox from the cultures (in order to shut down transgene expression) followed by additional 2 days of culture in the same serum or serum-free media. HEK293T, NIH3T3, and Bend3 cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Millipore), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 2 mM GlutaMAX (Invitrogen).</p>
<p>Skeletal myogenic differentiation of H9 iPAX3 ES cells was achieved by plating 10<sup>6</sup> cells in 6 cm nonadherent Petri dishes and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> on a shaker at 60 RPM. After 2 days, mTeSR was replaced with EB Myogenic (EBM) Media supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 and 10 μM GSK3 inhibitor (CHIR990217) (media composition described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref088">88</xref>]). Two days later, media were replaced to remove GSK3 inhibitor, and the formed EBs were plated on gelatin-coated flasks using EBM + 10 ng/ml human bFGF. Twenty-four hours later, cultures were supplemented with 1 μg/ml dox for PAX3 induction. Twenty-four hours later, cells were harvested using trypsin+EDTA solution and FACS sorted based on GFP expression. Sorted cells were collected for RNA extraction. To assess the myogenic commitment upon PAX3 induction, GFP+ cells from H9 iPAX3 differentiating cultures were sorted 4 days post dox supplementation and plated at 1.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per T25 on gelatin-coated flasks using EBM supplemented with 5 ng/ml bFGF, 1 μg/ml dox, and 5 μM ROCK inhibitor (ROCK inhibitor was removed the day after) and cultured as monolayer. At about 90% cell density, cells were passaged using trypsin+EDTA and replated on new gelatin-coated flasks. Terminal differentiation was induced by switching 100% confluent cultures to KOSR differentiation media (KnockOut DMEM + 20% KnockOut Serum Replacement + 1% penicillin/streptomycin + 2 mM GlutaMAX; all products from Gibco).</p>

<title>ChIP and library generation</title>
<p>ChIP was performed following the protocol described by Young and colleagues, with minor modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref089">89</xref>]. D4 EBs (1-day induced and control Pax3 mouse cells) were trypsin-treated at 37°C for 1 minute with gentle shaking, and reaction was inhibited by adding 10% FBS/PBS. One-day induced Pax3 NIH3T3 cells and 6-day induced Pax3 mouse cells growing in monolayer were harvested by incubation with trypsin for 1–2 minutes. Human differentiating PAX3-inducible cells were collected at day 6 of differentiation (following 24-hour dox-mediated induction) by incubation with trypsin for 1–2 minutes. Single cells were washed once with PBS, resuspended in 10% FBS/PBS, and supplemented with formaldehyde (final concentration 1%) for crosslinking of protein-DNA complexes (10 minutes at RT) followed by quenching with glycine and staining with PDGFRα-PE antibody. PDGFRα+ cells were sorted using FACSAria II, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C if not processed immediately. Cell pellets were incubated in lysis buffer LB1 supplemented with protease inhibitors (50 mM HEPES KOH [pH 7.5], 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP40, 0.25% Triton X-100 + complete-mini [Roche]) for 10 minutes at +4°C followed by incubation in buffer LB2 supplemented with protease inhibitors (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8], 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA + complete-mini [Roche]) for 10 minutes at +4°C. Cell pellet was then resuspended in LB3 supplemented with protease inhibitors (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8], 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.1% Sodium Deoxycholate, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine + complete-mini [Roche]) and then sonicated. For H3K4me1, cells were sonicated using Bioruptor Pico (25 cycles 30 seconds ON, 30 seconds OFF) to achieve an average size of 200 bp. For Pax3, cells were sonicated with a Branson sonicator at 18% power for 1 minute with intervals of 10 seconds ON and 10 seconds OFF to achieve an average chromatin size of 300 bp. After shearing, samples were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 16,000<italic>g</italic> and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen if not processed immediately. For histone ChIP, 12 μg of chromatin (diluted to 250 μl) was precleared for 4 hours at 4°C with 10 μl of BSA-blocked Protein A conjugated sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). For Pax3 ChIP, 25–40 μg of chromatin (diluted to 500 μl) was precleared for 4 hours at 4°C with 20 μl of BSA-blocked Protein A (or Protein G) conjugated sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). Samples were supplemented with 1/10 volume of 10% Triton X-100 and incubated overnight with anti-Pax3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-34926) or anti-H3K4me1 (ab8895 [Abcam]) antibodies. Immune complexes were recovered by incubation with 20 μl of BSA-blocked Protein G conjugated sepharose beads for 4 hours at 4°C and then washed 5 times with RIPA wash buffer (50 mM HEPES KOH [pH 7.5], 500 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP40, 0.25% Triton X-100, 0.7% sodium deoxycholate) and 1 time with TEN buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8], 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl). Immunoprecipitated chromatin was recovered by incubating beads with 200 μl of elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8], 10 mM EDTA, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) for 20 minutes at 65°C. Chromatin from IP and Input (equivalent to 1% of starting material) was reverse cross-linked overnight at 65°C, then diluted 1:1 with TE (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8], 1 mM EDTA) supplemented with 4 μl of RNaseA 20 mg/ml, and incubated for 2 hours at 37°C followed by proteinase K treatment (4 μl of 20 mg/ml stock for each sample) for 30 minutes at 55°C. DNA was purified by Phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol extraction (twice) followed by chloroform extraction, then supplemented with 1/10 of volume of 3 M Sodium Acetate (pH 5) and 1.5 μl of glycogen, and precipitated with 2 volumes of 100% ethanol at −80°C for &gt;1 hour. Following 30 minutes of centrifuge at 16,000<italic>g</italic>, pellets were washed with 75% ethanol, air dried, and dissolved in 45 μl H2O. qPCR was performed in a final volume of 10 μl using SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (Clontech), 0.5 μl of 1.4 μM primer stock, and 0.3 μl sample/reaction and run on a 384-well plate on a ABI7900HT instrument (Applied Biosystems).

<p>Libraries were generated following a gel-free protocol using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) for all the purification and size selection steps. DNA (10 ng or less) was end repaired using End-It DNA End Repair (Epicentre) and then A-tailed using Klenow Fragment (3′→5′ exo- NEB) followed by adapter-barcode ligation using T4 DNA ligase (Enzymatics). Illumina-compatible adapter barcodes were purchased from BIOO scientific. After ligation, DNAs were negatively size selected using 0.5x AMPure XP beads, and unbound DNAs were positively size selected by adding 0.4x AMPure XP beads (this step allows for retention of DNA fragments ranging 200–500 bp). Libraries were amplified using Phusion High Fidelity PCR master mix 2x (NEB) with a 16-cycle program. Libraries from iPax3 NIH3T3 cells were generated using the NEBNext DNA library prep kit (NEB). Purified libraries were then submitted to the UMGC for quantification, quality control, and sequencing. Libraries were pooled and sequenced on single-end runs of the HiSeq2500 operated at high-output mode (Illumina). Libraries for Pax3 were sequenced to an average depth of 25 million reads per sample.

Bigwig files for visualization on IGV were generated by converting the wig files obtained from MACS, using the Kent tool Wig-to-BigWig. ATAC-seq reads overlapping to Pax3 peaks were retrieved using the R Bioconductor package and then used to generate density maps with Seqminer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000153.ref100">100</xref>]. To identify differentially accessible peaks, we used the BEDTools intersect function: the common regions (-f 0.5 -F 0.5 -e options) for the dox-induced samples were intersected (-v -f 0.2 options) with the combined list of control peaks (from noninduced cells), and the resulting list was then compared (-f 0.5 -F 0.5 –e options) with the peak list detected in PDGFRα+FLK1− cells from E9.5 embryos. Motif analysis was performed using the MEME suite, but similar results were obtained using the Cistrome tool Seqpos. To generate ATAC-seq heatmaps, peaks associated with specific samples were combined into a single BED file for each set of sample of interest: (1) Msgn1-only, Pax3-only, and Myf5-only peaks in serum-free condition and (2) 1-day-only and 6-day-only in serum condition. The average coverage across all regions in the combined BED files was calculated by BEDTools map for each sample from coverage information in the BEDGRAPH files generated by MACS2.
