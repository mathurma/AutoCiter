Prior studies on co-regulation of metabolic genes have mainly focused on graph-theoretical features of metabolic networks and demonstrated a decreasing level of co-expression with increasing network distance, a naïve, but widely used, topological index. Others have suggested that static graph representations can poorly capture dynamic functional associations, e.g., in the form of dependence of metabolic fluxes across genes in the network. Here, we systematically tested the relative importance of metabolic flux coupling and network position on gene co-regulation, using a genome-scale metabolic model of <italic>Escherichia coli.</italic> After validating the computational method with empirical data on flux correlations, we confirm that genes coupled by their enzymatic fluxes not only show similar expression patterns, but also share transcriptional regulators and frequently reside in the same operon. In contrast, we demonstrate that network distance per se has relatively minor influence on gene co-regulation. Moreover, the type of flux coupling can explain refined properties of the regulatory network that are ignored by simple graph-theoretical indices. Our results underline the importance of studying functional states of cellular networks to define physiologically relevant associations between genes and should stimulate future developments of novel functional genomic tools.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Why do certain genes in a biological network show tight transcriptional co-regulation while others are more or less independently regulated? Prior studies showed that the degree of co-regulation between enzymatic genes decreases with their distance in the metabolic network. However, there are fundamental reasons to suspect that network distance is an incomplete descriptor of functional coherence (hence gene co-regulation), and other, biochemically more relevant measures, have been proposed to capture the functional dependencies between enzymes. We systematically examine whether flux coupling, a biochemically sound and computationally tractable measure of functional interaction between reactions, can better explain gene co-regulation than network distance in the metabolisms of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Escherichia coli</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content>. After validating the flux coupling method using published experimental data on in vivo flux correlations (i.e., coherence of reaction usage), we demonstrate that it not only outperforms metabolic network distance in relation to in vivo flux correlations, but also in explaining transcriptional co-regulation and operonic organization. Future functional genomics studies could benefit from the concept of flux coupling by using it as a basis to test the reliability of computationally predicted functional associations.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement> This work was part of (i) The BioRange programme of The Netherlands Bioinformatics Centre (NBIC), supported by a BSIK grant through The Netherlands Genomics Initiative (NGI); and (ii) The Kluyver Centre for Genomics of Industrial Fermentation.

These studies have revealed important insights into transcriptional regulation by integration of gene co-expression with historically defined modules (e.g., glycolysis) or with graph-theoretical properties of reconstructed networks. Although trends in gene co-regulation with network distance have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b003">3</xref>], it remains unexplained how purely graph-theoretical indices of metabolic networks relate to physiologically relevant functional associations. The widely used, but ad hoc, reasoning that when genes are located close to each other on an interaction map, then they will be functionally associated is intuitively reasonable, and, since topological reconstructions are widely available for many species (e.g., KEGG), it forms the basis for many validations of predicted functional associations in cellular networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b008">8</xref>]. However, there are good reasons to suspect that metabolic network distance per se does not necessarily indicate whether two reactions are used coherently in functional states of the network. For example, all enzymes within a linear pathway might be strongly associated in their function irrespective of their network distances (though their temporal activation patterns can correlate with distance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b009">9</xref>]). Moreover, erroneous predictions of functional associations might arise as paths defined on a metabolic connectivity graph do not necessarily correspond to biochemically relevant pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b010">10</xref>].</p><p>Since the functional state (phenotype) of metabolic networks is best represented by the actual flux distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b012">12</xref>], one might expect that the correlation between reaction fluxes across network states would provide a sound and biochemically relevant measure of functional dependence between enzyme-encoding genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b013">13</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that dynamic functional associations (i.e., correlations) between fluxes, rather than static topological properties of a metabolic network, could capture true functional associations between genes and consequently would provide refined insights into the modes of transcriptional regulation of metabolism. Recently, computationally tractable frameworks have been developed to determine genome-scale functional associations between metabolic genes on the basis of their coherent use of reactions (also referred to as “correlated reaction sets” or “flux coupling”, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040026-g001">Figure 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b016">16</xref>]. Prior studies initialized the integration of gene regulation with flux coupling and concluded that genes with correlated reactions often show signs of co-regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b019">19</xref>]. However, these studies did not explore the regulatory consequences of the differences in the degree of flux coupling. Moreover, it remains unknown to what extent flux dependencies relate to graph-theoretical properties of metabolic networks with respect to gene regulation.</p><fig id="pcbi-0040026-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0040026.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>A Hypothetical Network with Metabolites (Nodes), Reactions (Arrows), and Exchange Reactions (Ex) with the Environment</title><p>Indicated are three types of flux coupling between reactions that are located at distance 1 (directly connected by one node): i) A-B: directionally coupled, ii) B-C: fully coupled, and iii) C-D: uncoupled.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0040026.g001" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>In this study we therefore systematically investigated to what extent (degrees of) flux coupling and network distance, a simple and widely used topological index, relate to co-regulation. Although it might seem intuitively likely that reactions are flux coupled at shorter distances, it is easy to imagine situations where even neighboring reactions carry uncorrelated fluxes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040026-g001">Figure 1</xref>); hence it is important to quantitatively assess the contribution of each factor to gene co-regulation. The well-characterized metabolic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b020">20</xref>] and gene-regulatory networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b021">21</xref>] of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Escherichia coli</named-content> make it an ideal organism to address these issues.

In addition, to confirm the generality of our findings, we extended our study to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content>.

This procedure identifies coupled biochemical reactions in steady-state flux distributions of the network, given a set of environmental constraints (Methods). Metabolic gene pairs were categorized into three different groups: i) <italic>fully coupled</italic>: non-zero flux for one reaction implies a fixed (non-zero) flux for the other reaction and vice versa, ii) <italic>directionally coupled</italic>: the activity of one reaction implies the activity of the other, but not necessarily the reverse. Thus, these reactions are clearly not independent, but may not always operate together (i.e., the flux of one reaction can be zero while the other carries a flux), and iii) <italic>uncoupled</italic>: reactions whose flux ratios can take up any values, hence can operate independently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b014">14</xref>].</p><p>Although phylogenetic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b019">19</xref>] and metabolome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b022">22</xref>] studies suggest that in silico predicted flux coupling relationships have strong physiological and evolutionary relevance, it remains unexamined how well this procedure can explain in vivo flux correlations. For example, is directional coupling a physiologically relevant category in the sense that these reactions show some, but not perfect flux correlations? An experimental study enabled us to calculate flux correlations between 120 reaction pairs over six conditions in the central carbon metabolism of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b023">23</xref>].

Thus, genes with complete correlation in flux behavior undergo more frequently precise co-regulation.

When considering each distance group individually, we still found a significant association between flux coupling and operonic organization at any distance on the metabolic graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040026-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). Moreover, the strength of association, as expressed by Cramer's V, illustrates the importance of flux coupling even when the genes are direct neighbors in the network (V<sub>d=1</sub> = 0.54, V<sub>d=2,3,4</sub> = 0.35 and V<sub>d≥5</sub> = 0.32, where V scales from zero to one). Having demonstrated the importance of flux coupling when controlling for network distance, we next asked if distance has an independent effect by testing the association between operonic organization and distance for each specific type of flux coupling. Although we found a statistically significant association for fully coupled pairs (χ<sup>2</sup> = 27.3, d.f. = 2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−5</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040026-g003">Figure 3</xref>B), the strength of the effect (V = 0.26) is lower compared to those observed for flux coupling. Moreover, no association was detected in the group of directionally coupled pairs, and the association was weak, though statistically significant, for uncoupled ones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0040026-st001">Table S1</xref>).</p><p>How to explain the correlation between network distance and operonic organization for fully coupled gene pairs? The organization of genes into operons is an ongoing evolutionary process with chance events playing potentially important roles, and therefore the composition of operons might not be optimal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b024">24</xref>]. However, non-optimal operonic composition does not automatically imply a negative correlation between the network distance of a gene pair and the probability of both genes residing in the same operon. Thus, although any individual functionally related gene pair might be located in distinct operons simply by chance, our observation that separation into distinct operons depends on metabolic network distance suggests that operonic composition is shaped by selective forces as well. Intuitively, one might argue that at larger distances both genes might simply not fit into the same operon. To explore this possibility, we repeated our analysis with only those fully coupled pairs that are encoded in operons with “non-limiting” sizes. “Non-limiting” operons are defined as those operons that have a size large enough to contain all genes on the shortest path from one gene to the other (e.g., the minimum size of “non-limiting” operons for gene pairs at network distance 2 is three genes). None of the 25 gene pairs that are located in different operons and at a large network distance (i.e., ≥5) were in “non-limiting” operons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0040026-st002">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0040026-st003">S3</xref>), hinting at the possibility that limits on operon size might play a role.</p><p>However, within the set of gene pairs in “non-limiting” operons, we still see an association between network distance and operonic organization for pairs at distance &lt;5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0040026-st003">Table S3</xref>). Thus, structural constraints do not fully explain the separation of genes into different operons at shorter network distances. We speculate that a more likely explanation is that partition of within-pathway genes into multiple operons could allow the temporal fine-tuning of expression patterns in a way that enzymes are not synthesized before needed within a pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b025">25</xref>]. Such a “just-in-time” transcription program has been predicted to be optimal when the system needs to reach production objectives with minimal total enzyme synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b026">26</xref>] and has been supported by experimental studies on amino-acid biosynthetic enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b009">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Transcription Factor Binding Similarity Correlates with Flux Coupling</title><p>As transcription factors (TF) play an important role in the regulation of gene expression, we compared TF co-regulation between the different flux coupling types. We quantified the overlap in TFs upstream of operon pairs (TF similarity) as the number of shared TFs relative to the total number of involved TFs (Methods). As intra-operonic gene pairs show co-regulation by definition, we specifically studied those gene pairs that are encoded in different operons (i.e., inter-operonic) and are controlled by at least one known TF. Moreover, only those operon pairs were selected that contain inter-operonic gene pairs with the same type of flux coupling. We found that fully coupled operon pairs have, on average, higher TF similarities compared to both directionally and uncoupled ones (Wilcox multiple pairwise comparison, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−2</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040026-g004">Figure 4</xref>).

However, given the evidence that the degree of TF-binding similarity correlates with flux coupling, this observation might be intuitively explained by the possibility that uncoupled gene pairs have higher network distances than coupled ones. Uncoupled (inter-operonic) gene pairs are indeed at larger network distances compared to flux coupled pairs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0040026-sg001">Figure S1</xref>A).

However, the degree of co-expression was also associated with flux coupling (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−14</sup>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0040026-sg001">Figure S1</xref>B), a finding not unexpected based on the differences in TF similarities between the different types of flux coupling.</p><p>To unveil which factor (i.e., network distance or flux coupling) is the main determinant of co-expression between metabolic genes, we performed a two-way robust ANOVA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b027">27</xref>]. We found that while flux coupling is a significant main effect (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.003), the effect of network distance is not (<italic>p</italic> = 0.244), and there is an interaction between these two factors (<italic>p</italic> = 0.003) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040026-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). Apparently, the interaction term arises because the degree of co-expression increases with network distance for flux coupled gene pairs (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−4</sup>), but decreases for uncoupled pairs (<italic>p</italic> ≈ 0). Hence, network distance does not explain transcript-level co-expression for inter-operonic flux coupled genes in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content>, and even for uncoupled genes it predicts only weak co-expression for those located close to each other on the metabolic map: uncoupled neighboring (d = 1) gene pairs have an average co-expression of 0.106, which is only slightly, albeit statistically significantly, higher than the 0.039 observed for random pairs (see baseline in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040026-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). The idea that considering flux coupling relationships improves the discrimination of gene sets with different levels of co-expression is further exemplified by our observation that although fully and directionally coupled gene pairs do not differ in terms of overall network distance (<italic>p</italic> = 0.9, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0040026-sg001">Figure S1</xref>A), they differ in co-expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0040026-sg001">Figure S1</xref>B) and TF similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040026-g004">Figure 4</xref>, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−2</sup>). Thus, the type of flux coupling can capture differences in the degree of gene co-regulation that are ignored by network distance.</p><fig id="pcbi-0040026-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0040026.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>The Effect of Flux Coupling and Network Distance on Co-Expression for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> (A) and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> (B)</title><p>(A) The dashed baseline indicates the degree of co-expression between random gene pairs.

Flux coupling and network distance explain 16.8% and 7.3% of the variance in co-expression, respectively (interaction between the two factors explains 3.7%).

Our analysis showed that both flux coupling and network distance are associated with co-expression (two-way ANOVA, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−11</sup>), but flux coupling explains approximately twice as much of the variance in co-expression than network distance (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040026-g005">Figure 5</xref>B for details).</p><p>In summary, our results illustrate that modes of gene co-regulation can be better explained by a biochemically well-grounded flux correlation based measure (flux coupling), than by network distance, even though distance was calculated by excluding highly connected nodes to minimize artificial shortcuts. Network distance, although widely applied, is by no means the only possible topological measure, and therefore further studies should address whether more sophisticated and more robust graph-theoretical measures could provide refined insights into gene co-regulation.</p><p>Furthermore, it should be noted that changes in fluxes are not necessarily caused by changes only at the transcriptional level. Although concerted changes in enzyme levels through transcription may in theory improve metabolite homeostasis during large flux changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b029">29</xref>], experimental studies show that flux changes can arise as a result of specific types of regulation on each individual enzyme in the pathway, (e.g., on the level of metabolite concentrations or on the level of transcription, translation, posttranslational modifications, protein degradation, etc.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b030">30</xref>]. This explains that even for fully coupled gene pairs no strict correlation with transcriptional co-regulation is observed, or could be expected.</p><p>Our work has important implications for comparative genomics and gene function predictions. Since metabolic networks are based on solid biochemical knowledge and are the best-characterized biological networks available for numerous species, the present work paves the way for improved gene association studies in the future. In particular, the concept of flux coupling could form the basis to test the reliability of predicted functional interactions by genomic context or high-throughput functional genomics data. Since benchmarking of predicted gene associations (i.e., set of true-positives) relies in many studies on topological properties of pathways and networks (e.g., being associated to the same KEGG map) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b007">7</xref>], we expect that considering flux coupling would increase the quality of benchmarks and, as a result, prediction accuracy. In a similar vein, the computational prediction of operons could be improved by using flux coupling information instead of historically defined pathway classifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b031">31</xref>]. One potential difficulty in applying flux coupling for functional genomics is that this approach requires a high-quality, extensively curated reconstruction amenable to stoichiometric modeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b032">32</xref>]. In contrast, topological analyses can be applied to networks of lower accuracies, hence to a wider range of organisms. However, the development of improved functional genomic tools with flux coupling should certainly become feasible given the rapidly increasing number of genome-scale metabolic reconstructions and the availability of constraint-based methods to define flux correlations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b016">16</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Flux coupling analysis.</title><p>To analyze functional (physiological) associations between genes within the genome-scale metabolic network of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> K12 (<italic>i</italic>JR904 GSM/GPR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b020">20</xref>], we applied the previously developed flux coupling finder procedure (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0040026-sd001">Dataset S1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b014">14</xref>]. This constraint-based modeling approach relies on minimization and maximization of the flux ratios to determine the extent of dependency between any two reactions within the network given mass-balance constraints and boundary constraints (exchange fluxes with the environment). In general, the flux through one of the two reactions is fixed by a unit value while the flux through the other reaction is maximized and minimized (allowing for linear optimization, see Burgard et al. for details).</p><p>We distinguished three main types of flux coupling relationships between reaction pairs (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040026-g001">Figure 1</xref>): i) <italic>fully coupled</italic>: the activity of one reaction fixes the activity of the other and vice versa (i.e., complete correlation by equal minimum and maximum flux ratios); ii) <italic>directionally coupled</italic>: the activity of one reaction implies the activity of the other, but not necessarily the reverse—these reactions are not independent, but may not always operate together (i.e., the flux through one reaction can be zero while the other carries a flux); and iii) <italic>uncoupled</italic>: the activity of one reaction does not imply the activity of the other and vice versa (i.e., their flux ratio can vary from zero to infinity, indicating that the reactions are not (likely) to operate together). Calculations were run without assuming a constant biomass composition to avoid coupling of a large set of fluxes to the biomass reaction (thus all biomass components were allowed to be drained independently of one another) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b014">14</xref>]. Coupled reaction pairs were identified under a condition where all external nutrients were allowed for uptake and secretion (i.e., fewest constraints) except for the case where flux coupling was compared to empirical flux correlations. In the latter case a minimal glucose medium was simulated to mimic the experimental settings of Emmerling et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b023">23</xref>] where fluxes were measured in a wild-type and a mutant <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> strain under two carbon-limited and one nitrogen-limited growth conditions, corresponding to six experimental setups (note: the same set of nutrients were available for uptake in all six conditions).</p><p>Duplicated genes or isoenzymes can give rise to ambiguous relationships between genes and reactions when considering regulatory information. For example, duplicates might be differentially regulated, although their gene products have the same molecular function (i.e., catalysis of the same reaction). We therefore considered reaction pairs that are not associated to isoenzymes to achieve optimal sensitivity for analyzing gene co-regulation among different flux coupling types (and network distance, see below). Furthermore, multiple reaction pairs correspond to the same gene pair when a single gene is associated to more than one reaction. In those cases, we investigated flux coupling of all reaction pairs, but we assigned one type of coupling to the gene pair in the following hierarchical order: fully, directionally, and uncoupled (e.g., if one of the reaction pairs was fully coupled, we considered the corresponding gene pair to be fully coupled irrespective of the other associated reaction pairs).</p><p>A similar procedure was applied to the iLL672 reconstruction of the yeast metabolic network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b028">28</xref>] to identify flux coupled gene pairs in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0040026-sd001">Dataset S1</xref>), with the main difference that we also found partially coupled gene pairs in this network. Partial coupling can be considered as a form of coherent reaction usage with the activity of one reaction implying the activity of the other and vice versa (without, however, a fixed flux ratio between the two reactions) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040026-b014">14</xref>]. We therefore grouped fully and partially coupled pairs.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Network distance.</title><p>In order to calculate the network distance between genes within the genome-scale metabolic networks of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content>, we represented the networks as connectivity graphs consisting of nodes (metabolites) and edges (reactions). Subsequently, we calculated the network distance between any two reactions in the network by a shortest path algorithm based on the connectivity of the nodes. In such a way the distance is defined as the minimal number of metabolites that separates any two reactions in the network. Moreover, information on reversibility and irreversibility of reactions was considered in calculating the shortest paths. Nevertheless, we note that treating all reactions as reversible in order to minimize the number of reaction pairs that are unreachable gives qualitatively the same results (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0040026-st004">Tables S4</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0040026-st007">S7</xref>).</p><p>The existence of highly connected nodes (such as cofactors) can cause artificial shortcuts in the paths, resulting in biochemically infeasible paths.
