                <p>Accurate genome-wide identification of orthologs is a central problem in
                    comparative genomics, a fact reflected by the numerous orthology identification
                    projects developed in recent years. However, only a few reports have compared
                    their accuracy, and indeed, several recent efforts have not yet been
                    systematically evaluated. Furthermore, orthology is typically only assessed in
                    terms of function conservation, despite the phylogeny-based original definition
                    of Fitch. We collected and mapped the results of nine leading orthology projects
                    and methods (COG, KOG, Inparanoid, OrthoMCL, Ensembl Compara, Homologene,
                    RoundUp, EggNOG, and OMA) and two standard methods (bidirectional best-hit and
                    reciprocal smallest distance). We systematically compared their predictions with
                    respect to both phylogeny and function, using six different tests. This required
                    the mapping of millions of sequences, the handling of hundreds of millions of
                    predicted pairs of orthologs, and the computation of tens of thousands of trees.
                    In phylogenetic analysis or in functional analysis where high specificity is
                    required, we find that OMA and Homologene perform best. At lower functional
                    specificity but higher coverage level, OrthoMCL outperforms Ensembl Compara, and
                    to a lesser extent Inparanoid. Lastly, the large coverage of the recent EggNOG
                    can be of interest to build broad functional grouping, but the method is not
                    specific enough for phylogenetic or detailed function analyses. In terms of
                    general methodology, we observe that the more sophisticated tree
                    reconstruction/reconciliation approach of Ensembl Compara was at times
                    outperformed by pairwise comparison approaches, even in phylogenetic tests.
                    Furthermore, we show that standard bidirectional best-hit often outperforms
                    projects with more complex algorithms. First, the present study provides
                    guidance for the broad community of orthology data users as to which database
                    best suits their needs. Second, it introduces new methodology to verify
                    orthology. And third, it sets performance standards for current and future
                    approaches.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>The identification of orthologs, pairs of homologous genes in different species
                    that started diverging through speciation events, is a central problem in
                    genomics with applications in many research areas, including comparative
                    genomics, phylogenetics, protein function annotation, and genome rearrangement.
                    An increasing number of projects aim at inferring orthologs from complete
                    genomes, but little is known about their relative accuracy or coverage. Because
                    the exact evolutionary history of entire genomes remains largely unknown,
                    predictions can only be validated indirectly, that is, in the context of the
                    different applications of orthology. The few comparison studies published so far
                    have asssessed orthology exclusively from the expectation that orthologs have
                    conserved protein function. In the present work, we introduce methodology to
                    verify orthology in terms of phylogeny and perform a comprehensive comparison of
                    nine leading ortholog inference projects and two methods using both phylogenetic
                    and functional tests. The results show large variations among the different
                    projects in terms of performances, which indicates that the choice of orthology
                    database can have a strong impact on any downstream analysis.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>The identification of orthologs is an important problem in the field of comparative
                genomics. Many studies, such as gene function prediction, phylogenetic analyses, and
                genomics context analyses, depend on accurate predictions of orthology. A large
                variety of methods for predicting orthologs and the resulting databases have
                appeared in recent years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Tatusov1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Jensen1">[8]</xref>. But although the
                accuracy of the predictions highly impacts any downstream analyses, there are only
                few comparative studies of the quality of the different prediction algorithms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Hulsen1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Chen1">[10]</xref>. This
                paucity can be attributed to at least three major challenges. The first challenge
                resides in the multiple and sometimes intrinsically conflicting definitions of
                orthology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Ouzounis1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Jensen2">[13]</xref>. The original
                definition of Fitch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Fitch2">[14]</xref> is based on the evolutionary history of genes:
                two genes are orthologs if they diverged through a speciation event. On the other
                hand, given that orthologs often have similar function, many people uses the term
                orthologs to refer to genes with conserved function. Yet another definition is used
                in some studies of genome rearrangement, in which the ortholog refers, in the event
                of a duplication, to the “original” sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Marron1">[15]</xref>, which
                remains in its genomic context.</p>
            <p>The second challenge resides in the difficulty of validating the predictions. Take
                the case of phylogenetic orthology. Gene tree inference can be a notoriously
                difficult task, but it is usually precisely in difficult cases that the performances
                of methods can be differentiated. Indeed, in simple cases, most methods perform
                equally well. Validation of the definition based on function is not easier:
                orthology is in this context arguably <italic>impossible</italic> to verify because
                there is no universally applicable, unequivocal definition of conserved function,
                that is, the required similarity in terms of regulation, chemical activity,
                interaction partners, etc. for two genes to qualify as orthologs often varies across
                studies. For instance, in some wet lab experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Azevedo1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Elliott1">[17]</xref>, two genes are only
                considered orthologs if they have the ability to complement each other's
                function.</p>
            <p>The third challenge is of practical nature: to compare the different orthology
                inference projects, their methods must either be replicated on a common set of data,
                or the results produced by the different databases must be mapped to each other for
                comparison. Replication is not always possible, because some projects depend on
                human curation, or are not documented in detail. Mapping data is complicated by the
                lack of homogeneity in the sources of genomic data used by the different projects.
                The resulting intersection sets are often relatively small and may not be
                representative.</p>
            <p>In the present article, we provide an in-depth comparison of the prediction from 11
                major projects, including OMA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Dessimoz1">[4]</xref>, our own orthology inference effort. We try to
                address the aforementioned challenges by testing phylogenetic and functional
                definitions of orthologs, using a variety of tests. We took the approach of
                comparing the inferred orthologs available from the different projects, which
                required mapping the data between projects. The rest of this introduction provides a
                description of the projects retained here, a review on the representation of
                orthology in those projects so to provide a common basis for comparison, and
                finally, some words on our sequence mapping strategy.</p>
            <sec id="s1a">
                <title>Projects under Scrutiny</title>
                <p>In this study, we consider publicly available databases of orthologs that
                    distinguish themselves by popularity, size, quality, or methodology. One of the
                    oldest large-scale orthology database is COG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Tatusov1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Tatusov2">[18]</xref>
                    and its eukaryotic equivalent KOG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Tatusov2">[18]</xref>, which despite no
                    recent update are still considered by many authors as the standard orthologs
                    databases. Their reliance on manual curation make them not scalable to all
                    complete genomes. Unsupervised orthology assignment requires more sophisticated
                    algorithms, such as those of Inparanoid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Remm1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Berglund1">[19]</xref>, OrthoMCL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Li1">[3]</xref> or
                    EggNOG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Jensen1">[8]</xref>. We also investigated the results of RoundUp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-DeLuca1">[5]</xref>,
                    interesting for its relatively large size and its use of pairwise evolutionary
                    distances between genes to detect orthology. OMA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Dessimoz1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Roth1">[20]</xref>, our
                    own orthology assignment project, is also based on evolutionary distances but
                    takes into account the variance of the distance estimates and try to exclude
                    pseudo-orthologs arising from differential gene losses using third-party
                    species. A very different approach is taken in the orthology prediction of
                    Ensembl Compara<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Hubbard1">[7]</xref>, which is based on inference and
                    reconciliation of gene and species trees. Homologene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Wheeler1">[6]</xref> uses a pairwise
                    gene comparison approach combined with a guide tree and gene neighborhood
                    conservation to group orthologs, but the details of their methodology are
                    unpublished. Finally, we also compare the results to the standard approaches of
                    bidirectional best-hits (BBH) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Overbeek1">[21]</xref>, common in ad-hoc analyses, and reciprocal
                    smallest distance (RSD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Wall1">[22]</xref>. The size of the different projects is

                <title>Grouping of Orthologs</title>
                <p>Orthology is a relation over pairs of genes. However, few projects (namely
                    Ensembl Compara, OMA and RoundUp) explicitly provide output of all pairs of
                    predicted orthologs. This representation, although precise, has practical
                    drawbacks: on one hand, it scales poorly (quadratically with the number of genes
                    analyzed), and on the other hand, it does not present the predictions in a
                    particularly insightful way. To solve these issues, many projects cluster pairs
                    of orthologs into groups. This grouping process is not trivial, because
                    orthology, at least when the phylogeny-based definition applies, is a
                    non-transitive relation.</p>
                <p>The most common approach (taken by all other projects) is to form groups of
                    orthologs and “in-paralogs”. The relations in- and
                    out-paralogs were defined by Remm <italic>et al.</italic>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Remm1">[2]</xref>, and
                    are used to distinguish between paralogs from recent and old duplication events
                    respectively. Formally, these two relations are not defined over a pair, but
                    over a triplet: two genes and a speciation event of reference. Two genes are
                    in-paralogs with respect to a particular speciation event if they are paralogs
                        <italic>and</italic> their duplication event occurred after that speciation
                    event of reference. They are out-paralogs if they are paralogs
                    <italic>and</italic> their duplication event occurred before the speciation
                    event of reference. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000262.s013">Figure S1a</xref> in <italic>Supporting
                    Information</italic> for an example. Unfortunately, the fact that in- and
                    out-paralogy are ill-defined in the absence of a clear speciation event of
                    reference is underappreciated in the literature. We now come back to the
                    description of groups of orthologs and in-paralogs: such groups are constructed
                    such that every pair of genes in the group is either orthologous or
                    in-paralogous with respect to the last speciation event in their clade, that is,
                    such in-paralogs are genes inside the same species resulting from a duplication
                    event that occurred <italic>after</italic> all speciation. Consequently, in such
                    groups, the implication is that gene pairs are orthologs if they belong to the
                    different species, else they are paralogs. Note that this grouping approach
                    shows its limits when one or several duplication events have occurred after the
                    first, but before the last speciation events. In such cases, not uncommon in
                    Eukaryotes, the non-transitive nature of orthology makes it impossible to
                    partition all genes in such groups without losing orthologous relations (see
                        <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000262.s013">Figure
                    S1b</xref> for an example). In OMA for instance, groups of orthologs include
                    less than half of all predicted pairwise orthologous relations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000262.s015">Table S1</xref>).
                    This problem does not affect Inparanoid, because it provides predictions for
                    each pair of species separately, and so in every case, there is only one
                    speciation event.</p>

                <p>To perform a fair comparison of the different predictions, a common set of
                    sequences must be established. Unfortunately, the different projects vary
                    considerably in their sizes, the type of genome analyzed and the origin of the
                    protein sequences used. In fact, some projects have no overlap at all, and
                    therefore comparison on a common set of sequences for all projects is not
                    possible. Instead, we performed pairwise project comparisons with OMA (which
                    includes the largest amount of sequences), and then we repeated the tests on an

                <p>First, sequences from the different projects were mapped to OMA's only

                <p>According to the phylogenetic definition, two homologous genes are orthologs if
                    they diverged through a speciation event. Therefore, the phylogenetic tree of a
                    set of orthologs (a set of genes in which any pair is orthologous) has by

                    <p>We reconstructed gene trees from species with an accepted phylogeny and
                        predicted orthologs from the different projects using two independent
                        methods and software packages (distance-trees from Smith-Waterman pairwise
                        alignments and ML trees from multiple sequence alignments), and compared the
                        congruence of the resulting trees with the species trees using the fraction
                        of correct splits, which is defined as one minus the Robinson-Foulds (RF)
                        split distance measure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Robinson1">[23]</xref>. The RF distance is defined as the
                        normalized count of the bipartitions induced by one tree, but not by the
                        other. The experiment was performed on sets of bacteria, of eukaryotes and
                        of fungi. Note that this test can only verify the correctness of the
                        reported orthologs (the specificity) for each project, but not the
                        false-negative rate (the sensitivity).</p>
                    <p>Though some level of incongruence is expected from errors in the input data
                        or in the tree reconstruction, these perturbations affect, on average, all
                        methods equally. Results for ML trees are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000262-g002">Figure 2</xref> while distance trees are
                        presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000262.s014">Figure S2</xref> in <italic>Supporting Information</italic>. As a first
                        observation, it is comforting to see that the choice of tree reconstruction
                        method does not affect the ranking or the significance of the results. It
                        appears that COG, EggNOG and OrthoMCL suffer from comparatively high
                        false-positive rates, which is reflected in the significantly reduced amount
                        of correctly reconstructed gene trees. The high-level of non-orthology in
                        the COGs database is consistent with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Dessimoz2">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-vanderHeijden1">[25]</xref>. The differences among the better performing
                        projects are small. The predictions of Ensembl Compara, being made on the
                        basis of tree reconciliation, could have been expected to perform better
                        than pairwise gene comparison methods, but their predictions are in fact
                        slightly worse than OMA in this test. The generic BBH and RSD methods are
                        also dominated by OMA in the pairwise comparison. Note that the intersection
                        set is not large enough to allow the ranking of the best performing projects
                        (OMA, RoundUp, Homologene, Inparanoid). Finally, KOG covers too few genomes
                        for inclusion in this test.</p>

                        sign of excessive clustering. It also appears that the relatively higher

                        true-positive rate. Ensembl and RoundUp report fewer orthologs, but the

                <title>Function-Based Definition</title>
                <p>One of the main application of orthology is the propagation of functional
                    annotation, because orthologs often have a similar function. In fact, this
                    application is so prominent that many authors use the term
                    “orthologs” to refer to genes with conserved function in
                    different species. As mentioned in the introduction, this definition is

                    terms of gene ontology annotations, enzyme classification numbers, expression

                    <p>In the first test, we assessed the agreement in gene ontology (GO)
                        annotations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Harris1">[28]</xref> between predicted orthologs, only
                        considering annotations with experimental support (Evidence codes IDA, IEP,
                        IGI, IMP and IPI). Indeed, annotation obtained automatically are for the
                        most part done using the methods that we are testing here: inclusion of this
                        information would cause a serious circular dependency. We measure the level
                        of conservation in terms of GO annotation using the similarity measure
                        developed by Lin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Lin1">[29]</xref> which computes for a pair of terms a
                        score between 0 (unrelated) and 1 (identical terms) using the hierarchical
                        structure of the GO terms and their frequencies.</p>
                    <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000262-g004">Figure 4A</xref> shows the
                        average similarity of GO annotations in pairs of orthologs from the
                        different projects. The mean similarity of all projects falls in a
                        relatively small range, and is quite low. COG/KOG/EggNOG do comparatively
                        many predictions, but the average similarity score is significantly lower.
                        Hence, the results of COG/KOG/EggNOG are particularly suited for
                        coarse-grained functional classification. On the other hand, if a high
                        functional similarity is desired, the relatively simple BBH approach
                        dominates more sophisticated algorithms such as RoundUp and Homologene
                        (which does fewer predictions at same degree of similarity) or OMA (which
                        does only few more predictions, but significantly lower degree of
                        similarity). This result suggests that sequence similarity is a stronger
                        predictor of functional relatedness than the evolutionary history of the
                        genes. At mid specificity level, OrthoMCL outperforms Ensembl Compara and
                        Inparanoid, yielding many more predictions at roughly the same similarity
                        level.</p>

                    <p>A second measure for the quality of the orthologous assignments with respect
                        to function can be obtained from the enzyme classification numbers (EC),
                        which strictly depend on the chemical reaction they catalyze. Thus, we could
                        expect in general that orthologous enzymes have identical EC number.
                        Obviously, this test can only be applied to the small and rather specific
                        fraction of genes that are enzymes. The results must be interpreted
                        accordingly. As reference, we use the EC database curated by the Swiss-Prot
                        group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Bairoch1">[30]</xref>. Their annotation is a semi-supervised
                        procedure that mainly relies on sequence similarity (Kristian B Axelsen,
                        personal communication). As such, this test is less reliable than the GO
                        one, which is based on fully orthogonal data, but we believe that it has
                        enough informative value to warrant inclusion here.</p>

                        annotations test, but BBH is not as good, and Inparanoid has now moved to
                        the Pareto frontier, i.e. it is not dominated by OrthoMCL here.</p>

                    <title>Correlation in expression profiles</title>
                    <p>In this third test, conserved function is assessed using protein expression
                        profiles from large-throughput experiments. In such data, proteins with
                        similar function are expected to have similar expression profiles. We
                        measured this similarity by computing the average correlation between the
                        expression profiles of putative orthologs between the human and mouse
                        genomes as presented by Liao and Zhang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Liao1">[31]</xref>. Some projects,
                        such as COG and KOG did not have sufficient mappable proteins in those
                        genomes to be considered here. Although certainly relevant for many
                        researchers, Human–Mouse orthologs hardly constitute a
                        representative sample of all orthologs, and thus here too their assessment
                        should be extrapolated to all predictions with prudence.</p>
                    <p>The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000262-g004">Figure
                            4C</xref>. In general, the correlations found are relatively low and
                        within a narrow band. This range is however consistent with the results of
                        Liao and Zhang. Most projects perform very similarly, with average
                        correlation mostly within 2 standard deviations and number of predicted
                        orthologs differing by less than 10%. Predictions by OrthoMCL
                        have significantly lower average expression correlation, but in absolute
                        terms, the difference is modest, and they have a significantly higher number
                        of predictions. Finally, with 40 times more predictions but almost no
                        correlation in terms of expression, EggNOG does not appear to provide useful
                        information to propagate expression levels.</p>

                    <p>To assess the quality of the ortholog assignments on the basis of genome
                        structure, conservation of the gene arrangement on the chromosomes has been
                        used to validate functional orthology in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Hulsen1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-vanderHeijden1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Notebaart1">[32]</xref>. Conservation of the genomic context is
                        indeed a strong indicator of function conservation. Note that gene
                        neighborhood conservation is not a reliable indicator of phylogenetic
                        orthology: not only speciation, but also duplication of DNA segments
                        stretching over more than a single gene, such as operons, preserve the

                <title>About Absent Tests</title>
                <p>We now justify the absence of three other tests that have been previously
                    reported in the literature. We did not verify orthology based on common keywords
                    in the annotation because those are often assigned on the basis of sequence
                    similarity or using the methods that are tested here: this would introduce
                    circularity in the testing strategy. Nor do we test orthology based on
                    conservation in protein-protein interaction (PPI). Though there are studies such
                    as Bandyopadhyay <italic>et al.</italic>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Bandyopadhyay1">[33]</xref> reporting modest but measurably higher PPI
                    between some orthologs, it remains unclear to us how current PPI data can be
                    turn into a test of orthology for the following two reasons: first, PPI data
                    show large variations in reliability and completeness across experiments and
                    species, but more importantly, the general problem of matching (or
                    “aligning”) networks is computationally hard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Dost1">[34]</xref>. To
                    reduce complexity, most approaches, including Bandyopadhyay <italic>et al.</italic>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Bandyopadhyay1">[33]</xref>, strongly constrain the network alignment using
                    heuristics based on sequence similarity. In the present context, this too would
                    introduce circularity in the validation. Finally, we do not use the latent class
                    analysis approach of Chen <italic>et al.</italic>

                    This approach computes maximum likelihood estimates of false-positive and
                    false-negative rates for all the projects directly from the various ortholog
                    predictions (the data) and a parameterized multivariate distribution of the
                    errors (the model). This looks very attractive, because the assessment does not
                    require any of the external information used in the tests described here. Our
                    critique with this approach is that their results are conditional on their error
                    model, which is not verified (at least not in the context of evaluating
                    orthology inference projects). In a sense, the issue of validation is shifted to
                    their error model, but remains open.</p>

                    reference set of orthologs, expression correlation and conservation of gene

                    overwhelming majority (89.1%) of all orthologous pairs predicted by
                    Inparanoid on Human–Worm data arise from one large cluster of
                    olfactory-type receptor proteins (cluster number 4604). This very atypical
                    distribution explains why the results are so different from those for the
                    HUMAN-MOUSE genome pair (see Figures 3 and 4

                <p>They concluded that in terms of functional orthology, Inparanoid performed best
                    overall, while also noting that the appropriate method depends on the

                    results show, this trade-off remains true today, but Inparanoid is no longer the
                    overall best performer: besides being one of the projects with fewest genomes
                    under analysis, there are other projects with either higher specificity, or with
                    higher sensitivity; this reduces the scope of applications in which it

                <title>Conclusions</title>
                <p>Accurate ortholog prediction is crucial for many applications ranging from
                    protein annotation to phylogenetic analysis. There is a number of publicly
                    available orthology databases but little is known about their performances. In
                    this study we compared 11 different projects and methods by submitting them to a
                    variety of tests with respect to both phylogenetic and functional definitions of
                    orthology.</p>
                <p>The results obtained in the tests for both definitions are consistent, and allow
                    us comparison of the different projects on an objective basis.</p>
                <p>In phylogenetic tests, OMA and Homologene showed the best performances. The same
                    two projects do also best in functional tests if a high level of specificity is
                    required. At a somewhat lower degree of specificity, but at a higher coverage,
                    function-based tests suggest that OrthoMCL outperforms Ensembl Compara, and to a
                    less extent Inparanoid. Finally, for applications that only require
                    coarse-grained functional categories, EggNOG provides the largest coverage.</p>
                <p>In terms of methodology, the one project based on gene and species tree
                    reconciliation, Ensembl, had overall decent performances, but was overperformed
                    by some of the best pairwise approaches. This suggests that tree reconciliation,
                    although more powerful a method in theory, is not necessarily the best method in
                    practice. Another surprise is the good overall performance of the simple BBH
                    approach. Although the method is restricted to 1:1 orthologs, the derived
                    relations show good comparative accuracy in terms of Fitch's
                    definition. Orthologs predicted by BBH also show close functional relatedness.
                    This result probably explains why many people use ad-hoc BBH implementations for
                    their analyses rather than a more sophisticated orthology method.</p>
                <p>Beyond the accuracy aspects discussed in the present work, other factors will
                    also affect the choice of orthologs database, such as the number of genomes
                    analyzed, the state of maintenance, the availability of the predictions, or the
                    usability of the web-interface.</p>
                <p>There is still improvement potential in orthology inference, and we expect much
                    development in the coming years. We hope that the present work helps setting
                    performances standards. But it is also the responsibility of upcoming orthology
                    assignment projects or releases to clearly state the definition of orthology
                    they pursue, to explain their grouping strategy, and in the very least to
                    demonstrate the improvement of their methods over basic methods such as BBH or
                    RSD.</p>

                <title>Phylogenetic Reconstruction Test</title>
                <p>A consequence of Fitch's definition is that trees of orthologs are
                    congruent to the species tree (i.e. the topology, or branching order, is the
                    same). The phylogenetic reconstruction test uses this property to test the
                    predicted orthologs. It uses three reference species trees (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000262.s017">Text S1</xref> in
                        <italic>Supporting Information</italic>) whose branching order is
                    well-accepted, and whose topology follows a “comb”
                    structure, that is, completely unbalanced. Each leaf consists of one or several
                    species. The phylogeny of species that share the same leaf is not necessarily
                    well resolved, but this fact is irrelevant here, because, as we shall see below,
                    the test includes at most one sequence per leaf in each tree reconstructed.
                    Including more than one species per leaf is merely a way to include more data in
                    the test. The eukaryotic reference tree follows the NCBI taxonomy, the bacterial
                    one follows the lineage tree by Bern <italic>et al.</italic>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Bern1">[36]</xref> and
                    the fungal reference tree follows the NCBI tree, but with correction regarding
                    the placement of the two <italic>Candida</italic> species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Wong1">[37]</xref>.</p>
                <p>In each trial, a starting sequence from a random species in the innermost leaf is
                    randomly chosen. Then, for each project under scrutiny, we try to build a set of
                    sequences consisting of one ortholog per leaf. If a project predicts more than
                    one sequence orthologous to the starting sequence in a leaf, one of them is
                    picked randomly. If a project predicts no ortholog in a particular leaf,
                    sequence from that leaf are excluded from other projects as well, such that the
                    resulting sets of sequences are of the same size for all projects. If the
                    orthologous groups have less than 5 sequences, the procedure restarts with
                    another starting sequence. Else, based on each orthologous set, we build a tree
                    (as described below) and assess its agreement with the reference species tree by
                    computing the fraction of correct splits derived from the Robinson-Foulds metric
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000262-Robinson1">[23]</xref>.</p>
                <p>The “comb” structure of the topology is necessary to ensure
                    that a set of sequences orthologous to a starting sequence indeed constitutes an
                    orthologous groups (that is, a set of sequences in which every pair is
                    orthologous): recall that two sequences are orthologs if they split through
                    speciation. Thus, if all bifurcations in the gene trees are speciation events,
                    the set of sequences constitute an orthologous group. Due to the particular
                    topology, each bifurcation is the split of the innermost sequence from another
                    sequence. Since the innermost sequence is orthologous to all other sequences,
                    all bifurcations are speciation events, and the conclusion follows.</p>

                    protein pair where both proteins are present in the common set of sequences, we
                    determined whether the project made a true positive, a true negative, a

                    <title>Gene neighborhood conservation</title>
                    <p>The conservation of gene order is measured in the following way. We use the
                        coding sequence features (CDS) from OMA's genome sources (mainly
                        Ensembl, Genome Reviews and EMBL) to determine the order of the genes in the
                        genome. Overlapping genes are excluded, as the order is not resolved. For
                        every predicted orthologous protein pair, we check whether their directly
                        adjacent neighbors (if present) are orthologous too. The verification is
                        performed using the union of all predictions. This ensures that projects
                        with many ortholog predictions are not advantaged over more stringent ones.
                        Whenever we find at least one of the four possible neighbor configurations
                        in the union, we conclude that the neighborhood is conserved.</p>

                        the present analysis, the fact that a distance-based method reconstructed on
                        average more accurately eukaryotic trees than an ML method goes against the
                        common belief that ML tree building is the more accurate tree reconstruction
                        method. This could be the subject of further investigation.</p>
