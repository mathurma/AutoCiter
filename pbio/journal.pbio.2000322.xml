<abstract>
<p>Plant gas exchange is regulated by guard cells that form stomatal pores. Stomatal adjustments are crucial for plant survival; they regulate uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> for photosynthesis, loss of water, and entrance of air pollutants such as ozone. We mapped ozone hypersensitivity, more open stomata, and stomatal CO<sub>2</sub>-insensitivity phenotypes of the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> accession Cvi-0 to a single amino acid substitution in MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN (MAP) KINASE 12 (MPK12). In parallel, we showed that stomatal CO<sub>2</sub>-insensitivity phenotypes of a mutant <italic>cis</italic> (CO<sub>2</sub>-insensitive) were caused by a deletion of <italic>MPK12</italic>. Lack of MPK12 impaired bicarbonate-induced activation of S-type anion channels. We demonstrated that MPK12 interacted with the protein kinase HIGH LEAF TEMPERATURE 1 (HT1)—a central node in guard cell CO<sub>2</sub> signaling—and that MPK12 functions as an inhibitor of HT1. These data provide a new function for plant MPKs as protein kinase inhibitors and suggest a mechanism through which guard cell CO<sub>2</sub> signaling controls plant water management.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Human activities have increased the concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> and harmful air pollutants such as ozone in the troposphere. These changes can have detrimental consequences for agricultural productivity. Guard cells, which form stomatal pores on leaves, regulate plant gas exchange. To maintain photosynthesis, stomata open to allow CO<sub>2</sub> uptake, but at the same time, open stomata lead to loss of water and allow the entrance of ozone. Elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels reduce stomatal apertures, which can improve plant water balance but also increases leaf temperature. Using genetic approaches—in which we exploit natural variation and mutant analysis of thale cress (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)—we find that MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 12 (MPK12) and its inhibitory interaction with another kinase, HIGH LEAF TEMPERATURE 1 (HT1) (involved in guard cell CO<sub>2</sub> signaling), play a key role in this regulatory process. We have therefore identified a mechanism in which guard cell CO<sub>2</sub> signaling regulates how efficiently plants use water and cope with the air pollutant ozone.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Human activities have increased the concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> and harmful air pollutants such as ozone in the troposphere. During the last 200 y, the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration has increased from 280 to 400 ppm, and it is predicted to double relative to the preindustrial level by 2050 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref001">1</xref>]. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> is likely to have complex effects on plant productivity, since CO<sub>2</sub> is not only a driver of climate change but also the main substrate for photosynthesis. Altered atmospheric chemistry is not limited to CO<sub>2;</sub> the concentration of tropospheric ozone has more than doubled within the past 100 y [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref002">2</xref>]. Ozone is a notorious air pollutant causing severe damage to crops; present day global yield reductions caused by ozone range from 8.5%–14% for soybean, 3.9%–15% for wheat, and 2.2%–5.5% for maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref003">3</xref>]. Both CO<sub>2</sub> and ozone enter the plant through stomata—small pores on the surfaces of plants that are formed by pairs of guard cells. Guard cells also regulate plant water balance since plants with more open stomata allow faster water evaporation. Water availability is the most limiting factor for agricultural production, and insufficient water supply can cause large reductions in crop yields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref004">4</xref>]. Thus, plants are constantly facing a dilemma; assimilation of CO<sub>2</sub> requires stomatal opening but also opens the gates for entrance of harmful air pollutants and leads to excessive water loss. A consequence of increased atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration can be higher biomass production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref005">5</xref>], but at the same time, plants adjust to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> by partial closure of stomata [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref006">6</xref>] and expressing an altered developmental program that leads to reduced stomatal number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref007">7</xref>]. CO<sub>2</sub>-induced stomatal closure reduces water loss; hence, it can directly modify plant water use efficiency (WUE)—carbon assimilated through photosynthesis versus water lost through stomata.</p>
<p>Natural variation among <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> accessions provides a rich genetic resource for addressing plant function and adaptation to diverse environmental conditions. The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accession Cvi-0 from the Cape Verde Islands has impaired CO<sub>2</sub> responses, more open stomata than Col-0, and is extremely sensitive to ozone treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref009">9</xref>]. A single amino acid change in Cvi-0 MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 12 (MPK12) was recently shown to affect water use efficiency as well as stomatal size and to impair abscisic acid (ABA)-induced inhibition of stomatal opening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref010">10</xref>]. MPK12 also regulates auxin signaling in roots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref011">11</xref>]. However, the involvement of MPK12 in the CO<sub>2</sub> signaling pathway in guard cells has not been addressed thus far.</p>
<p>Among the important components of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> guard cell CO<sub>2</sub> signaling are carbonic anhydrases (βCA1 and βCA4) that catalyze the conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to bicarbonate and the protein kinase HIGH LEAF TEMPERATURE 1 (HT1) that has been suggested to function as a negative regulator of CO<sub>2</sub>-induced stomatal movements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref013">13</xref>]. Ultimately, for stomata to close, a signal from the bicarbonate has to activate protein kinases such as OPEN STOMATA 1 (OST1) that in turn activate plasma membrane anion channels, including SLOW ANION CHANNEL 1 (SLAC1), followed by extrusion of ions and water that causes stomatal closure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref017">17</xref>]. Isolation of a dominant <italic>HT1</italic> allele, <italic>ht1-8D</italic>, revealed that HT1 may directly inhibit OST1- and GUARD CELL HYDROGEN PEROXIDE-RESISTANT 1 (GHR1)-induced activation of SLAC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref018">18</xref>]. Bicarbonate-induced activation of SLAC1 has been reconstituted in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref020">20</xref>]. The pathway was shown to consist of RESISTANT TO HIGH CARBON DIOXIDE 1 (RHC1), HT1, OST1, and SLAC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref019">19</xref>], while more recently the importance of CARBONIC ANHYDRASE 4 (βCA4), aquaporin PIP2;1, OST1, and SLAC1 was demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref020">20</xref>]. Although guard cells are perhaps the best characterized single cell signaling system in the plant kingdom, there are still large gaps in our understanding of how CO<sub>2</sub> signaling in guard cells is regulated and by which mechanism CO<sub>2</sub> might regulate plant water management and WUE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we present the results of quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and sequencing of near-isogenic lines (NILs) of Cvi-0 ozone sensitivity. In a parallel approach, we mapped more open stomata and CO<sub>2</sub>-insensitivity phenotypes of a mutant <italic>cis</italic> (<underline>C</underline>O<sub>2</sub> <underline>i</underline>n<underline>s</underline>ensitive). A single amino acid change (G53R) in MPK12 and complete deletion of <italic>MPK12</italic> are the causes of more open stomata and altered CO<sub>2</sub> responses of Cvi-0 and <italic>cis</italic>, respectively. Based on kinase activity assays, we conclude that MPK12 acts as an inhibitor of the HT1 kinase, which represents a crucial step in the regulation of plant stomatal CO<sub>2</sub> responses.</p>

<title>Mapping of Cvi-0 Ozone Sensitivity Phenotypes</title>
<p>Our initial QTL mapping of ozone sensitivity in Cvi-0 placed the two major contributing loci on the lower ends of chromosomes 2 and 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref008">8</xref>]. To identify the causative loci related to the extreme ozone sensitivity and more open stomata of Cvi-0, we created a NIL termed Col-S (for <underline>Col</underline>-0 ozone <underline>s</underline>ensitive) through eight generations of backcrossing of Cvi-0 with Col-0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000322.s001">S1A Fig</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000322.s012">S1 Video</xref>). In parallel, ozone tolerance from Col-0 was introgressed to Cvi-0 by six generations of backcrossing, which generated the ozone-<underline>t</underline>olerant Cvi-T (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000322.s012">S1 Video</xref>). Using these accessions, NILs, and recombinant inbred lines (RILs), we mapped the causative ozone QTLs to a region of 90 kb on chromosome 2 and 17.70–18.18 Mbp on chromosome 3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000322.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). We have previously shown that the QTL on chromosome 2 also controls plant water loss and stomatal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref008">8</xref>]. We isolated both QTLs by backcrossing Col-S with Col-0 and obtained the NILs Col-S2 and Col-S3. Both of these were less sensitive to ozone than Col-S (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000322.s001">S1A Fig</xref>), indicating that these QTLs act additively to regulate ozone sensitivity. Col-S2 (but not Col-S3) showed much higher daytime stomatal conductance than Col-0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The mapping resolution on chromosome 3 was not sufficient to identify the causative gene. Hence, we focused on Col-S2 and its role in stomatal function. Within the 90-kb mapping region on chromosome 2, one gene, At2g46070, encoding a MAP kinase MPK12, shows strong preferential guard cell expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref023">23</xref>]. A single point mutation was found in Cvi-0 <italic>MPK12</italic>, leading to a glycine to arginine substitution at position 53 of the protein.</p>

<title>Stomata-Related Phenotypes of Cvi-0 and <italic>cis</italic> are Caused by Mutations in <italic>MPK12</italic></title>
<p>CAS (calcium-sensing receptor) is a chloroplast-localized protein important for proper stomatal responses to external Ca<sup>2+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref025">25</xref>]. While testing stomatal phenotypes in <italic>cas</italic> mutants, we observed phenotypic discrepancy between different alleles of <italic>cas</italic>. Whereas the <italic>cas-2</italic> (GABI-665G12) line had more open stomata and impaired CO<sub>2</sub> responses, this was neither observed in <italic>cas-1</italic> nor in <italic>cas-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000322.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). Further experiments showed that the T-DNA insert in the <italic>CAS</italic> gene was not linked to the CO<sub>2</sub>-insensitive phenotype of <italic>cas-2</italic>. In a backcross with Col-0, the T-DNA insert in <italic>cas-2</italic> was removed, thereby generating the mutant <italic>cis</italic> (<underline><italic>C</italic></underline><italic>O</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub> <underline><italic>i</italic></underline><italic>n</italic><underline><italic>s</italic></underline><italic>ensitive</italic>). Both <italic>cis</italic> and Col-S2 had impaired responses to high CO<sub>2</sub> (800 ppm), leading to longer half-response times, but a residual CO<sub>2</sub> response could still be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g001">Fig 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000322.s001">S1E Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to identify the causative mutation in <italic>cis</italic>, mapping and whole genome sequencing of <italic>cis</italic> × C24 population was performed, which revealed a complete deletion of the <italic>MPK12</italic> gene and its neighbor <italic>BYPASS2</italic> in <italic>cis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g001">Fig 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000322.s001">S1D Fig</xref>). Thus, <italic>cis</italic> was renamed <italic>mpk12-4</italic>. A second mutant (<italic>gdsl3-1</italic>) from the GABI-Kat collection (GABI-492D11) contained an identical deletion of <italic>BYPASS2</italic> and <italic>MPK12</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000322.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). We also identified a line with a T-DNA insert in exon 2 of <italic>MPK12</italic> from the SAIL collection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g001">Fig 1E</xref>), which was recently named <italic>mpk12-3</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref026">26</xref>]. No full-length transcript was found in <italic>mpk12-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000322.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). SALK T-DNA insertion lines of <italic>MPK12</italic> were previously described as lethal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref023">23</xref>]; similarly, we were unable to retrieve homozygous plants of the same alleles, possibly indicating the presence of an additional T-DNA in an essential gene. The new <italic>mpk12</italic> deletion, SAIL T-DNA insertion, and Col-S2 point mutation alleles allowed a detailed characterization of the role of MPK12 in stomatal regulation.</p>
<p>Stomatal conductance was higher throughout the day in all three lines (Col-S2, <italic>mpk12-3</italic>, and <italic>mpk12-4</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), suggesting that the amino acid substitution in Cvi-0 MPK12 leads to loss of function. Furthermore, Col-0 transformed with <italic>MPK12</italic> from Cvi-0 showed stomatal conductance similar to Col-0, which excludes the option that the G53R substitution in MPK12 would lead to gain of function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000322.s001">S1F Fig</xref>). Moreover, the wild-type (Col-0) stomatal phenotype was observed in heterozygous F1 plants from a cross of Col-S2 and Col-<italic>gl1</italic>, in which the <italic>gl1</italic> mutation that gives a trichome-less phenotype was used as a noninvasive method for selecting successfully crossed plants in the first generation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000322.s001">S1G Fig</xref>). Increased stomatal conductance may result from an increased number of stomata, larger stomata, or more open stomata. However, the stomatal index, length, and density did not differ between the lines, indicating that MPK12 regulates a function related to the stomatal aperture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000322.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Because of the higher degree of stomatal opening, the instantaneous WUE was lower in <italic>mpk12-3</italic>, <italic>mpk12-4</italic>, and Col-S2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).

<title>MPK12 Functions in Guard Cell CO<sub>2</sub> Signaling</title>
<p>Reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> levels inside the leaf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref027">27</xref>] is a signal that indicates a shortage of substrate for photosynthesis and triggers stomatal opening. The rate of stomatal opening in response to low CO<sub>2</sub> was severely impaired in <italic>mpk12</italic> and Col-S2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g003">Fig 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000322.s005">S5A Fig</xref>).

The hormone ABA has dual roles in stomatal regulation; it induces stomatal closure but also inhibits light-induced stomatal opening. The latter response was impaired in <italic>mpk12</italic> mutants and Col-S2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g003">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000322.s005">S5C Fig</xref>).

<title>MPK12 Interacts with the Protein Kinase HT1</title>
<p>Only a few regulators of stomatal CO<sub>2</sub> signaling in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> have been identified. These include the protein kinases HT1 and OST1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref016">16</xref>]. To find the interaction partners of MPK12, we conducted pairwise split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays against several kinases and phosphatases involved in stomatal signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000322.s007">S7A and S7B Fig</xref>). A strong interaction was observed between MPK12 and HT1 in yeast. The MPK12–HT1 interaction was also confirmed in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> with bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g004">Fig 4C–4E</xref>) and split luciferase complementation assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000322.s007">S7C Fig</xref>). Strong interaction between MPK12 and HT1 was observed in the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Recently, HT1 was shown to be a plasma membrane–associated protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref028">28</xref>]. In contrast, Col-0 and Cvi-0 MPK12-YFP were located inside the cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000322.s008">S8A–S8D Fig</xref>). Hence, it is likely that the interaction with HT1 brings MPK12 to the plasma membrane. HT1 interacted with both the Col-0 and Cvi-0 versions of MPK12, but the interaction with Cvi-0 MPK12 (G53R) was weaker both in quantitative BiFC and Y2H assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g004">Fig 4B and 4D</xref>). MPK11, an MPK from the same group as MPK12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref029">29</xref>], did not interact with HT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). INDOLE-3-BUTYRIC ACID RESPONSE 5 (IBR5) is a MPK phosphatase that regulates auxin signaling in roots and has been shown to interact with and regulate the activity of MPK12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref011">11</xref>]. We confirmed the interaction between MPK12 and IBR5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000322.s007">S7A Fig</xref>). However, the <italic>ibr5-1</italic> mutant exhibited wild-type stomatal phenotypes in response to CO<sub>2</sub> changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g003">Fig 3A and 3C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000322.s005">S5A and S5E Fig</xref>), suggesting that IBR5 is not required in stomatal CO<sub>2</sub> signaling.</p>

<title>MPK12 Inhibits HT1 Activity</title>
<p>The function of MPK12 in ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> signaling was further explored through genetic analysis. A strong loss-of-function allele, <italic>ht1-2</italic>, that has low stomatal conductance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref012">12</xref>] was used to evaluate the relationship between <italic>mpk12</italic> and <italic>ht1-2</italic>. The Col-S2 <italic>ht1-2</italic> and <italic>mpk12-4 ht1-2</italic> double mutants had a more closed stomata phenotype similar to <italic>ht1-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g004">Fig 4F</xref>), suggesting that <italic>HT1</italic> is epistatic to <italic>MPK12</italic>. The strong impairment of stomatal function in <italic>abi1</italic>-<italic>1</italic> (<italic>ABA insensitive1-1</italic>) was additive to Col-S2 in the double mutant Col-S2 <italic>abi1-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). Hence, signaling through MPK12 seems to act—at least to some extent—independently of the core ABA signaling pathway.</p>
<p>Taken together, the MPK12-HT1 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g004">Fig 4A–4E</xref>) and the epistasis between <italic>ht1-2</italic> and <italic>mpk12-4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g004">Fig 4F</xref>) suggest that MPK12 functions upstream of HT1 and could regulate the activity of HT1. To test this directly, we performed in vitro kinase assays with casein as the substrate for HT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). HT1 displayed strong autophosphorylation and phosphorylated casein efficiently. Addition of the Col-0 version of MPK12 and a hyperactive version (MPK12 Y122C) efficiently inhibited HT1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g005">Fig 5A</xref> and quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). A point-mutated version (MPK12 K70R) designed to remove the kinase activity of MPK12 also inhibited the autophosphorylation activity of HT1 and phosphorylation of casein by HT1, although it was less efficient than the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Importantly, the Cvi-0 version of MPK12 (G53R) displayed strongly suppressed inhibition of HT1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). MPK12 did not phosphorylate the kinase-dead version of HT1 (K113M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). The kinase-dead version of HT1 (K113M) was used as a substrate, since the strong autophosphorylation activity of HT1 would otherwise have obscured the result. Wild-type MPK12 and hyperactive MPK12 (Y122C) displayed autophosphorylation, whereas MPK12 (G53R) as well as MPK12 (K70R) had lost their autophosphorylation activity, indicating that the G53R substitution in Cvi-0 MPK12 disrupts the kinase activity of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). The inhibition of HT1 by MPK12 was specific, as MPK11, which belongs to the same group as MPK12, was not able to affect HT1 kinase activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000322.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). We conclude that the stomatal phenotypes of <italic>mpk12</italic> mutants and Cvi-0 can be explained by a lack of inhibition of HT1 activity by MPK12, which leads to more open stomata and impaired CO<sub>2</sub> responses (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g002">2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g005">5A and 5C</xref>).</p>

<title>Both MPK12 and MPK4 Regulate the CO<sub>2</sub> Signaling Pathway</title>
<p>MPK12 belongs to the same group of MPKs as MPK4, a crucial regulator of pathogen and stress responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref029">29</xref>]. In tobacco, the silencing of MPK4 impaired CO<sub>2</sub>-induced stomatal closure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref030">30</xref>]. Since <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> MPK4 and MPK12 are highly similar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref031">31</xref>], it is possible that both MPK4 and MPK12 could regulate stomatal CO<sub>2</sub> responses. Indeed, in an Y2H screen to identify HT1 interacting proteins, one prominent interactor was MPK4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>The <italic>Arabidopsis mpk4</italic> mutant is severely dwarfed, and measurements of accurate stomatal conductance with these plants are not feasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref032">32</xref>]. However, the impaired stomatal response to CO<sub>2</sub> in <italic>mpk12-4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g003">Fig 3</xref>) was further enhanced by guard cell–specific silencing of <italic>MPK4</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref018">18</xref>]; hence, in guard cells MPK4 is acting redundantly with MPK12 in stomatal CO<sub>2</sub> signaling. Furthermore, MPK4 could also inhibit HT1 kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref018">18</xref>]. The G53 residue in MPK12 is conserved in all <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> MPKs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref010">10</xref>]. Since the G53R mutation blocked MPK12 function, we tested whether a similar mutation would impair MPK4 function. This experiment showed that MPK4-induced inhibition of HT1 activity was blocked by the introduction of a G55R mutation in MPK4; this mutation corresponds to G53R in Cvi-0 MPK12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Since MPK11 did not inhibit HT1 activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000322.s009">S9 Fig</xref>), the function of MPKs as kinase inhibitors in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> may be restricted to MPK12 and its closest homologue MPK4.</p>

<p>The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> MPK6 crystal structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref033">33</xref>] was used to model the structure of MPK4 and MPK12 and to address the role of the G55R and G53R mutations that were shown to be crucial for the function of these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>). The mutation of Gly to Arg in position 53 in MPK12 caused the protrusion of the arginine sidechain on the surface of the protein, which could affect its binding affinity for other proteins in addition to an altered structure of the loop region. Similarly, the Arg in position 55 of MPK4 protruded from the surface as compared to the wild-type. Thus, the MPK12 G53R and MPK4 G55R amino acid substitutions may alter protein binding affinities of these MPKs to other proteins.</p>
<p>Collectively, the presented experiments suggest that the CO<sub>2</sub> signal leading to stomatal movements is transmitted through MPK12 and MPK4, leading to inhibition of HT1, and this enables SLAC1 activation by its activators, including OST1 and GHR1. Neither MPK12 G53R from Cvi-0 nor MPK4 G55R can fully inhibit HT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g007">Fig 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Schematic model of molecular events during elevated CO<sub>2</sub>-induced stomatal closure.</title>
<p>(Left guard cell) CO<sub>2</sub> enters guard cells through the PIP2;1 aquaporin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref020">20</xref>] and is converted to bicarbonate by carbonic anhydrases βCA4 and βCA1. The mechanism by which bicarbonate is sensed in guard cells still needs to be resolved; nevertheless, it is likely that in elevated CO<sub>2</sub> conditions, activation of MPK12 and MPK4 leads to inhibition of HT1, and this enables activation of slow-type anion channel SLAC1 by OST1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref015">15</xref>]. Additionally, GHR1 participates in the regulation of SLAC1 activity and is involved in CO<sub>2</sub>-induced stomatal closure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref018">18</xref>]. Bicarbonate-induced inhibition of HT1 by RHC1 has also been shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref019">19</xref>]. (Right guard cell) The G53R mutation in Cvi-0 MPK12, as well as G55R mutation in MPK4, decreases the ability of these MPKs to inhibit HT1 kinase activity, which results in enhanced inhibition of SLAC1 activity by HT1 and decreased sensitivity to CO<sub>2</sub> in stomatal closure.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Natural variation within a species holds great potential to identify regulatory mechanisms that are not easily uncovered through mutant screens. The Cvi-0 accession originates from the southern border of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> distribution area, the Cape Verde Islands. The Ler × Cvi RIL population was one of the first RILs produced, and it has been phenotyped for multiple traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref034">34</xref>]. Despite this, only a few QTLs from Cvi-0 have been identified at the molecular level. Our earlier research identified a locus related to ozone sensitivity and more open stomata phenotype of Cvi-0 in chromosome 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref008">8</xref>]. Recently, the G53R substitution in MPK12 that affects plant water use efficiency was identified by using the Ler × Cvi populations, but the biochemical function of MPK12 in stomatal regulation was not further investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref010">10</xref>]. Here, we generated NILs by backcrossing Cvi-0 eight times to Col-0 and show that the same natural mutation in Cvi-0 and lack of MPK12 in <italic>cis</italic> are the causes of ozone sensitivity, more open stomata, and altered CO<sub>2</sub> responses of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants. Furthermore, we showed that MPK12 regulates the activity of the protein kinase HT1, a major component of the CO<sub>2</sub> signaling pathway in guard cells. The regulators of HT1 have remained largely unknown, despite the exceptionally strong CO<sub>2</sub>-insensitivity phenotype of plants with impaired HT1 function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref015">15</xref>]. Our findings provide the first evidence for the role of MPK12 in guard cell CO<sub>2</sub> signaling and provide a mechanistic insight for the MPK12 function in the regulation of plant water management.</p>
<p>The role of MPKs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> guard cell signaling has concentrated on MPK9 and MPK12, which are preferentially expressed in guard cells. Plants with point mutations in <italic>MPK9</italic> (<italic>mpk9-1</italic>, L295F) and <italic>MPK12</italic> (<italic>mpk12-1</italic>, T220I) had wild-type ABA responses, but <italic>mpk12-1</italic> has decreased WUE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref010">10</xref>]. The <italic>mpk9-1</italic>, <italic>mpk12-1</italic>, and <italic>mpk12-2</italic> alleles are Tilling (Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes) lines in the Col-<italic>erecta</italic> background and the previously characterized MPK12-Cvi NIL is in the L<italic>er</italic> background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref023">23</xref>]. Mutations in <italic>ERECTA</italic> modify transpiration efficiency and stomatal density, which may have influenced some of the previously described <italic>mpk12-1</italic> phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref035">35</xref>]. In contrast, the full knockout alleles described here, <italic>mpk12-3</italic> and <italic>mpk12-4</italic>, are in Col-0 and imply a major function for MPK12 in CO<sub>2</sub> signaling. Additional roles for MPK12 in stomatal responses have been inferred through the use of the double mutant <italic>mpk9-1 mpk12-1</italic> that has impaired stomatal closure responses to ABA and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment and has impaired S-type anion channel activation in response to ABA and Ca<sup>2+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref023">23</xref>]. It is also highly susceptible to <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> infection and impaired in yeast elicitor-, chitosan-, and methyl jasmonate–induced stomatal closure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref036">36</xref>]. Since the <italic>mpk9 mpk12</italic> double mutant appears to be more severely impaired in abiotic and biotic stomatal responses and S-type anion channel activation than the loss of function MPK12 alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g003">Fig 3</xref>), it is possible that MPK12 together with MPK9 regulates stomatal aperture in response to various signals. MPK12 also regulates auxin responses in the root [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref026">26</xref>]. However, beyond the observation that plants with impaired MPK12 are hypersensitive to auxin inhibition of root growth, no details about the targets of MPK12 in roots are known.</p>
<p>HT1 was the first component shown to be specifically associated with stomatal CO<sub>2</sub> signaling, and the <italic>ht1-2</italic> mutant has more closed stomata displaying constitutive high CO<sub>2</sub> response at ambient CO<sub>2</sub> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g004">Fig 4D</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref012">12</xref>]). The opposite phenotypes of <italic>mpk12</italic> and <italic>ht1-2</italic> allowed us to use genetic analysis to position MPK12 in the guard cell signaling network. The stomata of <italic>mpk12 ht1-2</italic> were more closed, thus positioning MPK12 upstream of HT1 and possibly as a direct regulator of HT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). CO<sub>2</sub> signaling in guard cells is initiated through the production of bicarbonate by carbonic anhydrases, and bicarbonate initiates signaling leading to activation of S-type anion channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref015">15</xref>]. In <italic>mpk12</italic>, the bicarbonate-dependent activation of S-type anion channels was impaired, as was previously found for the plants with impaired OST1 and SLAC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g003">Fig 3E</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref015">15</xref>]. The combined evidence from <italic>mpk12</italic> phenotypes, genetic analysis, and measurements of S-type anion currents all pointed towards MPK12 as a crucial regulator of CO<sub>2</sub> signaling acting through HT1. Indeed, HT1 kinase activity was inhibited in the presence of Col-0 MPK12 but not by the Cvi-0 version of MPK12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Thus, the inhibitory function of MPK12 was impaired by the G53R amino acid substitution, probably by its weaker interaction with HT1 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g005">5A</xref>). This explains the similar phenotypes of the NIL Col-S2, <italic>mpk12-3</italic>, and <italic>mpk12-4</italic>; they all display lack of inhibition of the negative regulator HT1, leading to higher stomatal conductance. Further support for the regulatory interplay between HT1 and MPK12 is provided by the isolation of a dominant mutation in <italic>HT1</italic>, <italic>ht1</italic>-<italic>8D</italic>, which in contrast to <italic>ht1-2</italic> has constitutively more open stomata and is biochemically resistant to inhibition by MPK12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref018">18</xref>]. Cvi-0 has altered phenotypes in many traits, including drought and pathogen resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref038">38</xref>]. All of these traits are regulated through stomatal function; thus, the MPK12-HT1 regulatory module identified here may influence many of the previously observed phenotypes of Cvi-0.</p>
<p>Recently, two independent studies used <italic>X</italic>. <italic>laevis</italic> oocytes as a heterologous expression system to reconstitute bicarbonate-induced activation of the SLAC1 anion channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref020">20</xref>]. Tian et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref019">19</xref>] reported that a multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE)-type transporter RHC1 functions as a bicarbonate-sensing component that inactivates HT1 and promotes SLAC1 activation by OST1. More recently, it was demonstrated that expression of RHC1 alone was sufficient to activate ion currents in oocytes; these currents were independent of bicarbonate, calling into question the role of RHC1 as a bicarbonate sensor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref020">20</xref>]. Furthermore, it was shown that SLAC1 activation can be reconstituted by extracellular bicarbonate in the presence of aquaporin PIP2;1, carbonic anhydrase CA4, and the protein kinases OST1, CPK6, and CPK23 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref020">20</xref>]. However, in the guard cell, any proposed CO<sub>2</sub> signaling pathway should include HT1, since plants with mutations in HT1 completely lack CO<sub>2</sub>-induced stomatal responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref028">28</xref>]. We showed that bicarbonate-induced S-type anion currents were strongly impaired in guard cell protoplasts, which lacked functional MPK12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). Thus, MPK12, MPK4, and possibly other MPKs that are expressed in guard cells play a role in controlling the activity of HT1, and future research should identify the signaling pathway upstream of MPK12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Dissection of different domains in SLAC1 revealed that the CO<sub>2</sub> signal may involve the transmembrane region of SLAC1, whereas ABA activation of SLAC1 requires an intact N- and C-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref039">39</xref>]. Hence, ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> regulation of SLAC1 could use different signaling pathways, and this may explain the lack of strong ABA phenotypes in plants with mutations in <italic>MPK12</italic>.</p>
<p>We propose that stomatal movements triggered by changes in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration are regulated by MPK12- and MPK4-induced inhibition of HT1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g007">Fig 7</xref>). The MPK12 glycine 53 is conserved in all <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> MPKs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref010">10</xref>] and is located on the protein surface in the glycine-rich loop that coordinates the gamma-phosphate of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>). Thus, this glycine may also be important for the function of other <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> MPKs. Further studies into the mechanisms controlling activation of MPKs in guard cells will help to identify molecular switches that function in plant acclimation to environmental stress and modulate the overall plant water use efficiency. Such information may allow the designing of molecular targets that can be used for breeding crops with improved water management.</p>

<title>Plant Growth and Experimental Settings for Gas Exchange Measurements</title>
<p>Seeds were planted on a soil mixture consisting of 2:1 (v:v) peat:vermiculite and grown through a hole in a glass plate covering the pot as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref044">44</xref>]. Plants were grown in growth chambers (MCA1600, Snijders Scientific, Drogenbos, Belgium) at 12 h/12 h day/night cycle, 23°C/20°C temperature, 100 μmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> light, and 70% relative humidity (RH). For gas exchange experiments, 24- to 30-d-old plants were used.</p>
<p>Stomatal conductance of intact plants was measured using a rapid-response gas exchange measurement device consisting of eight through-flow whole-rosette cuvettes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref044">44</xref>]. The unit of stomatal conductance mmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> reflects the amount of H<sub>2</sub>O moles that exits the plant through stomata per one m<sup>2</sup> of leaf area per second. Prior to the experiment, plants were acclimated in the measurement cuvettes in ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (~400 ppm), 100 μmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> light (if not stated otherwise), and ambient humidity (RH 65%–80%) for at least 1 h or until stomatal conductance was stable. Thereafter, the following stimuli were applied: decrease or increase in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, darkness, reduced air humidity, and ozone. CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was decreased to 100 ppm by filtering air through a column of granular potassium hydroxide. In CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment experiments, CO<sub>2</sub> was increased by adding it to the air inlet to achieve a concentration of 800 ppm. Darkness was applied by covering the measurement cuvettes. In blue light experiments, dark-adapted plants were exposed to blue light (50 μmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) from an LED light source (B42180, Seoul Semiconductor, Ansan, South Korea). The decreased or increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, darkness, and blue light were applied for 58 min. In the long-term elevated CO<sub>2</sub> experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000322.g001">Fig 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000322.s001">S1E Fig</xref>), CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was increased from 400 ppm to 800 ppm for 2.5 h. To calculate stomatal half-response time, the whole 2.5-h stomatal response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> was scaled to a range from 0% to 100%, and the time when 50% of stomatal closure had occurred was calculated. Humidity was decreased by a thermostat system to 30%–40% RH, and stomatal conductance was monitored for another 56 min. In ozone experiments, the plants were exposed to 350–450 ppb of ozone for 3 min and stomatal conductance was measured for 60 min after the start of the exposure.</p>
<p>In ABA-induced stomatal closure experiments, 5 μM ABA solution was applied by spraying as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000322.ref045">45</xref>]. At time point 0, plants were removed from cuvettes and sprayed with either 5 μM ABA solution (5 μM ABA, 0.012% Silwet L-77 [PhytoTechnology Laboratories], and 0.05% ethanol) or control solution (0.012% Silwet L-77 and 0.05% ethanol). Thereafter, plants were returned to the cuvettes and stomatal conductance was monitored for 56 min.</p>
<p>In ABA-induced inhibition of stomatal opening experiments, plants were acclimated in measurement cuvettes in darkness. At time point 0, plants were removed from cuvettes and sprayed with 2.5 μM ABA solution (2.5 μM ABA, 0.012% Silwet L-77 [PhytoTechnology Laboratories], and 0.05% ethanol) or control solution (0.012% Silwet L-77 and 0.05% ethanol). Thereafter, plants were returned to the cuvettes, dark covers were removed, and stomatal conductance was monitored in light for 56 min.</p>
<p>Prior to the measurement of the diurnal pattern of stomatal conductance, plants were preincubated in the measurement cuvette for at least 12 h in respective light and humidity conditions. Plants were measured in 16-min intervals. WUE was calculated based on the data of diurnal experiments as an average of daytime light period (from 9:00 to 17:00).</p>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub>-induced stomatal conductance in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000322.s002">S2 Fig</xref> was measured as following.

The cells were resuspended in 30 mL of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 300 mM NaCl, 5% [v/v] glycerol, 1% [v/v] Triton X-100, 1 mM PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and lysed using an Emulsiflex C3 Homogenizer. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 30 min. The protein-containing supernatant was mixed for 1 h at 4°C with 0.20 mL of Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare), charged with 200 mM NiSO<sub>4</sub> and pre-equilibrated in the lysis buffer. The protein–resin complex was packed into a column, and the beads were washed with 5x10 column volumes (CV) of a wash buffer I (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 600 mM NaCl, 5% [v/v] glycerol, 1% [v/v] Triton X-100), 5x10 CV of a wash buffer II (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 300 mM NaCl, 5% [v/v] glycerol, 0.1% [v/v] NP-40), and 2x10 CV of a wash buffer III (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 5% [v/v] glycerol, 0.1% [v/v] NP-40). The protein was eluted by incubating the beads for 5 min at room temperature with an imidazole-containing elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 5% [v/v] glycerol, 0.1% [v/v] NP-40, 300 mM imidazole). MPK12 proteins were concentrated and imidazole was removed by Millipore Amicon Ultra-0.5 Centrifugal Filter Concentrators (NMWL 3000). Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 20% (v/v), and 20 μL aliquots of the eluted protein were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80°C.</p>

<title>In Vitro Kinase Assays</title>
<p>Protein concentrations were estimated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel using BSA as a standard. HT1 kinase activity assay was performed by incubating a constant amount of purified recombinant HT1 and 0–30 μM MPK12, 0–20 μM MPK4, or 0–10 μM MPK11 in a reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 60 mM imidazole, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mg/ml insulin) at room temperature for 10 min. Then, casein (1 mg/ml), 500 μM ATP, and 100 μCi/ml 32P-γ-ATP were added and reaction aliquots were taken at the 30 min time point. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS loading buffer. Proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 (Sigma) staining. HT1 activity was determined by autoradiography and quantified by ImageQuant TL Software.</p>
