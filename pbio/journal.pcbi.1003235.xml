<abstract>
<p>Systematic, genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) analysis is a powerful approach to identify gene functions that support or modulate selected biological processes. An emerging challenge shared with some other genome-wide approaches is that independent RNAi studies often show limited agreement in their lists of implicated genes. To better understand this, we analyzed four genome-wide RNAi studies that identified host genes involved in influenza virus replication. These studies collectively identified and validated the roles of 614 cell genes, but pair-wise overlap among the four gene lists was only 3% to 15% (average 6.7%). However, a number of functional categories were overrepresented in multiple studies. The pair-wise overlap of these enriched-category lists was high, ∼19%, implying more agreement among studies than apparent at the gene level. Probing this further, we found that the gene lists implicated by independent studies were highly connected in interacting networks by independent functional measures such as protein-protein interactions, at rates significantly higher than predicted by chance. We also developed a general, model-based approach to gauge the effects of false-positive and false-negative factors and to estimate, from a limited number of studies, the total number of genes involved in a process. For influenza virus replication, this novel statistical approach estimates the total number of cell genes involved to be ∼2,800. This and multiple other aspects of our experimental and computational results imply that, when following good quality control practices, the low overlap between studies is primarily due to false negatives rather than false-positive gene identifications. These results and methods have implications for and applications to multiple forms of genome-wide analysis.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Genome-wide RNA interference assays of gene functions offer the potential for systematic, global analysis of biological processes. A pressing challenge is to develop meta-analysis methods that effectively combine information from multiple studies. One puzzle is that implicated gene lists from independent studies of the same process often show relatively low overlap. This disagreement might arise from false-positive factors, such as imperfect gene targeting (off-target effects), or from false negatives if separate studies access different components of large, complex systems. We present new methods to examine the relations between individual genome-wide RNAi studies, using studies of host genes in influenza virus replication as a test case. We find that cross-study agreement is greater than suggested by overlap of reported gene lists. This better agreement is evidenced by the strong relation of independent gene lists in functional pathways and protein interaction networks, and by a statistical model that relates multi-study, gene-level findings to factors driving correct, false-negative, and false-positive gene identification. Our analysis of multiple genome-wide studies predicts that there are many undetected host genes important for influenza virus infection, and that false negatives are the major concerns for genome-wide studies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>RNA interference (RNAi) is a gene-specific silencing process directed by short double stranded RNAs or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that can “knock down” expression of a selected gene by inducing messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation in a sequence-specific manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Mohr1">[1]</xref>. RNAi has been widely used as a molecular tool to selectively inhibit the expression of a chosen gene. By expanding this technique to use large-scale RNAi libraries, high-throughput RNAi analysis has become a powerful approach to screen essentially all genes of an organism, to identify gene functions that support or modulate any biological process of interest.</p>
<p>Genome-wide RNAi analyses have been used to study many important biological processes and have provided novel, key insights. One important application of genome-wide RNAi screening has been to identify host genes that are required for the replication of a particular virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Sessions1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Krishnan1">[4]</xref>. In several cases, two or more independent RNAi screens have been performed to identify host factors required by the same viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Karlas1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Konig1">[11]</xref>. An emerging challenge shared with some other genome-wide approaches is that such independent genome-wide RNAi studies often exhibit limited overlap in the lists of genes implicated. For example, there is only 3–6% overlap of gene lists identified from three genome wide RNAi studies for host factors of HIV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Pache1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Zhou1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Bushman1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Konig2">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>Lack of overlap between studies must be due to some combination of false-positive and false-negative factors. If the dissimilarity between the sets of identified host factors is predominantly from false-positive factors, the majority of the genes identified from a genome wide RNAi study would be false positives. In this case, the number of genes involved in a biological process such as virus infection would be low relative to the number implicated. On the other hand, a high false-negative rate could also induce low agreement, since in this case each study would confirm just a small subset of involved genes, and many more genes than one study could identify might be implicated in the process.</p>
<p>A critical step to reduce false discoveries is good quality control, which is essential due to the limited number of repeats possible for genome-wide analyses, frequently high assay noise, the potential for systematic errors, and other effects. Relevant quality control practices include adequately designed positive and negative controls, proper patterning of samples and controls on microtiter assay plates, data display approaches suitable for revealing systematic errors, etc. Nevertheless, even good quality control cannot eliminate error, so that quality control is an essential but not sufficient basis for effective RNAi analysis. Appropriate data analysis, such as false discovery rate (FDR) controlling procedures, should also help to minimize false discoveries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Barrows1">[14]</xref>. However, the FDR is controlled within each study, and is not designed to control false-positive error rates caused by sources of variation between studies. Moreover, an inherent problem for large-scale dataset processing is that a strict cut-off to limit false-positive results increases the number of false negative results, and vice versa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Mohr1">[1]</xref>. Depending on the goal of a study, the tolerance for false positives or false negatives might be adjusted accordingly to generate the final results.</p>
<p>Of course, data analysis is not the sole source or solution for false-positive and-negative results. Both technical and biological sources also contribute to false discoveries and non-discoveries in genome-wide RNAi studies. An siRNA may silence one or more genes besides the targeted one <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Jackson1">[15]</xref>, owing to incomplete sensitivity and specificity of siRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Jackson2">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Zhang1">[19]</xref>. Beyond these off-target effects, another false-positive factor is measurement error intrinsic to the complex phenotypic readouts typically used. Similarly, many experimental issues contribute to false negatives. For example, the organism under study may have genetic redundancies that limit the accessibility of certain functions to phenotypic manipulation by knocking down a single gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Podder1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Kafri1">[21]</xref>. Furthermore, genes with undetectable expression or whose knock down results in cytotoxicity are usually excluded from such RNAi analyses, further reducing the number of genes that are accessed in such “genome-wide” studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Boutros1">[22]</xref>. Besides the above issues, false negatives also can be generated by systematic errors such as plate position effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Zhang2">[23]</xref>, by failure to control for variation in local cell environments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Snijder1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Knapp1">[25]</xref>, by inefficiencies in knocking down targeted genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Pekarik1">[26]</xref>, and by other effects. For these and other reasons noted above, use of well-chosen quality control as well as analytic methods are critical for producing high quality screening results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Zhang2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Zhang3">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>To better understand RNAi screening and the relative contributions of false positives and false negatives, we performed a meta-analysis of four recent studies to identify host genes involved in the replication of influenza virus, an important human pathogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Karlas2">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Konig1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Watanabe1">[28]</xref>. Despite differences in the RNAi libraries and cell lines used, these studies, including one from our laboratory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Hao1">[9]</xref>, employed similar two-step approaches. All studies began with a high-throughput primary screen with an RNAi library targeting the whole genome. Candidate genes from this primary screen then were re-tested for function in virus replication in repeated secondary validation assays with individual siRNAs. Similar to prior HIV results, the pair-wise overlaps among the confirmed gene lists were only 3–15% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003235-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Using a multi-faceted meta-analysis, we found that the independent gene lists are strongly interlinked by functional pathways and protein-protein interactions, and that their low overlap is due primarily to false negative rather than false-positive factors. First, there is substantially higher agreement between studies from the perspective of functional categories rather than gene lists. Second, the combined list of genes confirmed by all studies embodies a much richer network of molecular interactions than expected by chance. Thus, genes identified in independent RNAi studies are physically as well as functionally connected. Finally, we developed a new statistical model that incorporates the main experimental features of RNAi screening and that, upon fitting to the data via likelihood and Bayesian techniques, estimates the major intrinsic parameters governing false positives and false negatives. This model well duplicates the statistical patterns in the multi-study gene level data, and indicates that low overlap arises primarily from false negative factors. Thus, our bioinformatic and statistical analyses show that current genome-wide RNAi screens each reveal a highly useful but partial glimpse of a larger whole.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Data collection and preliminary analysis</title>
<p>Gene-level results from primary and secondary screens were collected from four genome-wide RNAi screens to identify host factors crucial for influenza virus replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Karlas2">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Konig1">[11]</xref>. All human genes were mapped to Entrez IDs (NCBI, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>); human orthologs for <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes were extracted from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org" xlink:type="simple">www.ensembl.org</ext-link>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003235.s001">Table S1</xref> lists for each study the Entrez IDs of all confirmed genes, followed by unconfirmed primary candidates. Study-specific lists of confirmed genes were compared using a mean overlap fraction (MOF). On average over all pairings of lists, MOF is the mean value of the proportion of one list that overlaps with another.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Gene-set analysis</title>
<p>Gene-set analysis was performed using confirmed genes from each of the four studies and functional-category information from the Gene Ontology (GO) project, as accessed using the R and Bioconductor systems (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioconductor.org" xlink:type="simple">www.bioconductor.org</ext-link>). We applied the recently-developed multi-function analyzer (MFA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Newton1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Wang1">[30]</xref> to process each gene list (four study-specific gene lists and one combined list). Briefly, MFA provides a model-based analysis of a gene list. A gene's presence on the list is explained by latent binary activities of GO terms which annotate it; through model-based computations MFA determines the posterior activity probabilities over all terms in the collection. It refines model-based gene set analysis (MGSA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Bauer1">[31]</xref> by encoding natural constraints on the function-level activities in order to improve statistical efficiency. Like MGSA, MFA addresses deficiencies of simpler gene-set methods (e.g., in handling set overlaps) by the simultaneous analysis of all sets in a collection. Gene-permutation was used to calibrate the between-study agreement of MFA-derived set lists. Specifically, data were organized in an incidence matrix with rows for genes and columns for studies, and containing indicators of confirmation. Permutation proceeded by shuffling row labels (gene IDs) and retaining the numbers of genes co-confirmed in two, three, and four studies, and expressed the null assumption of no functional association between studies. We computed Monte Carlo p-values using the MFA results from the observed data and from 999 permuted versions. Computations used <italic>GO.db</italic> version 2.8.0; and <italic>org.Hs.eg.db</italic> version 2.8.0 (September, 2012). In total 2472 GO terms were used; these are all terms that have non-empty intersection with the combined list of influenza-related genes and that are moderate in size (between 5 and 50 human genes). The size constraint improved computational efficiency without much loss in functional information.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Network analysis</title>
<p>Analysis of molecular interactions among the confirmed genes was performed in order to further assess the relatedness of the genes, both within studies and across studies. We assembled <italic>interaction graphs</italic>; these are data structures in which the vertices correspond to genes and the edges correspond to protein-protein interactions. The set of interactions used consisted of 47,647 human, protein-protein interactions from the BioGRID database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Hao1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>A <italic>connected component</italic> is a maximal subgraph in which any two genes in the subgraph are connected by one or more paths. To assess the extent of inter-relatedness within a list of confirmed genes, we considered several properties of the subgraph that results from selecting only the confirmed genes and their impinging interactions. First, we measured the number of edges in the resulting connected components and the size (in terms of genes) of the largest connected component. Second, we measured the <italic>average degree</italic> of the vertices in the confirmed-gene subgraph. The degree of a vertex in a graph is the number of other vertices to which it has edges. Thus we measured, on average, the number of other confirmed genes with which each confirmed gene has known interactions.</p>
<p>To determine if any of these measures is surprisingly large, we employed a Monte Carlo test in which the null hypothesis is that the measure can be accounted for by a randomly selected set of pseudo “confirmed” lists. Given a set of <italic>n</italic> actual confirmed genes, this test involved repeated random selection of gene sets of size <italic>n</italic>. We selected these random gene sets such that the degree of connectivity of the selected genes, with respect to the entire interaction graph, was the same as the degree of connectivity of the given list of confirmed genes. That is, if there are three genes in the confirmed list that each has eight known interactions with other genes in the genome, then our randomly selected gene sets would also include exactly three genes with eight interactions each. Note that the degree of connectivity we consider when doing this selection process refers to the connectivity of a given gene to <italic>all</italic> genes in the genome, as opposed to its connectivity to other confirmed genes. For the results reported here, our Monte Carlo p-values involved 9,999 iterations.</p>
<p>To determine if there were more relationships between pairs of genes confirmed in different studies than would be expected by chance, we pooled the confirmed genes from the four independent studies and determined the connected components that resulted from this set of pooled genes. As before, we counted the number of edges in connected components, determined the size of the largest connected component, determined the average degree for confirmed genes, and assessed the statistical significance of each measure using a Monte Carlo methodology. Additionally, to assess the extent to which the genes confirmed in separate studies were related, we counted the number of <italic>spanning edges</italic> in the connected components. A spanning edge is one that represents an interaction between two genes that were confirmed in different studies. We used a Monte Carlo test to measure the statistical significance of the number of spanning edges we observed. Each iteration of the Monte Carlo test involved randomly selecting, for each study in the pool, a set of pseudo “confirmed” genes which have the same degree of connectivity as the actual confirmed genes in that study. Given these randomly chosen sets, we counted the number of spanning edges in each as we did with the actual data. Again, our Monte Carlo p-values used 9,999 iterations.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2d">
<title>Model-based statistical analysis</title>
<p>To provide reasoned inferences about factors affecting among-study gene-level agreement, we developed a statistical model for genome-wide RNAi studies and corresponding likelihood-based analysis methods. The model formulates relationships among: system-level parameters that affect sensitivity and various error rates, gene-level and study-level latent variables that transduce information about the system to information at the gene-level, and gene-level, multi-study data on both detection and confirmation by RNAi screening. In its generative form, the model specifies the probability of observing any particular multi-study data set. In its inferential form, it indicates the likelihood assigned to any particular parameter setting in light of observed data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Kass1">[32]</xref>.</p>

<title>Knockdown</title>
<p>With respect to relating phenotypic effects to siRNA action, our model is as simple as possible while allowing three basic features. First, the larger the number of either on-target or off-target events for an siRNA or siRNA pool, the higher the probability of a phenotypic effect. Second, if there are multiple off-target events from a pool of siRNAs, then distinct off-targeted genes are affected. Third, we suppose that multiple on-target hits (i.e., from multiple siRNAs targeting the same gene) deliver a higher probability of phenotypic effect than do the same number of off-target hits dispersed to various genes. A mathematical device to achieve this structure imagines that every targeting or off-targeting event (i.e. every potential knock down of an involved gene) is associated with a uniform (0,1) random variable representing the fraction of mRNA remaining after knock down by that event. An error-free measurement then would show a phenotypic effect if any of the involved, accessible genes had mRNA levels reduced below a threshold, parameterized by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003235.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in (0,1). By assumption, off-target effects work in parallel on different genes. If <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003235.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the probability that any of the off-targeted genes has mRNA knocked down below <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003235.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003235.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The assumptions similarly form the on-target model as a series circuit: the probability that the targeted mRNA is knocked down below <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003235.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> after hits from a pool of, say four, siRNAs becomes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003235.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003235.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the cumulative distribution function of a gamma distribution with shape 4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003235.s002">Text S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Measurement error</title>
<p>Our meta-analysis analyzes summary gene-level data from four two-stage genome-wide studies. Whether or not a gene is detected or confirmed in any study depends on details of the quantitative assays used to assess the phenotypic effect, as well as on all the intrinsic factors indicated above. These assays are subject to various sources of measurement error that may create both false-negative and false-positive recordings. We allow both types, and have found improved model fits by allowing the false negative rate to be study specific. Parameters are <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003235.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for type I (false positives) and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003235.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for type II (false negatives).</p>

Each edge in the circuit has a probability, and the fate of cells considered prior to experimentation (left) is a path through the circuit to some end state (right). For example, a phenotypic effect (scored as 1) is possible if either (1) there is a successful knockdown of some involved gene (either on or off target) and there is no (type II) measurement error, or (2) there is neither on- nor off-target knockdown and there is a (type I) measurement error. Probabilities, which are assembled by multiplying along paths in this circuit, take a concise final form:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003235.e081"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003235.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>The model allows heterogeneity across genes and studies.

<p><bold>A</bold>) Detection Screen: The diagram expresses ways in which treated cells (left) can progress through the experiment to a scored detection D<sub>g,s</sub>, conditional upon the state of latent variables (accessibility A<sub>g,s</sub>, involvement I<sub>g</sub>, and off target count T<sub>g,s</sub>). In the case shown, cells are treated with a pool of 4 siRNAs against a single gene g. The top branch involves a phenotypically effective knockdown event that blocks influenza virus infection, due to an on-target effect (upper sub-branch) or off-target event (lower sub-branch) or both. The alternate bottom branch involves the absence of siRNA-mediated interference with influenza virus replication. In either case, as shown, negative measurement error (type II) or positive measurement error (type I) could affect the final scored phenotype. Depending on these combined effects, the gene g in influenza virus replication is scored as detected (1) or not detected (0). Shaded boxes record the probability of the indicated event, where variables a and i are both either 0 or 1, and count t is a natural number. Accordingly, phenotype probabilities are computed by adding probabilities over all paths from the left to the specific outcome, where a path probability is computed by multiplying over the traversed events. The open box at the bottom provides a concise summary form for the conditional detection probability. <bold>B</bold>) Schematic similar to (A) regarding the possible outcomes and associated probabilities for secondary confirmation testing of a given gene g implicated by detection screening in study s. Cells are treated in four separate assays with each of the four distinct siRNAs targeting gene g, and can then traverse one of the two main indicated outcome branches, similar to panel (A). As noted, confirmation requires a positive result with at least two of the individual siRNAs against gene g.</p>

<title>Four genome wide RNAi screens identified 614 host genes important for influenza virus replication</title>
<p>Four nearly genome wide RNAi studies have been published to identify host genes that affect influenza virus replication (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003235-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003235-t002">2</xref>). These four studies differed in the cell lines and RNAi libraries used, but each invoked a two-stage screening strategy in which candidate genes detected in a primary, genome-wide screen (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003235-t001">Table 1</xref>) were subjected to more thorough testing in a second, validation phase (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003235-t002">Table 2</xref>). In such validation testing, the candidate genes were knocked down using an alternate dsRNA or multiple single siRNAs to confirm that the effects on influenza virus were not due to off-target effects on unintended genes.</p>

<p>The majority of genes detected and confirmed in these four genome-wide screens are genes that promote influenza virus replication, i.e., knock-down of these genes by RNAi decreased virus replication (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003235-t002">Table 2</xref>). Two screens using human A549 cells identified, respectively, 219 and 168 genes that promoted influenza virus replication, without reporting any host genes that restrict influenza virus - i.e., genes whose knockdown increased viral replication. One screen in human U2OS cells found 129 genes that promoted influenza virus replication, and 4 genes that restricted replication. A screen in <italic>Drosophila</italic> DL1 cells identified 104 genes that promoted virus replication and 11 genes that restricted virus replication. Of the 104 <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes that promoted influenza virus replication, 96 have a total of 154 human homologs according to the Ensembl database, while 10 out of the 11 <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes that restrict influenza virus have 14 human homologs. As these studies identified very few genes that restricted virus replication when knocked down, our analysis focused on the genes that promoted virus replication. From 984 unique human genes identified in the primary screens of these four studies, 614 unique genes were confirmed that promoted influenza virus replication. The symbols and Entrez ID numbers of all 984 genes are listed in Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003235.s001">Table S1</xref>, with unconfirmed genes at the bottom of the table in shaded rows. Thus, on average, each such study detects approximately 1% of the genes in the genome as potentially involved in the influenza virus replication, and confirms approximately half of these candidate genes.</p>

<title>Studies agree substantially more at the level of functional categories than genes</title>
<p>Although all four studies aimed to perform a general identification of host genes affecting influenza virus replication, their gene lists exhibited relatively little overlap. Only one gene (<italic>COPG, or coatomer protein complex, subunit gamma</italic>) was detected and confirmed by all four studies; nine genes were confirmed by three of four studies, and 35 by two studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003235-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Pairwise overlap between studies ranged from 3% to 15%, with a mean pairwise overlap of 6.7% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003235-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>To complement comparisons at the gene level, we examined the relationship of the four confirmed-gene lists at the level of functional categories recorded by the Gene Ontology (GO) project. Within-study lists of over-represented GO terms exhibited relatively strong agreement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003235-g004">Figure 4</xref>), with a mean overlap fraction of 19% (compared to 6.7% for gene lists). This agreement is substantially more than would be expected in the absence of functional associations between the studies (Monte Carlo p-value = 0.001). The finding is based on an advanced gene-set analysis tool which accommodates term-size and term-overlap issues (MFA; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref>); the same conclusion was found with simpler gene-set enrichment methods of GO-term lists suggests that the four studies were probing common functional signals in influenza virus dependence on host genes.</p>

<title>Studies agree substantially at the level of functional categories.</title>
<p>When each study's confirmed gene list is processed for enriched functional categories from GO (Gene Ontology), substantially more categories are identified in multiple studies than one would expect by chance, suggesting a positive association in functional signals underlying the study-specific gene lists. Shown is the distribution of an agreement statistic (mean overlap fraction) generated by gene-permutation, where the multi-functional analyzer (MFA) approach is applied to every gene list to produce a list of over-represented GO terms. The actual agreement between studies (red) is strikingly higher than expected by chance (blue) and also much higher than the 6.7% gene-list agreement (purple).</p>

<p>The functional categories over-represented in the combined list of 614 confirmed genes from all four studies represent a wide variety of functions. The top 29 categories are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003235-g005">Figure 5</xref>, including with categories associated with mRNA translation (ribosomal small subunit, eIF3 initiation complex, ribosome binding), vesicular transport (Golgi to ER, vacuolar ATPse) RNA metabolism (RNA splicing, transport, poly(A) regulation), regulated protein degradation (proteasome, ubiquitination factors), and other functions. Cellular functions like regulation of type I interferon production and nucleo-cytoplasmic transport are known to play important roles in influenza virus replication, while other functions like NADP binding and vitamin transporter activities are novel findings identified through our analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003235-g005">Figure 5</xref> also shows that, for many categories, two or more studies isolated distinct sets of genes in the same functional category, so that the same cellular functions were independently but repeatedly identified to promote influenza virus replication.</p>

The MFA-identified category having highest overlap with the 614-gene list is GO:0022627 (top row), the overlap being 18 genes (horizontal axis). These genes and this category are removed from the system, and then the category having the highest overlap with the remainder is identified (GO:0005852), and so on until the overlap is less than four genes.

<title>Confirmed genes exhibit more physical interactions than expected by chance, both within and between studies</title>
<p>As noted above, if many of the genes confirmed in the genome-wide influenza screens were false positives, then we would expect these genes to be distributed across unrelated pathways and functional complexes. That is, we would expect relatively few direct interactions among the genes confirmed in one study or in different studies. Given the confirmed genes from the four influenza screens, we used known physical interactions among the genes' products, as cataloged in the BioGRID protein-protein interaction database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Hao1">[9]</xref>, to test two specific hypotheses: First, that the genes confirmed within each individual study are more inter-related by protein interactions than would be expected by chance. Second, that there are more such relationships between genes confirmed in different studies than would be expected by chance.</p>
<p>To assess the relatedness of a set of confirmed genes, we first determined the number of connected components in the interaction subgraph consisting of the proteins encoded by the confirmed genes. We considered two properties of these connected components: the number of edges in the connected components and the number of genes in the largest connected component. We further measure relatedness by determining the average degree for vertices in the subgraph of confirmed genes. We also investigated augmenting our interaction data with metabolic-pathway and transcription-factor relationships, and found that the results of our analysis were qualitatively similar when we include these additional interaction sets.</p>
<p>To test our first hypothesis, we independently measured the above mentioned properties for the four interaction subgraphs constructed using the confirmed genes from each individual study. To determine if any of the measures was surprisingly large, we employed a Monte Carlo test with the null hypothesis that these measures could be accounted for by a randomly selected set of pseudo “confirmed” genes. Given a list of <italic>n</italic> actual confirmed genes, our Monte Carlo test involved repeated random selection of gene sets of size <italic>n</italic>. We selected these random gene sets such that the degree of connectivity of the selected genes, with respect to the entire interaction graph, was the same as the degree of connectivity of the given list of confirmed genes. The rationale for controlling the degree of connectivity in our Monte Carlo tests is that we want to rule out the possibility that a confirmed list has a high degree of connectivity with other confirmed genes simply because its genes have many known interactions.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003235-g006">Figure 6A</xref> illustrates the two connected-component measures and the average degree measure, and shows the counts and <italic>p</italic>-values calculated using the graphs for each individual study. For three of the four studies, the number of interactions in connected components and the average degree exceeded those of the null hypothesis by a statistically significant margin (p&lt;0.05), and for two of the studies, the number of confirmed genes in the largest connected component is statistically significant. These results generally support our first hypothesis that the confirmed genes have a higher degree of relatedness than expected by chance.</p>

<p><bold>A</bold>) Physical interactions among implicated gene products define graphs that characterize the relatedness of the genes. Each circle represents a gene confirmed in at least one RNAi study and each edge represents a protein-protein interaction. The variable k represents the number of edges in the subgraph defined by a given set of confirmed genes, m represents the number of genes in the largest connected component, and r represents the average degree of the confirmed genes in this subgraph. The values of k, m and r for each RNAi study as well as the values for the interaction subgraph resulting from pooling all four studies are shown in the table. P-values correspond to the null hypothesis that the k, m, and r values can be accounted for by randomly selected sets of pseudo “confirmed” lists.

<p>To test our second hypothesis, we pooled the confirmed genes from the four independent studies and determined the connected components and the average degree in the interaction subgraph for this set of pooled genes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003235-g006">Figure 6A</xref> (bottom row) shows the resulting number of edges in the connected components, the size of the largest connected component, and the average degree for vertices in the pooled subgraph. The number of protein interactions in the pooled study subgraph (214) is much larger than the sum of interactions in the individual-study graphs (121), and was highly statistically significant at p&lt;0.0001. The average degree of proteins in the pooled subgraph is larger than the average degree of any of the single-study subgraphs, and this degree was highly statistically significant (p&lt;0.0001). Thus, these results strongly support our second hypothesis that there are more interactions between pairs of genes confirmed in different studies than expected by chance. Likewise, the size of the largest connected component in the pooled graph (108 genes) is much larger than the sum of the largest connected components in the individual-study graphs (34 genes) and was statistically significant at p&lt;0.05. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003235-g007">Figure 7</xref> illustrates the 108-gene largest connected component from the pooled-study graph.

<p>To further probe our second hypothesis, we counted the number of spanning edges in the connected components of the pooled-study graph. A spanning edge is one that represents an interaction between two genes that were confirmed in different studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003235-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). As before, we measured the statistical significance of the observed number of spanning edges by iterative Monte Carlo tests that involved randomly selecting, for each study in the pool, a set of pseudo “confirmed” genes with the same degree of connectivity as the actual confirmed genes in that study. The results show that, of the 214 total protein-protein interactions of the pooled study subgraph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003235-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), 175 (82%) were spanning interactions between gene products confirmed in different studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003235-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). This result was statistically significant at p&lt;0.05.</p>
<p>We also considered the possibility that our measures of interactivity might be inflated by the fact that some of the genes confirmed in the DL1 study mapped to multiple human orthologs. To control for this effect, we repeated all of our analyses using a smaller set of DL1 genes in which each of the 96 confirmed <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes was mapped to exactly one human gene. In particular, we mapped each <italic>Drosophila</italic> gene to the human ortholog with the <italic>fewest</italic> known interactors. The differences in p-values between the original analysis and this “conservative ortholog mapping” re-analysis were all small. Specifically, none of the p-values changed from statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) to not significant.</p>
<p>Overall, then, the results show that the independent RNAi studies identified distinct but physically interacting sets of genes, and that these confirmed gene products exhibit significantly more interactions both within and between studies than expected by chance.</p>

<title>Statistical modeling of genome-wide RNAi studies</title>
<p>Multiple independent analyses above show that the outputs of the four separate screens are not randomly divergent, but are highly interlinked both physically and functionally. To more thoroughly examine the biological and experimental factors that affect agreement among such screens, we generated a statistical model of RNAi screening that incorporates known biological and experimental features to better analyze and understand the expected relationships between the outputs of independent screens. The assessment of agreements and disagreements among studies has long been a focus of model-based statistical analysis, from seminal work by R.A. Fisher and colleagues on species abundance estimation in ecology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Fisher1">[34]</xref>, through more recent and relevant precursors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Craig1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Basu1">[37]</xref> to our own calculations. The rationale for this general approach is that the specific findings of any study are affected by numerous factors, some of which are systematic and shared in some predictable way among studies, and some of which are idiosyncratic.</p>
<p>To capture the systematic effects we treat them as parameters in a stochastic process presumed to have generated the observed data, and we infer the parameter values by calculating the probability of observed data (the likelihood). The structure of RNAi experiments forces us to go beyond previously described probability models and propose a specification for multi-study, two-stage (detection/confirmation), genome-wide RNAi data. As described more fully in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003235.s002">Text S1</xref>, the model considers that a fraction <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003235.e101" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in (0, 1) of all G genes is involved in the phenotype in the sense that error-free measurements in some cell type would detect and confirm this involvement. However, both primary detections and secondary confirmations are subject to additional sources of variation. On average over the full set of siRNAs, there is a knockdown threshold parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003235.e102" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the range (0, 1) indicating the frequency with which a single siRNA would reduce expression and function of a targeted gene sufficiently to cause detection or confirmation if the gene were involved and if knockdown and phenotypic readout were free of errors and other interfering effects (see next paragraph). Since siRNA pools show greater phenotypic penetration than an individual siRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Parsons1">[38]</xref>, the model further specifies how detection/confirmation rates increase as we apply more siRNAs targeting the same gene (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003235-g002">Figure 2A</xref> illustrates the conditional independence relationships of observable, reported data and latent variables in this statistical model, while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003235-g002">Figure 2B</xref> shows the nature of the distributions that were assumed for each variable.</p>
<p>As a separate issue from the frequency of phenotypically significant knockdown at the mRNA level, we allow that many factors could block a study from detecting a phenotype associated with an involved gene. We lump these factors into study-specific accessibility parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003235.e103" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sub>,</sub> which accommodate many factors specific to cell types and conditions used in different studies. Examples of such potentially confounding factors include whether the range of genes targeted by the siRNA library used; whether the cells and conditions used for a targeted mRNA is not expressed; if the mRNA is too abundant to be cleared within the period of RNAi treatment; if the functional protein product is too long-lived to be depleted over the measurement time course; if knockdown induces general cytotoxicity, which is usually taken to disqualify scoring for specific involvement; or if the phenotypic effect of knocking down an involved gene is masked by functional redundancies such as expressed homologs, parallel pathways, etc.. All other false negative measurement errors are monitored by type II error parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003235.e104" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which were also made study specific since this improved model fit. Finally, the model allows false-positive detections or confirmations to occur either because of off-target effects (the parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003235.e105" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the mean number of off-targets per siRNA) or by type I measurement error (parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003235.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Numerical and Monte Carlo methods were used to obtain parameter estimates and approximate confidence intervals using only a set of modeling assumptions and the multi-study detection/confirmation records (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref> and Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003235.s002">Text S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Model validation by multiple diagnostic checks</title>
<p>We computed three simulation diagnostics to check the internal validity of the model-based inferences, as detailed in Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003235.s003">Text S2</xref>, Section 2. First we performed a consistency check to assure the integrity of the modeling calculations and their implementation in software (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003235.s003">Text S2</xref>-2.1). Likelihood theory predicts that maximum likelihood parameter estimates computed from ever increasing data sets converge to the underlying parameter settings when the model is identifiable. Thus, we simulated gene-level data from the model, under various parameter settings, and demonstrated that as the genome size increases these settings were recovered.</p>
<p>Second, we performed predictive checks to examine properties of synthetic data generated from the fitted probability model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003235.s003">Text S2</xref>-2.2). Table S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003235.s003">Text S2</xref> demonstrated that simulations of the estimated generative model recapitulate statistical patterns seen in the observed data. For example, Figure S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003235.s003">Text S2</xref> plots the number of confirmations against the number of detections, both in the observed data and in hypothetical repeats. The goodness-of-fit is compelling in this plot and in several other summaries (Table S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003235.s003">Text S2</xref>; Figure S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003235.s003">Text S2</xref>).</p>
<p>For the third check, we did leave-one-study-out diagnostics. We fitted the model four times, once to each subset of three studies obtained by leaving out a single study's results (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003235.s003">Text S2</xref>-2.3). The cross-validation findings indicate stability of the parameter estimates (Table S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003235.s003">Text S2</xref>) as well as accuracy in predictions of the left-out studies (Table S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003235.s003">Text S2</xref>).</p>
<p>We plotted and compared the distribution of gene counts across the 81 possible patterns (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003235-t003">Table 3</xref>) between simulated and experimental data, and the simulation results generated from model fits accurately reflected the experimental data (Figure S7 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003235.s003">Text S2</xref>). Therefore, our model faithfully simulates actual RNAi studies.</p>

<title>Estimation of parameters governing the output of RNAi studies</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003235-t004">Table 4</xref> reports all parameter estimates in the fitted model. The threshold parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003235.e109" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the frequency of effective knockdown at the mRNA level was estimated to be 75–99% (95% CI), which indicates that there is a fairly high chance for an involved gene to be scored as positive, if the gene is accessible and measured in an error free system. The largest factor affecting inter-study agreement was the general accessibility rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003235.e110" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which we estimated separately for each study to improve model fit, and which ranged from 5–17% (95% CI across all studies). In other words, these results imply that, in a typical genome-wide RNAi study, most influenza virus-involved genes are inaccessible because, as noted above, one or more of many potential confounding factors either blocks knockdown or interrupts the transfer of this effect into a measurable phenotype. Biological factors and measurements consistent with such limited genetic accessibility are considered in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Discussion</xref>.</p>

<p>Another study-specific error causing false negatives is type II measurement error, which depending on individual study setup contributes 1–50% false negatives (95% CI across all studies). By contrast, both parameters dictating the frequency of false positives were estimated to be low. The type I measurement error <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003235.e111" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is estimated at 0.3%, which corresponds to approximately one false-positive well per 384-well plate. The off-target rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003235.e112" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is further discussed in the next section.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3g">
<title>Off-target effects and experimental confirmation rates</title>
<p>Besides type I measurement error, false positives can also result from knocking down an unintended gene during RNAi, i.e., the off-target effect. In our model estimation, the off-target rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003235.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was lower than initially expected, with an estimated average of up to 0.032 off-target genes per siRNA. We wondered if this finding might be attributable to our use of a Poisson distribution model for the number of off-targets per siRNA and performed robustness checks to test this assumption (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003235.s003">Text S2</xref>-2.4). Little is known about the details of off-target distributions, although computational predictions from a Drosophila dsRNA library suggest a highly non-Poisson structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Kulkarni1">[33]</xref>. In fact, the Poisson assumption made little difference for parameter estimation, as evidenced by computations done under a highly over-dispersed negative-binomial alternative to the Poisson (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003235.s003">Text S2</xref>-2.4).</p>

<title>Likelihood estimation prefers a small off-target rate.</title>
<p>Maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) are parameter settings that provide the best explanation for observed multi-study agreement counts, yet the estimate for ν, the mean number of off-targets per siRNA, is surprisingly small (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003235-t004">Table 4</xref>). Profile likelihood provides additional insight into this effect. At each fixed ν on a fine grid we found MLEs of the remaining system parameters as well as the maximum (log) likelihood (Panel A). The decreasing profile likelihood re-expresses the inference that fit decays if we insist on moderate to large values for ν. One reason for the poor fit is seen in a comparison of (study averaged) detection and confirmation rates computed at the profile MLEs (Panel B). Although the best fitting detection rate (green) matches the empirical detection rate regardless of ν, the best fitting confirmation rate (red) is much lower than its empirical counterpart. The profile MLE values can also be converted to false discovery rates (FDR) and false non-discovery rates (FNDR), as shown in Panel C. In the regime preferred by the observed multi-study counts (small ν), false negatives dominate, but the opposite inference follows if ν is large.</p>

<title>False negatives are more prevalent than false positives</title>
<p>False-positive and false-negative rates can be defined in various ways, depending on the reference set of genes. Using estimates and uncertainties in the model parameters, we estimated the false discovery rate (FDR), the false non-discovery rate (FNDR), the false positive rate (FP) and the false negative rate (FN), and we obtained posterior distributions for each in order to get approximate confidence intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003235-g009">Figure 9</xref>). FDR, which is widely used in high-throughput studies, is the rate of false positives among all statistically significant findings. In the case of the influenza study, the FDR is the probability that a gene is not involved with influenza given that this gene was confirmed in a secondary screen to be involved (i.e., the denominator counts the number of confirmations). Similarly FNDR is the probability of involvement given the gene is not confirmed (whether or not it is detected). For design purposes it is often useful to think of errors relative to the true set of involved genes (FN) or non-involved genes (FP). By either sets of measures, the clear indication from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003235-g009">Figure 9</xref> is that false-negative factors dominate false-positive factors in explaining the limited agreement among studies. Thus, the low overlap among the confirmed gene lists of the different studies arises principally due to missed genes.</p>

<title>Estimated total number of virus-involved cellular genes</title>
<p>Since the above results infer that the low gene level overlap between and among the four documented studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003235-g001">Figure 1</xref>) is primarily due to false negatives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003235-g009">Figure 9</xref>), the total number of involved genes is expected to be significantly more than the 614 confirmed in these initial studies.

<p>If the four analyzed RNAi studies are the first in a possibly long sequence of similar genome wide efforts, one could ask what is likely to happen in the remaining studies. An answer is possible via posterior predictive inference, which accounts for both random fluctuations inherent in study-specific data as well as uncertainty in the system parameters. Summarized above are predictions from 2000 simulated study sequences, with each sequence determined by a parameter setting obtained by Markov chain Monte Carlo and subsequently with future-study counts simulated prospectively from the specified multinomial model.

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Individual genome-wide RNAi studies each identifies a subset of relevant genes</title>
<p>Although individual genome-wide RNAi studies typically implicate from one to several hundred genes in a given biological process, multiple independent findings in our results indicate that such studies typically miss most involved genes due to a high false-negative rate during primary genome-wide screening. Thus, the results of each study provide a partial glimpse into a larger, interconnected whole. For the influenza virus studies examined here, e.g., although the gene level agreement between RNAi studies is relatively low (mean overlap fraction 6.7%), much higher levels of agreement between studies (19%) exist at the level of functional categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003235-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Further, we found that the gene sets implicated in independent studies are highly connected by interactions among their protein products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003235-g006">Figures 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003235-g007">7</xref>). These analyses examined the implicated genes from different perspectives, but all indicated that the gene sets identified in independent studies are significantly related. We conclude that, in general, functional pathways are better represented than individual genes in genome-wide RNAi studies, that independent RNAi studies add value, and that single RNAi studies can be valuable, particularly if interpreted in light of these and other insights.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4b">
<title>Modeling confirms that false negative errors exceed false positives</title>
<p>Using the measurements from the four influenza virus studies, we developed a statistical model to estimate critical parameters that control the output of genome-wide RNAi studies. The model was designed to reflect the experimental process of RNAi screening and to utilize the available published information from such screens. Our model was refined through several rounds of iteration and fits the experimental data very well (Table S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003235.s003">Text S2</xref>, Figure S2, S3 and S7 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003235.s003">Text S2</xref>). The leave-one-out test showed that the range and medians of the model estimations match the real experimental data well (Table S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003235.s003">Text S2</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to other insights, our statistical modeling confirmed that an individual genome-wide RNAi study generally will only identify a small portion of genes implicated in a biological process. The model further indicates that this partial coverage results predominantly from false-negative errors in the high-throughput, genome-wide primary gene detection phase of the analysis, and that false positives in the more focused, repeated validation phase of analysis are much rarer. Below we discuss factors related to these false-positive and false-negative rates.</p>
<p>As noted above, many issues might lead to false discoveries in a genome-wide high-throughput screen. However, to reduce false discoveries, all four studies in our meta-analysis incorporated validation testing of implicated genes with independent siRNAs and multiple repeats. Stringent statistics were used to control the false discovery rate, normally to below 5%. Accordingly, such validated genes, although only confirmed in one study, are unlikely to be false positives.</p>
<p>A potentially significant issue causing false positives for any RNAi knockdown study (either single gene or genome-wide) is the possibility of off-target effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Jackson1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Jackson2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Kulkarni1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Sigoillot1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Stertz1">[40]</xref>. In most genome-wide RNAi studies, including the four analyzed here, the potential for off-target effects in the initial screening phase is addressed by requiring the knock-down phenotype to be independently confirmed by independent, usually multiple tests with two or more distinct siRNAs against the target gene. As siRNAs with distinct sequences are unlikely to affect overlapping off-target genes, such testing considerably reduces the potential for off-target induced false positives. Indeed, the estimated off target rate was low, according to model based calculations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003235-t004">Table 4</xref>). Our further analysis showed that if we forced the off-target rate to be higher, the model fit the data poorly and did not explain the observed confirmation rates of &gt;50% of the detected genes. Increasing the off target rate to ∼5 genes/siRNA, e.g., shifts the estimated confirmation rate to 5% or less, which contradicts the data from all four studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003235-g008">Figure 8B</xref>), and amplifies the estimated gene involvement rate to over 80%, which appears unlikely from many practical and biological considerations. The actual model-estimated rate of host gene involvement of 12% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003235-t004">Table 4</xref>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003235.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), while higher than predicted from individual studies, is consistent with the many empirical and <italic>a priori</italic> considerations supporting the conclusion that true negatives should significantly outnumber true positives in such screens for viral dependency factors.</p>
<p>By comparison, the sheer scale and technical challenges of genome-wide studies presently make false negatives hard to control in the initial detection phase of global RNAi studies. Because of the large number of samples to test (typically tens of thousands), only limited replicates (typically 2 or 3) can be performed in the primary, genome-wide screens. Furthermore, simultaneous processing of hundreds to thousands of samples in microwell plates makes it impossible to individually optimize many critical parameters, such as assay timing, for knockdown analysis of each gene. Moreover, choices made to facilitate such high-throughput analysis, such as tractable endpoints, assays or virus genotypes may further affect the ability to detect at least some phenotypic effects. These and other factors noted below, including genetic redundancies, can restrict detection sensitivities and reduce phenotypic impacts, jeopardizing the detection of potentially positive phenotypes against the background of often significant experimental noise in such large-scale, high-throughput measurements.</p>
<p>Indeed, relative to most cell-based screens, screens for effects on viral replication are subject to additional variability associated with fluctuations in the efficiencies of initial and later stages of infection. Notably, substantial portions of such variations in infection efficiency are correlated with cell density, cell size and other local population features of the cultured cells, and appropriate normalization for such factors can significantly improve the consistency of the assay results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Snijder1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Knapp1">[25]</xref>. In addition to such within-screen variability, and as noted in part above, variability between independent screens is increased by differences in viral genotypes, cells, culture conditions, assay design (partial or full virus lifecycle, direct or indirect readout, timing, etc.), and similar experimental issues (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003235-t001">Table 1</xref>). This combination of issues, plus additional sources of variable and systematic errors noted in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref>, makes the use of appropriate quality control practices and analytical methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Zhang3">[27]</xref> particularly critical for virus-oriented screens.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4c">
<title>Low gene accessibility is a major obstacle for identifying implicated genes</title>
<p>Besides the above technical challenges, our statistical inference indicates that a major contributing issue to false negatives is low gene accessibility, i.e., the portion of genes for which the method of a given RNAi study can show a corresponding loss-of-function phenotype if the gene is involved. Specifically, our fitted statistical model estimated from the data of the four influenza virus studies that only ∼10% of tested genes could be effectively assayed by RNAi knockdown for phenotypes in any one study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003235-t004">Table 4</xref>).</p>
<p>This statistically inferred low gene accessibility is consistent with and presumably results from multiple aspects of host cell biology. First, genes not expressed in the specific cell type used for an RNAi study will not show any phenotype upon attempted knocked down. In analyses of gene expression in 84 human tissues and cell lines using high coverage Affymetrix DNA microarrays, only 37% of total probes were found to have moderate or higher expression in at least one cell type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Lopes1">[41]</xref>. These probes mapped to 9214 different genes, and the number of genes expressed in each cell type ranged from 484 (ovary tissue) to 6038 (B lymphoblast). In lung tissue, relevant to influenza virus infection, only 3355 genes, or ∼15% of the total were expressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Lopes1">[41]</xref>. Thus, in many cell types, a relatively small fraction of genes may exhibit sufficiently high expression to produce measurable phenotypic effects. Moreover, the particular sets of genes that are functionally expressed vary between different tissue and cell types in vivo, and between different cells and cell lines in culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Lopes1">[41]</xref>. Accordingly, RNAi screening in different cell lines will reveal contributions from different genes, either directly because of differences in the expression of particular tested genes or indirectly, because the contribution of a tested gene can be masked by other complementing genes that are differentially expressed between the cell lines (see also below).</p>
<p>Second, in genome-wide RNAi studies, genes that cause cytoxicity when knocked down are generally excluded from analysis. In the A549<sub>DE</sub> study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Karlas2">[8]</xref>, e.g., 1520 siRNAs were judged to be cytotoxic and were omitted from further analysis.</p>
<p>Third, as cells have been selected for functional robustness, knocking down expression of a single gene may have little phenotypic effect when additional genes provide similar functions. Multiple mechanisms for such genetic redundancy have been recognized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Pasek1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Hsiao1">[43]</xref>, including homologous genes with overlapping functions, parallel metabolic or regulatory pathways, and other processes. Such buffering effects appear to be common since many genes are members of multi-gene families and many examples are known where two or more genes must be simultaneously inhibited to produce a phenotype.</p>
<p>Finally, the phenotypic efficiency of an siRNA depends on many factors including the level of the targeted mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Arvey1">[44]</xref> and the half-life of its encoded protein. Notably, many proteins with half-lives in days cannot be sufficiently depleted within the time frame of an RNAi screen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Sigoillot1">[39]</xref>. All of the above factors combine to mask phenotypes and reduce the number of genes that can be characterized through current RNAi screening.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4d">
<title>Implications for further genome-wide RNAi studies</title>
<p>Our results provide useful approaches for conducting and interpreting genome-wide RNAi studies. Our statistical model provides a framework to describe a complicated biological assay, genome-wide RNAi, by modeling factors that can contribute to the final output. Such factors include general measurement errors that affect many assays, as well as factors specific to RNAi, such as off-target effects and gene accessibility. The model structure is not specific to influenza virus or even to virus infection. Thus we expect that the approach is applicable to genome wide RNAi studies of many cellular phenotypes. To test this, we applied the model-based estimation method to a collection of three genome-wide RNAi studies for HIV host factors (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003235.s003">Text S2</xref>, Section 5). The resulting HIV-derived parameter estimates were comparable to those from influenza virus, although an even lower overlap among the implicated gene sets led to a higher estimate of the involvement rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003235.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, at 28% (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003235.s003">Text S2</xref>, Table S6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003235.s003">Text S2</xref>).</p>
<p>As noted above, multiple findings imply that a key contributing factor to false-negative results is low gene accessibility. In future studies this could be addressed by performing screens in a variety of cell lines and possibly by expanding the time points and assay conditions used. In addition, insightful bioinformatics analysis with implicated genes could expand interpretation of host factors involved in virus infection by integrating information from other genome-wide or single gene studies. Insights from such analysis could be used to focus future studies on selected pathways to further test their involvement. Useful examples of such bioinformatic extensions include recent studies analyzing host genes required for HIV replication in the context of protein-protein interaction and other networking properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-MacPherson1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003235-Murali1">[47]</xref>. These studies offer experimentally useful insights into the functional organization of such genes and their interactions with HIV and, like the results presented here, also explicitly suggest that many host factors required for HIV replication remain to be discovered.</p>
<p>Additional information will help to refine the working probability model and thus provide a more accurate description of genome-wide RNAi studies. Our model was necessarily based on available published data, which was generally limited to lists of genes implicated in the primary detection screen and confirmed in the secondary validation test. To enrich understanding and modeling such RNAi screens, we strongly support publishing full genome-wide data from such studies, including data on genes excluded either for cell toxicity or low expression.</p>
