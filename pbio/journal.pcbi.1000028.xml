Here, we show that the space of shapes adopted by the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is low dimensional, with just four dimensions accounting for 95% of the shape variance. These dimensions provide a quantitative description of worm behavior, and we partially reconstruct “equations of motion” for the dynamics in this space. These dynamics have multiple attractors, and we find that the worm visits these in a rapid and almost completely deterministic response to weak thermal stimuli. Stimulus-dependent correlations among the different modes suggest that one can generate more reliable behaviors by synchronizing stimuli to the state of the worm in shape space. We confirm this prediction, effectively “steering” the worm in real time.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>A great deal of work has been done in characterizing the genes, proteins, neurons, and circuits that are involved in the biology of behavior, but the techniques used to quantify behavior have lagged behind the advancements made in these areas. Here, we address this imbalance in a domain rich enough to allow complex, natural behavior yet simple enough so that movements can be explored exhaustively: the motions of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> freely crawling on an agar plate. From measurements of the worm's curvature, we show that the space of natural worm postures is low dimensional and can be almost completely described by their projections along four principal “eigenworms.” The dynamics along these eigenworms offer both a quantitative characterization of classical worm movement such as forward crawling, reversals, and Omega-turns, and evidence of more subtle behaviors such as pause states at particular postures. We can partially construct equations of motion for this shape space, and within these dynamics we find a set of attractors that can be used as a rigorous definition of behavioral state. Our observations of <italic>C. elegans</italic> reveal a precise and complete language of motion and new aspects of worm behavior. We believe this is a lesson with promise for other organisms.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>We have received no specific funding for this work</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The study of animal behavior is rooted in two divergent traditions. One approach creates well-controlled situations, in which animals are forced to choose among a small discrete set of behaviors, as in psychophysical experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000028-Green1">[1]</xref>. The other, taken by ethologists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000028-Bolhuis1">[2]</xref>, describes the richness of the behaviors seen in more natural contexts. One might hope that simpler organisms provide model systems in which the tension between these approaches can be resolved, leading to a fully quantitative description of complex, naturalistic behavior.</p><p>Here we explore the motor behavior of the nematode, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, moving freely on an agar plate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000028-Geng1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000028-Roussel1">[9]</xref>. Though lacking the full richness of a natural environment, this unconstrained motion allows for complex patterns of spontaneous motor behaviors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000028-Croll1">[10]</xref>, which are modulated in response to chemical, thermal and mechanical stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000028-Bargmann1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000028-Chalfie1">[13]</xref>. Using video microscopy of the worm's movements, we find a low dimensional but essentially complete description of the macroscopic motor behavior. Within this low dimensional space we reconstruct equations of motion which reveal multiple attractors—candidates for a rigorous definition of behavioral states. We show that these states are visited as part of a surprisingly reproducible response of <italic>C. elegans</italic> to small temperature changes. Correlations among fluctuations along the different behavioral dimensions suggest that some of the randomness in the behavioral responses could be removed if sensory stimuli are delivered only when the worm is at a well defined initial state. We present experimental evidence in favor of this idea, showing that worms can be “steered” in real time by appropriately synchronized stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Eigenworms</title><p>We use tracking microscopy with high spatial and temporal resolution to extract the two-dimensional shape of individual <italic>C. elegans</italic> from images of freely moving worms over long periods of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000028-g001">Figure 1A</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).

Because these modes are eigenvectors of a covariance matrix their instantaneous amplitudes are not linearly correlated, but this does not mean that the dynamics of the different motions are completely uncoupled. We found the clearest indications of mode coupling between the phase in the {<italic>a</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>a</italic><sub>2</sub>} plane and the amplitude <italic>a</italic><sub>3</sub> at later times, which is illustrated by the correlation function in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000028-g006">Figure 6B</xref>. The diagonal band of positive correlation reflects the phase dependent bending motions of normal crawling. This pattern of correlations is perturbed strongly by thermal stimuli (<italic>t</italic>, <italic>t</italic>′&gt;0). The fact that the correlations between phase and the turning mode are stimulus dependent implies that the response of the turning mode to thermal stimuli depends on the phase which the worm finds itself at the time of the stimulus. Perhaps some of the apparent randomness of turning responses thus is related to the fact that repeated thermal stimuli catch the worm at different initial phases. To test this idea, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000028-g006">Figure 6C</xref> shows the average response of <italic>a</italic><sub>3</sub> when worms are thermally stimulated with their head turned to either the dorsal or ventral side. Worms stimulated when making a ventral head swing (−2≤<italic>φ</italic>≤−1) make bends in the dorsal direction (<italic>a</italic><sub>3</sub>&lt;0), and vice versa. Note that the thermal pulse itself does not have a handedness, so that if the pulses are not synchronized to the state of the worm there should be no systematic preference for dorsal vs. ventral handed turns. As a further test of this idea, we implemented our analysis online, allowing an estimate of the phase with a delay of less than 125 ms. We then deliver an infrared pulse when the phase falls within a phase window that corresponds to either dorsal– or ventral– directed head swings. The predicted consequence is that the worm should turn in the opposite direction to the laser stimulation, and is confirmed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000028-g006">Figure 6D</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our central result is a new, quantitative, and low-dimensional description of <italic>C. elegans</italic> motor behavior. Conceptually similar results have been obtained for aspects of motor control in humans and other primates, where postures or trajectories of limbs, hands or eyes are confined to spaces of low dimensionality despite the potential for more complex motions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000028-dAvella1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000028-Osborne1">[27]</xref>. For <italic>C. elegans</italic> itself, recent quantitative work has focused on simplifying behavior by matching to a discrete set of template behaviors, such as forward and backward motion of the center of mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000028-Hoshi1">[5]</xref>, sinusoidal undulations of the body <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000028-Karbowski1">[6]</xref>, or Ω bends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000028-Huang1">[7]</xref>. Our results combine and generalize these ideas. Motor behaviors are described by projection of the body shape onto a small set of templates (the eigenworms), but the strengths of these projections vary continuously. The templates are sinuous, but not sinusoidal, because the fluctuations in posture are not homogeneous along the length of the worm. Our description of shape is intrinsic to the worm and invariant to the center of mass position, but motion in shape space predicts the center of mass motion. There are discrete behavioral states, but these emerge as attractors of the underlying dynamics. Most importantly, our choice of four eigenworms is driven not by hypotheses about the relevant components of behavior, but by the data itself.</p><p>The construction of the eigenworms guarantees that the instantaneous amplitudes along the different dimensions of shape space are not correlated linearly, but the dynamics of the different amplitudes are nonlinear and coupled; what we think of as a single motor action always involves coordinating multiple degrees of freedom. Thus, forward and backward motion correspond to positive and negative phase velocity in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000028-g003">Figure 3</xref>, but transitions between these behavioral states occur preferentially at particular phases. Similarly, turns involve large amplitude excursions along <italic>a</italic><sub>3</sub>, but motion along this mode is correlated with phase in the ({<italic>a</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>a</italic><sub>2</sub>}) plane, and this correlation itself has structure in time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000028-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). The problems of <italic>C. elegans</italic> motor control are simpler than for higher animals, but these nonlinear, coupled dynamics give a glimpse of the more general case.</p><p>Perhaps because of the strong coupling between the turning mode <italic>a</italic><sub>3</sub> and the wriggling modes <italic>a</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>a</italic><sub>2</sub>, we have not found an equation of motion for <italic>a</italic><sub>3</sub> alone which would be analogous to Equation 4 for the phase. Further work is required to construct a fully three dimensional dynamics which could predict the more complex correlations such as those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000028-g006">Figure 6B</xref>. Turning should emerge from these equations not as another attractor, but as an ‘excitable’ orbit analogous to the action potential in the Hodgkin–Huxley equations or to recent ideas about transient differentiation in genetic circuits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000028-Suel1">[28]</xref>. A major challenge would be to show that the stochastic dynamics of these equations can generate longer sequences of stereotyped events, such as pirouettes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000028-PierceShimomura1">[29]</xref>.</p><p>We have shown that a meaningful set of behavioral coordinates can uncover deterministic responses. A response might seem stochastic or noisy because it depends on one or more behavioral variables that are not being considered. In our experiments, nonlinear correlations among the behavioral variables suggest that some of the randomness in behavioral responses could be removed if sensory stimuli are delivered only when the worm is at a well defined initial state, and we confirmed this prediction by showing that phase–aligned thermal stimuli can ‘steer’ the worm into trajectories with a definite chirality. A crucial aspect of these experiments is that the stimulus is scalar—a temperature change in time has no spatial direction or handedness—but the response, by virtue of the correlation between stimulus and body shape, does have a definite spatial structure. The alignment of thermal stimuli with the phase of the worm's movement in these experiments mimics the correlation between body shape and sensory input that occurs as the worm crawls in a thermal gradient, so the enhanced determinism of responses under these conditions may be connected to the computations which generate nearly deterministic isothermal tracking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000028-Ryu1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000028-Luo1">[30]</xref>.</p><p>More generally, all behavioral responses have some mixture of deterministic and stochastic components.

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000028-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, the time-dependent probability density <italic>ρ</italic><sub>t</sub>(<italic>ω</italic>) was smoothed before the onset of the impulse with a gaussian low-pass filter of size 0.19 s in the <italic>t</italic> direction and 0.17 cycles/s in the <italic>ω</italic> direction. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000028-g006">Figure 6B</xref> the correlation function <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000028.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was calculated as follows. Far from the time of the impulse (frames 800 to 1574, impulse on frame 400), we expect time-translation invariance <italic>C</italic><sub>post</sub>(<italic>t</italic>, <italic>t</italic>′) = <italic>g</italic>(<italic>t</italic>–<italic>t</italic>′)+ξ<sub>post</sub>(<italic>t</italic>, <italic>t</italic>′) where g(Δ) = 〈C(<italic>i</italic>,<italic>j</italic>)〉<italic><sub>i</sub></italic><sub>–<italic>j = </italic>Δ</sub> is the true correlation function and ξ<sub>post</sub>(<italic>t</italic>,<italic>t</italic>′) characterizes statistical error. Similarly in a time window around the impulse (frames 24 to 800), <italic>C</italic><sub>stim</sub>(<italic>t</italic>, <italic>t</italic>′) = <italic>g</italic>(<italic>t–t</italic>′)+ξ<sub>stim</sub>(<italic>t</italic>, <italic>t</italic>′). However, the thermal impulse breaks this invariance and ξ<sub>stim</sub>(<italic>t</italic>, <italic>t</italic>′) contains both sampling fluctuations and stimulus-dependent correlation dynamics. To separate these effects we use singular value decomposition to compare ξ<sub>post</sub> and ξ<sub>stim</sub>. We write each matrix ξ<sub>post/stim</sub>(<italic>t</italic>, <italic>t</italic>′) = ∑<sub>t″</sub><italic>U</italic><sub>post/stim</sub>(<italic>t</italic>, <italic>t</italic>″)<italic>S</italic><sub>post/stim</sub>(<italic>t</italic>″, <italic>t</italic>″)<italic>V</italic><sub>post/stim</sub>(<italic>t</italic>″, <italic>t</italic>′) and find that only two singular values of ξ<sub>stim</sub> are significantly larger than ξ<sub>post</sub>. We then reconstruct the two-point function around the stimulus as <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000028.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Thermal Steering</title><p>Preparation of worms and instrumentation were the same as described for the thermal impulse response. However, instead of processing worm images off-line, real-time calculation of the eigenworms and shape phase <italic>φ</italic> was done using custom dynamic-linked image processing libraries written in C along with supporting LabVIEW code. The modes were computed as previously described except that the spline interpolation algorithm was replaced with a Hermitian interpolation algorithm to reduce the processing time. The processing time was short enough to simultaneously track and calculate modes at 8 Hz. For phase dependent measurements, the laser was fired when the worm was moving forward and <italic>φ</italic> fell within a prescribed interval (width 1 radian). The laser pulse (150 mW) lasted for 75 ms and caused a temperature increase of 0.12°C. For each run a pair of triggering phase windows (0 to −1, and 2.1 to 3.1 radians) corresponding to the dorsal- and ventral-directed head swing was used. The sequence of each run started with a 5 minute period of no stimulus followed by the pair of phase dependent stimuli. The order of each pair of stimulus conditions was switched for each successive run. For the randomized pulse control experiments, the laser was fired with a uniform phase probability, but with conditions that restricted the firing interval to be longer than 2 seconds.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Steering and Turn Identification</title><p>The time-average change in orientation of the worm's path, 〈<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000028.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>〉 (rad/s), was calculated from the angular changes between the positions of the center of mass of the worm during forward runs of at least 4 s in length.

Since the distributions were Gaussian (data not shown) with similar variance, we used the Student's t-test to determine if the values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000028.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> under thermal stimulation were significantly different than the control (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). Since we were interested in the change in orientation during forward motion we excluded trajectory data that contained large turns or reversals along with angular changes greater than π/4 radians. These events were automatically detected by measuring the compactness of the worm shape. Compactness was calculated by measuring the longest distance between two points in the worm shape (also known as the max feret distance) and normalizing this with the maximum value for the entire data run. Turns were flagged when the compactness fell below 0.6.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank D. Chigirev, S. E. Palmer, E. Schneidman, and G. Tkačik for discussions, and A. R.
