      <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001068-g001"/>Tuberculosis is an age-old scourge of
                mankind. This chronic disease is caused by a bacterium, <italic>Mycobacterium
                    tuberculosis</italic>, which sets up an initial infection in its victims'
                lungs. Although the infection can spread to other organs, its most common symptoms
                are a painful and debilitating cough combined with difficulty breathing.
                Tuberculosis remains a major public health threat because even the best antibiotics
                currently available take a long time to clear the infection, and noncompliance with
                protracted antibiotic regimens can lead to the evolution and spread of
                drug-resistant strains.</p>
      <p>In order to better treat the disease, it will be important to understand how
                    <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> resists even the most powerful antibiotics for
                so long. One clue is that most antibiotics work best on rapidly growing populations
                of bacteria, but it's been observed that once <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>
                has established its initial infection, it is capable of dramatically slowing its
                metabolism and rate of cell division. This has led to the suggestion that the
                bacterium's retreat into a hibernation-like state underlies its remarkable
                resistance to antibiotic therapy. How does the bacterium execute this strategy?
                That's the question that Seung-Hun Baek, Alice Li, and Christopher Sassetti
                tackled in work published in this issue of <italic>PLoS Biology</italic>.</p>
      <p>In order to identify pathways that regulate bacterial growth, Sassetti's group
                subjected the bacteria to mutagenesis, hoping to disrupt genes that govern growth.
                They then examined the mutated cells to find ones that failed to arrest their growth
                in vitro in the presence of low oxygen, which normally causes growth arrest. Next,
                they used a method called transposon site hybridization to identify all of the
                mutations that give rise to this altered phenotype. Using this technique, Baek et
                al. observed that proteins involved in the production of the lipid triacylglycerol
                (TAG), in particular a protein called Tgs1, were required if bacterial cells were to
                arrest their growth in a low-oxygen environment.</p>
      <p>Tgs1 synthesizes TAG from a precursor molecule called acetyl CoA. But in addition to
                its role in TAG synthesis, acetyl CoA is also a major substrate of the citric acid
                cycle, the central metabolic pathway that fuels growth. Sassetti's group
                therefore wondered whether, under conditions of stress, the bacteria use TAG
                synthesis to deliberately divert acetyl CoA away from growth-promoting metabolic
                pathways. Indeed, they found that adding a downstream metabolite of the citric acid
                cycle prevents bacteria from entering growth arrest after exposure to low oxygen or
                other stressors (for example, iron deprivation and low pH). Likewise, increasing the
                level of the citric acid cycle enzyme that competes with Tgs1 for access to acetyl
                CoA also short-circuits growth arrest. Consistent with the idea that bacteria are
                diverting acetyl CoA away from the citric acid cycle, the authors' data also
                show that when Tgs1 is present, more acetyl CoA ends up incorporated into
                triacylglycerides than is used for energy metabolism.</p>
      <p>Because bacteria lacking Tgs1 grow more rapidly than wild-type bacteria, the authors
                suspected that Tgs1-deficient bacteria might also be more susceptible to
                antibiotics. To test this idea, they compared the survival of antibiotic-treated
                wild-type and Tgs1-deficient bacteria in low-oxygen conditions in vitro, and in
                infected mice. In fact, several different antibiotics killed wild-type bacteria much
                more slowly than they killed Tgs1-deficient bacteria, indicating that bacterial
                ability to slow growth through TAG synthesis is an important determinant of
                antibiotic resistance.</p>
      <p>Together, these findings help to illuminate a major pathway that <italic>M.
                    tuberculosis</italic> uses to alter its metabolism in response to environmental
                stress. This response, argues, could help <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> prevent
                overutilization of necessary nutrients, allowing the bacteria to continue living in
                a hostile host environment. It also, incidentally, helps clarify the contribution of
                metabolic rate (and TAG synthesis) to the bacteria's ability to resist the best
                antibiotic weapons humans have yet been able to marshal against them. Now that this
                relationship is better understood, it may be possible to design a way to
                deliberately disrupt the bacterial stress response and so improve antibiotic
                efficacy.</p>
