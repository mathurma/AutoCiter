				<article-title>Who Needs Sex (or Males) Anyway?</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>Asexuals are an important test case for theories of why species exist. If asexual clades displayed the same pattern of discrete variation as sexual clades, this would challenge the traditional view that sex is necessary for diversification into species. However, critical evidence has been lacking: all putative examples have involved organisms with recent or ongoing histories of recombination and have relied on visual interpretation of patterns of genetic and phenotypic variation rather than on formal tests of alternative evolutionary scenarios. Here we show that a classic asexual clade, the bdelloid rotifers, has diversified into distinct evolutionary species. Intensive sampling of the genus <italic>Rotaria</italic> reveals the presence of well-separated genetic clusters indicative of independent evolution. Moreover, combined genetic and morphological analyses reveal divergent selection in feeding morphology, indicative of niche divergence. Some of the morphologically coherent groups experiencing divergent selection contain several genetic clusters, in common with findings of cryptic species in sexual organisms. Our results show that the main causes of speciation in sexual organisms, population isolation and divergent selection, have the same qualitative effects in an asexual clade. The study also demonstrates how combined molecular and morphological analyses can shed new light on the evolutionary nature of species.</p>

          <title/>
          <p>The evolution of distinct species has often been considered a property solely of sexually reproducing organisms. In fact, however, there is little evidence as to whether asexual groups do or do not diversify into species. We show that a famous group of asexual animals, the bdelloid rotifers, has diversified into distinct species broadly equivalent to those found in sexual groups. We surveyed diversity within a single clade, the genus <italic>Rotaria,</italic> from a range of habitats worldwide, using DNA sequences and measurements of jaw morphology from scanning electron microscopy. New statistical methods for the combined analysis of morphology and DNA sequence data confirmed two fundamental properties of species, namely, independent evolution and ecological divergence by natural selection. The two properties did not always coincide to define unambiguous species groups, but this finding is common in sexual groups as well. The results show that sex is not a necessary condition for speciation. The methods offer the potential for increasing our understanding of the nature of species boundaries across a wide range of organisms.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Species are fundamental units of biology, but there remains uncertainty on both the pattern and processes of species existence. Are species real evolutionary entities or convenient figments of taxonomists' imagination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b003">3</xref>]? If they exist, what are the main processes causing organisms to diversify [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b004">4</xref>]? Despite considerable debate, surprisingly few studies have formally tested the evolutionary status of species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b006">6</xref>].</p>
      <p>One central question concerning the nature of species has been whether asexual organisms diversify into species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b001">1</xref>]. The traditional view is that species in sexual clades arise mainly because interbreeding maintains cohesion within species, whereas reproductive isolation causes divergence between species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b007">7</xref>]. If so, asexuals might not diversify into distinct species, because there is no interbreeding to maintain cohesive units above the level of the individual. However, if other processes were more important for maintaining cohesion and causing divergence, for example, specialization into distinct niches, then asexuals should diversify in a manner similar to sexuals, although the rate and magnitude of divergence might differ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b011">11</xref>].</p>
      <p>Empirical evidence to test these ideas has been rare. Most asexual animal and plant lineages are of recent origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b012">12</xref>]. The diffuse patterns of variation typical of such taxa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b013">13</xref>] could simply reflect their failure to survive long enough for speciation to occur or the effects of ongoing gene flow from their sexual ancestors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b012">12</xref>]. Distinct genetic and phenotypic clusters have been demonstrated in bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b017">17</xref>] and discussed as possible evidence for clonal speciation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b001">1</xref>]. However, all the study clades engage in rare or even frequent recombination as well as clonal reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b019">19</xref>]. Although horizontal gene transfer can occur between distantly related bacteria, homologous recombination occurs only at appreciable frequency between closely related strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b021">21</xref>]. Therefore, clusters in these bacteria could arise from similar processes to interbreeding and reproductive isolation in sexual eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b020">20</xref>]. Aside from issues of sexuality, previous studies looking for distinct clusters have been descriptive, relying on visual interpretation of plots of genetic or phenotypic variation rather than on formal tests of predictions under null and alternative evolutionary scenarios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b001">1</xref>].</p>
      <p>Here, we demonstrate that a classic asexual clade, the bdelloid rotifers, has diversified into independently evolving and distinct entities arguably equivalent to species. Bdelloids are abundant animals in aquatic or occasionally wet terrestrial habitats and represent one of the best-supported clades of ancient asexuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b024">24</xref>]. They reproduce solely via parthenogenetic eggs, and no males or traces of meiosis have ever been observed. Molecular evidence that bdelloid genomes contain only divergent copies of nuclear genes present as two similar copies (alleles) in diploid sexual organisms rules out anything but extremely rare recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b027">27</xref>]. Yet, bdelloids have survived for more than 100 million y and comprise more than 380 morphologically recognizable species and 20 genera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b028">28</xref>]. The diversity of the strictly asexual bdelloids poses a challenge to the idea that sex is essential for long-term survival and diversification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b029">29</xref>]. However, taxonomy does not constitute strong evidence for evolutionary species: the species could simply be arbitrary labels summarizing morphological variation among a swarm of clones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b007">7</xref>]. We adopt a general evolutionary species concept, namely, that species are independently evolving and distinct entities, and then break the species problem into a series of testable hypotheses derived from population genetic predictions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b003">3</xref>]. We use the word “entity” to refer to a set of individuals comprising a unit of diversity according to a given criterion or test: the question of whether to call those entities “species” will be returned to below.</p>
      <p>Focusing on the genus <italic>Rotaria</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050087-g001">Figure 1</xref>), one of the best-characterized genera of bdelloids, we use combined molecular and morphological analyses to distinguish alternative scenarios for bdelloid diversification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050087-g002">Figure 2</xref>). First, the entire clade might represent a single species, that is, a swarm of clones with no diversification into independently evolving subsets of individuals. Second, the clade may have diversified into a series of independently evolving entities. By “independently evolving,” we mean that the evolutionary processes of selection and drift operate separately in different entities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b009">9</xref>], such that genotypes can only spread within a single entity. Possible causes of independence include geographical isolation or adaptation to different ecological niches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b017">17</xref>]. The expected outcome is cohesion within entities but genetic and phenotypic divergence between them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b011">11</xref>].</p>

          <p>(A) Hypothetical trees showing expected genetic relationships among a sample of individuals under the null model that the sample is drawn from a single asexual population (H0) and under the alternative model that the clade has diversified into a set of independently evolving entities (H1).</p>
          <p>(B) Expected variation in two ecomorphological traits evolving either neutrally (H0) or by adaptive divergence (H1) in a genus that has diversified into six genetic clusters. Note that a mixed pattern is possible: Some genetic clusters may have experienced divergent selection on morphology, whereas others have not.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>We first test for the presence of independently evolving entities. Under the null scenario of no diversification, genetic relationships should conform to those expected for a sample of individuals from a single asexual population (H0, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050087-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Under the alternative scenario that independently evolving entities are present, we expect to observe distinct clusters of closely related individuals separated by long branches from other such clusters (H1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050087-g002">Figure 2</xref>A; and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b009">9</xref>]). Coalescent models can be used to distinguish the two scenarios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b030">30</xref>]. Failure to reject the null model would indicate a lack of evidence for the existence of independently evolving entities.</p>
      <p>Next, to investigate the role of adaptation to different niches in generating and maintaining diversity within the clade, we extend classic methods from population genetics to test directly for adaptive divergence of ecomorphological traits. If trait diversity evolves solely by neutral divergence in geographic isolation, we expect morphological variation within and between entities to be proportional to levels of neutral genetic variation (H0, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050087-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, Materials and Methods). If, instead, different entities experience divergent selection on their morphology, we expect greater morphological variation between clusters than within them, relative to neutral expectations (H1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050087-g002">Figure 2</xref>B; and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b031">31</xref>]). Past work has often discussed sympatry of clusters as evidence for niche divergence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b001">1</xref>], but, in theory, coexistence can occur without niche differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b032">32</xref>]; hence, we introduce an alternative, more direct approach.</p>
      <p>Our results demonstrate that bdelloids have diversified not only into distinct genetic clusters, indicative of independent evolution, but also into entities experiencing divergent selection on feeding morphology, indicative of niche divergence. In common with findings of cryptic species in sexual organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b034">34</xref>], the morphologically coherent groups experiencing divergent selection often include several genetic clusters: this introduces difficulties in deciding which units to call species, but this problem is shared with sexual organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b033">33</xref>]. In short, bdelloids have diversified into entities equivalent to sexual species in all respects except that individuals do not interbreed. The results demonstrate the benefits of statistical analyses of combined molecular and morphological data for exploring the evolutionary nature of species.</p>

      <p>Morphometric analyses further support the distinctness of taxonomic species. Bdelloid morphology is hard to measure because of their shape-changing abilities; hence, we used geometric morphometrics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b038">38</xref>] to measure the only suitable trait, their hard jaws, called trophi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b039">39</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050087-g001">Figures 1</xref> and S4). Trophi size and shape are not characters that have been used in the traditional taxonomy of the genus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050087-st002">Table S2</xref>). Trophi scale weakly with rough measures of body size of each species (mean trophi size against log body length from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b037">37</xref>]: <italic>r</italic> = 0.55, <italic>p</italic> = 0.2, Spearman's rank test), and both the size and shape of trophi likely reflect different types or sizes of particulate food consumed, although the details of how food is processed remain unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b028">28</xref>]. Discriminant analysis of the first five principal components (PCs) describing trophi shape (cumulative explained variance, 97.1%; Materials and Methods) produced a correct classification with respect to traditional taxonomy of most specimens of <italic>R. macrura, R. neptunia, R. sordida,</italic> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">R. tardigrada</named-content> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050087-st003">Table S3</xref>).

      <p>Congruence between molecules and morphology confirms that most traditional <italic>Rotaria</italic> species are monophyletic clades but does not rule out the possibility that taxa reflect variation within a single asexual species or swarm of evolutionarily interacting clones. Under the alternative scenario that independently evolving entities are present, we expect to observe clusters of closely related individuals separated from other such clusters by longer internal branches on a DNA tree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b040">40</xref>]. We therefore tested for significant clustering by comparing two models describing the likelihood of the branching pattern of the DNA trees: first, a null model that the entire sample derives from a single population following a neutral coalescent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b041">41</xref>], and, second, a model assuming a set of independently evolving populations joined by branching that reflects the timing of divergence events between them, that is, cladogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b042">42</xref>]. The models allow departures from strict assumptions of constant population size and rates of cladogenesis (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>
      <p>The results indicate significant clustering within <italic>Rotaria,</italic> as expected if several independently evolving entities are present and consistent with patterns of mtDNA diversity from a broad sample of bdelloids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b043">43</xref>]. The maximum likelihood solution for the independent evolution model on the combined tree infers 13 isolated clusters, with the remaining individuals inferred to be singletons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050087-g003">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050087-st004">Table S4</xref>). Two monophyletic taxonomic species contained two separate clusters: <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">R. magnacalcarata</named-content> has two clusters corresponding to the U.K. and Italian samples, whereas <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">R. macrura</named-content> has two clusters not matching sampling locality. Uncorrected pairwise distances of <italic>cox1</italic> within clusters ranged from 0% to 3.3% (mean, 1.5%), and those between clusters ranged from 4.1% to 23.1% (mean, 16.0%). The null model that the entire lineage represents a single cluster can be rejected (log likelihood ratio test, 2 × ratio = 30.8, χ<sup>2</sup> test, three degrees of freedom, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001).</p>
      <p>Our results indicate that independently evolving entities are present in bdelloids but at a lower level than taxonomic species, that is, cryptic taxa within the taxonomic species. However, the nature of independent evolution remains unclear. Clusters might simply represent geographically isolated, or even partially geographically isolated, populations evolving neutrally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b044">44</xref>]. Alternatively, the clade might have diversified into ecologically distinct species experiencing divergent selection pressures. To resolve these alternatives, we test directly for divergent selection between different lineages, adapting classic methods from molecular population genetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b045">45</xref>]. If rotifers have experienced divergent selection on trophi morphology between species, for example, adapting to changes in habitat or resource use, we expect low variation within species and high variation between species, relative to the same ratio for neutral changes.</p>
      <p>To explore the level at which divergent selection acts on morphology, we compared rates of morphological change within clusters, between clusters within taxonomic species, and between taxonomic species, in each case relative to silent substitution rates in <italic>cox1,</italic> assumed to reflect neutral changes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). The test is robust to sampling issues and differences in mutational mechanism between morphology and <italic>cox1</italic> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). The results reveal significant evidence for divergent selection on trophi size and PC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050087-g005">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050087-st005">Table S5</xref>). However, divergent selection occurs between taxonomic species, not between clusters; both traits are conserved within taxonomic species but diverge rapidly between species, relative to neutral expectations. Changes in PC1 are more complex, being lower between clusters either than within clusters or between taxonomic species. However, overall the results demonstrate divergent selection on the size and some aspects of shape of the trophi.</p>

      <p>Our results show that <italic>Rotaria</italic> has undergone adaptive diversification in feeding morphology, presumably associated with specialization to different habitats. The finding is supported by observations of ecological differences among the traditional species. For example, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">R. socialis</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">R. magnacalcarata</named-content> live externally on the body of the water louse <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Asellus aquaticus</named-content> but partition their use of the host, with the former living around the leg bases and the latter on the anterior, ventral surface. Our analyses show that these traditional species, which are found living together on single louse individuals, are evolutionarily independent and distinct entities. Another traditional species, <italic>R. sordida,</italic> is found in more terrestrial habitats than the other species, although it sometimes co-occurs with <italic>R. tardigrada,</italic> which is generally more aquatic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050087-st002">Table S2</xref>). Therefore, informal observations of habitat partitioning and coexistence at local scales add further support to the role of niche partitioning.</p>
      <p>Not all of the entities identified as genetic clusters display evidence of divergent selection on feeding morphology: the signature of divergent selection was detected at a broader level than that of independently evolving clusters. One possible explanation is that some clusters arose solely from neutral divergence in complete or partial geographical isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b044">44</xref>]. Some of the clusters do comprise geographically localized sets of samples, but at least one traditional species, <italic>R. macrura,</italic> contains two clusters without obvious geographical separation. Alternatively, divergent selection might act at different hierarchical levels on different traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b017">17</xref>]: clusters might have diverged in unmeasured traits such as behavior, gross body morphology, or life history. Future work sampling additional genetic markers and phenotypic traits for the identified clusters might distinguish these alternatives.</p>
      <p>So which level should we call “species”? As increasingly recognized in reviews of species concepts, the answer will depend on which aspect of diversity is of most interest and on the intended use of the delimitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b046">46</xref>]. For evolutionary studies, for example, into how bdelloids might adapt to changing environments, the genetic clusters provide statistical evidence of independent evolution within the traditionally recognized species that needs to be taken into account. For ecological studies, the traditional species conform closely to units that are ecologically distinct in terms of feeding morphology. Perhaps surprisingly for a poorly studied group of microscopic animals, traditional species limits appear to be robust for many purposes with the exception of the paraphyletic <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">R. rotatoria</named-content>. However, the important point here is that the same issues apply to studies of sexual organisms. Genetic surveys often reveal cryptic species within morphologically coherent sexual species and elicit the same arguments over their interpretation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b034">34</xref>].</p>
      <p>We conclude that bdelloids display the same qualitative pattern of genetic and morphological clusters, indicative of diversification into independently evolving and distinct entities, as found in sexual clades. This refutes the idea that sex is necessary for diversification into evolutionary species. Similar approaches could be used to explore the nature of species in sexual clades—for example, how often is speciation accompanied by ecological divergence compared to a null model of reproductive isolation and neutral divergence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b048">48</xref>]? In addition, clades differing in levels of recombination could be compared to determine how sexual reproduction affects the strength and rate of diversification. Does the requirement for reproductive isolation limit opportunities for speciation in sexuals, or do their faster adaptive rates promote stronger patterns of diversification than in asexuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b049">49</xref>]? Microbial eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and fungi could provide additional study clades for such studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b012">12</xref>], linked to genetic studies verifying the presumed lack of recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b050">50</xref>].</p>
      <p>Our study highlights the advantages of statistical analyses of combined morphological and molecular data. Recent work delimiting or identifying species from DNA barcode data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b051">51</xref>] has been criticized for relying on organelle genome markers, which may not reveal recent divergences or reflect the history of nuclear genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b052">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b053">53</xref>]. Morphology provides a ready window on adaptive differences between populations, often the first sign of divergence and at the present easier to sample than the genes underlying important traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b055">55</xref>], but has lacked the theoretical framework of DNA. Combined analyses, sampling at the population level across entire clades, offer new potential to uncover the nature of species and biological diversity. Our methods could be readily applied to sexual clades and to other cases presenting challenges to current theories, such as groups in which barriers to interbreeding appear to be weak or nonexistent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b001">1</xref>].</p>

The alternative model optimizes a threshold age, <italic>T,</italic> such that nodes before the threshold are considered to be diversification events with branching rate <italic>λ</italic><sub>D</sub> and scaling parameter <italic>p</italic><sub>D</sub>. Branches crossing the threshold define <italic>k</italic> clusters each obeying a separate coalescent process but with branching rate, <italic>λ</italic><sub>C</sub>, and scaling parameter, <italic>p</italic><sub>C</sub>, assumed to be constant across clusters. The alternative model thus has three additional parameters. Models were fitted using an R script available from T.G.B. to an ultrametric tree obtained by rate smoothing the combined analysis DNA tree using penalized likelihood in r8s (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ginger.ucdavis.edu/r8s" xlink:type="simple">http://ginger.ucdavis.edu/r8s</ext-link>) and cross-validation to choose the optimal smoothing parameter for each tree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b060">60</xref>].

        <p>In an asexual clade, all genes have the same underlying genealogy: the entire genome is inherited as a single unit. Assuming that silent substitutions are neutral, the expected number of silent mtDNA substitutions on a branch of the genealogy is <italic>μt,</italic> where <italic>t</italic> is the branch length in units of time and <italic>μ</italic> is the mutation rate of the gene. Assuming a neutral morphological trait evolving by Brownian motion, the expected squared change (variance) along a branch is <inline-formula id="pbio-0050087-ex001"><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.0050087.ex001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>

					 is the mutational rate of increase of variance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b061">61</xref>]. The expectations are the same for branches within populations or between them. Therefore, the average rate of change of a neutral trait expressed as variance per silent substitution should be the same within populations as between them, that is, <inline-formula id="pbio-0050087-ex003"><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.0050087.ex003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>
					 This prediction holds even if mutation rates vary across the tree, providing they do so without a systematic bias between the branch classes being compared, a reasonable assumption shared with widely used molecular versions of the test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b031">31</xref>].

        <p>We reconstructed evolutionary changes in trophi size and shape (PC1 and PC2) onto the DNA tree using the Brownian motion model by Schluter et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b062">62</xref>] implemented in the Ape library for R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b063">63</xref>]. Branch lengths were optimized as the proportion of silent substitutions per codon using PAML software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b064">64</xref>]. The null model assumes a constant rate of morphological change across the entire tree. The alternative model labels branches as between taxonomic species, within species and within clusters, and estimates different rates for each class. Under a three rate-class model, the likelihood of the reconstruction, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pbio-0050087-e003">Equation 3</xref> of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050087-b062">62</xref>] becomes the product of the equivalent likelihood for each class of branches.

Optimization was implemented in a modified version of the “ace” function of Ape, available from T. G. B. Divergent selection between taxonomic species, for example, would be indicated by a significantly lower rate within cluster and within species branches (classes 1 and 2) than between species branches (class 3).
