        <p>Genetic disruption of the pancreatic mesenchyme reveals that it is critical for the expansion of epithelial progenitors and for the proliferation of insulin-producing beta cells.</p>
      </abstract><abstract>
        <p>The developing pancreatic epithelium gives rise to all endocrine and exocrine cells of the mature organ. During organogenesis, the epithelial cells receive essential signals from the overlying mesenchyme. Previous studies, focusing on ex vivo tissue explants or complete knockout mice, have identified an important role for the mesenchyme in regulating the expansion of progenitor cells in the early pancreas epithelium. However, due to the lack of genetic tools directing expression specifically to the mesenchyme, the potential roles of this supporting tissue in vivo, especially in guiding later stages of pancreas organogenesis, have not been elucidated. We employed transgenic tools and fetal surgical techniques to ablate mesenchyme via Cre-mediated mesenchymal expression of Diphtheria Toxin (DT) at the onset of pancreas formation, and at later developmental stages via in utero injection of DT into transgenic mice expressing the Diphtheria Toxin receptor (DTR) in this tissue. Our results demonstrate that mesenchymal cells regulate pancreatic growth and branching at both early and late developmental stages by supporting proliferation of precursors and differentiated cells, respectively. Interestingly, while cell differentiation was not affected, the expansion of both the endocrine and exocrine compartments was equally impaired. To further elucidate signals required for mesenchymal cell function, we eliminated Î²-catenin signaling and determined that it is a critical pathway in regulating mesenchyme survival and growth. Our study presents the first in vivo evidence that the embryonic mesenchyme provides critical signals to the epithelium throughout pancreas organogenesis. The findings are novel and relevant as they indicate a critical role for the mesenchyme during late expansion of endocrine and exocrine compartments. In addition, our results provide a molecular mechanism for mesenchymal expansion and survival by identifying Î²-catenin signaling as an essential mediator of this process. These results have implications for developing strategies to expand pancreas progenitors and Î²-cells for clinical transplantation.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Embryonic development is a highly complex process that requires tight orchestration of cellular proliferation, differentiation, and migration as cells grow within loosely aggregated mesenchyme and more organized epithelial sheets to form organs and tissues. In addition to intrinsic cell-autonomous signals, these events are further regulated by environmental cues provided by neighboring cells. Prior work demonstrated a critical role for the surrounding mesenchyme in guiding epithelial growth during the early stages of pancreas development. However, it remained unclear whether the mesenchyme also guided the later stages of pancreas organogenesis when the functional exocrine and endocrine cells are formed. Here, we show that specific genetic ablation of the mesenchyme at distinct developmental stages in vivo results in the formation of a smaller, misshapen pancreas. Loss of the mesenchyme profoundly impairs the expansion of both endocrine and exocrine pancreatic progenitors, as well as the proliferative capacity of maturing cells, including insulin-producing beta-cells. Thus, our studies reveal unappreciated roles for the mesenchyme in guiding the formation of the epithelial pancreas throughout development. The results suggest that identifying the specific mesenchymal signals might help to optimize cell culture protocols that aim to achieve the differentiation of stem cells into insulin-producing beta cells.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Organogenesis is a complex and dynamic process that requires tight spatial and temporal regulation of differentiation, proliferation, and morphogenesis. The pancreas serves as an interesting model for the study of these processes as its epithelium gives rise to functionally distinct cells: endocrine cells, including insulin-producing Î²-cells that release hormones into the blood stream to regulate glucose homeostasis, and exocrine cells that produce, secrete, and transport digestive enzymes. These diverse cell types derive from common progenitors residing in the embryonic pancreatic epithelium through a well-orchestrated multi-step process. While numerous studies have delineated the cascades of transcription factors within the epithelium that guide epithelial cell development (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Gittes1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Puri1">[2]</xref>), the role of the surrounding mesenchyme in governing pancreas organogenesis at different stages remains largely unknown.</p>
      <p>Mesenchymal cells start to coalesce around the nascent gut tube shortly before pancreas epithelial cells evaginate around mouse embryonic day 9.5 (e9.5) to form the dorsal and ventral buds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Gittes1">[1]</xref>. At e13.5âe14.5 Pdx1<sup>+</sup> epithelial precursor cells become committed to either the endocrine or the exocrine lineage, and from e15.5 until the end of gestation, pancreatic cells undergo final differentiation to give rise to all pancreatic cell types found in the adult organ. The first evidence that mesenchymal cells were required for pancreatic epithelial growth was provided in the 1960s by seminal work by Golosow and Grobstein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Golosow1">[3]</xref>, in which it was shown that e11 mouse pancreatic epithelium rudiments stripped of their overlying mesenchyme failed to grow in culture. However, further studies addressing the role of the mesenchyme at later stages have been difficult as the expanding pancreas epithelium quickly branches into the surrounding mesenchyme, thus preventing clean physical separation of these two layers after â¼e12 in the mouse. Additionally, while improved culture conditions for organ rudiments mimic embryonic development during early stages quite well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Puri2">[4]</xref>, full replication of all in vivo aspects of later pancreas organogenesis have not been achieved ex vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Li1">[5]</xref>. As a consequence, studying the role of the mesenchyme at advanced stages of pancreas development using explant systems resulted in controversial findings. A number of studies have shown that while mesenchymal cells have a positive effect on exocrine differentiation and growth in culture, they impair endocrine cell development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Gittes2">[6]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Tulachan1">[10]</xref>. Other studies have observed that close proximity between mesenchyme and epithelium promotes exocrine differentiation, while secreted mesenchymal factors enhance endocrine differentiation over a distance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Li1">[5]</xref>. More recently, a study by Attali and colleagues showed that co-culture of epithelium with mesenchyme promotes the production of insulin-expressing cells, an effect largely due to the expansion of Pdx1<sup>+</sup> precursor cells rather than maturation or proliferation of insulin-positive cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Attali1">[11]</xref>. Importantly, endocrine development was highly variable and dependent on the culture conditions such as oxygen levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Attali1">[11]</xref>, further indicating that in vivo manipulation of mesenchymal gene expression is necessary to fully uncover all mesenchymal functions throughout pancreas development.</p>
      <p>Starting in the 1970s, extensive efforts were made to identify mesenchymal factors responsible for these effects on the epithelial compartment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Ronzio1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Levine1">[13]</xref>. A decade ago, Bhushan and colleagues demonstrated that fibroblast growth factor 10 (Fgf10), expressed by mesenchymal cells from e9.5 until e11.5, is essential for pancreas growth and differentiation as it stimulates proliferation of Pdx1-expressing precursor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Bhushan1">[14]</xref>. Since then, germ-line knock out mouse lines, genetically manipulated zebra fish, and transfected chick embryos have been used to study a limited number of additional mesenchymal signaling pathways for their role in guiding pancreas formation (summarized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Gittes1">[1]</xref>). These studies provided evidence for Retinoic Acid (RA), Wnt, FGF, BMP, TGFÎ², and EGF signaling pathways as important regulators of pancreas formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Gittes1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Tulachan1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Bhushan1">[14]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Stafford1">[17]</xref>. However, detailed studies of the requirement for individual mesenchymal factors in pancreas development have been hampered by the lack of transgenic tools that permit manipulation of gene expression specifically in the pancreatic mesenchyme.</p>
      <p>Here, we present experiments that take advantage of <italic>Nkx3.2</italic> (<italic>Bapx1</italic>)-Cre transgenic mice in which Cre-expression is directed to the embryonic pancreatic mesenchyme, but not the epithelium. Using this Cre line in conjunction with mouse lines allowing Diphtheria Toxin (DT) induced apoptosis, we depleted mesenchymal cell during various stages of in vivo pancreas development. As expected, elimination of mesenchymal cells at the onset of pancreas development completely blocked pancreas organogenesis. Surprisingly, mesenchymal requirement was not restricted to this early stage, as ablation at later developmental stages also led to severe epithelial hypoplasia, reduced branching, and impaired Î²-cell and exocrine cell expansion. To elucidate the signaling pathways essential for mesenchyme function, we eliminated canonical Wnt signaling from the tissue. Loss of Wnt signaling within the mesenchyme resulted in mesenchymal cell ablationâsubsequently leading to reduction in both exocrine and endocrine cell mass. Summarily, our results demonstrate that the pancreatic epithelium depends on mesenchymal signals for proper expansion and morphogenesis throughout development.</p>

        <p>In order to manipulate gene expression in pancreatic mesenchyme, but not epithelium, we looked for genes whose expression matches this pattern. Previous studies pointed to the homeobox gene <italic>Nkx3.2</italic> (also known as <italic>Bapx1</italic>), whose expression was found in the forming somites as well as in the mesenchyme of developing pancreas, stomach, and gut <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Tribioli1">[18]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Asayesh1">[23]</xref>. In contrast, <italic>Nkx3.2</italic> expression was not detected in endodermally derived cells in these tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Tribioli1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-HecksherSorensen1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Asayesh1">[23]</xref>. In the pancreatic mesenchyme <italic>Nkx3.2</italic> is expressed as early as e9.5, and by e12.5 its expression becomes restricted to the mesenchymal area, which will give rise to the splenic bud <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Tribioli1">[18]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-HecksherSorensen1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Asayesh1">[23]</xref>. An <italic>Nkx3.2</italic> (<italic>Bapx1</italic>)-Cre line, in which one copy of the endogenous <italic>Nkx3</italic>.<italic>2</italic> gene was replaced by a transgene encoding the Cre recombinase, had previously been generated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Verzi1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Takamoto1">[25]</xref>. This transgenic mouse line faithfully replicates the endogenous expression of <italic>Nkx3</italic>.<italic>2</italic> and directs Cre activity to the foregut mesenchyme and skeletal somites starting at e9.5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Verzi1">[24]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Given that pancreatic expression of the <italic>Nkx3.2</italic>-Cre transgene was not thoroughly analyzed in prior studies, we first crossed the transgenic mice to two reporter strains, the R26-LacZ<sup>f/+</sup> and the R26-YFP<sup>f/+</sup> lines, which express LacZ or YFP, respectively, upon Cre-mediated recombination. YFP expression in <italic>Nkx3.2</italic>-Cre;R26-YFP<sup>f/+</sup> embryos (from here on referred to as Nkx3.2/YFP) was not found in the endodermally-derived pancreatic epithelium marked by E-Cadherin and Pdx1 at e9.5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Offield1">[26]</xref>, but was ubiquitously detected in the surrounding mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001143-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Similarly, X-gal staining in <italic>Nkx3.2</italic>-Cre;R26-LacZ<sup>f/+</sup> (from here on referred to as Nkx3.2/LacZ) indicated LacZ expression was confined to the surrounding mesenchyme at e11.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001143-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). At p0, Nkx3.2/LacZ and Nkx3.2/YFP expressing cells with fibroblast-like morphology were observed around islets, ducts, and blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001143-g001">Figure 1C,Câ²,D</xref>). Importantly, we could not detect reporter genes' expression in either epithelial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001143-g001">Figure 1C,Câ²,D</xref>), endothelial, or neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001143.s001">Figure S1</xref>), indicating that <italic>Nkx3.2</italic>-Cre activity is excluded from those compartments throughout pancreatic development. Thus, the <italic>Nkx3.2</italic>-Cre line directs Cre-activity exclusively to the mesenchyme during pancreas development and serves as a novel tool to specifically manipulate embryonic gene expression in this tissue.</p>

        <p>General histological analysis implied that the relative proportion of mesenchyme to epithelium shifts during pancreas organogenesis as epithelial cell numbers expand. We therefore took advantage of <italic>Nkx3.2</italic>-Cre transgenic mice to quantify the mesenchymal area during different developmental stages. By measuring the percentage of the pancreatic area marked by Nkx3.2/LacZ and Nkx3.2/YFP cells at various developmental stages, we determined that while the relative mesenchymal area is significantly reduced during pancreas organogenesis, it still comprised 11% and 6% of the pancreatic area at e15.5 and e18.5, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001143-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Thus, although there is a dramatic reduction in their portion over time, embryonic mesenchymal cells are present throughout pancreas organogenesis.</p>

        <title>Mesenchymal Cell Ablation at Later Embryonic Stages Impairs Epithelial Pancreas Development</title>
        <p>Pancreas development is a multistep process during which the epithelium undergoes complex morphological changes while common precursor cells differentiate into the various cells types that form the adult pancreas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Wilson1">[30]</xref>. To test whether mesenchymal cells play distinct roles during different stages of pancreas development, we depleted the mesenchyme at various time points by injecting DT into developing embryos. Unlike primates, rodent cells lack a high affinity receptor for DT and therefore do not endocytose the toxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Pappenheimer1">[31]</xref>. Since DT internalization into the cell cytoplasm is crucial for its ability to trigger the apoptotic machinery, rodent cells are resistant to ectopically administrated DT. However, mouse cells expressing a human DT Receptor (DTR) transgene, encoding for the human heparin binding epidermal growth factor (hbEGF), gain sensitivity to DT and are rapidly eliminated upon exposure to the toxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Naglich1">[32]</xref>. Prior studies have established that cell specific expression of human DTR in transgenic mice allows the ablation of targeted cells within 6 h following DT administration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Jung1">[33]</xref>. By crossing transgenic mice in which DTR expression is activated upon Cre-mediated recombination (iDTR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Buch1">[34]</xref>, from here on referred to as DTR) with the <italic>Nkx3.2</italic>-Cre mice (<italic>Nkx3.2-Cre;DTR</italic>) we were able to specifically ablate the mesenchyme at different embryonic time points during pancreas development upon DT injection.</p>
        <p>To ensure efficient delivery of DT to the developing pancreas, we injected the agent directly into embryos intraperitoneally (i.p.; the experimental procedure is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001143-g003">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001143.s002">Figure S2AâD</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Nijagal1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Nijagal2">[36]</xref>.

Embryos were then allowed to develop in situ until e18.5 when pancreata were dissected and weighed. Surprisingly, both dorsal and ventral pancreatic regions were significantly reduced in size in treated transgenic embryos independent of time of DT administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001143-g003">Figure 3FâH</xref>). The most dramatic reduction in pancreas mass, up to 80%, was observed when transgenic embryos were injected between e11.5 and e13.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001143-g003">Figure 3H</xref>). DT injection at later stages, e14.5 and e15.5, resulted in an approximately 50% loss of pancreas mass.

        <p>To determine the developmental stage during which mesenchyme ablation affects pancreatic mass, we injected embryos at e13.5 and investigated pancreata 2 d later at e15.5 (DT e13.5âe15.5). At that stage, pancreas mass in transgenic embryos was already reduced by 80% as compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001143-g005">Figure 5E</xref>), similar to the reduction observed in pancreata injected at e13.5 and analyzed at e18.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001143-g003">Figure 3H</xref>). Since mesenchymal cells comprise only 11% of pancreatic tissue at e15.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001143-g001">Figure 1E</xref>), the observed reduction in pancreatic weight was likely due to a rapid and significant loss of the epithelial compartment of the organ.</p>
        <p>Next, we investigated whether cells of either the endocrine or exocrine compartments were already affected in e15.5 <italic>Nkx3.2</italic>-Cre;DTR embryos that were DT-treated 2 d before (i.e., at e13.5). While present in DT-treated transgenic pancreata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001143-g005">Figure 5F,G</xref>), the number of cells positive for Neurogenin 3 (Ngn3), a transcription factor that marks endocrine precursor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Gu1">[43]</xref>, was significantly reduced compared to littermate control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001143-g005">Figure 5H</xref>). Similarly, the number of cells expressing Ptf1a, a transcription factor found in exocrine precursor and differentiated acinar cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Zhou1">[44]</xref>, was significantly reduced 2-fold in DT e13.5âe15.5 <italic>Nkx3.2-Cre;DTR</italic> pancreata as compared to non-transgenic controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001143-g005">Figure 5IâK</xref>). Therefore, the reduction in Î²-cell and acinar cell mass detected at DT e13.5âe18.5 <italic>Nkx3.2-Cre;DTR</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001143-g005">Figure 5B,C</xref>) is, at least in part, due to the decreased number of Ngn3<sup>+</sup> precursor cells and Ptf1a<sup>+</sup> exocrine cells at earlier developmental stages.</p>
        <p>Since pancreatic growth between e13.5 and e15.5 relies heavily on proliferation of precursor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Stanger1">[45]</xref>, we next analyzed the effect of mesenchymal depletion on the proliferation rate of these cell populations in e14.5 <italic>Nkx3.2-Cre;DTR</italic> embryos treated at e13.5 (DT e13.5âe14.5). Epithelial tip cells serve as multi-potent progenitors before they become committed to the exocrine lineage around e14.5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Zhou1">[44]</xref>. Staining these cells, identified as Carboxypeptidase 1 (Cpa1) expressing cells, with an antibody against phosphorylated Histone H3, a marker of cell proliferation, revealed a 50% reduction in proliferating tip cells in <italic>Nkx3.2-Cre;DTR</italic> embryos compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001143-g005">Figure 5LâN</xref>). In addition, we analyzed proliferation of Sox9 expressing cells, a transcription factor that marks epithelial precursor cells giving rise to exocrine cells as well as to Ngn3<sup>+</sup> endocrine precursors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Lynn1">[46]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Kopp1">[48]</xref>. The percentage of Sox9<sup>+</sup> proliferating cells was slightly but significantly smaller in transgenic embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001143-g005">Figure 5OâQ</xref>). We could not detect apoptotic epithelial cells by TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP biotin nick end labeling) assays (unpublished data), concluding that depletion of mesenchymal cells affects both endocrine and exocrine mass through reduced proliferative capacity of epithelial progenitor cells rather than their apoptosis.</p>

        <title>Mesenchymal Cells Are Required for Proliferation of Differentiated Epithelial Cells</title>
        <p>The reduced proliferative potential of progenitor cells at e14.5 explained, at least in part, the reduction in pancreas mass in embryos treated with DT at e13.5. However, when mesenchyme was eliminated at e16.5 we also observed a significant reduction of about 35% in pancreas mass at e18.5, affecting both the endocrine and exocrine compartments (DT e16.5âe18.5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001143-g003">Figures 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001143-g006">6AâD</xref>). By e16.5, the various pancreatic cell types are committed towards their final differentiation fate and present with many of their mature cell characteristics. Since pancreatic growth at those late stages of development is attributed to proliferation of these differentiated cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Heit1">[49]</xref>, the decrease in pancreatic mass could not be due to reduced proliferation of progenitor cells.

In agreement with what we had found at earlier stages, the ratio between Insulin<sup>+</sup>/Amylase<sup>+</sup> areas was not affected in the DT-treated embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001143-g006">Figure 6D</xref>), suggesting mesenchymal factors have similar effect on cells of these two compartments.</p>

        <title>Mesenchymal Wnt Signaling Is Required for Epithelial Growth by Maintaining the Mesenchymal Layer</title>
        <p>Upon determining the requirement for mesenchymal cells to guide epithelial organ formation throughout development, we set out to identify signals and pathways critical for the mesenchymal effects. Canonical Wnt signaling is active in the developing pancreas, and both the mesenchyme and the epithelium express various Wnt ligands and receptors in a dynamic fashion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Heller1">[50]</xref>. At e11.5, Wnt signaling is observed in epithelial cells, and its level of activation declines in the following embryonic days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Murtaugh1">[51]</xref>, while its activity in the mesenchymal layer has been first reported around e13.5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Jonckheere1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Rulifson1">[52]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In order to directly investigate the role of mesenchymal Wnt signaling in pancreas development, we decided to block this pathway specifically in the mesenchyme by crossing transgenic mice carrying floxed alleles of Î²-catenin (Î²cat<sup>f/f</sup>), an essential mediator of canonical Wnt signaling, with <italic>Nkx3</italic>.2<italic>-Cre</italic> mice. In addition to its critical role in Wnt signaling, Î²-catenin has other functions within cells, most notably in maintaining cell-cell interactions as part of a complex with E-Cadherin. However, in pancreatic mesenchymal cells we failed to observe membrane-associated localization of the Î²-catenin protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001143.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). Therefore, elimination of this gene in <italic>Nkx3.2</italic>-Cre;<italic>Î²-cat<sup>f/f</sup></italic> pancreata is unlikely to perturb cell-cell interactions but should reveal the requirement for Î²-catenin mediated Wnt signaling in mesenchyme.</p>
        <p>As expected, elimination of Î²-catenin did not affect epithelial size at e12.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001143.s005">Figure S5B</xref>) prior to the reported onset of mesenchymal Wnt signaling. In contrast, <italic>Nkx3.2-Cre;Î²-cat<sup>f/f</sup></italic> pancreata were markedly reduced in size at e15.5 and e18.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001143-g007">Figure 7A,B</xref>), indicating that mesenchymal Î²-catenin signaling is critical for organ formation at later stages.

        <p>In order to identify the potential effects on pancreatic epithelial development in <italic>Nkx3.2-Cre;Î²cat<sup>f/f</sup></italic> embryos, we stained e18.5 knock-out pancreata for various cell markers and assessed acinar- and Î²-cell mass. All major pancreatic cell types, both of the exocrine (acinar and duct cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001143-g007">Figure 7E,F</xref>) and of the endocrine compartments (Î±-, Î²-, and Î´-cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001143-g007">Figure 7G,H</xref>), were detected in the <italic>Nkx3.2-Cre;Î²cat<sup>f/f</sup></italic> e18.5 pancreata. However, both Î²-cell and acinar-cell mass was significantly reduced in knock-out embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001143-g007">Figure 7I,J</xref>). Interestingly, the ratio between Î²- and acinar cells was maintained in <italic>Nkx3.2-Cre;Î²cat<sup>f/</sup></italic><sup>f</sup> pancreata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001143-g007">Figure 7K</xref>).</p>
        <p>The Wnt signaling pathway was shown to become activated in the pancreatic mesenchyme around e13.5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Jonckheere1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Rulifson1">[52]</xref>. To address whether the reduction in pancreatic mass observed in <italic>Nkx3.2-Cre;Î²cat<sup>f/f</sup></italic> at e15.5 and e18.5 is due to effects on epithelial growth at earlier stages, we studied epithelial proliferation in these mice at e13.5. At this stage, proliferating Cpa1<sup>+</sup> tips cells serve as multipotent pancreatic progenitor cells for both endocrine and exocrine populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Zhou1">[44]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001143-g007">Figure 7L</xref>, the proliferation rate of Cpa1<sup>+</sup> cells was significantly lower in <italic>Nkx3.2-Cre;Î²cat<sup>f/f</sup></italic> embryos as compared to controls. Cell death was not apparent as we could not detect apoptotic epithelial cells by TUNEL assays or by staining for cleaved Caspase3 (unpublished data). Therefore, blocking mesenchymal Wnt signaling leads to reduced pancreatic mass by affecting the proliferation capacity of epithelial precursor cells.</p>
        <p>Wnt signaling is known to regulate cell survival and proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Heiser1">[53]</xref>. Since pancreata from <italic>Nkx3.2-Cre;Î²cat<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice phenocopied those from DT-treated <italic>Nkx3.2-Cre;DTR</italic> mice, we wondered whether Wnt signaling is required for mesenchymal cell survival.

Thus, our results point to mesenchymal Wnt signaling as a critical mediator of mesenchymal cell survival in vivo and therefore of epithelial growth and patterning.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Despite extensive efforts, the role of the mesenchyme during in vivo pancreas development has remained elusive. Due to the absence of suitable genetic tools, probing the role of the pancreatic mesenchyme during organogenesis has been mainly restricted to organ rudiment culture experiments. In addition to the inability to faithfully mimic the in vivo conditions, clean separation of mesenchyme and epithelium for culture experiments is limited to early stages of pancreas organogenesis before the epithelial layer has integrated into the overlying mesenchyme (prior to e12.5 in the mouse). Here, we show that <italic>Nkx3.2</italic>-Cre mice permit transgene manipulation specifically in mesenchyme, but not in other pancreatic tissues. By using this tool to eliminate pancreatic mesenchymal cells at will, we expand upon classical tissue culture studies and for the first time present a model system suitable for detailed analysis of the various functions of this supporting tissue in vivo at multiple gestational ages.</p>
      <p>A key finding of our studies is the observation that pancreatic mesenchyme provides critical functions for the proper development of the epithelial compartment throughout organogenesis. As expected from previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Golosow1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Bhushan1">[14]</xref>, depletion of mesenchymal cells at the onset of pancreas development using <italic>Nkx3</italic>.2-<italic>Cre;DTA</italic> mice arrests pancreas organogenesis. Mesenchymal ablation at later stages, by injecting DT into <italic>Nkx3.2-Cre;DTR</italic> transgenic embryos at various stages or by blocking mesenchymal Wnt signaling in <italic>Nkx3.2-Cre;Î²cat<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice, impairs pancreatic epithelium growth and branching. Notably, while the morphological changes observed are profound, we did not observe alterations in cell differentiation capacity of the three main pancreatic cell types, the endocrine, acinar, and duct cells. However, our results clearly demonstrate a requirement of the mesenchyme for the expansion of epithelial progenitor cells, as well as proliferation of differentiated pancreatic cells.</p>
      <sec id="s3a">
        <title>Requirement of Secreted Mesenchymal Factors During Pancreas Development</title>
        <p>Factors secreted by the pancreas mesenchyme have previously been shown to regulate pancreas organogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Gittes2">[6]</xref>, including Fgf10 whose function is required for the expansion of common epithelial progenitor cells during early stages of pancreas development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Bhushan1">[14]</xref>. The pancreatic defects we observe in <italic>Nkx3.2</italic>-Cre;<italic>DTA</italic> embryos are more severe than those previously reported for <italic>Fgf10</italic><sup>â/â</sup> pancreata <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Bhushan1">[14]</xref>, a finding likely explained by the absence of mesenchymal cells, and thus reduction of all mesenchymal factors, in transgenic mice.</p>
        <p>Our results further demonstrate a requirement for mesenchymal cells in promoting proliferation of various epithelial cell types, including precursors and differentiated cells. While it is theoretically possible that these functions are mediated by a limited number of factors throughout all stages of development, the dynamic activation of mesenchymal signaling pathways (summarized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Gittes1">[1]</xref>) would suggest a more complex interplay of a diverse set of molecules that changes over time. Our findings also suggest that mesenchyme supports proliferation of multiple distinct cell types, even during the same developmental stage. For instance, mesenchyme ablation has similar effects on proliferation of mature acinar and Î²-cells towards the end of gestation. This observation poses the question as to whether different epithelial cell types rely on the same mesenchymal factor(s) for their proliferation, or whether these processes are mediated by distinct signals. Future analysis is required to identify secreted factors expressed by the pancreatic mesenchyme at different developmental stages. The use of the <italic>Nkx3.2</italic>-Cre line will allow specific manipulation of the genes coding for these signals to ascertain their role during pancreas organogenesis.</p>

Previous reports had reached differing conclusions, with some demonstrating a positive role for the mesenchyme on exocrine formation but not endocrine cell development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Gittes2">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Miralles1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Duvillie1">[9]</xref>, and others indicating that mesenchymal factors promote proliferation of multi-potent pancreas progenitors that subsequently increase the formation of endocrine cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Attali1">[11]</xref>. Some of these conflicting results can be explained by the different culture conditions used in each experiment.</p>
        <p>In contrast to the cultured studies, in vivo depletion of the mesenchyme investigated here revealed similar requirements for this tissue with regard to the endocrine and exocrine cytodifferentiation. At this point, we cannot exclude that other cells types, including endothelial and neural-crest derived cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Lammert1">[38]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Plank1">[41]</xref>, or cells residing in the adjacent liver, stomach, gut, or kidneys might provide signals that guide epithelial cell differentiation in mesenchyme depleted embryos in vivo. In addition, mesenchymal cells that did not originate from <italic>Nkx3.2</italic>-Cre expressing cells might still be present in our in vivo model and could provide either instructive or permissive signals.</p>
        <p>Prior organ culture studies proposed another model to explain the various effects of the mesenchyme on the epithelial compartments by demonstrating distinct effects of the mesenchyme on epithelial cells depending on the physical distance and contact between these tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Li1">[5]</xref>. In these experiments, close proximity between epithelial and mesenchymal cells promoted exocrine differentiation while at the same time blocked endocrine formation. In contrast, mesenchyme factors supported endocrine differentiation at a distance, indicating that the physical relation between mesenchymal and epithelial cells is critical for endocrine versus exocrine differentiation. Our studies support the notion of mesenchymal signals being important for both endocrine and exocrine development. However, our lineage tracing experiments provide evidence of close physical contact between Nkx3.2/LacZ and Nkx3.2/YFP expressing cells with endocrine cells, indicating that close proximity between mesenchymal and epithelial cells does not necessarily interfere with endocrine differentiation. However, since mesenchymal cells surround islets, they are likely in close contact only with peripheral endocrine cells, such as Î±-cells, while direct interactions with centrally located Î²-cells might not be common. Whether the mesenchyme contributes to Î²-cell expansion by releasing secreted factors or through cell-cell interactions as well as how the mesenchyme affects other endocrine cells are questions that need to be addressed in future experiments. Furthermore, isolation and characterization of mesenchymal cells throughout development might reveal cell heterogeneity that could explain differential functions with regard to promoting endocrine versus exocrine development.</p>

        <title>Requirement of Mesenchymal Signaling Pathways in Pancreas Organogenesis</title>
        <p>Our results also point to sustained mesenchyme function as a critical regulator of epithelial pancreas development and identify Wnt signaling as an essential mediator of mesenchyme survival. It is not clear as to whether Wnt signaling is activated in an autocrine or paracrine manner, as several Wnt ligands are expressed by both pancreatic epithelial and mesenchymal cells during development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Heller1">[50]</xref>. It is noteworthy that the defects we observe in <italic>Nkx3.2</italic>-Cre;<italic>Î²cat</italic><sup>f/f</sup> only occur after the onset of canonical Wnt signaling in pancreas mesenchyme as measured by expression of transgenic Wnt-reporters (i.e., e13.5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Jonckheere1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Rulifson1">[52]</xref>). The implication of canonical Wnt signaling as the cause for the observed phenotypes is indirectly supported by a previous study using germ-line knock-out mice in which <italic>mPygo2</italic>, a critical component of the nuclear Î²âcatenin/Tcf complex required for Î²-catenin transcriptional activity, has been eliminated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Jonckheere1">[15]</xref>. <italic>mPygo</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice show pancreas hypoplasia and a reduction in endocrine mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Jonckheere1">[15]</xref>, phenotypes that are not observed when this gene is specifically eliminated in pancreas epithelium. Thus, while mesenchyme specific depletion of <italic>mPygo2</italic> has not been reported, the absence of pancreas hypoplasia upon epithelial-specific <italic>mPygo2</italic> elimination suggests that at least some of the pancreatic defects are caused by reduced mesenchymal Wnt signaling. However, and in contrast to <italic>Nkx3.2</italic>-Cre;<italic>Î²cat</italic><sup>f/f</sup> pancreata, the exocrine compartment is not affected in <italic>mPygo2</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mutants and mesenchyme depletion was not reported in those mice. Since Wnt signaling is significantly reduced, but not completely blocked in the absence of <italic>mPygo2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Jonckheere1">[15]</xref>, it is possible that low level of canonical Wnt signaling is sufficient for mesenchymal cell survival and the production of factors that promote exocrine cell development. Alternatively, Î²-catenin is known to regulate cell-cell interactions as part of Cadherin complexes and these additional functions might be crucial for the maintenance of the pancreatic mesenchyme. However, we did not observe Î²-catenin localized to membranes in mesenchymal cells. In order to study whether different levels of mesenchymal Wnt signaling have a different effect on endocrine and exocrine expansion, mice specifically lacking mesenchymal expression of various components of this pathway (such as mPygo2) would need to be examined.</p>
        <p>In addition to Wnt signaling, other signaling pathways, such as the RA, BMP, and Hedgehog, have been implicated as mesenchymal factors regulating pancreas development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Jonckheere1">[15]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Stafford1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Apelqvist1">[54]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Kawahira1">[55]</xref>. Using <italic>Nkx3</italic>.2-Cre line as a novel tool to manipulate gene expression in the pancreatic mesenchyme will allow direct study of the role of these and potentially other pathways in pancreas organogenesis.</p>
        <p>In summary, data presented here indicate continuous requirement of mesenchymal cells and/or mesenchyme-derived signals to regulate epithelial pancreas formation from the onset of organ morphogenesis until the end of gestation. Isolation of mesenchymal cells at different stages of pancreas formation might allow identification of candidate factors that regulate expansion of common and endocrine progenitors as well as of differentiated Î²-cells. Future therapies for both type I and II diabetes rely on renewable sources of functional insulin-producing Î²-cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001143-Guo1">[56]</xref>. Current protocols allow the formation of pancreas progenitor cells from human embryonic stem cells (hESC) in vitro, but not fully differentiated Î²-cells. Our results demonstrate that mesenchymal factors provide critical signals for the expansion of both precursors and differentiated endocrine and exocrine cells. Thus, mesenchymal signaling factors not yet identified will likely be useful for expansion of hESC derived pancreas progenitor and differentiated Î²-cells.</p>

        <title>Quantifications</title>
        <p>For all quantifications presented in this study, each transgenic tissue was processed and stained in parallel with a littermate control, with each analyzed group comprising at least three pairs of transgenic and control embryos (i.e., <italic>n</italic>â¥3) as indicated in the figure legends. Throughout each analysis, images were acquired using the same exposure time and magnification. When MetaMorph software was used for image analysis, the same signal-to-noise threshold was applied throughout the experiment. For all measurements presented in this study, with the exception of the measurement of the mesenchymal area at e11.5 and Ptf1a<sup>+</sup> cell numbers at e15.5, the following regimen was applied: the entire pancreatic tissue, including both dorsal and ventral buds, was embedded in paraffin wax and cut into 5 Âµm thick sections. Every fifth section (20% of total tissue) was then immuno-stained with indicated antibodies as described above. Images were acquired as detailed below and analyzed blindly.</p>
        <p>For measurement of mesenchymal areas at e15.5 and e18.5, isolated pancreatic tissues from <italic>Nkx3.2</italic>-Cre;<italic>R26</italic>-YFP<sup>flox</sup> embryos were stained with an anti-YFP antibody and a fluorescent secondary antibody and entire sections were automatically imaged using Olympus IX70 widefield microscope and MetaMorph software. Over-exposure of the tissue and DAPI staining were used to determine the edges of the section. Images were analyzed using MetaMorph software, which automatically measured the positive area in each channel. To determine the percentage of mesenchymal area, total YFP-positive area was divided by total tissue area of each section.</p>
        <p>For Î²- and acinar cell mass, isolated e18.5 tissues (including both dorsal and ventral tissues) were dissected and weighed. Following fixation, tissues were embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned as described above, and immuno-stained with anti-Insulin and anti-Amylase antibodies. Images were acquired as described above for mesenchymal area measurement, and areas positive for either Amylase or Insulin, as well as the total pancreatic area, were automatically measured using MetaMorph software. To determine the fractions of the Î²- and acinar cell areas, total Insulin or Amylase positive area was divided by total tissue area. Cell mass was calculated as the fraction of Amylase<sup>+</sup> or Insulin<sup>+</sup> areas of the total pancreatic area multiplied by gross pancreas weight.</p>
        <p>To calculate the Î²-cell/acinar cell ratio, for each embryo Insulin<sup>+</sup> and Amylase<sup>+</sup> area was determined as described above for cell mass measurement, and Insulin<sup>+</sup> area was divided by Amylase<sup>+</sup> area. For clarity, the ratio obtained in non-transgenic controls was set to â1.â</p>
        <p>For quantification of Ngn3-expressing cells, whole e15.5 pancreatic tissues were isolated and processed as described above. Sections were stained with anti-Ngn3 antibody followed by fluorescent secondary antibody and images were then acquired as described above for mesenchymal area measurement, but positive cells were counted manually. To accommodate for potential differences in the developmental stage of the various litters analyzed, the number of transgenic Ngn3-positive cells was normalized to the number of Ngn3 cells counted in the corresponding non-transgenic littermate controls.</p>
        <p>For cell proliferation, whole pancreatic tissue (including both dorsal and ventral tissues) was isolated from embryos e15.5 and older. From embryos at e13.5 or e14.5, pancreatic tissue was isolated together with the adjacent stomach and duodenum. Following fixation, tissues were paraffin-embedded and sectioned as described above. Tissue sections were stained with indicated antibodies and imaged using Zeiss ApoTome or Leica SP5 microscopes. For each section, the percentage of proliferating cells was determined via manual counting of either Ki67 or pHH3 positive cells divided by the number of total target cells.</p>
        <p>To determine mesenchymal area at e11.5, <italic>Nkx3</italic>.2-Cre;<italic>R26</italic>-LacZ<sup>f/+</sup> embryos were stained with X-gal as described above. Entire embryos were then cut to obtain 5 Âµm thick sections, and all sections were counterstained with FastRed dye and imaged using Zeiss ApoTome. The total dorsal pancreatic bud area, identified by its typical localization and morphology, and pancreatic mesenchyme area, identified by blue x-gal staining, were manually selected and measured using MetaMorph software.</p>
        <p>For Ptf1a<sup>+</sup> cell quantification, isolated e15.5 pancreatic tissue were fixed, embedded in OCT, frozen, and cryosectioned. 10 Âµm thick sections were used and every 10th section was stained (10% of total tissue). Whole sections were imaged using Leica SP5 confocal microscope and the number of positive cells was counted manually. To account for potential differences in developmental stage of each litter, the number of positive cells obtained for each transgenic animal was normalized to the number obtained from the non-transgenic littermate control.</p>
