<abstract>
<p>Inferior olivary activity causes both short-term and long-term changes in cerebellar output underlying motor performance and motor learning. Many of its neurons engage in coherent subthreshold oscillations and are extensively coupled via gap junctions. Studies in reduced preparations suggest that these properties promote rhythmic, synchronized output. However, the interaction of these properties with torrential synaptic inputs in awake behaving animals is not well understood. Here we combine electrophysiological recordings in awake mice with a realistic tissue-scale computational model of the inferior olive to study the relative impact of intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms governing its activity. Our data and model suggest that if subthreshold oscillations are present in the awake state, the period of these oscillations will be transient and variable. Accordingly, by using different temporal patterns of sensory stimulation, we found that complex spike rhythmicity was readily evoked but limited to short intervals of no more than a few hundred milliseconds and that the periodicity of this rhythmic activity was not fixed but dynamically related to the synaptic input to the inferior olive as well as to motor output. In contrast, in the long-term, the average olivary spiking activity was not affected by the strength and duration of the sensory stimulation, while the level of gap junctional coupling determined the stiffness of the rhythmic activity in the olivary network during its dynamic response to sensory modulation. Thus, interactions between intrinsic properties and extrinsic inputs can explain the variations of spiking activity of olivary neurons, providing a temporal framework for the creation of both the short-term and long-term changes in cerebellar output.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Activity of the inferior olive, transmitted via climbing fibers to the cerebellum, regulates initiation and amplitude of movements, signals unexpected sensory feedback, and directs cerebellar learning. It is characterized by widespread subthreshold oscillations and synchronization promoted by strong electrotonic coupling. In brain slices, subthreshold oscillations gate which inputs can be transmitted by inferior olivary neurons and which will not—dependent on the phase of the oscillation. We tested whether the subthreshold oscillations had a measurable impact on temporal patterning of climbing fiber activity in intact, awake mice. We did so by recording neural activity of the postsynaptic Purkinje cells, in which complex spike firing faithfully represents climbing fiber activity. For short intervals (&lt;300 ms) many Purkinje cells showed spontaneously rhythmic complex spike activity. However, our experiments designed to evoke conditional responses indicated that complex spikes are not predominantly predicated on stimulus history. Our realistic network model of the inferior olive explains the experimental observations via continuous phase modulations of the subthreshold oscillations under the influence of synaptic fluctuations. We conclude that complex spike activity emerges from a quasiperiodic rhythm that is stabilized by electrotonic coupling between its dendrites, yet dynamically influenced by the status of their synaptic inputs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A multitude of behavioral studies leave little doubt that the olivo-cerebellar system organizes appropriate timing in motor behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref003">3</xref>], perceptual function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref006">6</xref>] and motor learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref010">10</xref>]. Furthermore, the role of the inferior olive in motor function is evinced in (permanent and transient) clinical manifestations, such as tremors, resulting from olivary lesions and deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref016">16</xref>]. Although the consequences of olivary dysfunctions are rather clear, the network dynamics producing functional behavior are controversial. At the core of the controversy is the question whether inferior olive cells are oscillating during the awake state and whether these oscillations affect the timing of the inferior olivary output [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref019">19</xref>]. The inferior olive is the sole source of the climbing fibers, the activity of which dictates complex spike firing by cerebellar Purkinje cells (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref020">20</xref>]). Climbing fiber activity is essential for motor coordination, as it contributes to both initiation and learning of movements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref026">26</xref>], and it may also be involved in sensory processing and regulating more cognitive tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref030">30</xref>]. Understanding the systemic consequences of inferior olivary spiking is therefore of great importance.</p>
<p>The dendritic spines of inferior olivary neurons are grouped in glomeruli, in which they are coupled by numerous gap junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref033">33</xref>], which broadcast the activity state of olivary neurons. Due to their specific set of conductances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref040">40</xref>], the neurons of the inferior olive can produce subthreshold oscillations (STOs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref043">43</xref>]. The occurrence of STOs does not require gap junctions per se [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref044">44</xref>], but the gap junctions appear to affect the amplitude of STOs and engage larger networks in synchronous oscillation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref042">42</xref>]. Both experimental and theoretical studies have demonstrated that STOs may mediate phase-dependent gating where the phase of the STO helps to determine whether excitatory input can or cannot evoke a spike [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref046">46</xref>]. Indeed, whole cell recordings of olivary neurons in the anesthetized preparation indicate that their STOs can contribute to the firing rhythm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref043">43</xref>] and extracellular recordings of Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex under anesthesia often show periods of complex spike firing around the typical olivary rhythm of 10 Hz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref047">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref049">49</xref>]. However, several attempts to capture clues to these putative oscillations in the absence of anesthesia have, so far, returned empty handed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref050">50</xref>].</p>
<p>It has been shown that in the anesthetized state both the amplitude and phase of the STOs can be altered by synaptic inputs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref010">10</xref>]. Inhibitory inputs to the inferior olive originate in the cerebellar nuclei and have broadly distributed terminals onto compact sets of olivary cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref051">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref053">53</xref>]. Excitatory terminals predominantly originate in the spinal cord and lower brainstem, mainly carrying sensory information, and in the nuclei of the meso-diencephalic junction in the higher brainstem, carrying higher-order input from the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref054">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref055">55</xref>]. In addition, the inferior olive receives modulating, depolarizing, level-setting inputs from areas like the raphe nuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref055">55</xref>]. Unlike most other brain regions, the inferior olive is virtually devoid of interneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref056">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref057">57</xref>]. Thus, the long-range projections to the inferior olive in conjunction with presumed STOs and gap junctions jointly determine the activity pattern of the complex spikes in Purkinje cells. How these factors contribute to functional dynamics of the inferior olive in awake mammals remains to be elucidated.</p>

<p><bold>(A)</bold> Simplified scheme of the inputs to the inferior olive (IO). Sensory input reaches the IO directly from the brainstem and spinal cord. In our study, we used facial whisker input that is relayed via the sensory trigeminal nuclei (TN). This input is considered the “sensory input” in our modeling studies. The IO also receives continuous inputs from other brain regions, which we modeled as the “contextual input”. The contextual input consists of excitatory input from the cerebral cortex (e.g., the motor (M1) and somatosensory cortex (S1)), either directly or relayed via the nuclei of the meso-diencephalic junction (MDJ), as well as of inhibitory input from the cerebellar nuclei (CN). The output of the IO is directed via its climbing fibers to the Purkinje cells (PCs) in the cerebellar cortex and via its climbing fiber collaterals to the CN. Sensory input also affects the contextual input indirectly, via the strong pathway from the TN via the thalamus (TH) to the cerebral cortex. <bold>(B)</bold> Representative trace of Purkinje cell activity showing simple spikes (as downward deflections) occurring at a high frequency and occasionally complex spikes (CS; marked with a blue dot).

<p>Here, we combine recordings in awake mice–in the presence and absence of gap junctions–with network simulations using a novel inferior olivary model to study the functional relevance of STOs in terms of resonant spikes. We are led to propose a view of inferior olivary function that is more consistent with the interplay between STOs, gap junctions and inputs to the inferior olive. Rather than acting as a strictly periodic metronome, the inferior olive appears more adequately described as a quasiperiodic ratchet, where cycles with variable short-lasting periods erase long-term phase dependencies.</p>

<title>Stimulation promotes oscillatory patterns in profiles of complex spikes over short periods</title>
<p>To study the conditions for, and consequences of, rhythmic activity of the inferior olive, we made single-unit recordings of cerebellar Purkinje cells in lobules crus 1 and crus 2 (<italic>n</italic> = 52 cells in 16 awake mice) in the presence and absence of short-duration (30 ms) whisker air puff stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). In the absence of sensory stimulation, the complex spikes of 35% of the Purkinje cells (18 out of 52) showed rhythmic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g002">Fig 2A–2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006475.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) with a median frequency of 8.5 Hz (inter-quartile range (IQR): 4.7–11.9 Hz). Upon sensory stimulation, 46 out of the 52 cells (88%) showed statistically significant complex spike responses. Of these, 31 (67%) had sensory-induced rhythmicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g002">Fig 2D–2F</xref>), which was a significantly larger proportion than during spontaneous behavior (<italic>p</italic> = 0.002; Fisher’s exact test). The median frequency of the oscillatory activity following stimulation was 9.1 Hz (IQR: 7.9–13.3 Hz). Hence, the preferred frequencies in the presence and absence of sensory stimulation were similar (<italic>p</italic> = 0.22; Wilcoxon rank sum test) (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g002">2C, 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g003">3</xref>). The duration of the enhanced rhythmicity following stimulation was relatively short in that it lasted no more than 250 ms. With our stringent Z-score criterion (&gt;3), only a single neuron showed 3 consecutive significant peaks in the peri-stimulus time histogram (PSTH). The minimum inter-complex spike interval (ICSI) across cells was around 50 ms, putatively representing the refractory period. We conclude that complex spikes also display rhythmicity in awake behaving mice, and that sensory stimulation can amplify these resonances in periods of a few hundred milliseconds, even though stimulation is not required for the occurrence of rhythmicity per se.</p>

<title>Rhythmic patterns of complex spikes following stimulation are transient</title>
<p>The pattern of rhythmic complex spike responses that was apparent for a couple of hundred milliseconds after a particular air puff stimulus repeated itself in a stable manner across the 1,000 trials (applied at 0.25 Hz) during which we recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). For example, the level of rhythmicity of the first 100 trials was not significantly different from that during the last 100 trials (comparing spike counts in first PSTH peak, <italic>p</italic> = 0.824; χ<sup>2</sup> test, or latency to first spike, <italic>p</italic> = 0.727, <italic>t</italic> test). This strongly indicates that there is–in a substantial fraction of the Purkinje cells–persistent oscillatory gating of the probability for complex spikes after a sensory stimulus resulting in time intervals (“windows of opportunity”) during which complex spikes preferentially occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g004">Fig 4B–4E</xref>). These windows of opportunity become even more apparent when sorting the trials on the basis of response latency: the first complex spikes with a long latency following the stimulus align with the second spikes of the short latency responses. Similarly, there are trials during which complex spikes appear only at the third cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, seen as a steeper rise around trial no. 650). The occurrence of spikes during later cycles, not predicated on prior spikes, argues against refractory periods or rebound spiking as the sole explanations for such rhythmic firing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref058">58</xref>] and highlight the putative existence of network-wide coherent oscillations.</p>

This phase dependence would not appear if it would be solely due to a reset followed by transient oscillation evoked exclusively in the spiking cell.

<title>Behavioral correlates of complex spikes patterns following stimulation</title>
<p>Since sensory stimulation of the whiskers can trigger a reflexive whisker protraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref059">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref061">61</xref>] and complex spike firing is known to correlate with the amplitude of this protraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref061">61</xref>], we examined the relation between periodic complex spike firing and whisker protraction. To this end, we further analyzed an existing dataset of simultaneously recorded Purkinje cells and whisker movements during 0.5 Hz air puff stimulation of the ipsilateral whisker pad. In line with our previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref061">61</xref>], trials during which a single complex spike occurred within 100 ms of whisker pad stimulation had on average a slightly, but significantly stronger protraction (from 6.1 ± 5.4° to 6.8 ± 5.3° (medians ± IQR), <italic>n</italic> = 35 Purkinje cells, <italic>p</italic> = 0.033, Wilcoxon-matched pairs test after Benjamini-Hochberg correction; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006475.s002">S2A–S2C Fig</xref>). Our new analysis revealed that also the occurrence of a second complex spike was correlated with a stronger whisker protraction. This could be observed as a second period of increased protraction during trials with two complex spikes. When compared to the increase in trials with a single complex spike, this second protraction was highly significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, Wilcoxon-matched pairs test after Benjamini-Hochberg correction; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006475.s002">S2D Fig</xref>). The second complex spike was unlikely a mere reflection of stronger protraction following the first complex spike, as there was no difference in whisker protraction between the trials that had a complex spike during the first, but not the second 100 ms after stimulus onset, and the trials with the opposite pattern (a complex spike during the second, but not the first 100 ms; <italic>p</italic> = 0.980, Wilcoxon-matched pairs test after Benjamini-Hochberg correction). The rhythmic firing pattern of complex spikes was thus reflected in the behavioral output of mice.</p>

<title>STOs can explain windows of opportunity</title>
<p>The existence of windows of opportunity for complex spike activity is compatible with the assumption of an underlying STO, and cannot solely be explained by rebound activity without invoking circuit-wide extrinsic mechanisms. To test the implications of assuming olivary STOs, we proceeded to reproduce a detailed network with a tissue-scale computer model of the inferior olive neuropil. The model is constituted by 200 biophysically plausible model cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref062">62</xref>] embedded in a topographically arranged 3D-grid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g005">Fig 5A–5C</xref>). It has the scale of a sheet of olivary neurons of about 10% of the murine principal olivary nucleus (cf. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref063">63</xref>]). The model was designed to test hypotheses about the interaction between intrinsic parameters of olivary neurons, such as STOs and gap junctional coupling, and extrinsic parameters including synaptic inputs during the generation of complex spike patterns.</p>

<title>A tissue-scale network model of the inferior olive.</title>
<p><bold>(A)</bold> To study the relative impact of the different components of the inferior olive we employed a biologically realistic network consisting of 200 model neurons embedded in a 3D grid of 10 x 10 x 2. The model neurons received input from two sources: a phasic input dubbed "sensory input" and a continuous fluctuating current, emulating a "contextual input". The “sensory input” reaches a subset of neurons synchronously and is modeled as an activation of glutamate receptor channels with a peak amplitude of 5 pA/cm<sup>2</sup>. The “sensory input” is complemented with a continuous input that is a mixture of excitatory and inhibitory synapses representing signals from different sources (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The “contextual input” is modeled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise process delivered to all neurons in the model network, with a 20 ms decay, representing temporally correlated input. The model neurons are interconnected by gap junctions. <bold>(B)</bold> The model neurons display subthreshold membrane oscillations (STOs), represented by the lower circle, and spiking, represented by the upper circle. The colors indicate which current dominates which part of the activity pattern. An I<sub>h</sub> current (green), a hyperpolarization-activated cation current, underlies a rise in membrane potential; the I<sub>T</sub> current (red), mediated by low threshold T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1), further drives up the membrane potential and from here either the subthreshold oscillation continues (lower circle) or a spike is generated (upper circle), mediated through I<sub>Na</sub> and I<sub>K</sub> currents (yellow and blue, respectively); both after a spike or a subthreshold peak, influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> through the P/Q-type type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (Ca<sub>v</sub>2.1) leads to a hyperpolarization due to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent K<sup>+</sup> channels (blue); this hyperpolarization in turn will activate the I<sub>h</sub> current resuming the oscillation cycle.

<p>Each neuron in the model is composed of a somatic, an axonal and a dendritic compartment, each endowed with a particular set of conductances, including a somatic low threshold Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1; T-type), a dendritic high threshold Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (Ca<sub>v</sub>2.1; P/Q-type) and a dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channel, chiefly regulating STO amplitudes, while a somatic HCN channel partially determines the STO period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g005">Fig 5B</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec023">Methods</xref>). The dendrites of each neuron are connected to the dendrites of, on average, eight nearby neighbors (within a radius of three nodes in the grid, representing a patch of about 400 μm x 400 μm of the murine inferior olive), simulating anisotropic and local gap junctional coupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). As the inferior olive itself, our model has boundaries which have impact on local connectivity characteristics, such as the clustering coefficient, though these did not have significant impact on the average firing rate between edge and center cells (<italic>p</italic> = 0.812, comparing edge and center cells, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006475.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). The coupling coefficient between model cells varied between 0 and 10%, as reported for experimental data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref064">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref065">65</xref>].</p>
<p>Sensory input was implemented as excitatory synaptic input, simulating the whisker signals originating from the sensory trigeminal nuclei that were synchronously delivered to a subset of model neurons. Additionally, a “contextual input” was implemented as a combination of inhibitory feedback from the cerebellar nuclei and a level setting modulating input (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g001">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g005">5A</xref>). This contextual input is modeled after an Ohrstein-Uhlenbeck process, essentially a random exploration with a decay parameter that imposes a well-defined mean yet with controllable temporal correlations (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec023">Methods</xref>). The amplitude of the contextual input drives the firing rate of the model neurons, which we set around 1 Hz (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006475.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), corresponding to what has been observed <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref066">66</xref>].

<title>Characteristics of STO dependent spiking in the network model</title>
<p>Whether a model neuron at rest displays STOs or not is largely determined by its channel conductances. Activation of somatic T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels can trigger dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent K<sup>+</sup> channels that can induce I<sub>h</sub>, which in turn can again activate T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, and so forth. This cyclic pattern can cause STOs that could occasionally produce spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). In our model, the conductance parameters were randomized (within limits, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec023">Methods</xref>) so as to obtain an approximate 1:3 ratio of oscillating to non-oscillating cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006475.s005">S5 Fig</xref>) guided by proportions observed <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref043">43</xref>]. Sensitivity analysis with smaller ratios (down to 1:5) did not qualitatively alter the results (data and analyses scripts are available online in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/9hmpy/" xlink:type="simple">https://osf.io/9hmpy/</ext-link>).</p>
<p>In the absence of contextual input, model neurons were relatively silent, but when triggered by sensory input, as occurred in our behavioral data (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g004">4</xref>), STOs synchronized by gap junctions would occur for two or three cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). Our network model confirms that gap junctional coupling can broaden the distribution of STO frequencies and that even non-oscillating cells may, when coupled, collectively act as oscillators (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006475.s006">S6 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref067">67</xref>]. Adding contextual input to the model network can lead to more spontaneous spiking in between two sensory stimuli. Compared to the situation in the absence of contextual input, the STOs are much less prominent and the post-spike reverberation is even shorter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Accordingly, despite the significant levels of correlation in the contextual input (10%), the periods between oscillations are more variable due to the interaction of the noisy current and the phase response properties of the network. In addition, in the presence of contextual input our model could readily reproduce the appearance of preferred time windows for spiking upon sensory stimulation as observed <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g006">Fig 6D–6F</xref>, cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g004">Fig 4</xref>). This was particularly true for the model cells that directly received sensory inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g006">Fig 6G–6H</xref>). Moreover, the observed rhythmicity in model cells as observed in their STO activity was in tune with that of the auto-correlogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g006">Fig 6D–6I</xref>) in that the timing of the STOs and that of the spiking were closely correlated (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). It should be noted though that model cells adjacent to cells directly receiving sensory input showed only a minor effect of stimulation. Thus, even though the gap junction currents in the model were chosen as the ceiling physiological value for the coupling coefficient (≤10%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref067">67</xref>], these currents alone were not enough to trigger spikes in neighboring cells.</p>

<p>Both directly stimulated model cells and those receiving only contextual input exhibited phase preferences, seen in the spike-triggered membrane potential average as well as in the spike-triggered average of the input currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g006">Fig 6G–6I</xref>). Spike-triggered averages of membrane potentials for any cell showed depolarization followed by hyperpolarization. In contrast, trials in which no spike was generated showed a depolarization just before the occurrence of the input. Similarly, the average of the input showed a long-lived phase preference, not only for a hyperpolarization before the spike, but also a preference for a depolarization in the previous peak of the STO, more than 100 ms earlier. These results are in line <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments under dynamic clamp and noisy input [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref068">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref069">69</xref>].

<title>Phase-dependent gating in the network model</title>
<p>Depolarizing sensory input delivered onto a subset of the model cells can reset the STO phase in oscillatory cells and create resonant transients in others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006475.s007">S7 Fig</xref> on the appearance of rebound firing). If a second stimulus is delivered during this short-lasting transient, the response probability is increased. As in most cells with resonant short-lasting dynamics, inputs delivered during different phases can cause phase advances or delays. Hyperpolarization advanced the phase between 0−<italic>π</italic> and delayed the phase between <italic>π</italic>−2<italic>π</italic>, whereas depolarization had roughly the opposite effect, in addition to phase advancements with spikes in later cycles between <italic>π</italic>−2<italic>π</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g007">Fig 7C–7E</xref>). Thus, there is a mutual influence of synaptic inputs and STOs on periodicity. While STOs can lead to phase-dependent gating, synaptic input can either modulate or reset the phase of the STOs, generating variable periods that range between 40–160 ms for the chosen amplitude of the contextual input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g008">Fig 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006475.s006">S6 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Synaptic input determines the phase-dependent gating properties of the inferior olive network model.</title>
<p><bold>(A)</bold> Phase-dependent spiking was prominent in our network model of the inferior olive in the absence of contextual input. We repeatedly stimulated the same 54 model cells with synchronous sensory input (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). The other 146 neurons of the network model were present, but not directly stimulated. Phase-dependent gating was studied using tandem stimulation with varying inter-stimulus intervals. The membrane potential of each of these 54 model neurons is plotted in <bold>A</bold> as a waterfall plot and in <bold>B</bold> as a heat map. The simulations are grouped by the interval between the two stimuli, starting with a single stimulation (red), and continuing with two stimuli with small to large intervals. In 13 equal steps two whole cycles of the subthreshold oscillation were covered. <bold>(C)</bold> Average and inter-quartile range (shaded area) of membrane potentials of neurons in the network that were only perturbed once at 0 ms (red) or twice (other colors). The phase of the subthreshold oscillations of the “synchronized” cells in the network was used to compute the data displayed in <bold>D</bold> and <bold>E</bold>. Note that the average membrane potential at the perturbation at 0 ms only went up to -15 mV and not up to the average spike peak of approximately 10 mV, because in the population only a fraction of neurons spiked. <bold>(D)</bold> Spike probability plot as measured for the second perturbation at the different phases of the membrane oscillation. Spike probability was computed as the number of neurons firing divided over the total number of neurons getting input. The first perturbation given at the peak of the oscillation is demarked as the start of the oscillation cycle. Perturbations at both a half and one-and-a half cycle (π and 3π, respectively) did not trigger spikes, whereas perturbations at either one or two full oscillation cycles (2π and 4π, respectively) did (see also <bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>). The repetition of the ‘sinusoidal’ probability curve shows that gating is not (only) due to a refractory period, but follows the hyperpolarized phase of the oscillation (not shown). <bold>(E)</bold> Phase response curve showing that perturbations early in the oscillation phase did not have a large impact on the timing of the spike, but halfway the oscillation the perturbations advanced the ongoing phase considerably, with impact declining linearly to the end of the full cycle. <bold>(F)</bold> Gallop stimuli provide indirect evidence for an underlying oscillatory process. This idealized diagram illustrates the impact of a resetting stimulus on the future spiking probabilities. Here we assume that resetting spikes occur only during the rising phases of the STO (red) and not during the falling phases (blue). One can query for the impact on spiking probability for any given initial phase at any time after the first stimulus. Different intervals lead to biased response ratios. <bold>(G)</bold> In order to test the impact of the presumed phase of the inferior olivary neurons, we applied a “gallop” stimulation pattern, alternating short (250 ms) and long (400 ms) intervals (top row). “Sensory input” (vertical red shaded bars) were delivered and spikes were counted in response windows (RW) 0–180 ms post-stimulus. Response probabilities were compared between response windows (RW) in short (empty bars) and long intervals (filled bars). Many cells in the model prefer either the short or the long window (for spiking cells, see left lower panel). However, in the presence of contextual noise, this preference largely washes off, seen as approximately symmetric responses in each of the intervals. Asterisks indicate that a tiny fraction of cells still displayed significant preference for particular intervals, which could be attributed to the low number of spikes fired by these cells.</p>

<title>Gallop stimuli provide indirect evidence for STOs</title>
<p>The only means of settling the question about the prevalence of STOs in awake and behaving mice would be intracellular recordings of inferior olivary neurons, which remains a daunting experimental challenge. We therefore looked for a less invasive method that could read out, from indirect and infrequent complex spikes, the presence or absence of STOs. We have developed one such paradigm inspired by auditory studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref070">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref071">71</xref>] using a rhythmic gallop stimulus that we first applied to the network model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g007">Fig 7F</xref>). In the gallop paradigm, stimuli are applied in quick succession with alternating intervals, comparable to the putative period of the underlying oscillation. Enough stimuli should be applied such that after multiple presentations the stimuli sample a uniform distribution of phases. In the context of auditory stimuli, the standard gallop experiment involves different tones and is used to test perceptual separation of auditory streams. Such rhythmic stimuli can help indicate resonances or physical limitations of the system, and distinguish across possible models for this separation (such as in neural resonance theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref071">71</xref>]). One possible mechanism of auditory stream separation is an underlying oscillatory process which resets in certain phases and is less responsive in others. According to the <bold><italic>in vitro</italic></bold> inferior olive literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref043">43</xref>] this behavior is to be expected, and hence, such a stimulus can help distinguish underlying processes.</p>
<p>If spikes are modulated by an oscillatory process, the presence of spikes on a short interval should be able to predict, in the next interval, the absence or presence of spikes. Indeed, if the underlying process producing spikes has oscillatory components and a relatively stable period, the probability of spikes in each interval is systematically different, which would appear as asymmetric ratios of response in the different intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g007">Fig 7F</xref>). This can be inspected as the length of the empty and filled vertical bars representing ratio of probabilities of spiking for long or short stimulation intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g007">Fig 7G</xref>). Thus, if the period of the STO rhythm would be regular and cause phase-dependent gating, complex spike responses following each stimulus interval are expected to show preferences for the short or long window of stimulation; these preferences were indeed observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g007">Fig 7G</xref>, left). However, this clear phase dependency only appears in the noiseless model scenario. After adding a moderate amount of contextual input, this dependency washes off, rendering the responses in the two windows more symmetric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g007">Fig 7G</xref>, right), with only a few cells (5/200) displaying significant ratio differences (tested against bootstrap with shuffled spikes).</p>

<title>Model exhibits network activity that is synchronous and oscillating, but quasiperiodic</title>
<p>In line with the experimental <italic>in vivo</italic> data (e.g., Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g004">4</xref>), the olivary spike rhythmicity in the network model was steadily present over longer periods, and for a wide range of contextual input parameters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006475.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). In addition, it also comprised, as in the experimental data, variations in frequency and amplitude during shorter epochs (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g008">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006475.s006">S6</xref>). Analysis of the network parameters indicates that these latter variations in oscillatory behavior can be readily understood by their sensitivity to both the amplitude (parameter 'sigma') and kinetics (parameter 'tau', temporal decay) of the contextual input. Indeed, because of the underlying Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, the generation of contextual input converges to a specified mean and standard deviation, but in short intervals the statistics including the average network STO frequency can drift considerably (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g006">6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g008">8</xref>). Since relatively small differences in oscillation parameters such as frequency can accumulate, they can swiftly overrule longer-term dependencies created by periodically resetting stimuli, as an analysis of phase distributions shows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g009">Fig 9</xref>). Thus, based upon the similar outcomes of the network model and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, we are led to propose that (1) the STOs in the inferior olive may well contribute to the continuous generation of short-lasting patterns of complex spikes in awake behaving animals, and that (2) the synaptic input to the inferior olive may modify the main parameters of these STOs. Note that in the absence of input, periodic rhythmic behavior should be the default behavior of oscillating cells. Thus, in all likelihood, even if the inferior olive oscillates endemically, sustained but variable input should induce highly contextual spike responses to variable periods and render the olivary responses quasiperiodic, rather than regularly periodic as observed in reduced preparations.</p>

As discussed above, a gallop stimulus would expose such an oscillatory process underlying the response probabilities. Four idealized scenarios about the expected results can be constructed, as follows: first, one can start with a complete absence of STOs, which would result in a response probability unrelated to stimulus intervals; second, it could be that there were STOs, but no phase-dependent firing (to be expected if the STO amplitude is small), which would also lead to complex spike firing irrespective of stimulus intervals; third, there could be STOs, but each stimulus would evoke a phase-reset, which again, would not lead to interval dependencies; and fourth, there could be STOs in combination with phase-dependent gating, which would result in a clear dependency of complex spike firing on the previous interval length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g007">Fig 7G</xref>, left panel). It should be noted that the large majority of studies on inferior olivary physiology, especially in reduced preparations, found evidence for the fourth situation (STOs + phase-dependent gating) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref067">67</xref>].</p>

<title>High-frequency stimulation does not evoke resonant complex spike firing</title>
<p>Our experimental data provided evidence for phase-dependent complex spike firing during brief intervals, but gallop stimulation did not expose a strong impact of STOs on complex spike response probabilities. Therefore, we sought an alternative approach to study the impact–if any–of STOs on complex spike firing <italic>in vivo</italic>. We reasoned that, if a sensory stimulus triggers a complex spike response with a certain probability, higher stimulation frequency should result in a proportional increase in complex spike firing. In particular, stimulus frequencies that would be in phase with the underlying STO would be expected to show signs of resonance and result in disproportionally increased complex spike firing. However, over periods of tens of seconds the complex spike frequency was resilient to varying the stimulus frequency between 1 and 4 Hz (linear regression = -0.02; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g010">Fig 10C</xref>) and did not show signs of resonance with any of the stimulus frequencies, as there were no frequencies at which the complex spike firing was substantially increased. Only a very high rate of sensory stimulation (10 Hz), commensurable with the average duration of windows of opportunity, could induce a mild increase in complex spike firing frequency, albeit at the cost of a highly reduced response probability (average increase: 71 ± 64% corresponding to an average increase from 1.12 Hz to 1.92 Hz; <italic>n</italic> = 5; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; paired <italic>t</italic> test). This examination indicates that the average complex spike frequency is robust and stiff to modulation over longer time periods, imposing a hard limit on the frequency with which complex spikes can respond to sensory stimuli, confirming recent reports on complex spike homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref072">72</xref>].</p>

<title>STOs may contribute to complex spike firing during shorter periods</title>
<p>As stimulus triggered resonances were not observed at any of the stimulation frequencies, we turned to a more sensitive measure for the detection of oscillatory components in complex spike firing. We developed a statistical model that extrapolated from frequencies inferred through inter-complex spike intervals and stimulus triggered histograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g011">Fig 11A and 11B</xref>). We reasoned that phase-dependent gating would imply that the interval between the last complex spike before and the first one after sensory stimulation aligns to the preferred frequency. In contrast, if sensory stimulation would typically evoke a phase reset, as suggested by our network model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g007">Fig 7</xref>), no such relation would be found. The method was applied only to Purkinje cells with highly rhythmic complex spike firing. For each of those, we calculated their preferred frequency in the absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g011">Fig 11C</xref>) or presence of sensory stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g011">Fig 11D</xref>). We used that frequency to construct statistical models representing idealized extremes of phase-dependent (oscillatory) and -independent (uniform) responses. For the oscillatory component we employed an oscillatory gating model, where the timing of the first complex spike after stimulus onset would be in-phase with the ongoing oscillation. This model was contrasted to a linear response model in which sensory stimulus could evoke a complex spike independent of the moment of the last complex spike before that stimulus, apart from a refractory period. For each Purkinje cell, we compared the distribution of the intervals between the last complex spike before and the first complex spike after stimulus onset with the predicted distributions based on the linear model, the oscillatory model and nine intermediate models, mixing linear and oscillatory components with different relative weights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g011">Fig 11A–11E</xref>). For the two extreme models as well as for the nine intermediate models we calculated a goodness-of-fit per Purkinje cell. Overall, when using these relatively long periods (300 ms), the linear model was superior to the oscillatory model, although a contribution of the oscillatory model could often improve the goodness-of-fit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g011">Fig 11F–11H</xref>). Despite the apparent failure of the oscillatory model to fit the data, the data did show an oscillatory profile for many of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g011">Fig 11E</xref>). This lends support to our observations that short-lived, but reliable, oscillations are apparent in complex spike timing, although they have little impact on the timing or probability of sensory triggered CS responses.</p>

<title>Gap junctions facilitate frequency modulation of rhythmic complex spike firing</title>
<p>Apart from the STOs, extensive gap junctional coupling between dendrites is a second defining feature of the cyto-architecture of the inferior olive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref073">73</xref>]. Absence of these gap junctions leads to relatively mild, but present deficits in reflex-like behavior and learning thereof [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref074">74</xref>]. We analyzed the inter-complex spike interval times in Purkinje cells of mutant mice that lack the Gjd2 (Cx36) protein and are hence unable to form functional gap junctions in their inferior olive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref069">69</xref>]. In line with the predictions made by our network model (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g005">5H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006475.s006">S6</xref>), the absence of gap junctions did not quench rhythmic complex spike firing during spontaneous activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g012">Fig 12A</xref>). In fact, the fraction of Purkinje cells showing significant rhythmicity in the Gjd2 KO mice was larger than that in the wild-type littermates (Gjd2 KO: 38 out of 65 Purkinje cells (58%) vs. WT: 15 out of 46 Purkinje cells (33%); <italic>p</italic> = 0.0118; Fisher’s exact test), with their average rhythmicity being significantly stronger (<italic>p</italic> = 0.003; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), measured by Z-scores of side peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g012">Fig 12B</xref>). Indeed, the variation in oscillatory frequencies across Purkinje cells of the mutants was significantly less than that in their wild-type littermates in that the latency to peak times per Purkinje cell were less variable (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0431; Mann-Whitney test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g012">Fig 12C</xref>). This latter finding is at first sight contradictory to our findings in the network model, where we show that gap junctions promote more uniform firing rates through increased synchrony between neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g005">Fig 5H</xref>). These simulations were run in the absence of synaptic input, though. Addition of contextual input also creates more variability in the wild type cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006475.s006">S6B Fig</xref>). As the lack of gap junctions increases cell excitability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref069">69</xref>], it is likely that synaptic input has a larger impact in the absence of gap junctions, leaving less room for inter-cell heterogeneity. Overall, removal of gap junctions affected the temporal and spatial dynamics by increasing the stereotypical rhythmicity of complex spike firing.</p>

<title>Temporal relations of complex spikes of different Purkinje cells</title>
<p>We made paired recordings of Purkinje cells in awake mice to study the temporal relations of their complex spikes during spontaneous activity. The cell pairs were recorded with two electrodes randomly placed in a grid of 8 x 4, with 300 μm between electrode centers. For each pair of simultaneously recorded Purkinje cells, we made a cross-correlogram. The median number of complex spikes in the reference cell used for these cross-correlograms was 827 (range: 74–2174). Cell pairs showed coherent activity in that they could show a central peak and/or a side peak in their cross-correlogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g013">Fig 13A–13C</xref>). The side peaks could appear at different latencies, similar to the range observed in auto-correlograms of single Purkinje cells (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Moreover, Purkinje cell pairs that did not produce signs of synchronous spiking in the center peak could still produce an “echo” in the side peak after 50–150 ms. Counter-intuitively, cross-correlograms of Purkinje cell pairs of the wild type mice showed less often a significant center peak than those of Gjd2 KOs (WT: 51 out of 96 pairs (53%; <italic>N</italic> = 4 mice); Gjd2 KO: 44 out of 61 pairs (72%; <italic>N</italic> = 7 mice); <italic>p</italic> = 0.0305; Fisher’s exact test). In line with the more stereotypic firing observed in single cells in the absence of gap junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g012">Fig 12</xref>), the strength of the center peak was on average enhanced in the mutants (<italic>Z-</italic>scores of significant center peaks (median ± IQR): WT: 3.47 ± 1.82; Gjd2 KO: 5.75 ± 5.58; <italic>p</italic> = 0.0002; Mann-Whitney test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g013">Fig 13D–13F</xref>). Instead, the side peak of Gjd2 KO Purkinje cell pairs was not stronger than that of WTs (<italic>Z</italic>-scores of significant side peaks (median ± IQR): WT: 3.01 ± 0.89; Gjd2 KO: 3.04 ± 1.52; <italic>p</italic> = 0.194; Mann-Whitney test), leading to a lower ratio between center and side peak (mean ± SEM: WT: 90.70 ± 5.17%; Gjd2 KO: 72.86 ± 6.52%; <italic>p</italic> = 0.036; <italic>t</italic> = 2.143; df = 67; <italic>t</italic> test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g013">Fig 13E and 13F</xref>). Interestingly, the occurrence of side peaks in Purkinje cell pairs was unidirectional in approximately half the cell pairs (WT: 47 out of 82 pairs with at least one side peak (57%); Gjd2 KO: 25 out of 47 pairs (53%); <italic>p</italic> = 0.714; Fisher’s exact test), which means that one of the neurons of a pair was leading the other, but not <italic>vice versa</italic>. As this was consistent in the Gjd2 KO as well as the WT Purkinje cells, these data could reflect traveling waves across the inferior olive, which, however, must have extrinsic sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref075">75</xref>]. Thus, the paired recordings are compatible with the findings highlighted above in that the presence of coupling can affect the coherence of STOs for short periods up to a few hundred milliseconds, while leaving the window for later correlated events open.</p>

Synchronized subthreshold oscillations (STOs) of olivary neurons have been suggested to contribute to the formation of temporal patterning of complex spike firing, but most of the evidence for STOs has been obtained in decerebrate or anesthetized animals <italic>in vivo</italic> or, even more indirectly, <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref079">79</xref>, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref080">80</xref>].

We evaluated rhythmic complex spike firing in behaving animals responding to peripheral stimuli and investigated their match with simulations of a tissue-scale model of the inferior olivary network. The model and data would be consistent with STOs whose period can be readily adjusted upon synaptic fluctuations from other brain regions, an effect that is consistent with the known response properties of the inferior olive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref067">67</xref>].</p>

<title>Complex spike patterns are explained by cell physiology and network-wide properties</title>
<p>During spontaneous activity, Purkinje cells generally fire a complex spike roughly once a second, but this frequency can be increased to about 10 Hz by systemically applying drugs, like harmaline, which directly affect conductances mediating STOs in the inferior olive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref081">81</xref>]. Since these drugs also induce tremorgenic movements beating at similar frequencies, it has been proposed that the inferior olive may serve as a temporal framework for motor coordination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref082">82</xref>]. This oscillatory firing behavior of the olivary neurons may mirror limb resonant properties and act as an inverse controller, for example by dampening the dynamics of the muscles involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref083">83</xref>].</p>
<p>In line with previous recordings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref061">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref072">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref076">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref078">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref084">84</xref>], the current data indicate that only a small fraction of Purkinje neurons respond to sensory stimulation with a complex spike response probability larger than 50%. This probability falls substantially with increasing frequency of stimulation, as the overall spike frequency only marginally increases to high frequency stimulation. Even after applying different temporal patterns of sensory stimulation for longer epochs, we observed no substantial deviation from the stereotypic 1 Hz firing rate. Moreover, it should be noted that even if the frequency of underlying oscillations has bearing on the pattern of responses of the gallop stimuli, conditional dependencies should be expected for most STO frequencies, unless the ratio of the interval of gallop and the STO period has no remainder. Given the seemingly consistent frequencies predicted by PSTH's and autocorrelograms of single cells (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g003">3</xref>, but also seen in cross correlograms, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g013">Fig 13</xref>), we chose gallop intervals with periods commensurate with a representative frequency of 8 Hz, each of which should sample different phases in the oscillation. If at all present, we should have observed conditional dependencies on at least a few cells.</p>
<p>In our study, complex spikes remain as unpredictable as ever. Thus, regulatory mechanisms keep the complex spike rate relatively stable over longer time periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref072">72</xref>]. No resonance is exhibited, irrespective of an enduring powerful sensory stimulus in a variety of frequencies. Save few exceptions, the presence of a complex spike in an interval is compensated by the absence in another. Thus, it looks as if the complex spikes rearrange themselves in time in order to keep close to its proverbial 1 Hz frequency. It remains to be shown to what extent the mechanisms involved are intrinsic (cell-dependent) and/or extrinsic (network-dependent). A possible candidate for setting the overall level of excitability through intrinsic mechanisms is given by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>−</sup> channels, which are prominently expressed in olivary neurons along with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent BK and SK K<sup>+</sup> channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref085">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref086">86</xref>]. In addition, the olivo-cerebellar module itself could partly impose this regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref086">86</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref088">88</xref>]. Indeed, the long-term dynamics within the closed olivo-cortico-nuclear loop may well exert homeostatic control, given that increases in complex spikes lead to enhanced inhibition of the inferior olive via the cerebellar nuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref020">20</xref>]. The impact of such a network mechanism may even be more prominent when changes in synchrony are taken into account [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref089">89</xref>]. We propose that a closed-loop experiment conducted while imaging from a wide field, producing stimulation as a function of the degree of complex spike synchrony, could tease out conditional complex spike probabilities. Increasing our capability of predicting complex spikes is instrumental to elucidate the control of inferior olivary firing.</p>

<title>Inferior olivary STOs</title>
<p>The existence of temporal windows of opportunity for complex spike responses following sensory stimulation highlighted a potential impact of STOs on conditional complex spike gating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref090">90</xref>]. Indeed, autocorrelogram peaks correlated well with interspike intervals following stimulation, arguing for an underlying rhythm. Complex spikes could appear in a particular window even when they were not preceded by a complex spike in a previous window during a single trial, arguing against a prominent role of refractory periods in creating rhythmic complex spike responses. Comparing actual firing patterns with statistical models mixing linear or oscillatory interval distributions indicated a potential impact of oscillations. The mild impact of the oscillatory component on explaining the data may in part depend on the assumption that cells have a well-defined frequency. In other words, a variable rebound time could offset the phase response by a couple of milliseconds, reducing the contribution of the oscillatory model, though phase preferences due to prior spikes may still occur (i.e., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g011">Fig 11E</xref>). Our biophysical model suggests that fluctuating inputs, such as those mediating inhibition from the cerebellar nuclei or those relaying depolarizing modulation from the raphe nuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref091">91</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref092">92</xref>], may induce variations in the oscillation period on a cycle-by-cycle basis (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g008">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g009">9</xref>). As these contextual inputs are absent or suppressed in decerebrate or anesthetized preparations, as well as <italic>in vitro</italic>, they may also explain why many earlier studies systematically encountered cells with well-defined STO frequencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref079">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref093">93</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref094">94</xref>]. In the network model, in which we mimicked the contextual input as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with local variations but no long-term drifts of the mean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref095">95</xref>], the results agree well with the experimental observations in terms of synchronous firing, phase shifts, cross-correlogram peaks and side peaks, as well as overall firing frequency. Indeed, the absence of resonant responses over longer time windows and the inconsistency of individual olivary cells to fire on every trial or cycle indicate that the STOs are not regularly periodic, but rather quasiperiodic, while still being synchronous.</p>

<title>Can rebound firing explain rhythmic complex spike responses?</title>
<p>Even though several lines of evidence suggest a role for STOs (see above), we did not observe an unequivocal, significant conditional dependence of complex spikes in the gallop paradigm, as expected by a noiseless model. How can a system with rhythmic responses at least partially fail to be phase modulated by such periodic stimuli? An attractive alternative explanation for rhythmicity might be the occurrence of high-threshold Ca<sub>v</sub>2.1 P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-dependent rebound spikes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006475.s007">S7 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref062">62</xref>]. If impulse-like input to the olive can evoke a spike, and if this spike produces a rebound spike some tens of milliseconds later, this could explain the alignment between the PSTHs and cross-correlograms. However, this argument cannot explain stimulus triggered spikes at the second or third window of opportunity, without an earlier spike as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g004">Fig 4</xref>. As the occurrence of the rebound spike is predicated on a prior spike, a spike in the second or third window without a prior spike cannot be explained by the rebound spiking phenomenon, at least not within the same cell. In other words, the spikes happening exclusively in the second (or third) window of opportunity cannot be the result of a previous spike in the same cell, unless there is a shared rhythm in the network. It is also conceivable that strong hyperpolarization that is synchronized with the complex spike rhythm could promote reverberating firing, but this is an extrinsic mechanism, discussed below. As they stand, our findings do not support the idea that the post-spike hyperpolarization is a prerequisite for the complex spike pattern observed. Multiple windows of opportunity could, according to our model, be enhanced by transient oscillations induced by resets relayed by gap junctions to the local olivary circuit.</p>

<title>The role of gap junctions in complex spike timing</title>
<p>Apart from the almost complete absence of interneurons, the presence of STOs and the exclusive projection to the cerebellum, the abundance of dendro-dendritic gap junctions is another defining feature of the inferior olive. The absence of these gap junctions does not lead to gross motor deficits, but prevents proper acquisition and execution of more challenging tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref074">74</xref>], which is in line with the relatively minor impact found on complex spike activity in Gjd2 KO mice. At first sight, the effects of deleting gap junctions seem counterintuitive. Synchronous and rhythmic patterns are exacerbated, rather than diminished by the loss of gap junctions. However, the side peak of the auto-correlogram is significantly squashed, indicating that the gap junctions have a role in the increased coherence of the upcoming oscillation. Gap junctions do not only facilitate synchronization of coupled neurons, they also lower their excitability by increasing the membrane resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref069">69</xref>]. Together, this results in less direct coupling, observed as reduced synchrony of direct neighbors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref096">96</xref>], and increased responsiveness to synaptic input. This leads to more long-range coherence and as a consequence gap junction networks may act as a “noise filter”, promoting short-range quorum-voting on phase (a term coined by Winfree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref097">97</xref>]). This effect is visible in our model as spikes are most likely to occur when excitation follows inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g006">Fig 6H</xref>). This is in line with the finding that complex spikes of nearby Purkinje cells have a preference to fire together [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref072">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref098">98</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref099">99</xref>]. This concept also agrees with the possibility that coupled olivary neurons may control movements by dampening the dynamics of the muscles involved at an appropriate level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref083">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref100">100</xref>], as both the resonances and movement oscillations increase shortly after sensory stimulation in Gjd2 KO mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref016">16</xref>].</p>

<title>Reverberating loops</title>
<p>Network resonances are a pervasive feature of brain circuits and they can be induced by subthreshold oscillations of particular cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref101">101</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref102">102</xref>]. In addition to the autochthonous dynamics of the inferior olive, reverberating loops through the circuit could help explain some features of complex spike firing, including the occurrence of complex spike doublets and side peaks in cross-correlograms. Such phenomena could be explained by "network echoes", where complex spikes in one cycle would induce complex spikes in the next cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref087">87</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref103">103</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref104">104</xref>]. The most obvious candidate loop to produce is that via the cerebellum and the nuclei of the meso-diencephalic junction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref055">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref105">105</xref>]. The output of the inferior olive is mainly directed via exceptionally strong synapses to the Purkinje cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref106">106</xref>]. These Purkinje cells in turn inhibit neurons of the cerebellar nuclei that can show rebound firing after a period of inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref088">88</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref107">107</xref>]. This rebound activity can excite the inferior olive again via a disynaptic connection via the nuclei of the meso-diencephalic junction. While an isolated complex spike is unlikely to evoke such a rebound activity, a larger group of Purkinje cells could be successful in doing so [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref107">107</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref108">108</xref>]. The travel time for this loop (around 50–100 ms) has been indirectly assessed in the awake preparation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref026">26</xref>], and corresponds to the latency of the rebound firing in the cerebellar nuclei under anesthesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref087">87</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref088">88</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref107">107</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref109">109</xref>]. This implies that the travel times for the entire loop would be in the same order as found for the preferred frequencies of complex spike firing. Other, more elaborate loops involving for instance the forebrain may also exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref110">110</xref>] and could play an additional role in shaping complex spike patterns.</p>
<p>A putative impact of reverberating loops on rebound activity could be a network phenomenon, as the impact of an isolated complex spike may not be sufficient to trigger this loop. This is in line with the reduced “echo” in the cross-correlograms of the Gjd2 KO mice and enhanced doublets following lesions of the nucleo-olivary tract as occurs in olivary hypertrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref111">111</xref>]. Taken together, rebound spiking, STOs and reverberating loops all seem to promote in a cooperative manner complex spike rhythmicity at a time scale of about 200 ms. Through modeling, we found that not only the state of the inferior olivary oscillations determines which inputs are transmitted, but that these inputs also determine the state of the network. Thus, inputs from both the cerebellum and the cerebrum determine the probability of complex spike responses on a cycle-by-cycle basis providing a quasiperiodic framework to align synchronous groups. This sharply contrasts with a view in which the inferior olive is a clock with regular periodicity. A circuit-wide understanding of cerebellar resonances on the basis of such a mechanism could open a novel pathway to explore the cerebellar gating by other brain regions.</p>
<p>The combination of delayed gap junctions and delayed inhibition, as found in the olivo-cerebellar loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref104">104</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref112">112</xref>], can affect oscillatory behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref113">113</xref>]. The interplay between STOs and delayed inhibition is therefore also relevant for other neural circuitries, for instance for creating filter settings for the perception of sounds with specific oscillatory properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref114">114</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref116">116</xref>] or orchestrating rhythmic movements as shown in the present study (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref117">117</xref>]).</p>

<title>A ratchet rather than a metronome</title>
<p>Well-coordinated movement sequences are not timed rigidly; they must be enacted flexibly and contextually. In order to catch a ball, or a prey, or to perform any other appropriately timed movement, it is essential to fine-tune the duration and onsets of multiple coordinated output systems. An inferior olive that responds contextually to time varying input by advancing and delaying cycles does not act as a rigid clock or metronome, but more contextually, as a ratchet-pole system, with the frequency of 'clicks' of the ratchet reflecting the recent history of applied torque. The properties we have encountered in this study are consistent with a 'ratchet-like' dynamics for the inferior olive, which integrates time-varying stimulus in a phase-dependent manner. According to this view, the inferior olive responds to all inputs (sensory and otherwise), by producing phase changes that are informative about the recent history of input, and dictate the appearance of coherent complex spike waves arriving at the cerebellar cortex.</p>

<p>Extracellular recordings of Purkinje cells were made in the cerebellar lobules crus 1 and 2 of awake mice as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref028">28</xref>]. Briefly, an 8 x 4 matrix of quartz-platinum electrodes (2–4 MΩ; Thomas Recording, Giessen, Germany) was used to make recordings that were amplified and digitized at 24 kHz using an RZ2 BioAmp processor (Tucker-Davis Technologies, Alachua, FL). The signals were analyzed offline with SpikeTrain (Neurasmus, Rotterdam, The Netherlands) using a digital band-pass filter (30–6,000 Hz). Complex spikes were recognized based on their waveform consisting of an initial spike followed by one or more spikelets. A recording was accepted as that of a single Purkinje cell when a discernible pause of at least 8 ms in simple spike firing followed the complex spikes and when the complex spikes were of similar shape and amplitude throughout the recording.</p>
<p>Sensory stimulation was applied as air puffs of 20 psi and 25 ms duration directed at the whisker pad ipsilateral to the side of recording.

<title>Complex spike pattern analysis</title>
<p>Of each Purkinje cell we computed the probability density function (PDF) of both its complex spike autocorrelogram and its distribution of intervals between consecutive complex spikes (inter-complex spike intervals (ICSIs)). PDFs were calculated with an Epanechnikov kernel (with finite support) with a width of 10 ms. In order to exclude stimulus-induced alterations in complex spike firing, complex spikes detected between 20 and 200 ms after a stimulus were omitted from this phase of the analysis. PDFs were calculated from 0 up till 500 ms. The peak in the ICSI PDF was considered as the “preferred ICSI interval” and its strength was expressed as the Z-score by dividing the peak value by the standard deviation of the PDF. To understand the impact of Purkinje cell with little or no preference for specific ICSI intervals on the analysis, we chose to look both at the Purkinje cells with high and low Z-scores. Thus, we grouped Purkinje cells into high and low level Z-scores, using a threshold of 3.</p>
<p>Air puff stimulations frequently triggered double complex spike response peaks, suggestive of an underlying inferior olivary oscillation. For further analysis of the conditional responses, an estimate of the putative inferior olivary frequency was derived from the interval between these two response peaks. First, it was established for each Purkinje cell whether two peaks were present in the PSTH. To this end, we set a threshold for each of these two peaks. For the first peak, this was calculated by reshuffling the ICSIs over the recording followed by calculating a stimulus-triggered pseudo-PSTH, repeating this procedure 10,000 times and selecting the 99% upper-bound. We considered the first response peak to be significant if it crossed the upper-bound uninterruptedly for at least 10 ms. Since the second response peak typically is much smaller than the first one, we calculated a new threshold for the second peak by excluding the time-window for the first response peak. This window was set from the time of the stimulus until where the response probability drops to the average response frequency, the response frequency as expected if stimuli do not trigger complex spikes, following the significant ‘first’ responsive peak. In 5 out of 98 Purkinje cells, the PDF of the response rate between clear peaks remained above the average response rate, in which case we used the time point where the amplitude drop in the PDF was more than twice the difference between upper bound and average response probability. The rest of the bootstrap method was identical to that for the first response peak. Only peaks up to 0.5 s after the stimulus were included in the population analysis.</p>

<title>Prediction of response probability based on inferred olivary oscillation frequency</title>
<p>In order to test whether the phase of the inferior olivary oscillations affected the complex spike response probability, we compared the complex spike intervals over an Air puff for each stimulus that triggered a complex spike. To this end, we analyzed the recordings of 25 Purkinje cells (10 WT and 15 Gjd2 KO) that were measured previously in crus 1 and crus 2 of awake, adult mice. We included only Purkinje cells that displayed clear oscillatory complex spike firing indicated by the display of a secondary complex spike response peak, as evaluated according to the bootstrap method described above, and/or significant peaks in the ICSI histogram. Only stable recordings covering at least 500 stimuli at frequencies below 1 Hz were considered for this analysis.</p>
<p>For each recording we compared two idealized statistical models of the observed ICSI distributions: an oscillatory model showing phase-dependent spiking and stable olivary oscillation frequencies and a uniform model lacking phase-dependencies. For the oscillatory model, we created complex spike probability functions for the pre-stimulus interval (-300 to 0 ms) based on the oscillatory period established either for the ICSI distribution or from the interval between the two complex spike response peaks. We fitted a sine wave with the observed frequency, having its peak at the moment of the first complex spike in the stimulus response window (20–200 ms after the air puff) and derived spike probability levels during the pre-stimulus interval from these fits, with the trough representing zero probability. Frequency and amplitude of every cycle were kept constant for the whole recording. In the uniform model, we calculated the pre-stimulus spiking probability with a uniform distribution based on the complex spike frequency of each Purkinje cell. We did include a refractory period, being the shortest ICSI observed for each recording, to reflect the inability of consecutive complex spikes to occur with a very short time interval. Refractory periods were comparable between mutants and wild types; 49 ± 15 ms for Gjd2 KO cells and 50 ± 20 ms for WT cells. Subsequently, we constructed compound fits consisting of linear summations of the two models. One extreme was the oscillatory model and the other the uniform model and we considered nine intermediate combinations (e.g., 0.3 x the oscillatory model + 0.7 x the uniform model). Every compound fit was run for 10,000 times. The goodness of fit was computed as the absolute differences of every single run of the model with the actual ICSI distribution.</p>

The connectivity parameters (distance and average connection probability) were chosen to match experimental values (radius ≤ 120 μm) and average connection probability (~8 neighbors). The procedure to obtain connectivity is as follows. First, pairwise distances between all cells are calculated. Then, a binary adjacency matrix is created by thresholding those distances within a specified radius. Thereafter, we assign a random number between 0 and 1 to each link from a uniform distribution. Finally, this matrix is made binary by comparing each entry with a probability so that the average number of connections approximates a given mean connectivity. This binary adjacency matrix is then multiplied by the mean gap junction conductance parameter. Finally, gap junction conductance values are then randomized by a uniform jittering of the conductance by 10% of their original value.</p>

<p>Only one subset of cells in the center of the network (40% of the cells in a mask spanning a radius of 3 cells from the center of the network) representing efferent arborization, receives the “sensory input”, with “sensory” currents being delivered to the soma of modelled cells (g<sub>AMPA</sub> = 0.15 mS/cm<sup>2</sup>). “Sensory input” was modeled according to O’Donnel et al.

<title>Network parameter spaces</title>
<p>To examine the dependence of network dynamics on the characteristics of the incoming input, we computed the 200 neuron network sweeping a grid of the main input parameters (<italic>τ</italic>,<italic>σ</italic>,<italic>μ</italic>,<italic>α</italic>) of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise process. The network response in terms of STO frequency, population firing rates, proportion of firing neurons was analyzed with respect to a grid of input parameters. For comparability of statistics and reproducibility of results, all results displayed in this article were obtained from a single random seed. We have tested the network with multiple seeds and the results are qualitatively indistinguishable.</p>
<p>The parameters of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process were tuned such that the network emulating the wildtype network (with gap junctions, WT) produced an average frequency of 1 Hz and more than 95% of the model cells fire at least once every 5 seconds (the parameter space for the network responses including STO, population firing rate and proportion of cells that fire within 3s is found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006475.s005">S5B Fig</xref>). The parameters to achieve these criteria are dependent on the total leak through the gap junctions. There are multiple methods to compensate the absent leak in the gapless network. In the present case, the network without gap junctions has been tuned to produce the same firing frequency as the network with gaps by increasing the membrane leak currents from 0.010 to 0.013 mS/cm<sup>2</sup>. This results in a similar excitability but slightly lower STO frequency in the “mutant”. The average firing rate behavior of the network shows a linear relationship with the standard deviation of the OU process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006475.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). For the present network with balanced connectivity and a single gap conductance of 0.04 mS/cm<sup>2</sup>, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck parameters are (<italic>τ</italic>,<italic>σ</italic>,<italic>μ</italic>,<italic>α</italic>),<italic>μ</italic> = −0.6 <italic>pA</italic>/<italic>cm</italic><sup>2</sup>,<italic>σ</italic> = 0.6 <italic>pA</italic>/<italic>cm</italic><sup>2</sup> <italic>and τ</italic> = 20 <italic>ms</italic>. <italic>τ</italic> is a decay parameter that represents the synaptic decay times expected for olivary inputs, in this case chosen to emulate dendritic GABA according to Devor and Yarom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref124">124</xref>].</p>

<title>Synchrony and frequency estimation</title>
<p>Both synchrony and instantaneous frequency were estimated on the basis of a novel phase transformation of the membrane potential, which is more robust than the standard Hilbert transform, and can produce a linear phase response to the non-linear shape of the subthreshold oscillations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref125">125</xref>]. This transformation improves the estimation of the momentary phase and compensates for the fact that ionic mechanisms induce different rates of membrane potential change at different phases of the oscillation. This phases analysis was conducted with the DAMOCO toolbox [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006475.ref126">126</xref>]. From the instantaneous phase, the instantaneous frequency is simply the inverse of the first order finite difference of phase. Synchrony across cells is estimated with the Kuramoto order parameter (<italic>K</italic>):

<p>To estimate a phase response curve of the stimulated neurons, first a “sensory stimulus” is delivered at a phase known to produce an action potential (and resetting).

<p><bold>(A)</bold> Mice received air puff stimulation of their whisker pad. <bold>(B)</bold> Purkinje cell recordings during sensory stimulation revealed that most trials had either no, one or two complex spikes during the 200 ms after stimulus onset.

Trials in which a complex spike was detected only during the first 100 ms after the stimulus (blue line) had on average a slightly larger protraction than the trials without a complex spike (black line). The trials with two complex spikes also had a stronger protraction than the trials without a complex spike, but showed in addition a more protracted position later on during the trial (red arrow and red line). <bold>(D)</bold> Averaged subtracted traces showing the differences between trials with, respectively, a single complex spike (blue line) and two complex spikes (red line) and the trials without a complex spike.

<title>Behavior of cells on the edges of the model.</title>
<p>The inferior olivary model has, as the inferior olive itself, boundaries. The impact of boundaries in connectivity of cells in the <italic>in vivo</italic> data (and by extension on the current leak through gap junctions) is, however, not known. The algorithm that generates connectivity enforces mean connectivity across cells, which increases the degree of clustering along the edges, but has at most a mild impact on the current leak through gap junctions. It is likely that the extra clustering degree along the edges may lead to a mild increase of coherence in STOs between neighbors, though this should not affect the overall conclusion–that the phase-dependency of the STO under the presence of noise is at most short-lived. The data are represented as stacked bar plots. All data were tested using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.</p>

<title>Behavior of model networks of identical composition as a function of the decay parameter of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (τ) and the noise correlation (η).</title>
<p>Model networks have been computed using a systematic exploration of the parameter space using 56 instances of the network model. The contour plots indicate isolines for synchrony <bold>(A)</bold>, frequency of subthreshold oscillations (STOs), population firing rate and proportion of active cells <bold>(B)</bold>. The results presented in the main text come from a model network with parameters chosen such as to display STOs with mean of 9 Hz, a population rate of about 1 Hz and with more than 70% of cells firing in three seconds (95% of cells fire within 10 s of simulation time). The position of this network in the contour plots is indicated with a red circle. In <bold>A</bold>, the thumbnails exemplify behaviors of extreme instances of the model network both as membrane potentials traces (top) and as heatmaps of the membrane potential (bottom). Arrows indicate parameter space coordinates of these examples.

<title>Rebound firing occurs only in a small region of parameter space.</title>
<p>The post-spiking behavior of model neurons after a depolarization was examined for a grid of parameters, within known experimental values. A depolarizing current pulse triggers spikes at 100 ms. The rebound behavior is dependent on a complex interplay between a number of parameters, but most importantly, it exists in a rather narrow range of the parameter space between T- and P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. For very low levels of Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 (T-type) expression, the model cell settles on an unphysiologically saturated depolarization after spiking. The cells in our model have Ca<sub>v</sub>2.1 (P/Q-type) expression around 4.5 and Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 between 0.6 and 1.1.</p>

<p><bold>(A)</bold> In order to test the impact of the presumed phase of the inferior olivary neurons <italic>in vivo</italic>, we applied a “gallop” stimulation pattern, alternating short (250 ms) and long (400 ms) intervals. Air puffs (vertical bars) were delivered to the whisker pad. Complex spikes were counted in response windows (RW) 20–200 ms post-stimulus and cells were sorted as a function of the ratio between the numbers of complex spikes in short and long intervals (indicated as horizontal dash between filled and empty bars). In this analysis, we included all RWs, irrespective of whether the preceding RW contained a complex spike or not (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006475.g010">Fig 10</xref>). For each Purkinje cell the relative response probabilities for the long and short intervals are illustrated as the length of the filled and open bars, respectively.
