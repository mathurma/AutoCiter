<abstract>
<p>Correlations in local neocortical spiking activity can provide insight into the underlying organization of cortical microcircuitry. However, identifying structure in patterned multi-neuronal spiking remains a daunting task due to the high dimensionality of the activity. Using two-photon imaging, we monitored spontaneous circuit dynamics in large, densely sampled neuronal populations within slices of mouse primary auditory, somatosensory, and visual cortex. Using the lagged correlation of spiking activity between neurons, we generated functional wiring diagrams to gain insight into the underlying neocortical circuitry. By establishing the presence of graph invariants, which are label-independent characteristics common to all circuit topologies, our study revealed organizational features that generalized across functionally distinct cortical regions. Regardless of sensory area, random and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-nearest neighbors null graphs failed to capture the structure of experimentally derived functional circuitry. These null models indicated that despite a bias in the data towards spatially proximal functional connections, functional circuit structure is best described by non-random and occasionally distal connections. Eigenvector centrality, which quantifies the importance of a neuron in the temporal flow of circuit activity, was highly related to feedforwardness in all functional circuits. The number of nodes participating in a functional circuit did not scale with the number of neurons imaged regardless of sensory area, indicating that circuit size is not tied to the sampling of neocortex. Local circuit flow comprehensively covered angular space regardless of the spatial scale that we tested, demonstrating that circuitry itself does not bias activity flow toward pia. Finally, analysis revealed that a minimal numerical sample size of neurons was necessary to capture at least 90 percent of functional circuit topology. These data and analyses indicated that functional circuitry exhibited rules of organization which generalized across three areas of sensory neocortex.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Information in the brain is represented and processed by populations of interconnected neurons. However, there is a lack of a clear understanding of the structure and organization of circuit wiring, particularly at the mesoscale which spans multiple columns and layers. In this study, we sought to evaluate whether functional circuit architecture generalizes across the neocortex, testing the existence of a functional analogue to the neocortical microcircuit hypothesis. We analyzed the correlational structure of spontaneous circuit activations in primary auditory, somatosensory, and visual neocortex to generate functional topologies. In these graphs, neurons were represented as nodes, and time-lagged firing between neurons were directed edges. Edge weights reflected how many times the lagged firing occurred and was synonymous to the strength of the functional connection between two neurons. The presence of label-independent features, identified by investigating functional circuit topologies under a graph invariant framework, suggest that functionally distinct areas of the neocortex carry features of a generalized functional cortical circuit. Furthermore, our analyses show that the simultaneous recording of large sections of cortical circuitry is necessary to recognize these features and avoid undersampling errors.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Transmission and processing of information in the brain is in large part determined by the connectivity between neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Harris1">[1]</xref>. The neocortical microcircuit hypothesis states that the neocortex is composed of repeated elements of a generalized circuit that are tweaked for specialization in each area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-DouglasRodney1">[2]</xref>. Supporting this hypothesis, local synaptic connectivity in the neocortex is non-random and is at least partly determined by neuron location and class <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-DouglasRodney1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Ktzel1">[12]</xref>. These rules imply that there is a probabilistic or partially stereotyped wiring diagram. The extent to which these rules generalize across the neocortex, however, is unclear. Analysis of neocortical microcircuit spiking activity in different brain regions has revealed common dynamical features <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Ktzel1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Sadovsky1">[15]</xref>, suggesting that circuits may share similarities between regions. In this study, we use the spatiotemporal correlations of firing activity between neurons to generate functional wiring diagrams <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Sadovsky1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Shababo1">[19]</xref>. Modeling studies have shown a clear relationship between connectivity and neural firing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Sadovsky1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Gerstein2">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-LitwinKumar1">[24]</xref>. This suggests that we can gain insight into the underlying structure and organization of cortical circuitry by analyzing the emergent dynamics of large populations of neocortical neurons.</p>
<p>Here we employed high speed two-photon calcium imaging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Sadovsky2">[25]</xref> to densely sample the spiking activity of up to 1126 neurons within a 1.1 mm diameter field of view, spanning multiple columns and layers in three different areas of the sensory neocortex. We then applied post-processing algorithms to detect spatiotemporal relationships between spiking neurons and modeled this activity as wiring diagrams, or graphs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Sadovsky1">[15]</xref>. Graph theory is a useful technique to quantify network dynamics, and has been increasingly applied in the neural context to understand brain connectivity patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Honey1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Sporns1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Sporns2">[27]</xref>. One potential approach to identify invariant features of functional wiring diagrams within and between areas of cortex is to isolate graph isomorphisms. For example, the unlabeled graphs <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are isomorphic when any two nodes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are connected in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> if and only if that connection exists in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. However, such an analysis currently remains intractable in graphs of sizes analyzed here, as the best known algorithm runs in polynomial time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Babai1">[28]</xref>. Perhaps more importantly, the organizational features of connectivity that have been described to date reflect probabilistic, rather than deterministic microcircuit architectures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Song1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Perin1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Hill1">[9]</xref>, making it unlikely that connectivity patterns in the brain are formally isomorphic. In order to test the postulate that the organization of functional circuitry generalizes across the neocortex, we instead applied functions that are invariant to labeling of the nodes of the graph. In other words, if A is the adjacency matrix describing graph <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we wanted to describe the function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> such that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>×<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> permutation matrix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Chandrasekaran1">[29]</xref>. In the context of our study, we aimed to identify features of a neuronal circuit wiring diagram that are invariant to the particular identities of the neurons. Thus, we characterized each neuron only by the connections it had with other neurons. While neurons and activation patterns between animals and regions may vary in their individual details, these abstract, global characteristics of circuit structure stay constant, even following the relabeling of the neurons. By investigating label-independent features, called <italic>graph invariants</italic>, we hoped to disregard features of the functional circuit that may be susceptible to over-fitting, and focus on features that are stable across slices and areas of the neocortex. Many graph invariants have been previously described, such as maximum degree and MAXCUT value <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Chandrasekaran1">[29]</xref>. Some particularly useful invariants include the graph eigenvalues and eigenvectors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Chandrasekaran1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Chung1">[30]</xref>. We apply these analyses to functional wiring diagrams generated from imaging data from three sensory neocortical areas to test the validity of a functional analogue to a generalized circuit architecture of the neocortex.</p>

<p>C57BL/6 mice of either sex on postnatal day 14–18 were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine-xylazine, rapidly decapitated, and had their brains removed and placed in oxygenated ice-cold cut artificial CSF (ACSF; contents contained the following, in mM: 3 KCl, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 3.5 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 25 dextrose, and 123 sucrose). Coronal slices (500 µm thick) containing the sensory region of interest were cut perpendicular to the pial surface using a vibratome (VT1000S; Leica). To control for potential slice angle effects, slices at slight angles off the coronal axis were generated (500 µm A1/V1, 450 µm S1BF). Our data showed no significant effects that correlated with angle, and thus these datasets were pooled with their coronal counterparts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Sadovsky1">[15]</xref>. Slices were placed in a 35°C oxygenated incubation fluid (Incu-ACSF; contents contained the following, in mM: 123 NaCl, 3 KCl, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 6 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and 25 dextrose) for 30 to 45 min. Calcium dye loading was then achieved by placing all slices into a small Petri dish containing ∼2 ml of Incu-ACSF, an aliquot of 50 µg Fura-2AM (Invitrogen) in 13 µl DMSO and 2 µl of Pluronic F-127 (Invitrogen) as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Sadovsky2">[25]</xref>.</p>

<p>To determine whether A1, S1, and V1 functional circuit wiring diagrams exhibited invariant features, we monitored neuronal activity in 43 slices from each region of the mouse neocortex (11 of A1, 21 of S1, and 11 of V1) using high speed multi-photon calcium imaging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Sadovsky1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Sadovsky2">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Vogelstein1">[31]</xref>.

Previous reports have found that spontaneous activity delineates all of the possible multi-neuronal patterns within a sampled population and that a sensory input activates only a subset of these patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Luczak1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Luczak2">[36]</xref>. By monitoring spontaneous activity in the imaged field of view, we hoped to maximize the number of pairwise correlations within the imaged populations. We imaged the flow of activity through large populations of neurons (A1: 595±101 cells, S1: 704±157 cells, V1: 734±129 cells) at the mesoscale in a two-dimensional circular imaging plane with a diameter of 1.1 mm that comprised multiple layers and columns with single-cell resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003710-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We confirmed activity was not biased to any one lamina and that our sampling was uniform across our field of view, since the amount of activity observed across all circuit events did not differ between layers (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, KW-test; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2"><italic>Methods</italic></xref> for explanation of laminar identification). Because temporal resolution of multi-photon microscopy is compromised at these spatial scales, we used the heuristically optimized path scan technique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Sadovsky2">[25]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003710-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), which allowed us to achieve fast frame rates (frame duration 86±17.7 ms) that did not differ between regions (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, KW-test). We deconvolved calcium fluorescence changes of each detected neuron into spike trains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003710-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Vogelstein1">[31]</xref> and generated rasters of spiking activity for the entire imaged population of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003710-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). All regions of the sensory neocortex showed a common capacity for emergent, multi-neuronal patterned activity, characterized by discrete periods (&gt;500 ms) of correlated action potential generation within subsets of neurons. Circuit events were separated by periods of quiescence and we refer to these distinct, clustered epochs of spontaneous action potentials as individual circuit events. The start and finish of a circuit event was easily resolvable because the field of view was either quiescent, corresponding to a DOWN state in a single neuron, or was active, corresponding to a UP state in a single neuron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-MacLean1">[35]</xref>. One circuit event lasted 1203±456 ms in A1,1568±885 ms in S1, and 1342±698 ms in V1. We imaged 82 total circuit events in A1, 268 total events in S1, and 104 total events in V1.</p>

<p>Using this data, we generated graphical abstractions, or circuit topologies, corresponding to functional activity over all circuit events observed in a single field of view. Neurons were represented as nodes in each graph. Edges between nodes were directional and formed according to the following rule: neuron A was considered functionally connected to neuron B if neuron B fired in the subsequent frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003710-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). These edges were then weighted according to how many times this single frame lagged correlation occurred, normalized to the number of events in that field of view. Thus, stronger edge weights indicated reliable, correlated spiking, whereas weaker edge weights indicated unreliable, weakly correlated spiking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003710-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). The resultant graphs contained a large number of edges (median: 3.4×10<sup>4</sup> functional connections, range: 4.2×10<sup>5</sup> functional connections). Note that although a functional relationship between neurons increases the probability of them having a synaptic connection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Ko1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Cossart1">[33]</xref>, a linear relationship between each functional edge and a synaptic connection does not exist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Gerstein1">[16]</xref>. Rather, given our method of inference, the functional connectivity measure captured the flow of activity through the network during a circuit event.</p>

To gain insight into the spatial dependency of functional circuit wiring, we compared functional topologies generated from the data with null models of varying spatial constraint. To this end, we generated a matched random and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-nearest neighbors null graph for each functional topology. The random and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-nearest neighbors topologies represented upper and lower bounds of spatial constraint, respectively. In each random topology, nodes were placed in the same locations as a corresponding functional topology, but each node had a fixed probability of functional connection (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) with any other node. We found that random topologies were spatially relaxed because their connections were not constrained to subsets or neighborhoods of nodes. Importantly, the spatial distribution of functional connections in random topologies was statistically indistinguishable from the long-tailed probability distribution of pairwise distances in the field of view (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; KS-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003710-g002">Figure 2</xref>, left column). Thus, the random topologies still contained a distance dependence in its likelihood of a connection. The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-nearest neighbors topology was a null model consistent with previous anatomical studies that described synaptic connectivity in a nearest-neighbors paradigm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Song1">[5]</xref>.

Thus, functional topology is non-random, and connections that extend beyond local neighborhoods form a substantial portion of connections at the mesoscale.</p>
<p>To further characterize the distributed nature of functional topology, we next analyzed functional connections traveling between and within the lamina visible in our field of view (L1, L2/3, L4, and L5; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2"><italic>Methods</italic></xref> for explanation of laminar identification). Due to relaxed spatial constraints and non-specific connectivity, Random topologies contained significantly more functional connections traveling between layers than within layers (between: 52±11 percent, within: 33±11 percent, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). The difference in the number of functional connections traveling between and within lamina in random topologies was significant across areas (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>).

Furthermore, the difference in the number of functional connections traveling between and within layers was insignificant across areas (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e062" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e063" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>).These analyses suggest that neocortical functional topologies consist of non-random, occasionally distal connections that, despite being skewed in probability toward local neighborhoods, are not solely governed by spatial proximity and are distributed across the field of view.</p>

<title>Neuronal influence in local functional circuitry is log-normally distributed</title>
<p>Neuronal networks have been found to contain neurons which are connected to large numbers of other cells, called hubs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Sadovsky1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Honey1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Yu1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Bonifazi1">[38]</xref>. Traditional approaches characterized a hub as having a large degree that is multiple standard deviations from a network's norm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Picardo1">[39]</xref>. However, this metric of degree centrality fails to fully capture the influence of a node in a network. To identify network hubs that focused on functional information flow, we utilized the eigenvector centrality measure of node influence.

The difference between eigenvector centrality and degree measures is revealed in the following example. Let one neuron project an edge to another neuron, which in turn projects to ten neurons. The first neuron in this chain would be assigned a degree of 1, and thus would be considered an insignificant actor in the circuit under degree centrality. However, under eigenvector centrality, each neuron's score is a linear combination of all other neurons' scores. Eigenvector centrality would assign the first neuron a high score as it is considered to be the most influential driver of local activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003710-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Projections of both measures onto an imaged field of view qualitatively revealed differences in the contour distributions of assigned scores by degree and eigenvector centrality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003710-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). We calculated the distribution of eigenvector centrality and degree scores, and found that the former fit to a log-normal distribution in all three areas of the sensory neocortex (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = −3.88±0.07, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 1.01±0.05, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 0.13; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = −4.01±0.07, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 1.05±0.05, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 0.08; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = −4.08±0.08, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 1.21±0.06, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 0.13; KS-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003710-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), and that the latter fit to a normal distribution in all three areas of the sensory neocortex (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 0.05±0.002, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 0.03±0.001, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 0.04±0.002, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e089" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 0.03±0.002, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e090" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e091" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 0.05±0.002, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e092" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 0.03±0.002, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; KS-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003710-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).

<p><bold>Theorem:</bold> Let the undirected graph <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e101" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> be specified by an adjacency matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e102" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and have a degree matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e103" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <bold>1</bold> is the column vector of all 1 s. Let the Laplacian <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e104" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> have eigenvalues <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e105" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is connected if and only if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e107" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e108" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denotes the algebraic connectivity of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e109" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. (For proof, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Chung1">[30]</xref>)</p>
<p>The larger the algebraic connectivity is, the more strongly connected the graph is. An algebraic connectivity close to zero indicates a graph that is highly modular and susceptible to attack, which makes connectedness a prime topological metric for defining robust networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Jamakovic1">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Dekker1">[45]</xref>. We assessed the connectedness of the functional topology by first transforming all directed edges to undirected ones, as this is required for the theorem to be applicable. We therefore lost information on circuit flow provided by directed edges, but preserved information on the abstract structural features of the topology, like the general reachability a neuron in the circuit. We then computed the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian of the resulting adjacency matrix, normalized by the number of nodes in the graph. We found that functional topologies in each sensory area were connected (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e110" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 0.385±0.17; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003710-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) and that the amount of connectivity did not differ between regions (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e111" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; KW-test). These values significantly differed from the moderately connected random topologies (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e112" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 0.24±0.006; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; KW-test) and the weakly connected <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-nearest neighbors topologies (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 0.02±0.004; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; KW-test). This analysis suggests that an arbitrary path from any neuron to every other neuron is present in functional circuit topologies. Interestingly, the variance of the algebraic connectivities of the models was much smaller than those of the data. The greater variance of algebraic connectivity present in the data might emerge from specific patterns of functional connectivity that are absent in the non-specific random and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-nearest neighbors topologies.</p>

<p>Sequences of neuronal activations in the neocortex likely represents a neural syntax that encodes external stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Buzski1">[46]</xref>. Since each directed edge in a functional topology represents a sequential activation of two neurons, each activation sequence can be defined as a walk, or a sequence of visitations to adjacent nodes, in the functional topology. Because spontaneous activations delineate all possible multi-neuronal patterns within a sampled population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Luczak1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Luczak2">[36]</xref>, we quantified the number of possible activation sequences of a given length in functional topologies generated from spontaneous activity. To compute this metric, we employed the following theorem:</p>
<p><bold>Theorem:</bold> Let the graph <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> be specified by an adjacency matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e123" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. For any <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> entry of the matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is equal to the number of walks from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e129" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of path length <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e130" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>This theorem can be proved through induction; we use the facts that each edge in the graph is unique, and that to form a walk of length <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e131" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from vertex <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e132" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, one must first have a walk of length <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e134" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from vertex <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e135" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e136" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and then a walk of length 1 from vertex <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e137" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e138" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Note that the number of open sequences, walks that do not have equal starting and ending nodes, is the sum of the upper and lower triangular matrices of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e139" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003710-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). In addition, the number of closed sequences, walks that have equal starting and ending nodes, is the trace of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e140" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003710-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Open sequences may relate to feedforward activity, while closed sequences may relate to recurrent activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Sadovsky1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Sadovsky3">[42]</xref>. In all analyses, we computed the number of open sequences of path lengths 1 to 10 and the number of closed sequences of path lengths 2 to 10, since a closed sequence of length 1 does not exist. We found that the number of possible open sequences and closed sequences, as a function of path length, were perfectly fit by exponential functions across all functional circuits (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e141" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 1.00±0.00). This exponential growth reflected the combinatorial explosion of possible sequences of larger lengths, as the graphs analyzed contained a large number of nodes and edges.</p>
<p>Next, we computed the ratio of the number of open sequences to the number of closed sequences in each graph, excluding sequences of length 1. We refer to this ratio as the <italic>O-C ratio</italic>. We found that across all path lengths analyzed, there were 217±47 open sequences for every closed sequence in A1, 293±151 open sequences for every closed sequence in S1, and 339±67 open sequences for every closed sequence in V1. The higher O-C ratio in V1 likely supports the postulate that the region has a greater propensity towards feedforwardness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Yu1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Sadovsky3">[42]</xref>.</p>
<p>The O-C ratio did not differ between path lengths (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e142" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e143" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e144" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; KW-test), suggesting that while the <italic>raw number</italic> of open and closed sequences grows exponentially as a function of path length, the <italic>ratio</italic> of open to closed sequences stays constant. In contrast, the O-C ratio in random topologies increased 2-fold from length 2 to length 3 (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e145" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e146" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e147" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; KW-test), and stayed constant for larger path lengths (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e148" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e149" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e150" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; KW-test). Further analysis showed that random topologies had a far greater percent of possible reciprocal connections (closed sequences of length 2) than functional topologies generated from the data (random: 24.9±0.04 percent; data: 8.4±8.2 percent).The greater prevalence of reciprocal connections in random topologies likely results in the smaller O-C ratio at length 2.</p>
<p>Because the number of open and closed sequences as a function of path length grew exponentially, we could linearize the curves by transforming them into log-scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003710-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Linearization allowed us to use slope as a feature of how the number of sequences varied with path length. We found that the distribution of slopes did not differ between open and closed sequence growth curves for all functional topologies generated from the data (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e151" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; KW-test). This finding confirmed the invariance of the O-C ratio to path length in the data.</p>
<p>We found that the slope of a sequence growth curve was strongly correlated with the number of functional connections in the corresponding topology (Open and closed sequences: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e152" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e153" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e154" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e155" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e156" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e157" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; Pearson correlation). This finding prompted us to characterize how the number of sequences in a functional topology varied with the number of neurons in the field of view. We hypothesized that random topologies were greedy: the more nodes in the field of view, the more activation sequences would be possible, because every node in the random topology has a 0.5 probability of being connected to any other node. Thus, the size of the random topology would scale with the number of nodes in the field of view. Supporting this hypothesis, we found that the slope of sequence growth curves for random graphs were strongly correlated with the number of nodes in the corresponding random graph in all regions (Open and closed sequences: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e158" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e159" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e160" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e161" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e162" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e163" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; Pearsons linear correlation). In contrast, we found that the slopes of sequence growth curves in the data were uncorrelated with the number of neurons in the corresponding functional topologies in all regions (Open and closed sequences: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e164" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e165" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e166" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e167" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e168" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e169" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; Pearson correlation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003710-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). This finding suggests that the size of functional connectivity does not scale with the number of neurons in the field of view, and that only a subset of neurons in the field of view are recruited during any one circuit event. These analyses further support the postulate of specificity in functional connectivity, and suggest that the lack of strong positive correlation between the slope of the sequence growth curve and number of neurons in the field of view is inherent to the functional connectivity patterns of these regions.</p>

<p>We measured the amount of angular clustering of activity flow in sensory areas by computing the circular variance of functional connections.

<title>Large fields of view are necessary to investigate functional topologies</title>
<p>The highly distributed nature of functional topologies suggested that large fields of view are necessary to fully capture invariant features of functional topology. We sought to confirm this hypothesis by examining the spatial dependency of connectedness in functional topologies. Connectedness in the context of an imaged field of view can be described as an aperture problem: large interlinked networks look like disjoint groups of interacting cells if viewed only in small parts, while viewing the entire network at once reveals one giant component. For efficient computation in our graph invariant framework, we examined this problem in the following way: disjoint modules of network activity could be characterized as a weakly connected functional topology with a small algebraic connectivity. We explored how algebraic connectivity of the functional topology was modulated by two variables: minimum weight and field of view size. Because edge weight corresponds to the reliability of an observation of a spike correlation, thresholding minimum weight in a functional topology pruned its weaker edges. We defined field of view size as the maximum pairwise distance between any two neurons investigated. Together, these variables represented spatial and sampling bias during experiments. We found that the algebraic connectivity of functional topologies followed similar trajectories in all three sensory areas: smaller fields of view and the exclusion of the weakest functional connections resulted in weakly connected graphs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003710-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that one must employ large fields of view and low edge weight thresholds to capture an independent functional circuit.</p>

<p>Interestingly, we found a field of view size in each sensory area at which the algebraic connectivity seemed to reach capacity or asymptote; above this distance, larger fields of view did not result in significantly increased connectivity. This finding suggested that a subsample size less than 1.1 square mm would capture a complete functional circuit topology. To further understand the interplay between experimental field of view and the topology of the functional circuits, we specified a general model of <italic>Field of View (FOV) Error</italic>, or how well a functional topology is captured as a function of field of view size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003710-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>
<p>FOV error varies with the distribution of functional connections inherent to each neocortical region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003710-g002">Figure 2</xref>, right column). Formally, let <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e179" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denote the existence of a functional connection between neurons <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e180" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e181" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e182" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denote the pairwise distance between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e183" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e184" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Let <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e185" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> be a pairwise distance. Then,<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003710.e186"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e186" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>We computed the average FOV error over all pairwise combinations of neurons in all sensory areas as a function of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e187" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. To achieve less than 10 percent FOV error, we found that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e188" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> must be at least 676 microns in A1, 660 microns in S1, and 583 microns in V1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003710-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). This corresponds to a minimum of 430 neurons in A1, 510 neurons in S1, and 478 neurons in V1 by computing a cumulative distribution of neuronal density based on the probability distributions of pairwise distances in our fields of view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003710-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). In contrast, we found less than 10 percent FOV error was achieved with just 93 microns in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e189" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-nearest neighbors topologies, and 884 microns (almost the entire imaging field of view) in topologies with a uniform random spatial distribution of functional connectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003710-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). In the random graphs, error dropped linearly as field of view size was increased (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e190" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 0.9995). Thus, it appears that large FOVs result in fewer errors about underlying functional topology, and that the field of view error is lessened by skew in the likelihood of a connection toward shorter distances.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>All regions of the sensory neocortex showed a common capacity for spontaneous circuit activations that emerged from the underlying local synaptic connectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Sadovsky1">[15]</xref>. Using the statistical dependencies of spiking between pairs of neurons, we generated directed and weighted functional graphs. This approach revealed a scaling relationship between A1 and S1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Sadovsky1">[15]</xref>, but was unable to delineate exactly what graph features were common to both regions. In this study, we conducted an analysis of graph invariance in functional circuit topologies generated from three regions of sensory neocortex in order to extend the graph theoretic approach toward delineating generalized rules of connectivity. The graph invariant framework allowed us to examine how circuits are similar, by considering how graph properties independent of neuronal labeling are consistent between areas. This represents a top-down approach which extracted global features of functional connectivity from large, dense sampling of neuronal activity in the neocortex. This analysis revealed multiple graph invariants that are consistent across sensory areas. The structure of neocortical functional topologies were well-characterized by non-random connectivity that was not merely dependent on spatial proximity, despite the fact that the probability of functional connection peaked proximally. In all areas, distal connections were required to achieve connected graphs, reminiscent of the daisy arrangement of dense local and patchy distal neocortical connections suggested by neuronal anatomy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-DouglasRodney1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Binzegger2">[48]</xref>. We found that functional topologies of all areas were connected, and the degree of connectivity was statistically indistinguishable between areas. Moreover, functional connections were structured even within a local circuit of the functional topology. We found that eigenvector centrality, a measure of influence in local flow, is log-normally distributed in all sensory areas, and is highly correlated with out-degree, and weakly correlated with in-degree. The size of functional topology does not scale with the number of neurons in the field of view, revealing that circuit activity is comprised of structured activations of subsets of neurons. Local circuit flow comprehensively covers angular space regardless of spatial scale, which is inconsistent with a canonical flow of spontaneous activity. Finally, our analysis revealed that given a large imaged field of view, a minimal numerical sample size was necessary to minimize the error of falsely characterizing two neurons as being independent. In summary, the invariant features revealed by this study suggest the existence of a generalized functional circuit throughout the sensory neocortex, strengthening the argument that the neocortical microcircuit hypothesis should be framed as probabilistic rules of connectivity and organization.</p>
<p>This is not to say that label-dependent features do not play a role in mediating the structure of functional topology. For example, although connectivity is strongly biased towards spatial proximity between neurons, the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710.e191" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-nearest neighbors rule and random topologies poorly recapitulated functional topologies in the data. This indicates that other connectivity rules that are not simply dependent on spatial proximity, such as those based on cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Binzegger1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Watts1">[49]</xref>, likely play an important role. As another example, we found that the distribution of eigenvector centrality, which strongly correlates with out-degree in all areas, is highest in V1, and that the ratio of the number of open sequences to closed sequences, which stays constant as a function of path length in all areas, is highest in V1. These analyses suggest that V1 may be more feedforward than A1 and S1, a result consistent with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Yu1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Sadovsky3">[42]</xref>. The translation of the eigenvector centrality distribution seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003710-g004">Figure 4A</xref> may represent a tweaking of a generalized rule (fitting to a log-normal distribution) to optimize the circuit for a particular function (feedforwardness). In general, it is possible that the specialization of the circuit to the overall function of the cortical area is label-dependent, or dependent on emergent properties of cell phenotypes. However, despite the fact that label dependent rules of connectivity are likely present, by investigating global features of functional circuit topology that are invariant to the details of individual neurons, we are able to reveal abstract structural rules present in functional wiring in a computationally efficient manner.</p>
<p>We emphasize that our functional approach does not necessarily identify causal connectivity, but rather pairwise correlative dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Gerstein3">[50]</xref>. However, we also note that there is a relationship between structure and function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Ko1">[18]</xref>. This relationship is likely enhanced in this study as the high sampling density employed here should dramatically increase the likelihood that a correlation could reflect a causal connection, since the likelihood of a synaptic connection increases with spatial proximity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Perin1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>We consider the slice preparation to be an isolated system that allows us to study the local connectivity that defines cortical microcircuitry and remove the potentially conflating influence of long modulatory and long afferent inputs. This approach allowed us to maximize the imaged field of view and the corresponding numerical sample of neurons. In addition, coronal slices allowed us to examine the potential influence of laminar boundaries on functional circuitry. We found that a field of view of approximately 640 µm is necessary to correctly establish functional dependence between two neurons in the sensory neocortex. This field of view results from having a minimal numerical sampling while having sufficient distal functional connections that are necessary to generate a connected graph. The necessity of distal functional connections that extend beyond layers and columns may indicate that functional circuits represent information from multiple octaves in A1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Stiebler1">[51]</xref> whiskers in S1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Hirata1">[52]</xref>, or a natural visual scene in V1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Kampa1">[53]</xref>. Our data are consistent with anatomical studies that have revealed a patchy, distributed axonal structure which has been postulated to limit signal redundancy while enabling the potential for integration of information within local populations of neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Binzegger2">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Binzegger3">[54]</xref>. For these hypotheses to be properly evaluated, future work toward understanding the role of connectivity in cortical dynamics and behavior will require a combination of research at the <italic>in-vitro</italic> and <italic>in-vivo</italic> level.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we found that the connectedness of the topology depended not only on the size of the field of view, but also on whether the most unreliable connections were considered. In a previous study employing a network model, we similarly found that weak connections were necessary to recapitulate experimentally observed circuit dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Sadovsky1">[15]</xref>. In this study, functional topologies became sparse and modular as minimum thresholds on weight were increased, likely because fewer functional connections were reliable. When only the most reliable functional connections were considered, the topologies were sparsely connected regardless of sensory area. By investigating invariant metrics without setting thresholds on how reliably active the neurons were, we did not bias ourselves to only investigating the most reliable connections. Such a bias may lead to subsampling errors, exactly parallel to the problems that arise from using small fields of view. Since circuit topologies become highly connected with the inclusion of weak functional connections, weak connections may be necessary to provide a large dynamic range similar to a previous study of mouse V1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Yu1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003710-Sadovsky3">[42]</xref>. These data and analyses suggest that the generalized features of functional circuitry identified in this study maximize the capacity of this system to represent the sensory environment.</p>
