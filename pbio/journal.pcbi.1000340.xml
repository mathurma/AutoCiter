                <p>When modeling cell signaling networks, a balance must be struck between
                    mechanistic detail and ease of interpretation. In this paper we apply a fuzzy
                    logic framework to the analysis of a large, systematic dataset describing the
                    dynamics of cell signaling downstream of TNF, EGF, and insulin receptors in
                    human colon carcinoma cells. Simulations based on fuzzy logic recapitulate most
                    features of the data and generate several predictions involving pathway
                    crosstalk and regulation. We uncover a relationship between MK2 and ERK pathways
                    that might account for the previously identified pro-survival influence of MK2.
                    We also find unexpected inhibition of IKK following EGF treatment, possibly due
                    to down-regulation of autocrine signaling. More generally, fuzzy logic models
                    are flexible, able to incorporate qualitative and noisy data, and powerful
                    enough to produce quantitative predictions and new biological insights about the
                    operation of signaling networks.</p>

                <p>Cells use networks of interacting proteins to interpret intra-cellular state and
                    extra-cellular cues and to execute cell-fate decisions. Even when individual
                    proteins are well understood at a molecular level, the dynamics and behavior of
                    networks as a whole are harder to understand. However, deciphering the operation
                    of such networks is key to understanding disease processes and therapeutic
                    opportunities. As a means to study signaling networks, we have modified and
                    applied a fuzzy logic approach originally developed for industrial control. We
                    use fuzzy logic to model the responses of colon cancer cells in culture to
                    combinations of pro-survival and pro-death cytokines, making it possible to
                    interpret quantitative data in the context of abstract information drawn from
                    the literature. Our work establishes that fuzzy logic can be used to understand
                    complex signaling pathways with respect to multi-factorial activity-based
                    protein data and prior knowledge.</p>

            <p>A variety of modeling methods can be applied to understanding protein signaling
                networks and the links between signals and phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Janes1">[1]</xref>. The choice of modeling
                method depends on the question being posed (e.g., mechanistic or phenotypic), the
                quality and type of experimental data (quantitative or qualitative), and the state
                of prior knowledge about the network (interaction map or detailed biochemical
                pathway; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Abstract
                techniques are largely data-driven and aim to discover correlations among signals or
                between signals and cellular phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Janes2">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Friedman1">[4]</xref>; these
                methods include principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares
                regression (PLSR). Mechanistic differential equation-based models, in contrast, are
                highly specified and dependent on extensive prior knowledge about components and
                their interactions, but have the advantage that they capture temporal and spatial
                dynamics at the level of individual reactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Aldridge1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Wiley1">[9]</xref>. Between
                these extremes, modeling methods such as Bayesian statistics, hidden Markov models,
                and logic-based models have been used to construct graph-based representations of
                influences and dependencies among signals and phenotypes based on experimental data
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Alon1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Bulashevska1">[18]</xref>. An advantage of
                these methods is their applicability to situations in which mechanistic information
                is incomplete or fragmentary but the notion of a network of interacting biochemical
                species is nonetheless informative. Moreover, logic-based models use natural
                language to encode common logical statements such as “if the kinase is not
                active or the phosphatase is overexpressed, the substrate is not
                phosphorylated”. Logic-based models are commonly depicted as edge-node
                graphs in which interactions among species occur at nodes, with gates specifying the
                logic of the interactions based on a set of specified rules. The identities of the
                gates are typically determined based on prior knowledge or experimental observables
                and the input-output relationships of each gate inferred from experimental data

                    <p>Modeling techniques balance specificity and complexity. Principal component
                        analysis elucidates correlations among network components (A–E) by
                        a linear transformation of the data, resulting in orthogonal principal
                        components. Bayesian networks use conditional probabilities to associate
                        correlations and influences between network components. Fuzzy logic uses
                        rule-based gates and probabilistic representation of input variables to
                        quantify influences and mechanism that regulate network species.
                        Differential-equations models using mass-action kinetics are highly
                        specified defining regulatory mechanism by defining rates of change in
                        network species concentrations.</p>

            <p>Among logic-based methods, the simplicity of Boolean models makes them attractive as
                a means to render biological networks. For example, a discrete-state representation
                of the level of phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) at serine
                636 (IRS(S)) might use three input edges for time, TNF and EGF (see below), one
                output edge for IRS(S), and one logic gate (where “1” means
                present or active, and “0” absent or inactive; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Time is included as an
                input variable to enable the representation of transient responses, following
                cytokine treatment, for example. In Boolean logic, interactions among inputs are
                cast as combinations of elementary “AND”,
                “OR”, and “NOT” gates that generate logic
                rules such as “(EGF OR TNF) AND (NOT(time))” and are most easily
                specified using truth tables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g002">Figure
                    2B–C</xref>). Truth tables consist of lookup values for the outputs
                (consequent value) based on all possible combinations of input values (antecedents).
                Despite the appeal of Boolean models a two-state “on-off”
                representation of many biological signals is quite unrealistic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Walsh1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Ziv1">[27]</xref>.</p>

                    <p>As an example, local logic gate construction is illustrated for IRS(S) (IRS
                        phosphorylation at serine 636). (A) Logic-based models use incoming edges to
                        contain activity level of input or regulatory network species (for IRS(S),
                        the inputs were TNF, EGF, and time) with the logic gate at the node that
                        performs the logic operation to update output signal (IRS(S)). (B) A Boolean
                        logic gate for IRS(S) could be represented in terms of the logic statement
                        “(TNF or EGF) and (NOT(time))”, represented here in
                        schematic form where the top shape is an “OR-gate” the
                        circle is a “NOT” operation, and the lower left shape is
                        an “AND-gate”). (C) The truth table for the logic in (B)
                        states the output of IRS(S) (0 for off or 1 for on, in bold) based on the
                        input state. (D) To set up a FL gate, the first step is to assign membership
                        functions (MFs) to the input variables (“TNF”,
                        “EGF”, and “time”). In this example,
                        each input variable has two or three membership functions
                        (“L”, “M”, and
                        “H” representing low, medium, and high states,
                        respectively). An MF relates an input value to that state's degree
                        of membership (DOM). MFs for Fuzzy and Boolean (2 MFs)/discrete multi-state
                        (&gt;2 MFs) logic forms are illustrated with the same state thresholds.
                        (E) The simulations from the Boolean logic gate shown in B–C is
                        compared to experimental data and the Fuzzy logic gates specified in F below
                        (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g005">Figure 5A</xref> for the
                        experimental and simulation conditions). The BL gate is not able to model
                        intermediate state for smooth transitions, and simulations of the FL gate
                        better fit the data as compared to the BL gate. (F) To set up a FL gate, the
                        MFs for the inputs and the constant values for the outputs are defined. For
                        simplicity, we use normalized input and output values. Next, logic rules are
                        listed as “if A (the antecedent), then B (the
                        consequent)” using the input and output states as descriptors.
                        Weights between 0 and 1 are assigned to each rule (indicated in
                        parentheses), which is helpful for rules that should have minor influence
                        (e.g. rule 4). The rules for IRS(S) are each graphically listed with the
                        outline of the membership functions specified for that rule's
                        antecedent. Inputs not considered for an antecedent are indicated by a light
                        gray box. The consequent for each rule is indicated by a bar whose height is
                        proportional to the rule weight. We do not depict FL rules in a truth table
                        because a row is not necessarily unique in FL (c.f. (C)). (G–H)
                        Two input scenarios are presented to illustrate FL gate computation
                        (horizontal gray arrows) and defuzzification (vertical gray arrow). The
                        amount of color filled in (yellow for inputs and blue for output) is
                        representative of the DOM (for inputs) or degree of firing (DOF) given the
                        input values (for outputs). The input values are listed on the top and
                        indicated graphically by the vertical red lines. For example in scenario 1,
                        rule 1 fires (full dark blue bar) because the antecedent (TNF is H) has a
                        high DOM (filled in yellow). The firing strength of the rule is the minimum
                        of the antecedents; therefore, rule 2 does not fire because while time has
                        low DOM to L (∼.4) and the DOM of time to H is near zero. To
                        defuzzify (resolve the output value given a set of firing rules), an average
                        is computed from the output values of each rule weighted according to both
                        firing strength and rule weight (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). The bottom row in the consequent column shows the
                        aggregated outputs and the small red line is the defuzzified or final,
                        value. The scenario illustrations were adapted from the “rule
                        viewer” in Matlab's Fuzzy Logic Toolbox.</p>

            <p>In this work, we propose fuzzy logic (FL) as an approach to logic-based modeling with
                the easy interpretability of Boolean models but significant advantages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Zadeh1">[28]</xref>
                including the ability to encode intermediate values for inputs and outputs. We show
                that FL can encode probabilistic and dynamic transitions between network states so
                as to create simple and fairly realistic depictions of cell signaling networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Chaves1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-SaezRodriguez1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Bosl1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Sokhansanj1">[31]</xref>. A key advantage of
                logic-based approaches, also exemplified by FL, is the ability to construct models
                    <italic>ad hoc</italic> based on knowledge of network topology and data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Hoffmann1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Kuepfer1">[36]</xref>. Reverse engineering
                models from data is an alternative and complementary approach, which is less biased
                by <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge and assumptions, and is particularly useful
                for identifying plausible topology and parameterization given quantitative data
                gathered under several perturbations. Here, we focused on building models by hand
                because our goal was to test whether FL methods could be adapted to test <italic>a
                    priori</italic> knowledge and hypotheses against data to refine our
                understanding of the network and generate testable hypotheses. We complement our
                initial model with model optimization to compare the effects of fuzzification.</p>
            <p>Several means to refine Boolean models have been described, including kinetic logic
                and the closely related piecewise-linear differential equations systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Mendoza1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Glass1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Thomas1">[38]</xref>. Some
                of these extensions rely on a differential equation system coupled to the Boolean
                network to handle continuous variables. The resulting models share common
                steady-state behavior with the underlying Boolean system (which is especially
                useful, for example, in development and cell cycle studies) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-deJong1">[39]</xref>, but take longer to
                simulate since they involve solving differential equation systems rather than
                look-up tables. Like fuzzy logic, dynamic Bayesian networks (BN) (and the related
                probabilistic Boolean networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Lahdesmaki1">[40]</xref>) are able to handle data in a non-discrete
                fashion, and have been used extensively to reverse engineer biological networks and
                to model uncertainty in signaling networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Friedman1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Sachs1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-GatViks1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Segal1">[42]</xref>. However, the
                theoretical foundations are very different from those of FL: BNs are based on
                probability distributions, in contrast to membership functions in FL (see below).
                Accordingly, the interpretation is also significantly different: BNs assign a
                probability that a particular interaction exists (with pre-defined weights), while
                FL assigns rule weights to describe the interactions thought to be present. We argue
                that FL models represent a useful addition to the set of mathematical methods
                available for analyzing complex cellular biochemistry.</p>
            <p>The death-survival decisions made by mammalian cells in response to environmental
                stimuli, such as those examined in this paper, are mediated by the integrated
                activities of multiple receptor-dependent and cell-intrinsic processes that
                coordinate opposing pro- and anti-apoptotic signaling. We have previously described
                a “cue-signal-response” (CSR) compendium of protein signals and
                phenotypic responses in HT-29 human colon carcinoma cells treated with combinations
                of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and insulin
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Gaudet1">[43]</xref>.
                The compendium includes ten measurements of protein modification states
                (phosphorylation and cleavage) and kinase activities for four proteins downstream of
                TNF, EGF and insulin receptors collected over a 24 hr time period in biological
                triplicate. To date we have used PLSR to predict the phenotypic consequence of
                perturbing the signaling network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Janes3">[44]</xref> and PCA to identify autocrine feedback circuits
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Janes4">[45]</xref>.</p>
            <p>In this paper we explore the ability of a manually assembled multi-state FL model to
                encode the dynamics of a complex intracellular signaling network. We find that key
                features of FL, such as non-discrete input-output relationships (membership
                functions – see below) and the possibility that more than one relationship
                can be invoked at the same time results in a remarkably intuitive representation of
                biology. It was therefore possible to generate new biological insight into the
                regulation of IKK (IkB kinase) and MK2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated
                protein kinase 2) kinases simply by inspection of the model. A closer fit between
                the FL model and data could presumably be achieved by automated regression. As a
                step in this direction we converted the multi-state FL model into a 2-state FL model
                that could be calibrated against data. The calibrated 2-state FL model exhibited a
                better fit to data than a discrete model having the same degrees of freedom. The
                calibrated 2-state FL model also exhibited a better fit than the manually assembled
                multi-state FL model, but only at the cost of less interpretability. Overall we
                conclude that manual assembly of FL models is an effective means to represent signal
                transduction and derive biological insight; development of new approaches to
                automated model fitting should also make FL models effective tools for
            prediction.</p>

            <title>Results</title>
            <p>Prior knowledge of signal transduction biochemistry was used to assemble a
                topological framework covering all experimental observables in the CSR dataset and
                logic then added using an adaptation of the FL toolbox in Matlab. Once gates were
                specified, a global model was constructed by connecting FL gates together and the
                behavior of the global model was evaluated with respect to goodness of fit to data.
                Specifically, FL gates were used to model changes in protein concentrations or their
                states of modification. Each protein in the network was associated with a single FL
                gate whose inputs were specified by the framework topology; the effect of the inputs
                on the activity or concentration of the protein represented by the FL gate was then
                determined using prior literature knowledge and data. Specifying the precise
                operation of each FL gate involved two distinct concepts: definitions that assigned
                to each input a <italic>membership</italic> to descriptive <italic>classes</italic>
                    (<italic>states</italic> such as “low”,
                “medium”, and “high”), and logic
                    <italic>rules</italic> that related these input classifications to a specific
                output.</p>
            <p>Working with FL models involves manipulating logic gates based on several adjustable
                parameters: (i) <italic>Membership functions</italic> (MFs) are used to assign
                values of inputs to a descriptive input class. (ii) MFs define the <italic>degree of
                    membership</italic> (DOM) that quantifies the mapping between inputs and MFs and
                is always between 0 (no membership) and 1 (full membership). Fuzzy logic is so-named
                because inputs can have non-zero DOM to more than one MF, unlike discrete-state
                logic in which MFs and DOMs only take on values of 0 and 1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Zadeh1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Sugeno1">[46]</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g002">Figure 2D</xref> illustrates example MFs for Boolean and
                fuzzy logic models. (iii) The steepness of the membership functions is parameterized
                by the <italic>degree of fuzziness</italic> (note that Boolean logic models have a
                degree of fuzziness of 0). (iv) Logic <italic>rules</italic> relate the input state
                to the output state. In doing so, these rules encode how the input proteins regulate
                the activity of output protein.</p>
            <p>Once the logic rules are established, an FL gate is generated by first
                    <italic>fuzzifying</italic> the inputs, a step that computes the DOM of each
                input state over the current input values and the pre-specified MFs. The
                    <italic>degree of firing</italic> (DOF), then specifies whether a rule should be
                used (1) or not (0) as determined from the lowest DOM amongst the antecedents and
                the <italic>rule weight</italic>, a value between 0 and 1 that allows additional
                tuning of a rule's importance. In contrast to Boolean logic (BL) gates in
                which only one rule can fire for any set of input values (that is, only one row in
                the truth table is applied), FL gates allow multiple rules to fire to varying
                degrees (as defined by the DOF, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g002">Figure
                    2F</xref>). <italic>Defuzzification</italic> is the final step in which the
                superposition of multiple rules is resolved to determine the output value for the
                gate. Because of the flexibility of FL gates at the input and output levels,
                intermediate levels of activity and complex processing functions can be modeled
                using networks similar in overall structure to familiar BL networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g002">Figure 2E,G–H</xref>). However,
                flexibility also comes at the cost of additional free parameters; to minimize their
                numbers we use only a subset of available FL functions. This involves using few
                intermediate (between 0 and 1) rule weights or membership classes and allowing only
                one degree of fuzziness for all inputs in a given gate.</p>

                <title>Assembling a fuzzy logic gate</title>
                <p>To illustrate how FL was used to model an intracellular signaling protein,
                    consider the gate describing control of IRS-1 phosphorylation at serine 636
                    (IRS(S)) by EGF and TNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g002">Figure
                        2F–H</xref>). For IRS(S), the inputs were TNF concentration, EGF
                    concentration, and time, and the output was the level of IRS(S) phosphorylation.
                    The input and output activities were normalized between 0 and 1 for simplicity.
                    For example, in the IRS(S) gate, TNF concentrations of 0, 5, and 100 ng/mL were
                    normalized to 0, 0.5, and 1 as input values to the FL gate (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Because we do not explicitly model
                    biochemical processes such as receptor downregulation that make signals
                    transient, some of the FL gates had an input corresponding to time (more
                    generally, this approach makes it possible to model dynamical processes using a
                    logical framework). In the CSR data, “low” times refer to
                    early signaling responses (0–2 hr) while “high”
                    times refer to late signaling events (2–24 hr). Membership functions
                    were defined to transform input values to the DOM for each state. For IRS(S),
                    the EGF input has low (L) and high (H) states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). When normalized EGF activity was
                    ∼0, the gate assigned a high (∼1) DOM to L and low (∼0)
                    DOM to H. As the EGF activity increased to 0.5,
                    DOM = 0.5 for both L and H. The output level
                    classes (L and H) were treated as constants (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g002">Figure 2F</xref>); MFs were unnecessary here because
                    gradation of the output was obtained during defuzzification (see below). Once
                    the membership functions had been defined, logic rules were listed as
                    “if A (the antecedent), then B (the consequent)” statements
                    using the inputs and output states as descriptors; e.g., rule 2: if TNF is H and
                    time is L then IRS(S) is H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g002">Figure
                        2F</xref>). Each rule had an associated weight factor between 0 and 1, which
                    was used to quantify the relative importance of the rules.</p>
                <p>To compute the output of a gate for a given set of input values, we first
                    fuzzified the input variables (see two examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g002">Figure 2G–H</xref> and described in text
                    below). Next, each rule was evaluated, and a DOF was calculated as the minimum
                    of the DOMs for the inputs and the rule weight <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Zadeh1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Sugeno1">[46]</xref>.
                    Finally, the outcomes of each rule fired were resolved into a net output value
                    by defuzzification that involved computing the weighted average of the rule
                    consequences (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). By way of
                    illustration, consider the two input value scenarios in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g002">Figures 2G–H</xref>. In scenario 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g002">Figure 2G</xref>),
                    EGF = 1 (that is DOM to MF
                    H = 1),
                    TNF = 0 (DOM to MF
                    L = 1), and
                    time = 0.27 (DOM to MF
                    L = 0.4 and
                    H = 0.6). Rule 1 fired entirely (output IRS(S)
                    was L) while rules 5 and 6 fired partially because time had partial membership
                    to L and H (antecedents for rules 6 and 5, respectively); rules 2, 3, and 4 did
                    not fire to a meaningful extent. Combining all these, the aggregate gate output
                    was ∼0.2, an intermediate value between the full L output from rule 1
                    and the partial H output from rules 5 and 6. In contrast, scenario 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g002">Figure 2H</xref>) shows a condition
                    (EGF = 0,
                    TNF = 1,
                    time = 0.19) that led to full firing of rule 4
                    (though this rule has a weight of 0.25), partial firing of rules 2 and 3, and
                    negligible firing of rules 1, 5, and 6. The aggregate gate output in this case
                    was ∼0.5.</p>

                <title>Features of various logic gates</title>
                <p>To model CSR data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Gaudet1">[43]</xref>, eleven gates were constructed, each
                    comprising 2–4 inputs, 2–4 MFs per input, and 2–3
                    outputs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The
                    precise structure of each gate was based on the network scaffold, as described
                    above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). We aimed
                    for as few inputs, rules, and MFs as possible while still allowing a good fit to
                    data. The parameter values for MFs and rules were fit manually to data but
                    future implementation of machine-learning algorithms or automated fitting would
                    improve the speed and accuracy of the process (see below). By way of
                    illustration consider the JNK and MK2 pathways, which are activated by stress
                    and cytokine treatment and are thought to be co-regulated following EGF or TNF
                    treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Roux1">[47]</xref>).
                    During the course of constructing gates for JNK and MK2, we found that the data
                    could be modeled without knowing whether or not cells had been treated with EGF
                    or insulin, suggesting that activation of JNK and MK2 was independent of ligand
                    addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g003">Figure
                    3B–C</xref>). In some cases, gates based on the pathway scaffold were
                    insufficient to yield a reasonable fit to data and major changes were required
                    in the number and/or types of inputs. For example, IRS-1 is the canonical
                    adapter protein downstream of the insulin receptor, though some of its many
                    phosphorylation sites are also substrates of other receptor kinases, including
                    EGFR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Lassarre1">[48]</xref>. In modeling IRS-1 phosphorylation at two sites,
                    tyrosine 896 (IRS(Y)) and serine 636 (IRS(S)), we observed that both were
                    regulated by TNF and EGF but not by insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g003">Figure 3F and 3J</xref>). The rules indicate that
                    both TNF and EGF treatment induce S636 phosphorylation while TNF inhibits
                    EGF-induced phosphorylation at Y896 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000340.s001">Text S1</xref>).</p>
                <p>During construction of an FL gate for Akt, we included inhibitory crosstalk from
                    ERK to Akt because it has been observed in several experimental settings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Kiyatkin1">[49]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Yu1">[51]</xref>. The introduction of
                    crosstalk greatly simplified the rule-base of the Akt gate, suggesting that this
                    crosstalk exists in HT-29 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g003">Figure 3I</xref>). The mechanistic basis of crosstalk is not fully, and our
                    model includes a short time delay from ERK to the Akt gate input. Negative
                    crosstalk from the ERK to Akt pathways may be the mechanism by which TNF
                    inhibits Akt phosphorylation upon insulin treatment, as observed by Gaudet et
                    al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Gaudet1">[43]</xref>.</p>

                <title>FL network modeling</title>
                <p>A model with four inputs (TNF, EGF, insulin, and time) and describing the full
                    CSR dataset was constructed by joining together individual gates specified using
                    the approach described above. Time delays were incorporated to model slow
                    processes such as the induction of transforming growth factor-α
                    [TGF-α] by TNF stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Janes4">[45]</xref>. TGF-α,
                    which acts in an autocrine fashion (not shown) was united with the EGF input by
                    taking the maximum value across both signals at each point in time (using the
                        “<italic>MAX</italic>” function), as these ligands bind
                    the same receptor and both affect MEK and Akt FL gates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). To compute model output, a
                    simulator stepped through small time steps, updating inputs to each gates at
                    successive steps (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>); model state
                    was then recorded at twelve equal time intervals corresponding to the
                    experimental time points.</p>
                <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g005">Figure 5A</xref> depicts heatmaps of
                    the CSR dataset and the FL model, and shows that our FL model recapitulated most
                    major features of the CSR dataset across ten cytokine combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). For most inputs,
                    the difference between simulation and experimental data were small, averaging
                    ∼2.2%, over the entire CSR data set (as defined by the root
                    mean square deviation normalized by the mean of the data). Common to all
                    predicted signals was the absence of a delay in activation after cytokine
                    stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g005">Figure 5</xref>). To
                    model this delay would require an additional MF for several gates, a feature we
                    omitted for simplicity. It was also challenging to model FKHR phosphorylation.
                    Even though Akt is known to regulate FKHR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Lam1">[52]</xref>, the model did not
                    effectively match data when Akt was the sole input to the FKHR gate; thus, we
                    modeled FKHR as having inputs from TNF, EGF, insulin, and time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g003">Figure 3H</xref>). This suggests that
                    in HT-29 cells, FHKR is subject to more complex regulation than simply
                    activation by Akt.</p>
                <p>One way to evaluate the performance of a model is to ask whether it can correctly
                    predict data that are not part of the training set. Data describing the response
                    of HT-29 cells to co-treatment with TNF and C225, an antibody that blocks ligand
                    binding to the EGF receptor, was not used to assemble the multi-state FL model.
                    We therefore asked whether the FL model could predict the effect of C225 as
                    compared to treatment with TNF alone. Because EGFR is activated both by
                    exogenous EGF and autocrine TGF-α (whose production is induced by TNF
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Janes4">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Chen1">[53]</xref>) we modeled the
                    effect of C225 addition by disabling the <italic>MAX</italic> function
                    downstream of TNF and EGF (recall that this gate is present to model activation
                    of EGFR not only by exogenous EGF but also by TNF-dependent release of
                    TGFα, which acts in an autocrine manner). The model correctly predicted
                    that cotreatment with TNF and C225 would reduce Akt, MEK, and ERK signals as
                    compared to treatment with TNF-alone (“−“ vs
                    “+” C225 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g006">Figure 6</xref>). However, the model did not predict
                    decreases in MK2 and JNK signaling because the MAX function downstream of EGFR
                    activity was not connected to the MK2 and JNK pathways, which are thought to be
                    downstream of TNF but not TGFα or EGF stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Janes4">[45]</xref>. We can reinterpret
                    our initial assumptions that TGFα signaling only affects Akt and ERK.
                    The other MAP kinases measured (MK2 and more noticeably JNK) exhibited less
                    activation in the presence of C225. Likewise, late IKK signaling was decreased
                    and slightly more caspases were cleaved compared to C225 alone, but these
                    effects were not predicted by our model. The discrepancy between the model and
                    data suggest that MK2, JNK, and IKK are activated in part by TNF via
                    TGFα by either a direct effect of EGFR or through crosstalk with the Akt
                    and ERK pathways. Our model enabled us to predict some of the effects of C225 in
                    interfering with TNF signaling while providing context to revise our
                    understanding of TNF-induced signaling through EGFR in the MK2, JNK, and IKK

                <title>Towards a method for optimizing gates</title>
                <p>In the work described above, logic rules and membership functions for each gate
                    were established manually. A better approach is to use training to optimize the
                    weights of all possible rules in a gate by minimizing the sum of the squared
                    differences between the experimental data and local model output (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Following optimization, logic rules
                    that are supported by the data should have weights near 1, while
                    poorly-supported rules should have weights near 0. We tested the fitting
                    algorithm on the MK2 gate. For such a gate, which has two MFs each for the two
                    inputs (TNF and time) and the output (MK2 activity),
                    2<sup>3</sup> = 8 explicit rules are possible.
                    MK2 data from the 10 cytokine treatment conditions were used to optimize a
                    vector containing the 8 rule weights. Our initial optimization attempt failed
                    because time-dependent MFs were not parameterized so as to capture rapid
                    increases in signals following cytokine treatment. We had implicitly ignored
                    this discrepancy when fitting the model by hand. To improve the automated
                    fitting procedure, an additional MF for time was included to represent
                    immediate-early responses, increasing the number of candidate rules to 12.
                    Optimization yielded a gate with a good fit to data using only six rules with
                    weights near one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g007">Figure
                    7A</xref>). These six rules were identical to those assembled manually with the
                    exception of the new rule needed to represent immediate early signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). To test FL gate
                    regression with more rules, we applied the algorithm to the same MK2 data using
                    one additional membership function (for medium activity levels) and compared it
                    to an untrained model using the same MFs. The training process created several
                    rules that were nearly identical to those introduced manually as well as several
                    new ones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000340.s002">Figure
                        S1</xref>). The MK2 test case suggests that it is possible to optimize rule
                    weights as a means to fit logic rules without bias and is a first step towards a
                    more rigorous approach to logic-based modeling.</p>

                <title>Comparing fuzzy and discrete logic</title>
                <p>To compare FL and discrete models we converted our FL model to a multi-state
                    discrete model (DL) by leaving the rules, rule weights and MF thresholds the
                    same and changing the degree of fuzziness of the MFs so as to make the model
                    discrete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Resulting FL and DL models are
                    therefore identical except in a single global parameter (the degree of
                    fuzziness) making direct comparison possible. More than one rule could fire at
                    the same time in both the FL and DL model, making defuzzification necessary in
                    both (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000340.s003">Figure
                        S2</xref>). Thus, the DL model was not a conventional Boolean model.</p>
                <p>To measure the goodness of fit of FL and DL models, we computed the sum of
                    squared differences (RSS) and normalized RSS (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). The FL model consistently exhibited a better fit to the
                    data than the DL model (absolute deviation of 44.6 and 96.7, and normalized
                    deviation of 0.035 and 0.076, respectively). When we compared simulated and
                    actual data we observed cases in with FL models were better than DL models,
                    cases in which they were similarly effective and cases in which neither did a
                    good job in fitting data. In general, DL models were less effective than FL
                    models in capturing intermediate activity levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). For example, in the DL model ERK
                    activity alternated between low and high while in the FL model ERK activity was
                    graded, as it was in experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). More striking breakdowns between
                    the DL model and data were observed for IRS(S), JNK and Akt, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). For IRS(S)
                    transient activation was missing from in the model for 1 of 5 cytokine
                    treatments and for JNK it was missed for 3 of 6 treatments However, DL models
                    effectively capture step functions and they are therefore well suited to sharp
                    transient signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g005">Figure
                    5C</xref>). We also observed cases where both models failed to fit the data,
                    especially when two peaks of activity were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). This failure to fit data could be
                    remedied by adding more input states for time and by altering the rules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000340.s003">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
                <p>To ensure that the superior fit of the FL model (as compared to the DL model) was
                    not biased because the FL model (and not the DL model) was manually assembled,
                    we independently optimized simplified FL and DL models. We performed a global
                    optimization with 8-fold cross-validation of the rule weights in 2-state FL and
                    DL models (see below, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000340.s003">Figures
                    S2</xref>). These models contain two states for each input and the output in
                    every gate. Optimization of the 2-state FL model improved the estimated error
                    compared to the 2-state DL model (with averages and standard deviations of
                    0.030±0.005 and 0.040±0.006, respectively, using a
                    normalized fitness measure (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> and
                        <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000340.s003">Figure
                    S2</xref>). Additionally, we converted the 2-state DL model to BL by converting
                    the rule weights to a binary value (0 or 1). We repeated the optimization but
                    over binary rule weights for the BL and FL 2-state models. The cross-validated
                    error of the binary-weighted FL model was ∼50% lower as
                    compared to the BL model (0.056±0.01 and 0.083±0.01,
                    respectively). We therefore find that a standard Boolean model has poorer
                    performance than the discrete model (DL) studied here (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000340.s003">Figure S2</xref>).
                    The improved ability of the DL model (as compared to the BL model) to predict
                    data following optimization on a training set suggests that continuous rule
                    weights confer noticeable flexibility to the models.</p>

                        respond to TNF and, following cytokine treatment, are jointly regulated by
                        the upstream kinases MEKK1-4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Roux1">[47]</xref>. Since MK2 is a substrate of p38, it was
                        not surprising to see a close correlation in the FL model between JNK and
                        MK2. MEK is the immediate upstream activator of ERK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Roux1">[47]</xref>, but the fit to
                        ERK dynamics was much better if both MEK and MK2 were included as inputs to
                        the ERK gate; under these circumstances, only five simple rules were
                        required to capture ERK dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Moreover, we judged MK2 to be
                        superior to TNF, EGF, and insulin as an input to the ERK gate because the
                        rule-base was smaller. In the final formulation, MK2
                        “OR” MEK positively influence ERK. The unexpected
                        involvement of MK2 in ERK regulation suggests either that MK2 regulates ERK
                        in an indirect or direct manner, or that MK2 is tightly correlated with an
                        as-yet unidentified ERK regulator. In previous PLSR modeling, we had
                        observed a role for MK2 in cell survival and the current data suggest that
                        ERK may be an effector of MK2 survival functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Janes3">[44]</xref>. MK2 has
                        previously been reported to regulate TNF and TGF-β expression, two
                        ligands that regulate ERK by engaging cell-surface receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Sousa1">[54]</xref>,
                        and it is possible that the action of MK2 on ERK is autocrine-indirect.
                        However the time-independence of the interaction in FL model is suggestive
                        of a more direct link.</p>

            <p>In this paper we describe the assembly and evaluation of a fuzzy logic model of
                mammalian signaling networks induced by TNF, EGF, and insulin. The logic gates and
                their associated membership functions, which encode input-output relationships for
                interactions among various species in the model, were generated based on study of
                cellular responses to different cytokine treatments. The gates were then linked
                together based on prior knowledge of network topology and parameterized using
                induction or an automatic fitting process that minimized the difference between
                simulated and experimental trajectories. The resulting models were interpretable
                with respect to known interactions from the literature, and they generated dynamic
                trajectories for various signals that were similar to experimental data. We can
                therefore conclude that efficient assembly of a FL network able to encode complex
                experimental data is possible.</p>
            <p>By building different versions of a FL gate, we were able to intuit potential
                biological interactions that had gone unnoticed during data mining with other
                analytic tools. For example, the FL model suggested that MK2 and MEK are
                co-regulators of ERK. This offers a new explanation for the previously published
                observation that MK2 has pro-survival effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Huang1">[21]</xref>. Similarly, a link
                between EGF treatment and IKK inhibition suggests that EGF-induced downregulation of
                the EGF receptor might interfere with IKK activation by inhibiting
                TGF-α-induced IL-1α autocrine signaling, which is dependent on EGF
                receptor activity. Thus, FL modeling yields predictions about the strength and logic
                of direct and autocrine-indirect processes. In the future, the process of choosing
                the best FL model can be made more rigorous than what we have undertaken here by
                automating the fit of rules and membership function to data; this would obviously
                make the process of extracting hypotheses from models more rigorous.</p>
            <p>As a starting point for optimizing FL models, we show that it is possible to fit the
                rules for individual gates to experimental data. This raises the general possibility
                that logic-based models can be improved by global fitting procedures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Linden1">[60]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-Ressom1">[61]</xref>.
                Optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithms and Monte Carlo simulations can
                be used to fit membership functions and rule weights simultaneously (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000340.s003">Figure S2</xref>).
                However, a critical step in optimization of FL models will be the development of
                objective functions that balance complexity and goodness of fit to data. Because
                different parameter types encode diverse degrees of freedom, designing a balanced
                metric will be challenging. Should a model be penalized equally for binary and
                continuous parameters, or for additional rule weights versus another membership
                function? Answering these questions will likely require application of theories such
                as Minimum Description Length and Vapnik-Chervonenkis Theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000340-MacKay1">[62]</xref>. These methods employ
                statistical learning methods (Vapnik-Chervonenkis Theory) or data compression
                through Turing-style languages (Minimum Description Length) to quantify model
                complexity. We have already observed that the capacity of multi-state discrete logic
                gates to effectively capture quantitative data features can be increased by
                including a greater number of memberships (states) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000340.s004">Figure S3</xref>).
                Therefore, either fuzzification or inclusion of additional states can strengthen a
                DL model. A solid metric of model quality would make it possible to compare FL and
                BL models rigorously as well as evaluate models of the same processes that differ in
                topology or MFs.</p>
            <p>The fuzzy logic framework supports several mechanisms for flexibility including the
                slope and shape of the membership functions, rule weights, fuzzification and
                defuzzification procedures, and rule structure. Here, we limited our fuzzification
                of logic models to a subset of possible FL functions. We used only one degree of
                membership and one membership shape for entire models and chose the simplest
                fuzzification algorithms and rule structures. Most of the flexibility in our FL
                models, as compared to BL models, arose from fuzzy memberships and continuous rule
                weights that enabled multiple rules to fire simultaneously. By optimizing four
                variants of the 2-state model (discrete or fuzzy memberships and continuous or
                binary rule weights, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000340.s003">Figure S2</xref>), we were able to demonstrate that much of the ability of the
                FL models to fit the CSR data arose by allowing rule weights to be continuous and
                not binary. Thus, DL models may be a useful alternative to BL models. If DL models
                use quantized rather than continuous rule weights, they are likely to achieve a
                similar flexibility of fuzzified logic models while offering the benefit of faster
                optimization and easier interpretability with fewer degrees of freedom.</p>
            <p>We built models by both manually and automatically fitting model parameters. Though
                the latter achieved better fits to data, it came at the expense of a loss of model
                interpretability. Model building methods that balance rigor of automatic
                optimization with the intuition gained with hand-curated models will be a key step
                forward. This might be achieved by optimizing quantized rule weights instead of
                continuous values, or by penalizing models for intermediate weights. Use of a
                processing algorithm that simplifies sets of optimized rules by excluding those with
                low weights or merging similar rules would ease the interpretability gap between
                manually and automatically assembled models. Specialized software that offers a more
                limited subset of FL capabilities would also streamline model development and
                improve the computational time required for parameter optimization.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, the current FL model of TNF/EGF/insulin-induced signaling in HT-29
                cells begins to explore the potential of FL methods to model cell signaling
                networks. the future, the improvement of automated model fitting, a graphical-user
                interface tailored to biological applications, and better means to mine and
                incorporate literature data should facilitate the application of FL modeling
                methods. Moreover, FL models can be merged with differential equation models to form
                hybrid models with particular utility in cases in which some processes are well
                described, receptor-ligand binding and immediate early signaling for example, but
                the biochemical details of downstream processes such as induced gene transcription
                are less well specified. One approach to such model fusion would be to reverse
                engineer part of a differential-equation model to generate the look-up tables
                necessary for construction of various logic gates. We are currently exploring these
                and other approaches to expanding the areas of application of FL from industrial
                control to interpretation of complex biological data.</p>

                <p>Models were written and run using Matlab R2007a. Individual FL gates were
                    constructed and tested using the Matlab Fuzzy Logic Toolbox (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000340.s005">Figure S4</xref>).
                    Defuzzification was implemented using the Sugeno inference method
                    (“sugeno” in the Fuzzy Logic Toolbox) where for N rules (r)
                    with firing strength s and output level z, the defuzzification is calculated as follows:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000340.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
                <p>To parameterize the “gauss2mf” membership function shape, a
                    Python script was used to coordinate the MF slope (.250 for FL and .0001 for BL
                    models) with intersections at a 0.5 DOM. Input and output values ranged from 0
                    to 1 for simplicity and were empirically normalized. Cytokine inputs were scaled
                    non-linearly (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g004">Figure 4</xref>)
                    and signals were scaled linearly. Each of the twelve time-steps in the data
                    compendium were equally spaced as inputs to the FL gates even though they were
                    not evenly spaced in real time. Membership functions and input/output ranges
                    could be extended and made nonlinear to reflect absolute time and concentration.
                    We used a default of two states (membership functions) for each variable and the
                    number was increased as needed (heuristically). We decreased the number of free
                    parameters by imposing a single degree of fuzziness on the model and constants
                    for output memberships. The global model was built and run in Simulink, using
                    its standard libraries for the “max” function, time, and
                    time delays. The network is simulated on a synchronous clock (corresponding with
                    the time variable, with a sufficiently small time step) with initial values in
                    downstream gates as 0. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000340.s007">Dataset S1</xref> contains the Matlab, Simulink,

                <title>Model fitness</title>
                <p>Model fitness was calculated by dividing the sum of the squared difference (RSS)
                    between a model and the data by the degrees of freedom (number of data
                    points-number of parameters for the multi-state models and the number of data
                    points for cross-validation of the 2-state models). For the whole set of
                    simulations, there were 1430 data points. The parameters were counted as
                    fellows: degree of fuzziness (1), MF thresholds (40), and number of unique
                    antecedents (120). The methodology for fitness of the 2-state models is

                <title>Global logic gate regression</title>
                <p>Rule weight optimization was achieved by using non-linear least squares
                    regression between the model and the dynamic data under ten treatment
                    conditions. Because a gate's output is defuzzified by using a weighted
                    average of the rules fired, sets of firing rules can all have low weights
                    without altering the final output. To highlight firing rules in any
                    circumstance, rule weights were normalized at each iteration of optimization so
                    that the weights of rules with the same antecedents sum to 1. Our manually
                    assembled gates were similar to the fitted gates, but frequently contain
                    condensed and simpler rules sets. For example, we would write the rules
                    “If TNF is L and time is H then MK2 is L” and “If
                    TNF is H and time is H then MK2 is L” in a condensed form:
                    “If time is H then MK2 is L”. Significantly, the condensed
                    form is weighted less heavily in the defuzzification than the explicit form and
                    therefore a balance must be struck between interpretability (for condensed
                    rules) and accuracy (for explicit rules), though we have not encountered
                    misbehavior of logic gates due to condensed rules. For rule fitting, we started
                    by generating full description versions of each possible rule. The optimization
                    procedure was scripted in Matlab R2007a and used the Matlab Optimization toolbox
                    (lsqcurvefit). The Matlab files can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000340.s007">Dataset S1</xref>.

                        candidate rules. The rules are indicated in tabular format; the first two
                        rows describe the state of the inputs, TNF and time, and the last row is the
                        output MK2 state. L, M, and H represent low, medium, and high states, and E
                        is the state describing the early response lag. Symbols above the plot show
                        whether the rules were present (check), absent (slashed circle), or not
                        applicable (boxed x) in the untrained model. Rules that are different in the
                        trained and the untrained model have red symbols. To compare the optimized
                        rule set with our empirically determined set, the bar graph of rule weights
                        was annotated to indicate discrepancies (red symbols). Seven rules were
                        found to be different, though the differences are easiest understood when
                        grouped into three sets. The first set of rules (“a”)
                        involve the antecedent case “If TNF is M and time is L”.
                        In the untrained model, the output was M while in the trained model, the
                        output was L and H (partial). Therefore, the logic for the trained and
                        untrained model was essentially the same and yielded relatively similar
                        results. In the second set of rules (“b”) for the case
                        “If TNF is H and time if L”, the trained model includes
                        additional outputs of M and L (partial) in addition to H, which is the only
                        rule of the set in the untrained model. The third set of rules
                        (“c”), “If TNF is H or M (partial) and time is
                        M, then MK2 is M”, was missed when the untrained model was built.
                        In comparing the heatmaps of the trained to the untrained model when TNF is
                        H or M and time is M, it is apparent that the untrained model erroneously
                        omitted these rules (A) and the trained model's rules are
                        improvements over the untrained model.</p>

                        logic (FL) models differ from Boolean logic (BL) and discrete multi-state
                        logic (DMSL) models because the membership functions are fuzzy and the rule
                        based need not be unique (e.g. more than one rule can fire for a given input
                        state, even when membership to the input states is discrete). Discrete
                        models (DL) and DMSL models both use discrete membership function but are
                        different in that DL rule bases allow multiple rules to fire (rules are not

                        for the IRS(S) gate described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g002">Figure 2</xref> is expanded to show the case
                        where multiple rules can fire (DL and FL). IRS(S) output values are in bold.
                        One value is gray to reflect its rule weight of 0.25. Where more than one
                        output value is shown, both values result from conflicting firing rules and
                        must be defuzzified. In this case, multiple rule firing results from
                        non-unique rules (overlapping antecedents), not fuzziness in the membership
                        functions. (C) Simulations of the IRS(S) across the spectrum of logic
                        gate-types shown and labeled in (A) are shown with the experimental data
                        (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000340-g005">Figure 5A</xref> for
                        cytokine conditions). (D) Non-heatmap representation of globally optimized
                        2-state FL (IV, blue), DL (II, green), and data (black, shown with the
                        earliest three time points set to their maximum, see above). (E) Non-heatmap
                        representation of globally optimized 2-state model with Fuzzy memberships
                        but binary rule weights (I, blue), BL (III, green), and data (black, shown
                        with the earliest three time points set to their maximum, see above).
                        Because continuous parameters have a higher information capacity than binary
                        parameters, we cannot quantitatively compare BL models with DL or FL models
                        while accounting for the flexibility imparted by their parameters.</p>
