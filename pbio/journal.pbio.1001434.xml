        <p>Analysis of centromeres in progeny of <italic>Drosophila</italic> sperm with experimentally altered centromere-specific histone CenH3 levels reveals quantitative inheritance of this epigenetic mark.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, as in many animal and plant species, centromere identity is specified epigenetically. In proliferating cells, a centromere-specific histone H3 variant (CenH3), named Cid in Drosophila and Cenp-A in humans, is a crucial component of the epigenetic centromere mark. Hence, maintenance of the amount and chromosomal location of CenH3 during mitotic proliferation is important. Interestingly, CenH3 may have different roles during meiosis and the onset of embryogenesis. In gametes of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, and possibly in plants, centromere marking is independent of CenH3. Moreover, male gamete differentiation in animals often includes global nucleosome for protamine exchange that potentially could remove CenH3 nucleosomes. Here we demonstrate that the control of Cid loading during male meiosis is distinct from the regulation observed during the mitotic cycles of early embryogenesis. But Cid is present in mature sperm. After strong Cid depletion in sperm, paternal centromeres fail to integrate into the gonomeric spindle of the first mitosis, resulting in gynogenetic haploid embryos. Furthermore, after moderate depletion, paternal centromeres are unable to re-acquire normal Cid levels in the next generation. We conclude that Cid in sperm is an essential component of the epigenetic centromere mark on paternal chromosomes and it exerts quantitative control over centromeric Cid levels throughout development. Hence, the amount of Cid that is loaded during each cell cycle appears to be determined primarily by the preexisting centromeric Cid, with little flexibility for compensation of accidental losses.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Genetic information in eukaryotic cells is parceled into chromosomes. These information strings are precisely transmitted to daughter cells during mitotic and meiotic cell divisions, but only if the centromere, a specialized chromosomal region, is functional. The centromere region within chromosomes of many species—including humans and the fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>—is thought to be specified epigenetically by incorporation of a centromere-specific histone H3 variant (CenH3). After chromosome replication, the centromeres in the resulting two sister chromatids might be expected to be composed of a mixture of pre-existing CenH3 evenly distributed onto the two copies during replication and new CenH3 recruited by the partitioned pool in a stoichiometric manner. Here, we have addressed whether centromeres are indeed replicated in this manner by experimentally altering the levels of centromeric CenH3 in Drosophila sperm. We show that centromeres on paternal chromosomes cannot recruit new CenH3 in embryos fertilized with sperm lacking CenH3. By using sperm with increased or reduced amounts of centromeric CenH3, we demonstrate that altered CenH3 levels are at least partially propagated on paternal centromeres throughout development of the offspring. We conclude that pre-existing CenH3 in Drosophila sperm is therefore not only required for transgenerational centromere maintenance, but that it also exerts quantitative control of this process.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Many eukaryotes, like humans and Drosophila, have chromosomes with a single regional centromere. Faithful propagation of this centromere during chromosome replication and cell proliferation is crucial. Loss of centromere function or extra centromeres cause aneuploidy. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms that control centromere replication have attracted considerable attention recently (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Black1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Allshire1">[4]</xref>). Importantly, these analyses have indicated that centromere identity in regional centromeres is specified epigenetically. Centromere-specific histone H3 variants (CenH3s) are thought to be an essential component of the corresponding epigenetic mark. In humans and Drosophila, the CenH3s have been named CENP-A and Centromere identifier (Cid) (FlyBase accession number FBgn0040477), respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Sullivan1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Henikoff1">[6]</xref>. Nucleosomes with these CenH3s instead of other histone H3 variants are stably incorporated exclusively within the centromeric region of the chromosome during unperturbed cell cycle progression. The precise structural details of these special centromeric nucleosomes may vary in different cell cycle phases and organisms (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Black1">[1]</xref>). Based on the analysis of stretched chromatin fibres, blocks of chromatin containing CenH3 alternate with blocks that lack it <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Blower1">[7]</xref>. The molecular mechanisms that control the number and size of these blocks and the centromere region overall are not understood. While the gradual depletion of CenH3 does not appear to have immediate effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Liu1">[8]</xref>, an enforced acute increase in centromeric Cid has been shown to result in severe chromosome missegregation during mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Schittenhelm1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A conceptually simple mechanism that might maintain the centromere during cell proliferation is “template-governed.” After random distribution of centromeric CenH3 nucleosomes during chromosome replication onto the two sister chromatids, these old nucleosomes may act as a template, allowing the local stoichiometric loading of new CenH3 nucleosomes during each cell cycle. Such a mechanism for maintenance of centromere position and size would lack flexibility for correction of occasional errors. In contrast, “homeostatic” mechanisms controlling the loading of new CenH3s to a target level that is set independently from the actual amount that is already present at the centromere would allow for correction of accidental fluctuations. Elegant experiments in Drosophila have provided clear evidence for template-governed CenH3 loading. Cid-GFP-LacI targeting to lac operator arrays was shown to recruit endogenous Cid that appeared to be maintained independently of Cid-GFP-LacI at least to some extent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Mendiburo1">[10]</xref>. On the other hand, recent findings from <italic>C. elegans</italic> and plants have indicated that centromere maintenance during meiosis and onset of embryogenesis can be mechanistically distinct. Cenp-A nucleosomes are transiently eliminated from chromosomes in the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> germline and not required for subsequent Cenp-A incorporation in nontranscribed regions throughout the holocentric chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Monen1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Gassmann1">[12]</xref>. Although this independence on pre-existing Cenp-A in <italic>C. elegans</italic> might represent a derived state resulting from the evolution of the holocentric chromosomes, a similar transient absence of centromeric CenH3 has also been described in egg cells of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Ingouff1">[13]</xref>, which has regional centromeres. In addition, de novo formation of centromeres can occasionally occur in humans and various experimental systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Folco1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Harrington1">[20]</xref>. These findings emphasize that in animals, the uncharacterized role of CenH3 in regional centromeres during meiosis and fertilization might not necessarily be the same as during mitotic cell proliferation, where it is both required and sufficient according to the evidence obtained in case of Cid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Blower1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Mendiburo1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Blower2">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Heun1">[23]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To address significance, composition, and transgenerational maintenance of epigenetic centromere marking during sexual reproduction in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, we analyzed Cid behavior during spermatogenesis and early embryogenesis. Drosophila spermatogenesis begins at the closed apical end of the testis tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g001">Figure 1a</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Fuller1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Cenci1">[25]</xref>. Germline stem cells located there divide asymmetrically. The resulting differentiating daughter cell, the gonioblast, progresses through four mitotic cell cycles with incomplete cytokinesis, and thereby generates a cyst with 16 interconnected spermatocytes. Premeiotic S phase is completed very soon after the last of these four mitotic divisions. Thereafter extensive spermatocyte growth occurs during an extended meiotic G2 phase before progression through the first and second meiotic division. The haploid cell nucleus of postmeiotic spermatids, which remain interconnected within each cyst, is extensively remodeled. Nucleosomes are massively replaced with sperm-specific proteins such as protamines and the genetic material is highly compacted (200-fold) into a needle-shaped sperm head <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-JayaramaiahRaja1">[26]</xref>. After complete elongation of the sperm tails, mature sperm is individualized and released in a motile form into the seminal vesicle at the distal end of the testis tube. After fertilization, the sperm nucleus is once more extensively remodeled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Bonnefoy1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Loppin1">[28]</xref>. Protamines are rapidly replaced with nucleosomes concomitant with transformation into a round male pronucleus. Thereafter progression through the first S phase occurs. In parallel, female meiosis is completed. After S phase and pronuclear migration, the female pronucleus and the closely apposed male pronucleus enter into the first mitosis by forming a gonomeric spindle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Callaini1">[29]</xref>. The reformation of daughter nuclei in telophase combines the two parental genomes within the first two daughter nuclei. Subsequent progression through the rapid and synchronous cleavage cycles generates a syncytium because cytokinesis is omitted during early Drosophila embryogenesis. After cellularization of the syncytial blastoderm nuclei at the onset of gastrulation, additional cell proliferation involves progression through cell cycles including cytokinesis.</p>

      <p>Here we show that Cid survives the radical nucleosome replacement process that accompanies spermatogenesis.

        <title>Paternal Cid But Not Cenp-C Is Inherited with Paternal Centromeres</title>
        <p>In case of epigenetic specification of centromere identity, all essential components of the corresponding mark have to be preserved when the bulk of nucleosomes are replaced with protamines during postmeiotic spermatid differentiation. Otherwise paternal chromosomes could not be propagated after fertilization. Cid, the Drosophila CenH3, which is essential for centromere maintenance during mitotic proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Blower2">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Blower3">[22]</xref>, was therefore expected to be present in mature sperm if Cid is also crucial for transgenerational centromere maintenance. In earlier attempts Cid was not detected in sperm, but technical problems with antigen accessibility during immunolabeling were suspected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Loppin2">[30]</xref>. To avoid such problems, we analyzed testis from transgenic <italic>cid</italic> mutant males that expressed functional Cid-EGFP under control of the normal <italic>cid</italic> cis-regulatory region instead of endogenous Cid. Specific dot-like EGFP signals were clearly observed in mature <italic>cid; cid-EGFP</italic> sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g001">Figure 1b,c</xref>), indicating that Cid is indeed present in sperm. While centromeres are strongly clustered close to the chromocenter in most somatic Drosophila interphase cells, Cid-EGFP dots were found to be predominantly unclustered in mature sperm (46%, 42%, and 12% with 4, 3, and 2 signals, respectively; <italic>n</italic> = 24).</p>
        <p>In contrast to Cid-EGFP, we were unable to detect Cenp-C-EGFP in mature sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g001">Figure 1b,d</xref>). During earlier stages, Cenp-C-EGFP was readily detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g001">Figure 1b,d</xref>). For comparison of Cid and Cenp-C changes during spermatogenesis, centromeric EGFP signal intensities observed in S4–6 spermatocytes were set to 1 arbitrary unit in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g001">Figure 1c and d</xref>. During the S4–6 stages, however, centromeric Cenp-C-EGFP signals were at least as strong as those observed for Cid-EGFP (unpublished data). Our failure to detect Cenp-C-EGFP in mature sperm is therefore not simply a result of limited detection sensitivity. We conclude that centromeric Cenp-C (FlyBase accession number FBgn0086697) is eliminated during sperm head formation. It is either absent or very low in mature sperm. Another centromere protein described in Drosophila apart from Cid and Cenp-C is Cal1 (FlyBase accession number FBgn0038478) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Goshima1">[31]</xref>. Cal1-EGFP could also not be detected in sperm (see below). Therefore, Cenp-C and Cal1 do not appear to be essential components of the suspected epigenetic centromere mark.</p>
        <p>To analyse the fate of paternal Cid protein after fertilization, <italic>cid; cid-EGFP</italic> males were crossed with wild-type females, followed by analyses during the initial cleavage cycles in the resulting embryos. Cid-EGFP signals in up to four discrete spots were readily detected during male pronucleus formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g002">Figure 2a–c</xref>). At metaphase of the first mitosis, Cid-EGFP was present on four pairs of sister centromeres in one of the two chromosome sets within the gonomeric metaphase plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g002">Figure 2d</xref>). Cid-EGFP signals in essentially all of the analyzed paternal pronuclei (11 out of 12) were also observed when males hemizygous for the <italic>cid-EGFP</italic> transgene were crossed to wild-type females. If Cid-EGFP signals in paternal pronuclei, however, were to reflect zygotic expression of the paternally inherited transgene after fertilization, at most 50% of the progeny of hemizygous fathers would be expected to display Cid-EGFP at paternal centromeres. We conclude that the Cid protein of mature sperm remains associated with paternal centromeres during chromatin remodeling and male pronucleus formation, followed by equal distribution onto sister centromeres during the first S phase. During metaphase of mitosis 2, centromeric Cid-EGFP was still detectable but again on only one half of the chromosomes and with reduced intensity (unpublished data). During mitosis 3, paternal Cid-EGFP was no longer detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g002">Figure 2e</xref>). Progression through the cleavage stages therefore appears to be accompanied by dilution of the inherited paternal Cid-EGFP during each cell cycle by newly recruited unlabeled Cid from maternally provided stores. In contrast to Cid, but as expected from the absence of Cenp-C in mature sperm described above, we did not detect EGFP signals in early embryos after crossing <italic>Cenp-C-EGFP, Cenp-C</italic> males with wild-type females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g002">Figure 2f</xref>).</p>

        <title>Sperm Centromere Cid Is Required for Maintenance of Paternal Chromosomes after Fertilization</title>
        <p>To evaluate the functional significance of paternal Cid inherited with sperm, we applied deGradFP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Caussinus1">[32]</xref> for Cid protein depletion during spermatogenesis. In deGradFP, depletion of GFP fusion proteins is achieved by expression of a GFP-specific recombinant ubiquitin ligase (NSlmb-vhhGFP4) with the UAS/GAL4 system. For expression of this ubiquitin ligase specifically in late spermatocytes, we generated a <italic>topi-GAL4-VP16</italic> driver. Using this driver for deGradFP in <italic>cid; cid-EGFP</italic> males, we were able to obtain sperm in which EGFP signals were no longer above background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g003">Figure 3a</xref>). We assume that some centromeric Cid was still present at least during the preceding meiotic divisions, as these were clearly successful. The resulting Cid-depleted sperm allowed successful fertilization, as evidenced by analyses of embryos collected from crosses of deGradFP <italic>cid; cid-EGFP</italic> males with control females. Around 90% of progeny developed to the syncytial blastoderm stage, when thousands of nuclei are regularly arranged just below the egg cell membrane. As fertilization is required for the initiation of embryonic development in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, we conclude that fertilization with sperm is still possible after Cid elimination.</p>

        <p>However, careful cytological analyses of embryos derived from deGradFP <italic>cid; cid-EGFP</italic> fathers indicated that development after fertilization is not normal. When in control experiments <italic>cid; cid-EGFP</italic> males without deGradFP were crossed to <italic>cid; cid-EGFP</italic> females, we observed normal progeny development with centromeric Cid-EGFP signals in both chromosome sets within all of the analyzed gonomeric metaphase plates of mitosis 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g003">Figure 3a</xref>; <italic>n</italic> = 10), as expected. However, when deGradFP was active in the <italic>cid; cid-EGFP</italic> males that were crossed to <italic>cid; cid-EGFP</italic> females, one of the two chromosome sets within all of the analyzed gonomeric metaphase plates of mitosis 1 did not display centromeric Cid-EGFP signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g003">Figure 3a</xref>; <italic>n</italic> = 9). This indicates that paternal centromeres cannot acquire maternally derived Cid-EGFP after degradation of Cid-EGFP during spermatogenesis. Mitotic figures in anaphase and telophase of mitosis 1 indicated that Cid-EGFP-free paternal chromosomes did not attach normally to the mitotic spindle. Only the Cid-EGFP containing chromatids were oriented towards the spindle poles in all of the analyzed late mitosis 1 figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g003">Figure 3a</xref>; <italic>n</italic> = 11).

        <p>Gynogenetic haploid embryos obtained from various mutant genotypes (<italic>mh</italic>, <italic>ms(3)K81</italic>, <italic>Hira</italic>) all progress through 14 instead of the normal 13 syncytial blastoderm cycles before cellularization, and they eventually arrest late in embryogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Edgar1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Loppin3">[34]</xref>. The progeny from <italic>cid; cid-EGFP</italic> fathers with deGradFP expressed these traits as well. First, none of the progeny obtained from these fathers reached the larval stages. We point out that expression of the GFP-specific recombinant ubiquitin ligase (NSlmb-vhhGFP4) with the <italic>topi-GAL4-VP16</italic> driver did not affect male fertility when <italic>cid</italic> function was provided by the endogenous wild-type <italic>cid</italic> gene instead of the <italic>cid-EGFP</italic> transgene. The sterility of <italic>cid; cid-EGFP</italic> fathers with deGradFP therefore does not reflect a Cid-EGFP independent deGradFP effect. Second, compared to progeny derived from wild-type or <italic>cid; cid-EGFP</italic> fathers without deGradFP, the nuclear density during cellularization was 2-fold higher in embryos obtained from <italic>cid; cid-EGFP</italic> fathers with deGradFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001434.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Counting the number of Cid-EGFP dots during mitosis revealed only four pairs of sister centromeres in the large majority (&gt;90%) of the syncytial blastoderm embryos obtained from a cross of <italic>cid; cid-EGFP</italic> males with deGradFP during spermatogenesis and <italic>cid; cid-EGFP</italic> females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g003">Figure 3b</xref>). In contrast, the expected eight pairs of sister centromeres characteristic for the normal diploid karyotype were detected with control fathers lacking deGradFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g003">Figure 3b</xref>).</p>
        <p>Centromere counting revealed that a minority (&lt;10%) of progeny from <italic>cid; cid-EGFP</italic> fathers with deGradFP contained nuclei with five pairs of sister centromeres with comparable amounts of Cid-EGFP. Such nuclei were often in patches next to regions with nuclei containing four pairs of sister centromeres. Similarly, a minority of embryos fertilized with Cid-depleted sperm displayed a mosaic of nuclear densities during cellularization with patches of wild-type next to patches with 2-fold higher density (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001434.s001">Figure S1</xref>), as characteristically observed in near-haploid embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Lu1">[35]</xref>. While it is not excluded that these near-haploid embryos reflect occasional neocentromere formation or postzygotic centromere restoration by maternal Cid, we favor alternative explanations as discussed below.</p>

        <title>Developmental Regulation of Cid Centromere Loading During Spermatogenesis and Early Embryogenesis</title>
        <p>Our analysis of the consequences of Cid-EGFP degradation during spermatogenesis demonstrates that the paternally contributed Cid protein on centromeres of paternal chromosomes is required for normal function of these centromeres. Evidently, the maternally derived Cid supplies present in early embryos cannot be used for restoration of centromere function on paternal chromosomes contributed by Cid-depleted sperm, at least in the great majority of cases. This finding argues against efficient homeostatic compensation of centromeric Cid losses and supports template-governed regulation where Cid recruitment is strictly dependent on already present centromeric Cid. Therefore, the amount of old Cid nucleosomes partitioned onto the two sister chromatids during chromosome replication might determine the loading of a precisely equivalent amount of new Cid into the centromere during cell cycle progression.</p>
        <p>Cid recruitment into the centromere occurs during exit from M phase according to our earlier analyses of the syncytial blastoderm cycles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Schuh1">[36]</xref>. As meiosis includes progression through two consecutive M phases without an intervening S phase, meiotic Cid loading attracted our attention. If new Cid was loaded during both meiotic M phases in amounts precisely equal to the already present centromeric Cid protein, an increase of centromeric Cid levels with each generation had to occur unless compensated by periodic reduction.</p>
        <p>To analyse meiotic Cid loading, we quantified centromeric EGFP signals during spermatogenesis in <italic>cid; cid-EGFP</italic> males. Interestingly, this did not reveal any net Cid loading during exit from MI and MII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g001">Figure 1c</xref>), suggesting the possibility of compensatory loading during other developmental stages. Indeed, analysis of early spermatocytes revealed net centromeric Cid loading between stage S1 and S4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g004">Figure 4a</xref>)—that is, during G2 well after the premeiotic S phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Cenci1">[25]</xref>.

Cal1-EGFP expressed from a transgene under control of the normal <italic>cal1</italic> cis-regulatory region in a <italic>cal1</italic> null mutant background was detected at centromeres of spermatocytes between S1 and S3 but not during progression through the meiotic divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g004">Figures 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001434.s002">S2</xref> and unpublished data). Moreover, Cal1 depletion in early spermatocytes by RNAi abolished the increase in Cid-EGFP levels that normally occurred between S1 and S4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g004">Figure 4c</xref>), supporting our conclusion that this Cid-EGFP increase in centromeres of early spermatocytes represents compensatory Cid loading during G2.</p>

        <p>Apart from Cid loading during spermatogenesis, we also analyzed the initial phase of embryogenesis when sperm nucleus remodeling occurs concomitant with completion of female meiosis. Given that Cenp-C was found to be no longer present on centromeres of mature sperm (see above) and given that this centromere protein provides an essential link between Cid and outer kinetochore components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Schittenhelm2">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Przewloka1">[39]</xref>, loading of maternally derived Cenp-C onto paternal centromeres during the first cell cycle following fertilization was expected.

Indeed, maternally derived Cenp-C-EGFP was observed to associate very soon after fertilization with the sperm nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g005">Figure 5a,b</xref>). Cenp-C-EGFP spots were already observed in sperm nuclei that had not yet attained a regular round shape. Cenp-C-EGFP spots were also present in the paternal pronucleus during S phase and pronuclear apposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g005">Figure 5c</xref>).

        </fig>
        <p>In contrast to Cenp-C, paternal Cid is still present in mature sperm and remains stably associated with paternal centromeres after fertilization, as shown above. Therefore, rapid association of maternally derived Cid before mitosis 1 as in the case of Cenp-C was not necessarily expected. However, in analogous analyses with progeny obtained from <italic>cid; cid-EGFP</italic> mothers and wild-type fathers, such early association of Cid-EGFP was clearly observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g005">Figure 5f–j</xref>). In contrast to the Cenp-C-EGFP experiments, where signal intensities during metaphase 1 were comparable on maternal and paternal centromeres, this was not the case in the Cid-EGFP experiments. Cid-EGFP signal intensities were clearly weaker in paternal compared to maternal centromeres. While both maternal and paternal centromeres contain exclusively the EGFP-tagged version in the Cenp-C experiments, this is only true for the maternal centromeres in case of the Cid experiments, where the paternal centromeres also contain unlabeled wild-type Cid inherited from the father apart from newly loaded maternally derived Cid-EGFP. We conclude that in addition to the net loading of Cid in G2 spermatocytes described above, the rapid association of maternally derived Cid onto paternal centromeres soon after fertilization might provide additional compensation for the absence of Cid loading during the male meiotic divisions. However, we point out that precise quantification of total centromeric Cid-EGFP levels in early embryos is precluded by various factors (like sample thickness, high and variable autofluorescence levels). Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that the rapid association of maternal Cid-EGFP with paternal centromeres might be balanced by loss of paternal Cid in early embryos. Similarly, we cannot exclude the occurrence of dynamic Cid-EGFP turnover at centromeres during the stages of spermatogenesis where we have not detected any net loading.</p>

        <title>Chromosome-Specific Levels of Centromeric Cid and Kinetochore Proteins</title>
        <p>By a more detailed quantification of Cid levels during spermatogenesis we addressed yet another aspect of the control of centromeric Cid levels—that is, chromosome-specific variation. Drosophila testis provides a unique advantage for the analysis of chromosome-specific variation of centromeric Cid because of the characteristic segregation of chromosome bivalents into discrete subnuclear territories in late spermatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Cenci1">[25]</xref>. In principle, an observation of reproducible chromosome-specific differences in centromeric Cid amounts would argue in favor of template-governed control of centromeric Cid levels. Such control would readily propagate distinct chromosome-specific amounts of centromeric Cid. In contrast, homeostatic mechanisms might be expected to equalize occasional fluctuations and keep a uniform level of Cid in all of the centromeres. Therefore, to evaluate whether centromeric Cid amounts vary on different chromosomes, we quantified EGFP signals in individual centromeres of S5/6 spermatocytes in <italic>cid; cid-EGFP</italic> testis preparations. At the S5/6 stage, DNA staining revealed the three characteristic chromosome territories within the large spermatocyte nucleus. Two of these territories represent the bivalents of chromosome 2 and 3, respectively. Their DNA labeling is more homogenous than that of the third territory, which is formed by an association of the bivalent of chromosome 4 with the X chromosome and those parts of the Y that are not involved in Y loop formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Cenci1">[25]</xref>. The territories with the bivalents of chromosome 2 and 3 both contained two Cid-EGFP spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g006">Figure 6a</xref>).

(e) Spreads of mitotic chromosomes were prepared from syncytial blastoderm embryos expressing Cid-EGFP, Cenp-C-EGFP, or Spc25-EGFP and stained for DNA. As illustrated by the image panels, individual chromosomes could be identified based on chromosome size, pattern of intensely staining heterochromatin blocks, and centromere position.

        <p>The characteristic unequal intensity of the two Cid-EGFP spots within the X-Y chromosome territory suggested that either the X or the Y centromere is associated with higher levels of centromeric Cid. To clarify this issue we crossed <italic>cid-EGFP</italic> into X/0 males. Apart from the paired centromeres of chromosome 4, the X/0 spermatocytes no longer contained a second bright Cid-EGFP spot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g006">Figure 6b</xref>), as characteristically present in normal X/Y spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g006">Figure 6a</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that the Y centromere contains more Cid than all the other centromeres. A quantification of the Cid-EGFP signals on the different chromosomes revealed that the Y centromere contains ∼2-fold more Cid than the other centromeres. Analyses with Y chromosomes introgressed from different Drosophila strains into the <italic>cid; cid-EGFP</italic> background indicated that the increased Cid levels on the Y centromere are not strain-specific (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001434.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
        <p>Analogous quantification of Cenp-C revealed that the level of this centromere protein was also ∼2-fold higher on the Y centromere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g006">Figure 6c</xref>). To evaluate whether the ∼2-fold higher levels of the centromere proteins Cid and Cenp-C on the Y centromere were accompanied by a corresponding increase in kinetochore components, we analyzed Spc25-EGFP signals. Spc25 is a component of the Ndc80 complex, which represents the major microtubule binding site of the kinetochore. Before the onset of the meiotic divisions, we did not detect dot-like Spc25-EGFP signals. However, during prometaphase of meiosis I, spermatocytes often displayed eight distinct Spc25-EGFP signals, as expected. In such prometaphase I figures, one of the eight signals was always considerably stronger than all the others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g006">Figure 6d</xref>). In contrast, in X/0 testis, prometaphase I figures with seven distinct Spc25-EGFP signals did not include such a conspicuously stronger signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g006">Figure 6d</xref>), suggesting that the especially strong Spc25-EGFP signals in X/Y testis represent the Y kinetochore. As predicted by this interpretation, prometaphase II figures in X/Y testis with 4 Spc25-EGFP signals could readily be grouped into two classes: a first class with a conspicuously strong signal, and a second class without such an intensity outlier. In all likelihood, these two classes represent early spermatids that had inherited the Y and the X chromosome, respectively, in the preceding meiosis I. Finally, a quantification of kinetochore signal intensities in mitotic chromosomes released from early syncytial embryos provided a further confirmation that the Y centromere has higher levels of Cid, Cenp-C, and Spc25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g006">Figure 6e</xref>). Thus, the increased levels of centromere and kinetochore proteins on the Y centromere are not a peculiarity of the spermatocyte stages. Moreover, these observations argue against the existence of efficient homeostatic mechanisms that enforce identical Cid amounts on all the different centromeres.</p>

        <title>Transgenerational Propagation of Altered Centromeric Cid Levels in Sperm</title>
        <p>For a direct evaluation of the role of centromeric Cid for quantitative maintenance, we generated sperm with either moderately increased or decreased levels of Cid on centromeres and analyzed whether the altered centromeric levels were maintained during development of the next generation.</p>

Therefore, the accurately quantifiable Cid-EGFP was the only Cid species produced.

Quantification revealed almost 7-fold higher Cid-EGFP levels after overexpression. Judging from the number and size of the observed Cid-EGFP spots, Cid-EGFP was still primarily confined to the centromeric region.</p>

        <p>Males with “high Cid-EGFP” sperm as well as control males lacking the UAS transgenes were crossed with <italic>cid; cid-EGFP</italic>; <italic>Cenp-C-Tomato</italic> females and progeny was aged to the syncytial blastoderm stage before fixation and quantification of centromeric Cid-EGFP signals in prometa- and metaphase embryos. The total centromeric Cid-EGFP intensity per nucleus was found to be ∼1.7-fold higher in embryos generated with high Cid-EGFP sperm compared to embryos generated with control sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g007">Figure 7b</xref>). Centromeric Cenp-C-Tomato was increased to a comparable extent (unpublished data). Considering that only one half of the centromeres in the embryo are of paternal origin, we conclude that the increased Cid-EGFP levels on paternal centromeres appear to be maintained during progression through the early embryonic cell cycles, although not quantitatively. The level of Cid-EGFP during embryogenesis might not be sufficiently high to support a complete maintenance of the paternally increased centromeric Cid-EGFP levels during postzygotic development. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> from an analysis of the effects of the zygotic <italic>cid-EGFP</italic> gene dose on centromeric Cid-EGFP levels in wing imaginal disc cells of third instar wandering stage larvae and in spermatocytes of adult males supported the notion that the expression level governed by the normal <italic>cid</italic> regulatory region is not much higher than what is required for maintenance of physiological centromeric Cid levels. In the absence of endogenous Cid, cells with only one <italic>cid-EGFP</italic> copy were observed to display centromeric signals that were 40% weaker than those in cells with two <italic>cid-EGFP</italic> copies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001434.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>
        <p>As limiting <italic>cid</italic> expression might have prevented complete maintenance of increased Cid levels on paternal centromeres, we also analyzed whether decreased Cid levels on paternal centromeres in sperm are maintained during development of the next generation. Transgenic RNAi allowed a partial Cid depletion during spermatogenesis. Targeted depletion using <italic>bam-GAL4-VP16</italic> in combination with a <italic>UAS-cid<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> transgene was achieved in a <italic>cid; cid-EGFP</italic> background lacking untagged wild-type Cid. Quantification of centromeric signals in sperm indicated that RNAi resulted in a reduction of Cid-EGFP to about 33% of its level in controls lacking the <italic>UAS-cid<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g007">Figure 7c</xref>). In a second independent experiment, a somewhat lower reduction to about 50% was obtained, and the centromeres of X, Y, and autosomes were found to be affected to a comparable degree (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001434.s005">Figure S5a</xref>,b). Males producing low Cid-EGFP sperm and control males were crossed with <italic>cid; cid-EGFP</italic>; <italic>Cenp-C-Tomato</italic> females, and centromeric Cid-EGFP levels in progeny were determined at the syncytial blastoderm stage. The total centromeric Cid-EGFP intensity per nucleus in the embryos derived from low Cid-EGFP sperm was found to be ∼72% of the intensity observed in the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g007">Figure 7d</xref>). Considering that only one half of the centromeres are of paternal origin, the reduced Cid-EGFP levels on paternal centromeres appeared to have been quantitatively maintained during progression through the early embryonic cell cycles.</p>
        <p>To evaluate whether the reduced Cid-EGFP levels were also maintained during subsequent development, we analyzed wing imaginal discs from third instar wandering stage larvae. These measurements revealed that the reduced Cid-EGFP levels were indeed maintained beyond embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g007">Figures 7e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001434.s005">S5c</xref>,d). Finally, we measured centromeric Cid-EGFP levels in sperm of adult male progeny. As in embryos and imaginal discs, only ∼71% of the control levels were observed in sperm of males fathered by Cid-depleted sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g007">Figure 7f</xref>).</p>
        <p>Since chromosome territory formation in spermatocytes is accompanied by conversion of chromocenter-associated centromere clusters into well-separated centromeres, we were able to quantify Cid-EGFP levels in individual centromeres in this special cell type. Because the X and Y chromosomes are of maternal and paternal origin, respectively, only the Y but not the X centromere is expected to have reduced centromeric Cid-EGFP, if the reduction reflects propagation on paternal centromeres after Cid depletion during spermatogenesis in the father. Indeed reduction of Cid-EGFP in paternal sperm was found to result in a significant decrease of Cid-EGFP in the Y but not in the X centromere in two independent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g007">Figure 7g</xref>, and unpublished data).</p>
        <p>In case of chromosome 2 and 3 territories, parental origin could not be assigned to the two signals within a territory. Under the assumption that in control spermatocytes Cid amounts in maternally and paternally derived centromeres of chromosome 2 and 3 are usually equal on average, the results obtained after quantification of centromeric Cid-EGFP signal intensities in major autosome territories were not in accord with the findings concerning the X and Y centromeres. Under this assumption it is expected that the intensity difference between the stronger and weaker centromere signal within a major autosome territory should be greater after reduction in sperm and subsequent propagation of reduced Cid on paternal centromeres in comparison to control spermatocytes. However, the average intensity difference between the two signals of a major autosome territory was not increased after reduction of Cid-EGFP in paternal sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g007">Figure 7g</xref>). In principle, this result might argue for chromosome-specific differences in the control of centromeric Cid levels on sex chromosomes and autosomes. However, this apparent support for chromosome-specific discrepancies is completely abolished under the following alternative assumption. If centromeric Cid levels in control spermatocytes on average are usually higher on paternal compared to maternal centromeres, our results are clearly consistent with quantitative propagation of centromeric Cid not only on the Y but on all paternal centromeres. According to this alternative assumption, the stronger of the two signals in each major autosome territory within control spermatocytes in general corresponds to the paternal and the weaker to the maternal centromere. After reduction in sperm and subsequent propagation of reduced centromeric Cid, only the paternal (i.e., the stronger) but not the maternal (i.e., the weaker) centromere signals should be decreased. This expectation is borne out by our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g007">Figure 7g</xref>). While statistical analyses did not favor one over the other assumption, we propose that our other findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g006">6</xref>) provide support for the second assumption, as discussed below.</p>
        <p>Our comparison of spermatocytes in males with either two or only one Cid-EGFP gene copies also corroborated the second interpretation. After reduction of the zygotic Cid-EGFP gene dose, centromeric Cid-EGFP was no longer decreased exclusively on the Y centromere (as after centromeric Cid-EGFP reduction in paternal sperm), but equally on both sex chromosomes, and also on all autosomal centromeres (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001434.s004">Figure S4C</xref>).</p>
        <p>Based on our analysis of the consequences after reduction of centromeric Cid in sperm, we conclude that centromeric Cid-EGFP is not replenished to normal levels during development of progeny, at least in case of the Y centromere and presumably also on all other centromeres.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Among the known Drosophila centromere proteins (Cid, Cenp-C, Cal1), only Cid survives the excessive chromatin remodeling that accompanies the compaction of the haploid genome into sperm heads. We demonstrate that this centromeric Cid in sperm is essential for the propagation of the paternal genome in the next generation. When normal oocytes are fertilized with sperm lacking centromeric Cid, paternal chromosomes fail to recruit the maternally provided Cid and cannot generate functional kinetochores during mitosis 1. As a result, gynogenetic haploid embryos develop. These findings demonstrate that a minimal amount of pre-existing centromeric Cid is required for centromere propagation during cell cycle progression. Moreover, by partial depletion of centromeric Cid in sperm, in combination with precise quantification, we establish that pre-existing centromeric Cid not only functions as a permissive factor but actually exerts quantitative control over centromeric Cid maintenance during cell proliferation. Reduced centromeric Cid levels in sperm are maintained throughout development of the next generation. They are not restored to the normal amount.</p>
      <p>The presence of CenH3 in sperm has previously been demonstrated in mammals and Xenopus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Palmer1">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Milks1">[45]</xref>. Similarly, the absence of Cenp-C in sperm has been observed in Xenopus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Milks1">[45]</xref>. A future analysis of the mechanism that selectively maintains all or at least a substantial amount of centromeric CenH3 during the radical chromatin re-organization that accompanies genome compaction into sperm heads will be of interest. The fact that CenH3 nucleosomes are not exchanged for protamines, in contrast to bulk nucleosomes, is crucial, at least in case of Drosophila sperm where centromeric Cid is an essential component of an epigenetic centromere mark for paternal chromosome maintenance in progeny. The demonstration that Cid is indispensible for epigenetic centromere marking in sperm may appear trivial in the light of the clear evidence that Cid is required and sufficient for centromere maintenance during mitotic proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Mendiburo1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Blower2">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Blower3">[22]</xref>. However, recent findings in <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Monen1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Gassmann1">[12]</xref> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Ingouff1">[13]</xref> have indicated that functional gametes do not necessarily require centromeric CenH3.</p>
      <p>While the large majority of progeny generated after Cid elimination in sperm are gynogenetic haploid embryos, a fraction appears to have an extra chromosome with normal centromeric Cid levels. We cannot rule out that these near-haploid embryos represent cases where normal Cid amounts have been restored postzygotically on a particular paternal chromosome at the original centromere or at an ectopic location. The successful production of human artificial chromosomes (HACs), for example, is a clear case for de novo CenH3 acquisition and subsequent maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Harrington1">[20]</xref>. While the alpha-satellite arrays used in HAC production are completely CenH3-free before transfection, the centromeres in Cid-depleted sperm might have residual Cid below the level of detection in our experiments. A partial Cid depletion might also explain the apparently normal chromosome segregation during the two meiotic divisions. These meiotic divisions reduce Cid intensity per spot by a factor of at least four (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g001">Figure 1c</xref>) and thereby in our deGradFP experiments perhaps below our detection limit. Alternatively, it is not excluded that Cid depletion continues after the meiotic divisions in these deGradFP experiments. However, even if the near-haploid embryos were to result from postzygotic restoration after partial or complete Cid elimination in sperm, such centromere restorations would be rare exceptions and not the rule. Since postzygotic replenishment is not even effective after far more moderate Cid reduction in sperm by RNAi, we consider centromere restoration to be an unlikely explanation for the observed near-haploid embryos. Perhaps these embryos arise after missegregation of maternal chromosomes during the first embryonic mitoses because occasionally the lagging paternal chromosomes might affect the function of the gonomeric spindle. Consistent with this interpretation, embryos fathered by Cid-EGFP-depleted sperm often displayed a reduced and irregular nuclear density during the syncytial stages within the anterior region where fertilization occurs (33% versus 5% in controls). Similarly, polar body morphology in this anterior region was also often abnormal (64% versus 20% in controls). It appears therefore that the lagging paternal chromosomes somehow cause local cell cycle defects in a considerable fraction of the progeny.</p>
      <p>The fact that centromeric Cid, after moderate reduction in sperm to 33%–50% of its normal level, is not restored back to normal during development of progeny with normal levels of maternal and zygotic <italic>cid</italic> expression demonstrates that the pre-existing level of centromeric Cid is a major determinant for quantitative control over centromeric Cid levels during cell cycle progression. Some restoration occurs within one generation according to our data, and Cid on the Y centromere no longer seems to be significantly reduced in spermatocytes of grandsons and great-grandsons of fathers with Cid-depleted sperm (N.R. and C.F.L., preliminary observations). However, it is clear that the efficiency of this restoration is poor. Starting from sperm, generation of F1 spermatocytes requires more than 2 wk of development, including progression through about 20 or more cell cycles. This is insufficient to replenish centromeric Cid to the normal level. Thus our data clearly support the idea that the Cid nucleosomes, which remain after random partitioning of pre-existing centromeric Cid nucleosomes onto the two sister chromatids during chromosome replication, instruct the local loading of an equivalent amount of new CenH3 nucleosomes during each cell cycle. Accordingly, centromeric Cid nucleosomes might be licensed for loading in a first cell cycle period, followed by actual loading and concomitant license consumption during a later cell cycle period. Overproduction of Cid and its loading factor Cal1 might by-pass the license requirement. Thus, the proposed quantitative dependence of Cid loading on pre-existing amounts is not necessarily incompatible with our finding that a centromeric Cid increase can be induced.</p>
      <p>Apart from the fact that pre-existing centromeric Cid is critical for quantitative regulation, our overexpression experiments and the effects of <italic>cid-GFP</italic> transgene dose indicate that the level of <italic>cid</italic> expression is also a critical factor. We demonstrate that a single copy of this transgene under control of the <italic>cid</italic> cis-regulatory region (in a <italic>cid</italic> mutant background with Cid-EGFP as the only Cid source) is not sufficient for maintenance of centromeric Cid-EGFP at the level established in the presence of two copies. Therefore, the normal level of <italic>cid</italic> expression does not seem to be in great excess over what is required for centromere maintenance.</p>
      <p>Our previous analyses have clearly revealed cell-cycle-dependent control of centromeric Cid deposition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Schittenhelm1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Schuh1">[36]</xref>. In syncytial Drosophila embryos, Cid loading occurs during and depends on exit from mitosis. Studies in vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Jansen1">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Moree1">[49]</xref> have similarly suggested that Cid loading in animal cells might generally depend on exit from M phase and that it occurs early in the cell cycle. However, here we demonstrate that cell-cycle coupling of Cid loading is subject to developmental control. Exit from M phase during the meiotic divisions in testis is not accompanied by Cid loading and expression of the loading factor Cal1. Instead, we observe Cal1-dependent loading during G2 before the onset of the meiotic divisions. Similarly, recent data have suggested that Cid loading in cultured Drosophila cells occurs already during metaphase (i.e., before exit from M phase) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Mellone1">[50]</xref>. Moreover, observations from plant and fungal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Lermontova1">[51]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Dunleavy1">[53]</xref> have also indicated that the control of CenH3 loading during eukaryotic cell cycle progression is not governed by an invariant universal mechanism. Although presently precluded by background problems, a precise quantitative understanding of Cid loading throughout female gametogenesis would be of great interest.</p>
      <p>The quantitative control of centromeric Cid during male and female gametogenesis might not be precisely identical and subtly subvert the quantitative control exerted by pre-existing Cid. Our quantification of centromeric Cid on Y, X, and autosomes is clearly consistent with the notion that centromeres are somewhat overloaded during passage through the male germline. This might explain the fact that the Y centromere, which is transmitted exclusively through the male germline, has about 2-fold higher levels of centromeric Cid. Moreover, the X centromere, which is transmitted more frequently through the female germline than any other centromere, seems to have the lowest amount of centromeric Cid. A possible reason for the postulated sex-specific difference in Cid loading might be linked to the fact that paternal centromeres experience exit from meiotic M phase not only in the testis but also again in the egg after fertilization during completion of female meiosis. Indeed we find that maternal Cid associates with paternal centromeres very early after fertilization during completion of the meiotic divisions of the oocyte. Importantly, mathematical analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001434.s006">Text S1</xref>) demonstrates that if the extent of over- and underloading are equal in the male and female germline, respectively, then a stable difference between Cid levels on paternal and maternal autosomal centromeres is reached within only two generations. Such a difference is also required for compatibility of our quantitative measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g007">Figure 7g</xref>) with the parsimonious interpretation that centromeric Cid levels on autosomes (where we cannot assign parental origin) behave in the same way as revealed by our results concerning X and Y (where parental origin is known). Our mathematical analysis also implies that overloading in the male germline will result in a continuous increase of Y-centromeric Cid in the absence of counterbalancing mechanisms. In the case of the Y chromosome, Cid underloading in the female germline will of course not act as a counterbalancing process, but we speculate that the observed limited level of Cid expression might be involved. In addition, the Drosophila Y centromere contains unique telomere-related satellite repeats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-MendezLago1">[54]</xref> that may have chromosome-specific effects. Even though centromeres in animals are specified primarily in an epigenetic manner, centromeric and pericentromeric DNA sequences are unlikely to be irrelevant and they have been implicated in meiotic drive and speciation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Malik1">[55]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Some aspects of centromere control that we have defined in Drosophila are presumably not valid or of minor importance in case of humans. In contrast to Drosophila, the Y centromere in human cell lines appears to have the lowest level of centromeric Cenp-A, while the X has average amounts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Irvine1">[56]</xref>. Cenp-A levels on a given chromosome might vary considerably within the human population and appear to correlate with the size of the alpha-satellite region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Sullivan2">[57]</xref>.</p>
      <p>While our experiments concur with the notion that limited variation in the level of centromeric Cid is not necessarily detrimental, we also demonstrate that the variation of centromeric Cid on different chromosomes correlates with the amount of recruited kinetochore proteins, as previously found in some <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Burrack2">[58]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Castillo1">[59]</xref> but not all experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Joglekar1">[60]</xref> with fungi.

        <p>For the preparation of mitotic chromosome spreads, eggs were collected for 1 h and aged for an additional hour. Embryos were dechorionated in 1.4% sodium hypochlorite and extensively rinsed with deionized water. After transfer into an Eppendorf tube containing a 1∶1 mixture of heptane and Schneider’s tissue culture medium with 10 µM demecolcine (Sigma D7385), embryos were incubated on a rotating wheel. In case of the analysis of Cenp-EGFP and Spc25-EGFP, the incubation in demeocolcine was omitted. After 30 min, embryos were transferred to 75 mM KCl in a depression slide and incubated for 10 min. Embryos were then transferred into a 5 µl drop of polyamine buffer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Cram1">[71]</xref> on a glass slide and torn apart using fine tungsten needles. A drop of 5 µl of 4% formaldehyde in PBS was added. After addition of a coverslip, the sample was inverted onto a filter paper and squashed for a few seconds to spread the embryos. After a 5-min incubation, the sample was frozen in liquid nitrogen. After flipping away the coverslip, the slide was immediately placed into chilled 100% ethanol and incubated for 10 min at −20°C. Excess ethanol was removed by tapping the slide onto a paper towel. After washing the sample area with PBS for 5 min, DNA staining was performed with 0.5 µg/ml Hoechst 33258 in PBS for 10 min. After a 5-min wash in PBS, the sample was mounted under a coverslip in 70% glycerol, 1% n-propyl gallate, and 0.05% p-phenylenediamine.</p>

Briefly, embryos were dechorionated in bleach, fixed in methanol, and rehydrated in 1× PBS, 0.15% Triton X-100. Embryos were then incubated overnight in the same buffer with rabbit anti-GFP antibody (Invitrogen) at a 1∶200 dilution. They were then washed three times in 1× PBS, 0.15% Triton X-100, and incubated overnight in secondary antibody (AlexaFluor 488 goat anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes) at 1∶1,000). After an incubation step in a RNAse A solution (2 mg/ml in PBS) for 1 h at 37°C, embryos were mounted in a mounting medium (DAKO) containing propidium iodide (5 µg/ml) to stain DNA. Male and female pronuclei at the pronuclear apposition stage and during the first prometaphase were identified based on their position. As previously revealed by immunolabeling using an antibody against actetylated histone H4, a histone mark that is enriched in paternal chromatin, the female pronucleus (or the maternal set of chromosomes) is known to be systematically oriented toward the polar bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Bonnefoy1">[27]</xref>. Accordingly, the first pronucleus encountered along the virtual line from polar bodies to the apposed pronuclei was considered to be the female pronucleus.</p>

        <title>Microscopy and Image Analysis</title>
        <p>Quantification of EGFP signals on centromeres and kinetochores was performed after acquiring stacks (20–28 sections, 250 nm spacing) from squashed testis preparations using a 63×/1.4 oil immersion objective on a Zeiss Cell Observer HS microscope. Stacks were converted into maximum projections using ImageJ. Signal quantification was performed essentially as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001434-Schittenhelm1">[9]</xref> with the following modifications. For quantification of centromeric signal intensities during spermatogenesis, all centromeric signals within a cell were surrounded with the free hand tool followed by measurement of area (A<sub>s</sub>) and integrated pixel intensity (I<sub>s</sub>) of the selected regions. For subtraction of diffuse signals (background and GFP signals from any noncentromeric pools), the selected region was slightly enlarged yielding A<sub>l</sub> and I<sub>l</sub>. Total centromeric signal intensity per cell was then calculated as I<sub>s</sub>−[A<sub>s</sub>×(I<sub>l</sub>−I<sub>s</sub>)/(A<sub>l</sub>−A<sub>s</sub>)]. An analogous subtraction of diffuse signals was performed for quantification of intensities of individual centromeres in spermatocytes where each centromeric spot was surrounded individually. The characteristics of the DNA staining pattern during the S5 spermatocytes stage provided the basis for an assignment of Cid-EGFP signals to different chromosomes. While the centromeres of the two chromosome 4 homologs in the large majority of all S5 spermatocytes analyzed are paired into a single Cid-EGFP spot next to a strongly staining DNA dot, each homolog of all the other chromosomes usually displays a single Cid-EGFP dot. The X centromere Cid-EGFP signal is usually also close to a region of intense DNA labeling, which however is more irregular in shape and not as intense as in case of chromosome 4. In contrast, the Y centromere is very rarely associated with a region of intense DNA staining presumably as a result of the Y loops present during the S5 stage. Finally, the territories of chromosome 2 and 3 display a far more homogenous DNA staining than the regions with chromosomes X, Y, and 4. We would like to point out that quantification of centromeric signals obtained after immunofluorescent labeling with anti-Cid, anti-Cenp-C, or anti-GFP resulted in far more noisy data. Moreover, comparison of GFP fluorescence signals and immunofluorescent signals after double labeling of cells expressing only Cid-EGFP or Cenp-C-EGFP with antibodies recognizing these GFP fusions indicated that immunofluorescent signal variability is likely to be caused by problems with antibody accessibility that at least in part also reflect the kinetochore attachment status. Accurate centromere signal quantification in combination with DNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for chromosome identification was therefore not an option, also because GFP fluorescence does not survive the FISH procedure.</p>
        <p>In case of the analyses in syncytial blastoderm embryos, stack size was 16 focal planes with 250 nm spacing, in case of wing discs, 20 focal planes with 250 nm spacing. For all quantitative analyses of EGFP signal intensities, data were acquired from at least three different slides. The data displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001434-g007">Figure 7b,d</xref> are from embryos in prometaphase or metaphase of mitosis 11 and 12. As we did not observe significant intensity differences between mitosis 11 and 12, values were pooled for preparation of the s.</p>
