Here, we investigate the effects of ligand binding and chain connectivity on network communication in DHFR. We carry out systematic network analysis and molecular dynamics simulations of the native DHFR and 19 of its circularly permuted variants by breaking the chain connections in ten folding element regions and in nine nonfolding element regions as observed by experiment. Our studies suggest that chain cleavage in folding element areas may deactivate DHFR due to large perturbations in the network properties near the active site. The protein active site is near or coincides with residues through which the shortest paths in the residue interaction network tend to go. Further, our network analysis reveals that ligand binding has “network-bridging effects” on the DHFR structure. Our results suggest that ligand binding leads to a modification, with most of the interaction networks now passing through the cofactor, shortening the average shortest path. Ligand binding at the active site has profound effects on the network centrality, especially the closeness.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>The cooperative movements within a protein concerning the binding and dissociation of the reactants and products could be important for protein function. Communication among the various parts of an enzyme can be achieved by the networks connecting amino acids through peptide backbone connections and nonbonded amino acid contact. We used dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), a clinically important enzyme, as an example to explore the effects of amino acid communication on protein functions. We found that the peptide chain itself is an efficient “telephone wire” to transfer the communications. Breaking the telephone wire (peptide chain) at different points leads to differentiated behavior near the enzyme active site. The important points to keep the peptide chain communication are coupled with the place where protein folding occurs. On the other hand, ligand binding to the enzyme active site provides a “short cut” to the communication networks, with most of the interaction networks now passing through the added ligand and shortening the average communication path. We considered the short cuts to be “network-bridging effects” in the protein structure. The enzyme active site is the place where the short cut has the most dramatic effect in modifying protein communication networks.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This project has been funded in whole or in part with Federal funds from the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health (NIH), under contract number NO1-CO-12400.

DHFR catalyzes the reduction of 7,8-dihydrofolate (DHF) to 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-folate (THF) using the reducing cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). DHFR is a clinically important enzyme and is the target of a number of antifolate drugs.</p><p>Experimental kinetic analysis of various DHFR permutants has identified several loop regions important for catalysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b002">2</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030117-g001">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the loop locations. The Met-20 loop (residues 10 to 23) directly controls the ligand binding to DHFR. The FG loop (residues 116 to 121) is behind the Met-20 loop. There is a network of hydrogen bonds connecting the Met-20 loop and the FG loop. The third GH loop (residues 142 to 149) is in contact with both the Met-20 and the FG loops. Based largely on the conformation of the Met-20 loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b003">3</xref>], the three states of the enzymatic reaction process (binding and release of cofactor, substrate, and product) can be defined using available crystal structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030117-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In the open state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030117-g001">Figure 1</xref>, green ribbon) the Met-20 loop is flipped away from the binding site. In the closed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030117-g001">Figure 1</xref>, blue), the Met-20 loop packs against the cofactor and seals the active site. In the occluded state, the Met-20 loop blocks the binding of the cofactor in the pocket. Simulations of the closed state also indicate changes in the other side of the binding pocket, in the helix region (residues 44 to 50), which binds the cofactor. Loop region 64–71, which contacts the helix, also presents large fluctuations.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030117-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030117.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Illustration and Superposition of the Three States of DHFR</title><p>Red indicates occluded; green, open; and blue, closed.

The communications among the various parts of the DHFR can be achieved by residue interaction networks and through peptide backbone chain connections and nonbonded residue interactions. Agarwal et al. carried out genomic analysis of sequence conservation, kinetic measurements of multiple mutations, and theoretical calculations, observing that nonbonded residue interactions in DHFR form a network of coupled motions that are important for enzyme catalysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b004">4</xref>].</p><p>The effect of the peptide backbone chain connection on the protein dynamics is more complex, since chain connection is coupled with protein folding. Circular permutations of DHFR provide insight into chain connectivity, stability of the fold, and function. Circular permutation of a protein consists of connecting the native N- and C-termini covalently with a peptide linker and cleaving the peptide backbone at another specific site. Iwakura et al. have performed systematic circular permutation of the entire DHFR protein to investigate essential folding elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b008">8</xref>]. Other groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b011">11</xref>] have also circularly permuted the protein, selectively focusing on several permutations or cutting the backbone connection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b011">11</xref>] to test fragment complementation. It was found that the peptide bonds in the protein could be grouped into two categories based on the effects of breaking the backbone connectivity. While cleavage of some peptide bonds results in less active variants or affects the enzyme function only slightly, suggesting that these make only minor contributions to the ability of the protein to fold, cleavage at certain other positions leads to a complete loss of the ability of the protein to fold. When such cleavage sites occurred sequentially in the primary sequence and formed a contiguous peptide segment, the region was named a “folding element,” which is crucial for a protein to be foldable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b008">8</xref>]. Folding elements distribute throughout the sequence. It was proposed that a complete set of folding elements is necessary for a protein to fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b005">5</xref>]. By conducting a systematic circular permutation analysis in which the original N- and C-termini of a protein are connected by an appropriate linker and new termini are created sequentially, ten folding elements have been identified in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> DHFR, each of which contains two to 14 residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b008">8</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030117-g002">Figure 2</xref>). It was also found that although the positions of the folding elements do not appear to correspond to the secondary structure motifs or to binding sites, almost all of the amino acid residues known to be involved in early folding events of DHFR are located within the folding elements, suggesting a close relationship between the folding elements of a protein and early folding events.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030117-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030117.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>A Drawing of the Tertiary Structure of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> DHFR Taken from the Protein Data Bank and the Locations of the Proposed Folding Elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b005">5</xref>]</title><p>Four α-helices and eight β-strands are shown as ribbons.

We first obtained average protein structures from MD simulations of the native DHFR and of the circularly permuted mutants. We investigated the relationship between small-world network behavior and chain connectivity using the crystal and MD average protein structures. Small-world network analysis of the protein structure uses graph theory to explore the bonded and nonbonded amino acid residue network. It was first used to identify key residues in protein folding, as these residues have high connectivity (betweenness) with respect to all possible network connections in the transition states of the protein structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b012">12</xref>]. The concept has been extended to the protein-folding process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b014">14</xref>], the protein–protein interface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b015">15</xref>], protein structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b016">16</xref>] and stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b017">17</xref>], protein dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b018">18</xref>], and key functional residues in enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b019">19</xref>]. By comparing the centrality of the residue interaction network, we found that ligand binding at the functional site has profound effects on the global network connections. Using the network connectivity index to distinguish between bonded and nonbonded connections, we found that breaking the chain connection in folding elements has a greater effect on active site loops than does breaking the chain in nonfolding regions. This leads us to conclude that the native sequence was selected to maximize the coupling between the protein fold and its functional dynamics. A folding–function interrelationship might particularly be the case for a fold like the DHFR, which currently has only been observed in the DHFR family, fulfilling a single function.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>MD Simulations of Native DHFR and Circular Permutation Variants</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>Conformational fluctuations of native DHFR and circular permutation variants.</title><p>We first investigated the overall structural change of the native (closed state) protein as observed in the MD simulations by computing the root mean square deviations (RMSDs) between the initial structure and snapshots along the trajectory.

This is also observed in the comparison of the RMSF for the folding and nonfolding element groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030117-g003">Fig 3</xref>C). While similar to the native DHFR, most of the large fluctuations occurred outside the folding element regions; in most cases, the RMSF values of the folding element group were smaller than the nonfolding element group. Again, the tightly packed environment of the folding elements stabilized the local region.</p><p>We did not observe unfolding in permutants with cuts in folded regions. Assuming that the experimental observations of enzymatic deactivations are caused by unfolding, there are two possibilities for our inability to capture the unfolding events. (1) None of the variants with cuts in folding elements is indeed able to fold into a native-like state. In such a case, our short 5-ns simulations of permutation variants in the folding elements are most likely trapped since we started the simulation with the native-like folded state. The additional 5-ns simulations are unable to change the scenario. (2) Some variants with cuts in the folding elements are still able to fold into native-like folds if helped by a chaperone, but without native enzymatic function due to effects on the active sites. It has been found that there is a close relationship between folding elements and the early folding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b005">5</xref>]. The systematic permutation experiments coupled folding and function, since a folding element was assigned to a continuous region when the cleavage abolished DHFR enzymatic function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b005">5</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that some permutation mutants, even with a folded native-like structure, may nevertheless lose function due to other reasons.</p><p>We stress that our simulations of the circularly permuted folding element group do not assess the folding ability of the systems with respect to either of the above two scenarios; rather, under the assumption that the permutants are able to fold, our simulations address effects of chain connection on the overall dynamics of protein. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030117-g003">Figure 3</xref>C, comparison of the overall structural fluctuations from the MD simulations illustrates that we are unable to distinguish between variants with cuts in folding or in nonfolding elements. In the next section, we compare the structural changes, focusing on loop movements.</p></sec><sec id="s2a2"><title>Comparison of three states of native DHFR and average structure of circular permutation variants.</title><p>Experimental kinetic analysis of various DHFR permutants has identified several loop regions important for catalysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b002">2</xref>], such as the Met-20 loop, the FG loop (residues 116 to 132), and the third GH loop (residues 142 to 149).</p><p>We systematically compared the structural variations for the three native states (i.e., the open, the occluded, and the closed), the average structure from the native (closed) state simulation, and the two average structures from the simulations of the circular permutation variants of the folding and nonfolding elements (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030117-t002">Table 2</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030117-g001">Figure 1</xref>, the difference between the three native states is in loop 10–23, with an average displacement of 1.7 Å between the closed and open states, 2.6 Å between the occluded and closed states, and 2.1 Å between the occluded and open states. The average structure from the simulation has a large deviation from the three crystal structures (the closed, open, and occluded states), and has an additional large change in loop 64–71 (average structure of wild-type DHFR [wild-ave]; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030117-t002">Table 2</xref>). Using the closed state as a reference, the group of permutation variants with cuts in folding elements has a slightly smaller structural variation than that of the nonfolding element cutting group. The average structures of Pmut-45 (permutant with a cut at residue 45; a folding element group cut) and Pmut-87 (a nonfolding cut) have very small variations from the closed state crystal structure. When we use the open state crystal structure as a reference, we observe that Pmut-137 from the folding group and Pmut-106 from the nonfolding group have the least structural variation. When we compare with the occluded structure, we see that all average structures for permutant variants obtained from the MD simulations have large deviations in the range of 3–4 Å in the loop 10–23 region. In summary, the loop conformations in the MD average structures are more similar to the open or closed states than to the occluded structure. Examination of the geometric features of the average structures does not show any noticeable difference among the average structures for the native state, the folding region, and the nonfolding region cutting groups.</p><table-wrap content-type="1col" id="pcbi-0030117-t002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030117.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Structural Variation of the MD Average Structures for the Native DHFR and Its Circular Permutation Variants</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030117.t002" xlink:type="simple"/><!-- <table frame="hsides" rules="none"><colgroup><col id="tb2col1" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb2col2" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb2col3" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb2col4" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb2col5" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb2col6" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb2col7" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left"><hr/>Structure</td><td><hr/>Variation</td><td><hr/>Loop 10&ndash;23</td><td><hr/>Helix 44&ndash;50</td><td><hr/>Loop 64&ndash;71</td><td><hr/>Loop 116&ndash;121</td><td><hr/>Loop 142&ndash;149</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><bold>Reference: Closed, PDB 1rx1</bold></td><td>Open</td><td>1.7</td><td>0.4</td><td>0.5</td><td>0.8</td><td>0.6</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Occluded</td><td>2.6</td><td>0.2</td><td>0.6</td><td>1.0</td><td>0.7</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Wild-ave</td><td>2.7</td><td>0.7</td><td>3.6</td><td>1.6</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Pmut-45</td><td>1.2</td><td>1.0</td><td>1.4</td><td>0.8</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Group of cutting in folding elements</td><td>1.9</td><td>1.4</td><td>2.8</td><td>1.3</td><td>1.1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Pmut-87</td><td>2.2</td><td>1.5</td><td>1.1</td><td>0.8</td><td>1.3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Group of cutting in nonfolding elements</td><td>2.3</td><td>1.2</td><td>2.1</td><td>1.1</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Reference: Open, PDB 1ra9</bold></td><td>Occluded</td><td>2.1</td><td>0.4</td><td>0.8</td><td>0.4</td><td>0.3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Wild-ave</td><td>3.6</td><td>0.9</td><td>3.7</td><td>1.9</td><td>1.3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Pmut-137</td><td>1.8</td><td>0.5</td><td>1.8</td><td>2.1</td><td>0.6</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Group of cutting in folding elements</td><td>2.8</td><td>1.6</td><td>2.9</td><td>1.6</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Pmut-106</td><td>1.6</td><td>0.9</td><td>2.4</td><td>0.7</td><td>0.7</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Group of cutting in nonfolding elements</td><td>2.9</td><td>1.4</td><td>1.8</td><td>1.3</td><td>1.4</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Reference: Occluded, PDB1rx5</bold></td><td>Wild-ave</td><td>4.1</td><td>0.7</td><td>4.0</td><td>1.9</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Pmut-110</td><td>3.4</td><td>0.4</td><td>1.4</td><td>0.9</td><td>1.1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Group of cutting in folding elements</td><td>3.3</td><td>1.4</td><td>2.9</td><td>1.6</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Pmut-106</td><td>2.4</td><td>0.7</td><td>1.8</td><td>0.8</td><td>0.6</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Group of cutting in nonfolding elements</td><td>3.5</td><td>1.2</td><td>2.2</td><td>1.4</td><td>1.4</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Reference: Wild-ave, averaged structure from MD simulation of wild-type</bold></td><td>Pmut-12</td><td>1.6</td><td>1.3</td><td>0.8</td><td>1.6</td><td>0.7</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Group of cutting in folding elements</td><td>2.1</td><td>1.4</td><td>3.2</td><td>1.6</td><td>0.8</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Pmut-21</td><td>2.7</td><td>0.4</td><td>0.8</td><td>1.7</td><td>0.8</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Group of cutting in nonfolding elements</td><td>2.0</td><td>1.3</td><td>3.3</td><td>1.6</td><td>0.8</td></tr></tbody></table> --><!-- <table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt201"><p>The average displacements (&Aring;) of the five regions are compared.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot> --></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Changes in the Residue Interaction Network of Native DHFR by Ligand Binding and Circular Permutations</title><sec id="s2b1"><title>Cofactor binding and its network-bridging effects.</title><p>Network analysis of protein structures has shown that residues with high closeness values are likely to be functionally important, interacting directly with or close to the binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b019">19</xref>]. Closeness centrality correlates more accurately with critical residues than betweenness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b020">20</xref>]. The above studies imply that the protein active site is near or coincides with residues through which the shortest paths in the residue interaction network tend to go. Therefore, binding of a ligand to the active site could modify the residue interaction network. As a first step in our quest for a relationship between chain connectivity and functional site interaction network, we investigate the closeness changes upon a ligand binding to the DHFR active site.</p><p>The nodes of the residue interaction network of DHFR are the C<sub>α</sub> of all residues.

The third, r3, is located near the strands formed by residues 1–15, which constitute one of the centers of the residue network of DHFR.

First, we examined the crystal structure to obtain the betweenness of locations of important network residues and the locations of the cuts in the permutations. Agarwal et al. identified several key residues in DHFR enzymatic catalysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b004">4</xref>]. The locations of these residues are within the folding elements (for example, Phe31 and Met42) and the nonfolding elements (like G15 and G121, and Asp122). In general, these key residues and the cutting points within the folding elements have higher betweenness than the cutting points in the nonfolding group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030117-t003">Table 3</xref>). Analysis of the MD average structure also shows that the z-scores of centrality are higher for the folding element group.

It can be seen that while the difference for the Met-20 loop is large during the 2.5- to 5.0-ns time span, the 5.0- to 10.0-ns dynamics show differences in the regions of helix 44–50 and the FG loop 116–132.</p><p>In summary, the closeness centrality in the network analysis indicates the differing behavior of the functional loop regions upon breaking the chain connection in folding element regions versus in nonfolding element regions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have carried out a systematic network analysis and MD simulations of the native DHFR and 19 of its circularly permuted variants. Starting with the crystal structure of the native DHFR, we constructed circular permutations by linking the N-termini and C-termini with five glycine residues, and, following the experiment, introduced breaks in the chain connections in ten folding element regions and in nine nonfolding element regions. The 5-ns MD simulations provided average structures for the native DHFR and for the circularly permuted mutants that are able to fold according to experimental data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b005">5</xref>]. For ten circularly permuted variants (five from the folding element group and five from the nonfolding element group), additional 5-ns simulations provided dynamics effects reflecting the changes in the closeness in the functional loop regions. Analysis of the structural variations illustrated that there are no distinctive structural features indicating whether particular circularly permuted mutants with cuttings within the folding elements will be able to fold. Simulations of experimentally determined permuted mutants that are unable to fold sample only the local minimum on the protein-folding energy landscape and do not reveal the true folding properties of such circularly permuted variants. Nevertheless, our combined MD and network studies with breaks in the chain connection in the folding element or nonfolding element regions present different patterns of perturbation of the network properties near the active site.</p><p>Our network analysis further leads us to propose that ligand binding induces network-bridging effects in the protein structure. We observed that substrate binding has profound effects on the DHFR network centrality, especially on closeness. The protein active site is near or coincides with residues through which the shortest paths in the residue interaction network tend to go. Our results suggest that cofactor binding leads to a modification of the interaction network, with most of the interactions now passing through the cofactor. The average shortest path is shorter with cofactor binding. Our findings are consistent with experimental observations that substrate binding increases DHFR folding stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b024">24</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, our analysis demonstrates that active site dynamics of DHFR are communicated to the whole protein via both the peptide backbone and the nonbonded residue contacts. Such communication is indicated by the closeness change accompanying ligand binding, by breaking chain connections in the folding element region, and by breaking chain connections in the nonfolding element region. Even though the native and the circularly permuted proteins have similar overall folds, breaking the chain connections at different regions and ligand binding can change the properties of the network.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>MD simulations.</title><p>The structure of DHFR from <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> (closed state) was taken from the Protein Data Bank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb" xlink:type="simple">http://www.rcsb.org/pdb</ext-link>). Both crystallographic waters and substrates were deleted. Circular permutation of the protein consists of connecting the native N- and C-termini covalently with a peptide linker and cleaving the peptide backbone at one specific site. Because a five-glycine peptide was shown to be the most favorable linker in the circularly permuted DHFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b005">5</xref>], this peptide linker was used in all variants in our study. The MOE software (Chemical Computing Group, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chemcomp.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.chemcomp.com</ext-link>) was used to obtain all the circularly permuted variants of the native DHFR, which now has 164 residues. A total of 19 variants were selected for simulation: ten in the proposed folding element region and nine in the nonfolding element region (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030117-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The CHARMM program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b025">25</xref>] (version 30b1) was used for all computations with the CHARMM force field version 22 using all atom representation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b026">26</xref>]. The native DHFR and its circularly permuted variants were simulated in a 60 × 60 × 60 Å<sup>3</sup> explicitly solvated periodic box. TIP3P water molecules were introduced. The simulations were carried out with a distance cutoff of 13 Å and a constant dielectric constant of 1. Each simulation was initialized with adopted basis Newton-Raphson (ABNR) minimization followed by 3 ps system heating and 17 ps system equilibration. A production simulation run was carried out for each of the protein structures described above with a 1-fs time step. The coordinates were saved at 1-ps time intervals. Each simulation was run at 300 °K for 5 ns. The average structures from the last 2.5-ns simulations were used for network analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Molecular docking of DHFR ligand complex.</title><p>Patchdock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b027">27</xref>], a geometry-based molecular docking algorithm, was used to generate clusters for the DHFR–ligand interactions.

Residue interaction network analysis often uses uniformed distance as long as the contacting residues are within a cutoff distance. Such an approach does not distinguish between chain connection and nonbonded interaction. A recent network permutation analysis of DHFR based on such a definition led to two separate regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b022">22</xref>].</p><p>The nature of the chemical bond argues for a strong communication when two residues are sequentially linked by a peptide bond. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030117-g007">Figure 7</xref>, we show that the most connected residue Ile5 has two bonded connections with Leu4 and Ala6 and the two closely packed residues Ile94 and Tyr111. Since residues connected by a peptide bond have shorter C<sub>α</sub> distances, a weighting of distance can distinguish between chain connection and nonbonded interaction. Thus, we define contact distances based on the C<sub>α</sub> of all residues within 6.0 Å and use the integer of the distance as weight. Therefore, 6 is coded for a distance of 6.0 Å, 5 for a distance between 5.0 and 6.0 Å, 4 for a distance between 4.0 and 5.0 Å, and 3 for a distance between 3.0 and 4.0 Å. The chain connection can have a distance index of 3 or 4, and a nonbonded contact can have a distance index of 5 or 6. This definition can effectively reflect the effects of chain cleavage on the network properties. The algorithm by Pape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030117-b028">28</xref>] was used to calculate the shortest path lengths between nodes.
