Until recently most of this regulation was thought to be implemented by processes that operate at the “transcriptional” level, that is, by modifying the rate at which mRNA is synthesized. The discovery of short RNAs, termed microRNAs (miRNAs), which can affect gene expression either by degradation of target mRNAs or by inhibiting their translation, has focused much recent effort on determining their specific functional roles and the extent to which they contribute to establishing protein repertoires within individual cells. Chan and colleagues have applied a computational comparative genomic approach for identifying the targets of these miRNAs within 3′ untranslated regions of mRNAs in closely related flies and worms. Their approach identifies a large number of target genes for most of the known miRNAs in these species, providing evidence that these regulators have a much more extensive role than previously thought. The sets of genes targeted by each miRNA are enriched in various known functional classes, providing strong clues for their role in physiology and development. The authors went on to identify many novel miRNAs based on the sequence of highly conserved target sites. They also found a large number of targets that do not correspond to miRNAs, some of which match the targets of known RNA-binding proteins. By comparing the large catalog of putative regulatory elements between flies and worms, they show that, although a large fraction of these elements are conserved, they are targeting, by and large, different sets of genes.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Citation:</meta-name><meta-value>Chan CS, Elemento O, Tavazoie S (2005) Revealing posttranscriptional regulatory elements through network-level conservation.

Such regulation arises essentially at the transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and posttranslational levels. While tremendous progress has been made in understanding transcriptional regulation and in mapping transcriptional regulatory networks, posttranscriptional regulatory networks are only beginning to be uncovered. Posttranscriptional regulation has been shown to arise through both protein-RNA and RNA-RNA interactions. RNA-binding proteins have been implicated in many aspects of posttranscriptional regulation, e.g., RNA processing, export, localization, degradation, and translational efficiency. Posttranscriptional regulation through RNA-RNA interactions has recently received much attention, in large part due to the discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b001">1</xref>].</p><p>miRNAs are 21- to 23-nucleotide (nt) single-stranded RNAs, derived from stem-loop precursors. It has been demonstrated that miRNAs regulate mRNA expression either by inducing degradation of the targeted transcript or by decreasing translational efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b002">2</xref>]. Recent studies suggest that only the degree of complementarity between a miRNA and its target determines the nature of regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b002">2</xref>]. Targets with strong complementarity to the miRNA are cleaved by the RNA-induced silencing complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b003">3</xref>]. Such targets appear to be common in plants but rare in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b005">5</xref>]. In some cases, targets with weaker complementarity appear to have decreased translational efficiency, although the molecular mechanism for this repression is currently unknown. It was also recently shown that some miRNAs might be involved in mRNA degradation in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b006">6</xref>]. Indeed, decreased mRNA levels (in human HeLa cells) were observed for dozens of genes upon transfection of two distinct miRNAs, <italic>miR-1</italic> and <italic>miR-124;</italic> it was also shown that the 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of these down-regulated mRNAs have significant complementarity to the 5′ extremity of the transfected miRNAs.</p><p>While hundreds of animal miRNAs have been discovered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b007">7</xref>], it is likely that many more have not, probably because the conditions under which they are expressed are not known, or because they may be expressed at very low levels. Moreover, very few targets of known miRNAs have been fully characterized experimentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b008">8</xref>]. However, these studies, along with computational ones, indicate that complementarity between miRNAs and their targets is stronger in the 5′ extremity of the miRNAs. Several computational and experimental efforts, based on features of the few verified miRNA/target duplexes, have been directed at finding targets for known miRNAs in the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> transcriptome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b011">11</xref>]. In a recent study, human miRNA targets were predicted on the basis of conservation of the seed (the 6-nt sequence at the 5′ extremity of the miRNA) in multiple alignments of five vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b012">12</xref>]. Based on their results, the authors suggest that up to one-third of human genes may be regulated by miRNAs. In another recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b013">13</xref>], 3′UTR alignments from four mammalian genomes were used to identify highly conserved targets of known miRNAs. Other highly conserved short sequences within their alignments were subsequently used to discover novel miRNAs.</p><p>In this paper, we use network-level conservation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b015">15</xref>] to show that many motifs are highly conserved in the 3′UTRs of orthologous genes from pairs of fly and worm genomes. We show that many of these highly conserved short sequences are complementary to the 5′ extremity of known miRNAs. We show that our approach naturally defines sets of putative target genes for each of these miRNAs, and that some of the target sets are enriched for genes within specific functional categories, shedding new light on miRNA involvement in these processes. Our approach also discovers known sites for RNA-binding proteins, motifs known to be involved in mRNA decay in other species, and many novel sites that are strongly associated with specific functional enrichments. We show that some of the highly conserved sites are often simultaneously conserved within the same 3′UTRs, suggesting combinatorial regulation of these transcripts. Since our approach uncovers many sites that are not known to be targeted by miRNAs or RNA-binding proteins, we describe a simple approach for discovering new miRNAs in the worm and fly genomes, and show that the candidate novel miRNAs have all the features of known miRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Scoring Exhaustive Motif Lists for Network-Level Conservation</title><p>We modified FastCompare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b015">15</xref>], for processing mRNA sequences (i.e., we performed single-strand analyses), to calculate a conservation score for all 7-, 8-, and 9-mers from the 3′UTRs of worm and fly genes. Briefly, a <italic>k</italic>-mer is given a high conservation score if there is a significant overlap between the sets of orthologous genes having at least one copy of the <italic>k</italic>-mer anywhere in their 3′UTRs. The hypergeometric distribution is used to evaluate the significance of the overlap.

The same pattern was observed for flies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0010069-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). We retained the top 500 7-mers (3.5% of all 16,384 7-mers) for further analysis (see below for a justification of this cutoff, in terms of number of captured miRNAs). We determined that the conservation score threshold induced by retaining the top 500 7-mers is, on average, greater than 99.9% of the scores obtained from randomized data. Using the procedure described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, we mapped the 500 7-mers into 442 <italic>k</italic>-mers for worms and 497 for flies (with <italic>k</italic> = 7, 8, or 9).

First we determined that the overlap between the highest-scoring <italic>k</italic>-mers obtained in the present study and the ~400 highest-scoring <italic>k</italic>-mers found in the analysis of 2-kb upstream regions in the same worm and fly genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b015">15</xref>] is very small (15 for worms, seven for flies). Since TFBSs are most abundant in upstream regions (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b016">16</xref>] for a review), this provides supportive evidence for the limited presence of TFBSs among our highest-scoring <italic>k</italic>-mers; although we cannot rule out the presence of unique transcription factor binding sites that function exclusively within 3′ downstream regions. Second, we reasoned that, if our highest-scoring <italic>k</italic>-mers were TFBSs, they would generally not have any strand bias, i.e., a <italic>k</italic>-mer and its reverse complement should be roughly equally conserved. However, we found that 97% (worm) and 90% (fly) of our highest-scoring <italic>k</italic>-mers have a higher conservation score than their reverse complement (which are themselves generally not among our highest-scoring <italic>k</italic>-mers). As an example of highly significant strand bias, the highest-scoring worm <italic>k</italic>-mer, CUGUGAU, is conserved in 187 genes, while its reverse complement, AUGACAG, is conserved in only 16 genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>High-Scoring <italic>k</italic>-Mers Are Complementary to the 5′ Ends of Many miRNAs</title><p>We observed that the highest-scoring fly <italic>k</italic>-mer, UGUGAUA, corresponds to the K box, a short sequence that has been found in the 3′UTRs of many genes of the <italic>E(spl)</italic> complex in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b017">17</xref>]; this sequence has been shown to reduce mRNA transcript levels in vivo, and to a lesser extent, to also reduce protein levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b017">17</xref>]. Another short sequence with a verified posttranscriptional role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b019">19</xref>], the Bearded (Brd) box (AGCUUUA, rank 23) was also identified as a highly conserved motif. These two motifs were shown to be complementary to the 5′ extremity of several fly miRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b020">20</xref>]. We then systematically matched our highest-scoring worm and fly <italic>k</italic>-mers to the 117 <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and 79 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> known (and experimentally verified) miRNAs, from the miRNA registry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b007">7</xref>].</p><p>We found that 87 and 73 of our 442 and 497 highest-scoring worm and fly <italic>k</italic>-mers (respectively) had perfect complementarity to at least one known miRNA, and that, conversely, 77 and 57 different miRNAs were complementary to at least one high-scoring <italic>k</italic>-mer. The expected numbers of miRNAs matched by chance are significantly lower (approximately 38 and 24 for worm and fly, respectively; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010069-g003">Figures 3</xref>A for worms and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0010069-sg002">S2A</xref> for flies; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for explanations). However, we found that the vast majority of <italic>k</italic>-mers matched miRNAs within their 5′ extremity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010069-g003">Figures 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010069-g004">4</xref> for worms, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0010069-sg002">Figures S2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0010069-sg003">S3</xref> for flies). Note that here, and in the rest of this study, we define complementarity to the 5′ extremity of a miRNA as complementarity starting within 1 nt or less of the actual miRNA 5′ extremity (e.g., positions 1 or 2 of the miRNA). Of the <italic>k</italic>-mer/miRNA pairings, 76% and 67% occur within the miRNA 5′ extremity, and the number of distinct miRNAs that are complementary to at least one <italic>k</italic>-mer within their 5′ extremities is 73 for worms and 49 for flies; this represents 62.4% and 62.0% of all known and experimentally verified miRNAs in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster,</italic> respectively. For both worms and flies, the expected number of miRNAs whose 5′ extremity is complementary to the same number of <italic>k</italic>-mers selected at random is small: 5 for worms and 3.5 for flies (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010069-g003">Figures 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0010069-sg002">S2A</xref>), signifying that only a small proportion (6.8% and 7.1%) of the captured miRNAs is expected to be due to chance. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010069-g003">Figure 3</xref>A shows that significantly increasing the initial number of retained worm 7-mers (we currently retain the 3.5% highest-scoring 7-mers) would yield very few additional complementary miRNAs; however, it would significantly increase the number of complementary miRNAs expected by chance.

We observed that, for most worm miRNAs in this study (58/73), 7-mers that are complementary to positions 2–8 of miRNAs are more conserved than 7-mers complementary to positions 1–7. Intriguingly, the situation was almost opposite in flies, with only 18/49 miRNAs having a more conserved complementary 7-mer in positions 2–8.</p><p>We also investigated whether highly conserved <italic>k</italic>-mers that are not exactly complementary to the 5′ extremity of any miRNA can still pair with certain miRNAs, if we tolerate a single non-Watson-Crick GU pairing. We found that 41 highly conserved <italic>k</italic>-mers, complementary to 53 distinct miRNAs, fit that scenario in worms. This number of <italic>k</italic>-mers is much larger than the average (approximately 11) obtained when we start from the same number of randomly selected <italic>k</italic>-mers (repeated 100 times). Interestingly, out of these 53 complementary miRNAs, 45 (85%) are also exactly complementary (in their 5′ extremity) to one of our high-scoring <italic>k</italic>-mers. This suggests that at least certain miRNAs in worms can bind their targets either through exact complementarity or through inexact complementarity involving a small number of GU pairs. The high network-level conservation of certain <italic>k</italic>-mers with imperfect complementary to miRNAs may indicate that miRNA targets involving imperfect pairing through GU pairing constitute a functionally distinct class of targets, similar to observations made for transcription factors in bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b021">21</xref>]. The same analysis in flies yielded 17 <italic>k</italic>-mers, complementary (through one GU pairing) to 19 miRNAs. This number of <italic>k</italic>-mers was closer to the expected number (approximately nine) obtained from randomly selected <italic>k</italic>-mers, than in the worm analysis. This suggests that targets involving GU pairing may be less common in fly than in worms.</p><p>Since the signal-to-noise ratio appears to be much higher when considering only exact complementarity to miRNAs (in worms, 57 <italic>k</italic>-mers are exactly complementary to the 5′ extremity of known miRNAs, with only 4.3 expected by chance), we restricted the rest of our analyses to such exact complementarity. Nonetheless, the list of <italic>k</italic>-mers/complementary miRNAs with one GU pairing is available from our Web site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tavazoielab.princeton.edu/mirnas/" xlink:type="simple">http://tavazoielab.princeton.edu/mirnas/</ext-link>).</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010069-g003">Figure 3</xref>B we show the proportion of 7-mers (within a sliding window of 50 7-mers) that are (exactly) complementary to the 5′ extremity of at least one miRNA as a function of the conservation score rank in worms. As can be seen in the figure, complementarity to the 5′ extremity of a miRNA correlates very strongly with conservation at the network level. A similar correlation was observed for flies (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0010069-sg002">Figure S2</xref>B).</p><p>The known <italic>C. elegans</italic> miRNAs with 5′ complementarity to at least one <italic>k</italic>-mer are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010069-t101">Table 1</xref>.

Our approach thus conveniently defines sets of putative targets for each miRNA: A gene is predicted to be a target of a given miRNA if its 3′UTR and that of its ortholog contain a high-scoring <italic>k</italic>-mer that is complementary to the 5′ extremity of the miRNA.

To avoid systematically biasing our predicted targets toward these genes, we used real-length 3′UTRs when the length is less than 500 nt, but truncate larger 3′UTRs to 500 nt. Although many real targets are likely to be located beyond the 500-nt cutoff, we expect most of them to be retained (80% of annotated fly 3′UTRs are less than 500 nt). For worms, we used the real-length 3′UTRs. Although few miRNA targets have been experimentally verified, our predicted targets include some for which experimental evidence is available. For example, the predicted targets for worm <italic>let-7</italic> includes <italic>hbl-1,</italic> a gene that is likely regulated by <italic>let-7</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b024">24</xref>].

These subsets thus contain predicted target sites that are further constrained. Although nonaligned predicted targets may contain many false positives, we suspect that small scale DNA rearrangements, fast evolution of noncoding sequences, or imprecise definition of 3′UTR boundaries may, in many cases, make alignment-based methods unreliable.

For example, we found several AU-rich motifs that are highly conserved both in worms and flies, e.g., UAAUUUAU (ranks 4 and 11 in worms and flies, respectively) and UAUUUAUU (ranks 6 and 2). These motifs are similar to the AU-rich element (ARE), defined as UUAUUUAUU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b027">27</xref>]; the ARE was found in the 3′UTRs of cytokines and proto-oncogenes in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b028">28</xref>]. It was shown to destabilize these mRNAs at least in part by triggering rapid deadenylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b027">27</xref>]. AREs have not been shown to be functional in worms or flies; however, a chimeric mRNA consisting of the rabbit β-globin gene fused to the 3′UTR of the human TNF-α (which contains several AREs) was rapidly degraded in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b029">29</xref>]. Moreover, this degradation involves homologs of human genes known to be involved in ARE-mediated mRNA decay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b029">29</xref>]. Interestingly, it was shown in the same study that the human <italic>miR-16</italic> miRNA is required for ARE-mediated mRNA turnover. In worms, the genes whose 3′UTR contains conserved UAAUUUAU appear to be enriched for genes whose products localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−11</sup>) and to the proteasome complex (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−10</sup>); for example, eight (out of 14) genes encoding products that localize to the core proteasome complex contain a conserved UAAUUUAU in their 3′UTRs.</p><p>We also found that UGUAAAUA, a sequence bound by some members of the PUF family, was highly conserved both in worms and flies (ranks 9 and 4, respectively). Interestingly, as we will see below, the PUF binding site appears to be better represented by a gapped motif in worms. <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> possesses a single PUF protein named Pumilio. Early in embryogenesis, Pumilio controls anterior/posterior body patterning by binding to the 3′UTR of <italic>hunchback</italic> mRNA and repressing its translation (via interaction with Nanos) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b030">30</xref>]. There is strong evidence that Pumilio also inhibits pole-cell division in early embryogenesis by repressing the translation of <italic>cyclin B</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b031">31</xref>]. Finally, Pumilio has also been shown to be involved in neuronal excitability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b032">32</xref>], long-term memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b033">33</xref>], and dendrite neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b034">34</xref>]. However, no additional targets have been identified yet. Altogether, these studies suggest that Pumilio targets many mRNAs, with potentially a small fraction of them having been identified. The fly conserved set for UGUAAAUA contains 314 genes, thus providing a large number of potential targets awaiting experimental verification; it would be particularly interesting to focus experiments on genes that are expressed early in embryogenesis (maternal and zygotic) and genes expressed in the brain.</p><p>Finally, we found many highly conserved <italic>k</italic>-mers that are not yet known to be bound by any RNA-binding proteins (and are not complementary to any known miRNAs), but which are associated with strong functional enrichment. In worms, the sequences UUGUUGA, UGUUGUU, and UUGUUAU appear to be highly conserved in the 3′UTRs of many genes involved in cell growth (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−17</sup>, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−23</sup>, and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−24</sup>, respectively). Indeed, out of the 497 genes containing a 3′UTR with a conserved UUGUUGA, UGUUGUU, or UUGUUAU, 192 are annotated as being involved in growth (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−49</sup>, 64 expected). Moreover, the protein products of 60 of these 497 genes are known to localize to the ribosome (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−49</sup>, six expected by chance). The same elements are also conserved downstream of many genes involved in larval development (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−38</sup>) and gametogenesis (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−15</sup>). This motif may be involved in slowing down cell growth by repressing translation or degrading large numbers of mRNAs at a certain developmental stage, or under stressful environmental conditions.</p><p>In flies, CAG-repeats (CAGCAGC, rank 71; and GCAGCAG, rank 104) are strongly associated with genes involved in transcriptional regulation (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−14</sup> for both <italic>k</italic>-mers). For example, among the 14 genes that have a conserved motif consisting of four tandem copies of CAG, six are known transcription factors <italic>(fork head, ventral veins lacking, SoxNeuro, cropped, spineless,</italic> and <italic>ypsilon schachtel),</italic> and two are transcriptional co-activators or co-repressors <italic>(big brother, smrter)</italic>. CA repeats are also highly enriched with genes involved in organ development (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−11</sup> for CACACAC, rank 32). There is growing evidence that CA repeats are involved in mRNA transcript stability, at least in human. For example, in one recent study it was shown that CA repeats in the 3′UTR of the <italic>bcl-2</italic> mRNA are responsible for destabilization of the transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b035">35</xref>]. In another study, CA repeats within intron 13 of the human endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene were found to mediate cleavage of the pre-mRNA, unless bound by heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b036">36</xref>]. Although experiments are needed to validate our observations, these results provide strong support for the functionality of certain classes of repeats in posttranscriptional regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Motifs Represented by Gapped <italic>k</italic>-Mers Often Show Stronger Conservation than Ungapped <italic>k</italic>-Mers</title><p>The binding sites for the PUF RNA-binding proteins in yeast are <bold>UGUA..UA</bold>, <bold>UGUA...UA</bold>, and <bold>UGUA....UA</bold> for Puf3p, Puf4p, and Puf5p, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b037">37</xref>]. This means that UGUA and UA are required for binding to the PUF proteins, but also that the nucleotides between the two half-sites are less important (although nucleotide preferences still exist within the gaps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b037">37</xref>]. In yeast, the length of the gap between UGUA and UA determines which PUF protein binds the site with highest affinity. In what follows, we refer to such elements as “gapped” <italic>k-</italic>mers. To search for these regulatory elements within the 3′UTRs of worm and fly mRNAs, we calculated a conservation score for all sequences of the form <italic>s<sub>1</sub></italic>-<italic>gap</italic>-<italic>s<sub>2</sub>,</italic> where the lengths of <italic>s<sub>1</sub>, gap,</italic> and <italic>s<sub>2</sub></italic> vary between 2 and 4 nt.

To calculate a statistical significance, we randomly selected the same number of pairs of positions within the same 3′UTRs, 10,000 times, and from this we calculated the null distribution of median distances. We found that most interactions were not associated with any statistically significant clustering. This may be due to the fact that pairs of <italic>k</italic>-mers are coconserved in relatively few genes, preventing strongly significant statistical assertions.

This scenario is not surprising, since modifying the RNA-binding affinities of the regulators would cause drastic changes to the regulatory network topology, while appearance/deletion of single regulatory elements would presumably have much less drastic consequences for the cell. These results also indicate that motif discovery using the network-level conservation principle (at least as presented here) would fail if the compared species were very distantly related.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have described an integrated approach for discovering conserved elements involved in posttranscriptional regulation and for predicting the miRNA regulators that may target these elements. Our approach is based on comparative genomics, but does not require the orthologous 3′UTRs to be aligned, and it requires only two genomes. Many of the regulatory elements we discovered were complementary to the 5′ extremity of known miRNAs, both in worms (in which we captured 62.4% of the known miRNAs) and in flies (62.0%). There may be several reasons why we failed to detect complementary <italic>k</italic>-mers for the remaining known miRNAs. It is possible that the sets of genes regulated by these miRNAs are small, decreasing the statistical power for detecting them. Alternatively, the corresponding posttranscriptional networks may have undergone extensive rewiring, rendering them undetectable by network-level conservation.</p><p>We have shown that the high-scoring <italic>k</italic>-mers are unlikely to be TFBSs (although we expect some level of contamination, due to transcription factors that bind downstream regions). Note, however, that some miRNAs may target mRNA sequences that match known transcription factor binding sites. For example, the target site of <italic>C. elegans miR-248</italic> matches the E-box, a site known to be bound by several transcription factors of the basic helix-loop-helix family; similarly, the target site of <italic>D. melanogaster miR-184*</italic> matches the binding site for GATA factors.</p><p>We have also shown that our approach conveniently defines sets of targets for miRNAs; a gene is predicted to be a target of a miRNA if the 3′UTR of the gene and its ortholog contain a globally conserved <italic>k</italic>-mer that is complementary to the 5′ extremity of the miRNA. While this simple approach appears to group together coherent sets of genes (as defined by functional enrichments and coexpression, for example), it has several limitations. For example, it does not predict <italic>lin-41</italic> as being a target of <italic>let-7</italic> in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> because this interaction involves a non-Watson-Crick pairing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b043">43</xref>] and relatively extensive complementarity across the entire length of the miRNA/mRNA duplex. As recently shown in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b008">8</xref>], inexact complementarity between the 5′ extremity of the miRNA and its target sequence can be rescued by a more extensive pairing across the length of the miRNA. Computational approaches for recovering these targets have been described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b044">44</xref>]. Also, our approach predicts only conserved targets; it is unclear what proportion of functional targets is not conserved between the species under consideration.</p><p>Since many of the most highly conserved <italic>k</italic>-mers do not match known miRNAs, we searched the <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genomes for candidate novel miRNAs. We found many such putative miRNAs and showed that these predictions have all the features of known miRNAs. While experiments are now required to validate our predictions, a conservative estimate based on the highest-scoring <italic>C. elegans</italic> miRNAs indicates that there may be more than twice as many functional miRNAs in worms as is currently thought. A total of 101 (worms) and 110 (flies) of our high-scoring <italic>k</italic>-mers are complementary to the 5′ extremity of at least one known or novel miRNA. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0010069-st001">Table S1</xref>, we found that many of the remaining high-scoring <italic>k</italic>-mers extensively overlap with these sites (e.g., 120 and 147 of these remaining <italic>k</italic>-mers have at least 6-nt overlap with at least one <italic>k</italic>-mer that is complementary to the 5′ extremity of a known or novel miRNA). A small fraction (17 in worms, five in flies) of the remaining <italic>k</italic>-mers were complementary to miRNA 5′ extremities, if a single GU-pairing is allowed. Therefore, 204 <italic>k</italic>-mers in worms and 235 in flies are unaccounted for. As we have shown above, several of these <italic>k</italic>-mers are known to be protein-binding sites (e.g., by members of PUF family of RNA-binding proteins), and it is likely that many of the remaining <italic>k</italic>-mers are bound by RNA-binding proteins that have not been characterized yet. Finally, it is also possible that many of the remaining sites are targeted by miRNAs that are less conserved and/or those that interact weakly with their targets.</p><p>We have also shown that posttranscriptional regulatory networks have undergone extensive rewiring between worms and flies. The binding sites for miRNAs and known RNA-binding proteins are present in both phyla, suggesting that the regulators are still largely the same. However, these elements seem to be regulating entirely different sets of genes.</p><p>We envision several directions for further research. For example, our current approach does not make any assumptions about how miRNA or RNA-binding protein target sites evolve. We believe that, once the evolution of RNA regulatory elements is better understood, our approach may be refined to take RNA-specific modes of evolution into account, similarly to what was done with transcription factor binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b045">45</xref>].

The strength of the overlap was measured using the hypergeometric distribution, which defines the probability of drawing two sets of size <italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub>, having <italic>i</italic> or more elements in common, from a set of <italic>N</italic> elements, and this probability is given by:</p><disp-formula id="pcbi-0010069-e001"><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010069.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><!-- <table frame="hsides" rules="none"><colgroup><col id="tb1col1" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col2" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col3" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col4" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col5" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col6" align="char" charoff="0" char="."/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left"><hr/>TF Name<sup>a</sup></td><td><hr/>Anneal WM<sup>b</sup></td><td><hr/>Track WM<sup>c</sup></td><td><hr/>Anneal Sites<sup>d</sup></td><td><hr/>Track Sites<sup>e</sup></td><td><hr/>Number Annotated in &lsqb;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b027">27</xref>&rsqb;</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>GAL80*</td><td>0.88</td><td>0.89</td><td>3/4</td><td>2.73/3.41</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>GCR1&plus;</td><td>1.00</td><td>1.00</td><td>6/10</td><td>5.17/7.96</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>HAP2</td><td>1.00</td><td>1.00</td><td>15/15</td><td>4.5/6.72</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>HAP3</td><td>1.00</td><td>1.00</td><td>10/10</td><td>7.14/8.21</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>MET32*</td><td>1.00</td><td>1.00</td><td>9/11</td><td>7.33/9.77</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>MSN4*</td><td>1.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>14/23</td><td>12.41/20.68</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>RGT1&plus;</td><td>0.42</td><td>0.67</td><td>9/13</td><td>8.27/12.35</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>RTG3*</td><td>1.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>3/7</td><td>2.31/5.77</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>PUT3&plus;</td><td>0.03</td><td>0.0</td><td>3/3</td><td>2.73/2.73</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>MET31*</td><td>1.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>2/3</td><td>1.84/2.52</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>ADR1*</td><td>0.92</td><td>0.92</td><td>1/9</td><td>0.19/6.21</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>MAC1</td><td>0.77</td><td>0.69</td><td>1/4</td><td>0.85/2.67</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>HAP5</td><td>1.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>10/15</td><td>0.99/10.97</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>SKO1</td><td>1.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>2/4</td><td>0.91/4.13</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>GZF3</td><td>0.74</td><td>0.0</td><td>0/3</td><td>0/0.83</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>RLM1*</td><td>0.74</td><td>0.0</td><td>0/8</td><td>0/3.64</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>DAL80</td><td>0.03</td><td>0.0</td><td>0/6</td><td>0/5.75</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>MOT3</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0/10</td><td>0/11.69</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>ROX1</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0/10</td><td>0/6.65</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>YAP6</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0/4</td><td>0/2.5</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>YOX1</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>1/2</td><td>0.91/1.82</td><td>3</td></tr></tbody></table> --></disp-formula><p>It is important to note that, due to basal conservation (that is, conservation arising from common ancestry), the hypergeometric <italic>p</italic>-values will generally be very small for most <italic>k</italic>-mers. Therefore, we use only these <italic>p</italic>-values as relative measures of network-level conservation and focus on <italic>k</italic>-mers with the greatest conservation. For simplicity, we define the “conservation score” as the negative logarithm (base <italic>e</italic>) of the hypergeometric <italic>p</italic>-value obtained for a given <italic>k</italic>-mer. Conservation scores were normalized for unequal lengths among 3′UTRs by weighing the contribution of each 3′UTR by 1/<italic>length</italic>, where <italic>length</italic> represents the length (in nt) of the 3′UTR. The variables <italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub>, and <italic>i</italic> were obtained by multiplying the corresponding weighted counts by 300 (for worms) and 500 (for flies), then rounding to the nearest integer. Further details about the motif discovery method are described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b015">15</xref>].</p><p>We calculated a conservation score for all possible <italic>k</italic>-mers, with <italic>k</italic> ranging from 7 to 9. We used randomized sequences to show that the high conservation scores obtained in this study were unlikely to be obtained by chance. To generate randomized pairs of orthologous 3′UTRs with the same level of divergence as in the actual data, we aligned each pair of orthologous 3′UTRs using ClustalW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b050">50</xref>], and used the alignments to obtain an estimate of the substitution rates between the orthologous sequences. Starting from one of the orthologs, we created a randomized ortholog by mutating the initial sequence according to the estimated substitution frequencies. We then repeated FastCompare on the randomized sequences.</p><p>In the present study, we retained the 500 most conserved 7-mers (obtained from the actual sequences) and processed them as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b015">15</xref>]. Briefly, we first extended 7-mers into 8-mers if, for a given 7-mer, there existed an 8-mer with a higher conservation score such that the 8-mer contained the 7-mer. We extended 8-mers into 9-mers in the same way. We also retained high-scoring 8-mers and 9-mers that did not have any substrings among 7-mers. Then we systematically removed <italic>k</italic>-mers that had higher scoring substrings. We define the conserved set of a given <italic>k</italic>-mer as the set of genes whose 3′UTRs contained at least one conserved occurrence of the <italic>k</italic>-mer.</p><p>To estimate the expected number of miRNAs complementary to a set of <italic>m</italic> high-scoring <italic>k</italic>-mers, we chose <italic>m k</italic>-mers at random, with the same numbers of 7-, 8-, and 9-mers as in the original set. We then evaluated the number of known miRNAs complementary to at least one of these randomly selected <italic>k</italic>-mers. We repeated the same procedure 100 times, and calculated the average number of complementary miRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Defining miRNA targets.</title><p>We defined the target set of a given miRNA as the union of all conserved sets corresponding to the highly conserved <italic>k</italic>-mers complementary to its 5′ extremity (complementarity had to begin within 1 nt of the 5′ extremity). To estimate the number of targets expected by chance for each miRNA, we generated pairs of randomized orthologous sequences retaining the same level of divergence as the original pairs of sequences, as described above. Conserved sets for all <italic>k</italic>-mers complementary to miRNAs were then determined for these randomly generated sequences and subsequently used to create pseudo-target sets for each miRNA. The randomization procedure was repeated 100 times. Then, for each miRNA, the average size and standard deviation of the 100 corresponding pseudo-target sets were calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>miRNA discovery.</title><p>For each conserved <italic>k</italic>-mer, we searched through the entire <italic>C. elegans</italic> or <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genome for occurrences of the reverse-complementary <italic>k</italic>-mer on both strands of DNA. For each occurrence, we took two windows of length 80 nt (potentially corresponding to the two possible candidate miRNAs lying on the two arms of the 80-nt stem-loop sequence). We folded each window using RNAfold from the Vienna Package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010069-b051">51</xref>] to give the fold with minimal folding energy (MFE). If the fold formed a single stem-loop and the MFE was less than −30 kcal/mol at 25 °C, we retained the sequence as a potential miRNA precursor. We then tested for conservation of the potentially novel miRNA by searching for its homolog. We used BLAST (blastn) to search the second genome <italic>(C. briggsae</italic> or <italic>D. pseudoobscura)</italic> for regions homologous to the 80-nt stem-loop sequence, requiring the best matching sequence to have an E-value below a cutoff corresponding to conservation of 40% of the known miRNAs for that species (10<sup>−17</sup> for worms and 10<sup>−29</sup> for flies). We also required that the best matching sequence contains the exact conserved <italic>k</italic>-mer above, and folds into a single stem-loop with MFE less than −30 kcal/mol at 25 °C. We removed miRNA candidates located in exons or on the opposite strand of exons. Candidate mature miRNAs were defined as 23-nt sequences, such that the conserved reverse-complementary <italic>k</italic>-mer began at the second nucleotide from the 5′ extremity. A candidate mature miRNA matched a known mature miRNA if the positions of their 5′ ends were located within 2 nt on the genome (because miRNAs are generally 21–23 nt long). For the miRNA precursor stem-loops with candidate miRNAs from both arms of the stem-loop, we chose the one that matched the more conserved <italic>k</italic>-mer as the more likely candidate, except in the case where one matched a known miRNA. We ranked the candidate miRNAs by the MFE of their precursor stem-loop. To minimize false-positives, we present only candidate miRNAs with MFEs smaller than −34 kcal/mol at 25 °C as our final list of high-confidence predictions (80 for <italic>C. elegans</italic> and 92 for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>).</p><p>We named our predicted miRNAs (pmi) by a number followed by a letter (e.g., <italic>cel-pmi-74a</italic>). The number corresponds to the rank of the conserved <italic>k</italic>-mer matched by our predicted miRNA. The letter corresponds to the ordinal value from all <italic>pmi</italic> matching that <italic>k</italic>-mer as ranked by MFE.
