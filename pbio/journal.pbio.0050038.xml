        <p>Compelling evidence suggests that the transcription factor Foxp3 acts as a master switch governing the development and function of CD4<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Tregs). However, whether transcriptional control of Foxp3 expression itself contributes to the development of a stable Treg lineage has thus far not been investigated. We here identified an evolutionarily conserved region within the <italic>foxp3</italic> locus upstream of exon-1 possessing transcriptional activity. Bisulphite sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed complete demethylation of CpG motifs as well as histone modifications within the conserved region in ex vivo isolated Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs, but not in naïve CD25<sup>−</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Partial DNA demethylation is already found within developing Foxp3<sup>+</sup> thymocytes; however, Tregs induced by TGF-β in vitro display only incomplete demethylation despite high Foxp3 expression. In contrast to natural Tregs, these TGF-β–induced Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs lose both Foxp3 expression and suppressive activity upon restimulation in the absence of TGF-β. Our data suggest that expression of Foxp3 must be stabilized by epigenetic modification to allow the development of a permanent suppressor cell lineage, a finding of significant importance for therapeutic applications involving induction or transfer of Tregs and for the understanding of long-term cell lineage decisions.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Regulatory T cells play a pivotal role in the maintenance of self-tolerance within the immune system by preventing autoimmunity or excessive activation of the T cells that respond to pathogens (naïve and effector T cells). They differentiate within the thymus, but can also be de novo induced in the rest of the body. Mechanisms determining development of a stable regulatory T cell lineage are unknown. Our study provides evidence for a critical role of epigenetic modifications in the locus coding for the forkhead transcription factor Foxp3, which acts as a master switch controlling regulatory T cell development and function: An evolutionarily conserved region within the non-coding part of the gene contains CpG motifs, which are completely demethylated in regulatory T cells, but methylated in naïve and effector T cells, whereas we observed an inverse occurrence of acetylated histones, another epigenetic chromatin modification. Regulatory T cells induced in vitro—which, in contrast to natural regulatory T cells, do not display a stable regulatory T cell phenotype—display only incomplete DNA demethylation despite high Foxp3 expression. Our data suggest that expression of Foxp3 must be stabilized by epigenetic modification to result in a permanent suppressor cell lineage, a finding of significant importance for therapeutic applications involving induction or transfer of regulatory T cells and for the understanding of long-term cell lineage decisions.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Regulatory T cells (Tregs), which have been shown to play a pivotal role in the maintenance of self-tolerance within the immune system, were described originally as CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells constitutively expressing CD25 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b001">1</xref>]. More recently, the forkhead transcription factor Foxp3 has been shown to be specifically expressed in Tregs and to be a central control element in Treg development and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b002">2</xref>]. Mutation or deletion of the gene encoding Foxp3 causes severe autoimmune disease in mice and humans, due to a failure to generate CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b004">4</xref>], whereas ectopic expression of Foxp3 in conventional T cells confers suppressive activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b005">5</xref>]. These findings provided compelling evidence that Foxp3 acts as a master switch controlling the development and function of Tregs; however, the molecular mechanisms leading to its induction remain largely unknown. Recently, an initial characterization of the human FOXP3 promoter revealed a basal, T cell–specific promoter containing several NF-AT and AP-1 binding sites, which are positively regulating FOXP3 expression after triggering of the T cell receptor (TCR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b006">6</xref>].</p>
      <p>Occurrence of autoimmunity in thymectomized mice provided initial evidence that Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs are generated as an individual lineage within the thymus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b001">1</xref>]. Using mice harboring a GFP-Foxp3 fusion protein-reporter knockin allele, Fontenot et al. could show that Foxp3 expression becomes prominent in CD4 single-positive (SP) thymocytes (∼83% of Foxp3<sup>gfp+</sup> thymocytes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b008">8</xref>]. In addition to the thymic generation of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs, peripheral conversion of Foxp3<sup>−</sup>CD25<sup>−</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs has recently been demonstrated by tolerogenic antigen application in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b011">11</xref>] or upon activation in the presence of TGF-β in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b017">17</xref>]. To what extent these induced populations of Tregs acquire a stable phenotype corresponding to that of natural, thymus-derived Tregs is, however, unclear.</p>
      <p>An emerging paradigm in understanding the development of stable cellular lineages emphasizes the role of epigenetic mechanisms for the permanent, heritable fixation of distinct gene expression patterns. Molecular mechanisms of epigenetic imprinting include selective demethylation of CpG motifs and histone modifications as shown for cytokine genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b020">20</xref>]. Whether Treg differentiation also involves elements of epigenetic regulation has not been studied thus far. We therefore investigated whether epigenetic alterations such as DNA methylation and histone modifications of the <italic>foxp3</italic> locus correlate with Foxp3 expression. The selective association of chromatin remodeling with a stable Treg phenotype suggests a role of epigenetic imprinting in the establishment of a committed regulatory cell type.</p>

        <title>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs Display a Stable Foxp3 Expression</title>
        <p>It is assumed that Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs represent an individual lineage exhibiting a stable phenotype. To prove experimentally the stability of Foxp3 expression in natural Tregs on a cellular level, we adoptively transferred sorted CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells after CFSE (carboxy fluorescein diacetate succinimide ester) labeling into syngeneic recipients. Fourteen days after transfer, more than 95% of CFSE<sup>+</sup> cells, including those that had divided once or twice according to loss of CFSE, were still Foxp3<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050038-g001">Figure 1</xref>), supporting data from a recent publication using a lymphopenic transfer model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b021">21</xref>]. Having shown that Foxp3 is stably expressed in CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs, we next asked whether epigenetic modifications of the <italic>foxp3</italic> locus might account for the maintenance of the long-term identity of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs.</p>

            <p>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs were isolated ex vivo from pooled spleen and LN single-cell suspensions, labeled with CFSE, and then transferred into syngenic 8-wk-old recipients (2 × 10<sup>6</sup>/mouse). Before transfer, sorted cells were analyzed for intracellular Foxp3 expression by FACS. Fourteen days after transfer, splenocytes of recipient mice were stained for CD4, CD25, and Foxp3, and analyzed by FACS. About 0.1% of total splenocytes and, accordingly, 3% of total Foxp3<sup>+</sup> splenocytes were donor derived (CFSE<sup>+</sup>). Representative dot and histogram plots from four independently analyzed mice were selected. Numbers display frequency of cells within indicated populations. Comparable results were obtained for cells isolated from peripheral or mesenteric LNs (unpublished data). The bars in the left and right graphs indicate the marker gate for Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells. The box in the middle graph indicates the region that was used to gate for CD4<sup>+</sup>CFSE<sup>+</sup> cells. These gated cells (CFSE<sup>+</sup>) are depicted in the right graph.</p>

        <title>Epigenetic Modifications of the <italic>foxp3</italic> Locus in Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs</title>
        <p>The lymphoproliferative disorder of scurfy mice is completely rescued by transgenic complementation with a 30.8-kilobase (kb) genomic fragment containing the <italic>foxp3</italic> gene from wild-type mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b022">22</xref>]. This indicates that most key regulatory elements required for proper Foxp3 expression are located within the transgene including the entire gene, as well as 12.5 kb and 2.8 kb of 5′ and 3′ flanking sequences, respectively. We therefore focused our analysis of epigenetic modifications on sequences from the 30.8-kb region and selected specific regions for methylation analysis based on CpG density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050038-g002">Figure 2</xref>A): Overlapping amplicons 1 and 2 map upstream from exon-1, amplicons 3 and 4 align to the seventh intron.

ESME software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b047">47</xref>] is used for normalization and quantification of methylation signals from sequencing data by calculating ratios of T and C signals at CpG sites. Data are condensed to methylation information at CpG positions forming matrices of consecutive CpGs. The methylation status of individual CpG motifs within the four amplicons is color coded according to the degree of methylation at that site. The color code ranges from yellow (0% methylation) to blue (100% methylation) according to the color scale on the right. CpG motifs from amplicon 2 overlapping with motifs in amplicon 1 were excluded. Due to sequencing problems, the CpG motif 37 from amplicon 4 is not listed.

        <p>We sorted CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs and conventional CD25<sup>−</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from secondary lymphoid organs of male mice. Male mice were chosen to avoid potential artifacts due to random X chromosome inactivation since Foxp3 is encoded on the X chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b022">22</xref>]. As expected, the vast majority of sorted CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs were Foxp3<sup>+</sup>, whereas less than 1% of CD25<sup>−</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressed Foxp3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050038-g002">Figure 2</xref>B).</p>
        <p>The methylation status of the <italic>foxp3</italic> locus was analyzed by bisulphite sequencing (see Material and Methods). Interestingly, striking differences between CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs and conventional CD25<sup>−</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells could be observed. CpG motifs within amplicons 1 and 2 displayed a high degree of methylation (∼100%) within conventional CD25<sup>−</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, but were almost completely demethylated within CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050038-g002">Figure 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050038-st001">Table S1</xref>). No significant differences were observed for amplicons 3 and 4, showing that the demethylation process is not a random event, but is confined to defined regions as was recently found for the interleukin 2 (IL-2) promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b023">23</xref>]. Together, our findings suggest that demethylation of CpG motifs within selected elements of the <italic>foxp3</italic> locus enable stable Foxp3 expression in CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs. This view is supported by recent findings with human natural killer (NK) cells, which up-regulated FOXP3 expression in response to IL-2 only after treatment with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2′deoxycytidine, demonstrating that this gene was constitutively repressed in non-Tregs by a mechanism involving DNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b024">24</xref>].</p>

        <title>Differentially Methylated Element of the <italic>foxp3</italic> Locus Is Evolutionarily Conserved and Possesses Transcriptional Activity</title>
        <p>The differentially methylated element covered by amplicons 1 and 2 is conserved between mice and humans (77.3% sequence identity). This is not the case for the region covered by amplicons 3 and 4, which essentially showed no signs of differential DNA methylation. In silico analysis of the differentially methylated, conserved region predicts a number of binding sites for transcription factors, including ATF/CREB, C/EBPγ, Elk-1, Ets-1, Evi-1, Foxp3, GATA-4, NFATc, NF-κB, SMAD-4, STAT-1, TCF-4, and TTF1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050038-sg001">Figure S1</xref>), indicating that these factors might be involved in the induction of Foxp3 expression in CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs.</p>
        <p>To analyze whether the same region harbors transcriptional activity, we cloned a 1,160–base pair (bp) element containing the differentially methylated element covered by amplicons 1 and 2 into the pGL3 luciferase vector in front of a minimal SV40 promoter. The luciferase vector was transfected into a murine CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell line, and transfected cells were either left unstimulated or were stimulated with PMA for 24 h, followed by measurement of luciferase activity. PMA treatment mimics part of the signals generated after TCR triggering, which have been shown to be essential for Foxp3 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b006">6</xref>]. Interestingly, significant luciferase activity was only observed in stimulated cells transfected with the vector containing the conserved element of the <italic>foxp3</italic> locus, but not in cells transfected with the control vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050038-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Similar results showing a 5-fold to 7-fold induction of luciferase activity after stimulation were also obtained with ex vivo isolated CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs, albeit much lower transfection efficiencies were achieved with these primary murine T cells (unpublished data). Initial experiments targeting the functional activity of selected transcription factors, for which a binding site in the differentially methylated, conserved element has been predicted, showed a reduced luciferase activity if transcription factors of the STAT family were inhibited by decoy oligonucleotides (unpublished data), confirming recently published data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b024">24</xref>]. Together, our data assuredly show that the differentially methylated, conserved element of the <italic>foxp3</italic> locus possesses transcriptional activity.</p>

        <title>Histone Modifications Indicate Opening of the <italic>foxp3</italic> Locus in CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs</title>
        <p>DNA demethylation is often linked to acetylation or methylation of histones, other key features of chromatin remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b025">25</xref>]. To investigate whether this also holds true for the aforementioned region of the <italic>foxp3</italic> locus, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments using antibodies specific for acetylated histone H3, acetylated histone H4, and trimethylated lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4). Subsequently, the precipitated DNA was used as a template for amplifying the differentially methylated region of the <italic>foxp3</italic> locus by quantitative real-time PCR. Indeed, in CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs, the region of interest showed a stronger association with modified histones when compared with conventional CD25<sup>−</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050038-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Major differences were observed for the acetylated and trimethylated histone H3, whereas minor differences were found for the acetylated histone H4. Together, the ChIP data disclose that within conventional CD25<sup>−</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, the <italic>foxp3</italic> locus is packed in a more condensed, inaccessible chromatin structure, whereas it is located within open euchromatin in CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs.</p>

        <p>Having shown that peripheral CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs display a characteristic methylation status of the <italic>foxp3</italic> locus, we next sought to determine whether this also could be observed in developing Tregs. Generation of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells in the thymus occurs preferentially at the CD4 SP stage or during transition to this stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b008">8</xref>]. We therefore isolated CD25<sup>+</sup> and CD25<sup>−</sup> subsets of CD4 SP thymocytes from male mice.

Only CD25<sup>+</sup>, not CD25<sup>−</sup> CD4 SP thymocytes, displayed demethylated CpG motifs within the regions covered by amplicons 1 and 2, whereas CpG motifs in amplicons 3 and 4 were again fully methylated in both subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050038-g005">Figure 5</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050038-st001">Table S1</xref>).

These stark differences cannot simply be explained by the fact that, among CD25<sup>+</sup> CD4 SP thymocytes, only 80% are Foxp3<sup>+</sup> compared to 95% within the peripheral counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050038-g002">Figures 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050038-g005">5</xref>A).

        <title>Weak CpG Demethylation Correlates with Poor Foxp3 Stability in TGF-β–Induced Tregs</title>
        <p>A critical issue for application of Tregs in therapeutic approaches is the availability of large numbers of cells. Recent publications have reported that conventional CD25<sup>−</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can be converted into Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs by stimulation in the presence of TGF-β [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b017">17</xref>]. However, the stability and in vivo efficacy of these cells have not been thoroughly tested so far. Analysis of the accessibility of the <italic>foxp3</italic> locus might provide an additional clue, aside from the mere expression of Foxp3, as to the extent to which a permanent conversion into a Treg lineage did occur. We therefore analyzed the methylation status of the <italic>foxp3</italic> locus from CD25<sup>−</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which had been activated and cultured for 6 d in the presence of TGF-β. On day 6, more than 98% of TGF-β–cultured cells were Foxp3<sup>+</sup>, whereas control cells cultured under Th1 conditions showed only approximately 1% Foxp3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050038-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). As expected, within cultured Th1 cells, all analyzed CpG motifs were completely methylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050038-g006">Figure 6</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050038-st001">Table S1</xref>). In contrast, cell culture in the presence of TGF-β led to a clearly visible demethylation of CpG motifs within the region covered by amplicons 1 and 2, whereas CpG motifs in amplicons 3 and 4 again were fully methylated. However, the degree of demethylation was far less pronounced compared to naturally occurring peripheral CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050038-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). This prompted us to investigate whether such a weak degree of CpG demethylation might correlate with persistent expression of Foxp3 in TGF-β–induced Tregs. Therefore, we restimulated TGF-β–cultured Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells for another 6 d in the absence of TGF-β followed by the analysis of intracellular Foxp3 expression. As a control, we cultured ex vivo isolated Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs under comparable conditions. Whereas ex vivo CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs maintained high Foxp3 levels after cell culture for 6 d, TGF-β–induced Tregs have lost Foxp3 expression during the 6-d restimulation period to variable degrees, and initial results point toward an almost complete loss of the partial demethylation of the CpG motifs within amplicons 1 and 2 in the restimulated TGF-β cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050038-g007">Figure 7</xref>, and unpublished data). To rule out selective outgrowth of Foxp3<sup>−</sup> cells or enhanced cell death of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells during restimulation, we performed TGF-β cultures with CD25<sup>−</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from GFP-Foxp3 reporter mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b007">7</xref>], which allowed sorting of TGF-β–induced Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs to a purity greater than 99% before restimulation. In other control experiments, we either labeled TGF-β–induced Tregs with CFSE before restimulation or did spiking experiments with Foxp3<sup>−</sup> T cells. In none of these control experiments was outgrowth of Foxp3<sup>−</sup> cells or massive cell death observed (unpublished data), confirming our previous assumption that Foxp3 expression in TGF-β–induced Tregs is lost during restimulation in the absence of TGF-β. Importantly, loss of Foxp3 expression was strictly associated with loss of suppressive activity when tested in in vitro proliferation assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050038-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Viewed as a whole, our data strongly suggest that complete demethylation of CpG motifs within the <italic>foxp3</italic> locus is required to stabilize both Foxp3 expression and suppressive capacity.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The forkhead box transcription factor Foxp3 has been identified as a specific molecular marker for Tregs, and its expression is essential for programming Treg development and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b002">2</xref>]. Although it is widely accepted that Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs represent a stable population mainly generated as a separate lineage in the thymus, conclusive data on the molecular mechanisms maintaining stable Foxp3 expression are not available. We here provide evidence that epigenetic modifications of the <italic>foxp3</italic> locus are required to enable long-term identity of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs.</p>
      <p>We have identified an element within the 5′ untranslated region of the <italic>foxp3</italic> locus, TSDR (Treg-specific demethylated region), which displays demethylated CpG motifs both in developing thymic as well as in mature, peripheral murine Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs. Interestingly, the differentially methylated element is evolutionarily conserved. Preliminary analyses using cells from human peripheral blood also showed a differential methylation of CpG motifs within the conserved element of the <italic>foxp3</italic> locus when conventional CD25<sup>−</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD25<sup>high</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs were compared, implying that this region and its epigenetic regulation is of functional importance (unpublished data).</p>
      <p>In addition to DNA demethylation, acetylated histones H3 and H4 as well as trimethylated histone H3 were associated with the conserved region in CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs, but not in conventional CD25<sup>−</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Similar histone modifications have frequently been reported to concur with DNA demethylation, e.g., as described for the loci encoding the active cytokines interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and IL-4 in differentiated Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b020">20</xref>]. These data suggest that in terminally differentiated Tregs, epigenetic modifications of the <italic>foxp3</italic> locus allow persistent expression of Foxp3.</p>
      <p>The human FOXP3 promoter has recently been mapped to the putative 5′ end of exon-2b, 6.1 kb upstream from the first coding exon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b006">6</xref>]. However, other studies have reported promoter activity upstream from exon-1 close to the differentially methylated region analyzed in the current study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b027">27</xref>] corresponding to the Foxp3 mRNA species AY357712 and AY357713. We could show here by performing luciferase assays that the differentially methylated region itself possesses transcriptional activity. Together these data suggest that the evolutionarily conserved element might belong to an alternative TATA-less promoter, which contributes to the regulation of Foxp3 expression.</p>
      <p>The differential methylation status of the <italic>foxp3</italic> locus in Tregs appears to be a new example for epigenetic regulation of cell lineage differentiation. Although almost all cells in an individual contain the same complement of DNA code, higher organisms must impose and maintain different patterns of gene expression in the various types of differentiated cells. Most gene regulation is transitory, depending on the current state of the cell and changes in external stimuli. Persistent regulation, on the other hand, is a primary role of epigenetics: heritable regulatory patterns that do not alter the basic genetic coding of the DNA. DNA methylation is the archetypical form of epigenetic regulation; it serves as the stable memory for cells and performs a crucial role in maintaining the long-term identity of various cell types. Our finding that evolutionarily conserved sequences within the <italic>foxp3</italic> locus are completely and selectively demethylated upon differentiation into persistent Tregs suggests an important role of epigenetic fixation for this phenotype.</p>
      <p>Moreover, this seems to be the first report that a transcription factor acting as a master switch for a certain subpopulation is itself subject to epigenetic control. The role of transcription factors such as T-bet or GATA-3 for the polarization of Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively, has been carefully studied, and their interplay with epigenetically regulated regions in the respective cytokine genes is seen as a major factor in the acquisition of cytokine memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b019">19</xref>]. However, <italic>foxp3</italic> appears to be the first known example, at least in the immune system, in which the transcriptional regulation of a master transcription factor itself involves epigenetic mechanisms.</p>
      <p>A crucial finding of this study is that chromatin remodeling of the <italic>foxp3</italic> locus does not merely correlate with Foxp3 expression. Rather, our current data provide first experimental evidence that the completely demethylated status of the evolutionarily conserved region is only confined to stable Treg populations, such as the naturally occurring, thymus-derived CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> cells, and might indeed be a prerequisite for the permanent commitment to the suppressor cell lineage. This assumption is based on the analysis of TGF-β–induced Tregs, which, despite Foxp3 expression and suppressive properties, have not acquired a terminally differentiated phenotype and have lost both Foxp3 expression and suppressive capacity upon restimulation in the absence of TGF-β. This indicates that the recently postulated positive autoregulatory loop involving up-regulation of endogenous TGF-β expression and subsequent Foxp3-dependent down-regulation of Smad7, a negative regulator of TGF-β signaling, is not sufficient to induce stable Foxp3 expression in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b015">15</xref>]. As TGF-β–induced Tregs display only weakly demethylated CpG motifs within the conserved region of the <italic>foxp3</italic> locus, a more complete CpG demethylation might be the key for a stable Foxp3 expression, similar to what has recently been reported for IL-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b023">23</xref>].</p>
      <p>The findings of this study have important implications with respect to clinical applications. First, determination of the methylation status might allow a better identification and quality control of Tregs considered for cellular therapy concepts of autoimmune diseases, graft-versus-host diseases, or transplant rejections. Temporary expression of FOXP3 can be detected in activated T cells lacking regulatory function, especially in the human system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b029">29</xref>]. Analysis of the methylation status of the <italic>foxp3</italic> locus promises to be a more reliable marker for the successful conversion of conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into a stable population of suppressor cells.</p>
      <p>Second, detection of demethylated <italic>foxp3</italic> sequences might allow the development of novel diagnostic tools for the quantification of Tregs in blood or tissues. Both in autoimmune disease and tumor patients, a correlation between Treg number and/or activity and disease status has been observed in a number of recent studies. Decreased activity and/or number of Tregs has been noted to be associated with myasthenia gravis, autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type II, ulcerative colitis, and multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b036">36</xref>]. In contrast, an increased number of Tregs was observed in patients with a variety of malignant cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b039">39</xref>], and might be involved in tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b042">42</xref>]. Most notably, presence of Tregs, as defined by gene expression of FOXP3, has been shown to constitute a significant predictive parameter for the clinical outcome in ovarian cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b041">41</xref>]. However, the analytical value of flow cytometry, immunohistological, and mRNA expression analysis of CD25 and Foxp3 as accurate diagnostic tools is blurred by both ambiguity of the markers and instability of the biological materials. In contrast, our current data show that DNA demethylation at the <italic>foxp3</italic> locus, both in mice and humans, strictly coincides with the generation of stable Tregs. Therefore, measurement of the methylation status of the <italic>foxp3</italic> locus could present a more reliable and objective criterion for the identification and quantification of Tregs. Moreover, DNA methylation is intrinsically a more stable parameter than mRNA expression or protein synthesis, and can be accurately quantified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b043">43</xref>]. Therefore, we believe that establishment of a measurement system for the methylation status of the human <italic>foxp3</italic> locus may provide a novel diagnostic tool both in tumor and in autoimmune disease patients.</p>

        <title>Bisulphite sequencing.</title>
        <p>Genomic DNA was isolated from purified T cells using the DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California, United States) following the supplier's recommendations. Sodium bisulphite treatment of genomic DNA was performed according to Olek et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050038-b046">46</xref>] with minor modifications, resulting in the deamination of unmethylated cytosines to uracil, whereas methylated cytosines remain unchanged. In a subsequent PCR amplification, uracils were replicated as thymidines. Thus, detection of a “C” in sequencing reactions reflects methylation of the genomic DNA at that site. Detection of a “T” at the same site reflects instead the absence of a methyl modification of the genomic cytosine.</p>
        <p>PCRs were performed on MJ Research thermocyclers (Waltham, Massachusetts, United States) in a final volume of 25 μl containing 1× PCR Buffer, 1-U Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen), 200 μM dNTPs, 12.5 pmol each of forward and reverse primers, and 7 ng of bisulphite-treated genomic DNA. The amplification conditions were 95 °C for 15 min and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 45 sec, and 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension step of 10 min at 72 °C. PCR products were purified using ExoSAP-IT (USB Corp, Staufen, Germany) and sequenced in both directions applying the PCR primers and the ABI Big Dye Terminator v1.1 cycle sequencing chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, United States), followed by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI 3100 genetic analyzer.
