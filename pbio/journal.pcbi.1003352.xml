<abstract>
<p>The contact structure between hosts shapes disease spread. Most network-based models used in epidemiology tend to ignore heterogeneity in the weighting of contacts between two individuals. However, this assumption is known to be at odds with the data for many networks (e.g. sexual contact networks) and to have a critical influence on epidemics' behavior. One of the reasons why models usually ignore heterogeneity in transmission is that we currently lack tools to analyze weighted networks, such that most studies rely on numerical simulations. Here, we present a novel framework to estimate key epidemiological variables, such as the rate of early epidemic expansion (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and the basic reproductive ratio (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), from joint probability distributions of number of partners (contacts) and number of interaction events through which contacts are weighted. These distributions are much easier to infer than the exact shape of the network, which makes the approach widely applicable. The framework also allows for a derivation of the full time course of epidemic prevalence and contact behaviour, which we validate with numerical simulations on networks. Overall, incorporating more realistic contact networks into epidemiological models can improve our understanding of the emergence and spread of infectious diseases.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Understanding how infectious diseases spread has public health and ecological implications. The contact structure between hosts strongly affects this spread. However, most studies assume that all types of contacts are identical, when in reality some individuals interact more strongly than others. This is particularly striking for sexual-contact networks, where the number of sex acts is not identical for all partnerships. This heterogeneity in activity can either speed up or slow down epidemic spread depending on how strongly the individuals' number of contacts coincides with their activity. There are two limitations to current frameworks that can explain the lack of studies on weighted networks. First, analytical results are difficult to obtain, which requires numerical simulations. Second, inferring weighted networks from survey data is extremely difficult. Here, we present a novel framework that allows to alleviate these two limitations. Building on configuration type network epidemic approaches, we manage to capture disease spread on weighted networks from the distribution of the number of contacts and distribution of the number of interaction events (e.g. sex acts). This allows us to derive analytical estimates for the epidemic threshold and the rate of spread of the disease. It also allows us to readily incorporate survey data, as illustrated in this study with data from the National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (NATSAL) carried out in the UK.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Contact structure between hosts is known to have a key influence on disease spread <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Anderson1">[1]</xref>. A striking result is for instance that the more heterogeneous the contact network is, i.e. the higher the variance in the number of contacts per individual, the more rapid the initial disease spread.</p>
<p>One way to capture contact structure is to use a network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Newman1">[2]</xref>. Such contact networks are typically described by a square binary adjacency matrix, where each term on the <italic>i</italic>th line and <italic>j</italic>th column can take the value 0 or 1 to indicate respectively the absence or the presence of a contact between individuals <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic>. Contact networks are widely used because they possess several convenient properties, one of which being that the dominant eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix is an indicator of the initial propagation speed of an infectious disease spreading on this network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Li1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-MoslonkaLefebvre1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>The main limitation of contact networks is that their exact shape is often difficult to infer. This is why there is a continuous effort to predict disease spread from network summary statistics that are easier to estimate, such as the distribution of the number of contacts (degrees). For instance, the number of secondary infections generated by a typical infected host in a fully susceptible population, i.e. the basic reproductive number <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Anderson1">[1]</xref>, scales with the ratio of the second moment <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and first moment (mean) <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the distribution in the number of contacts <italic>k</italic>. This result holds both for static networks (denoted <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Durrett1">[5]</xref> as well as for fully mixed, dynamic networks (denoted <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-May1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Moreno1">[7]</xref> with<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003352.e008"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e008" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1a)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula id="pcbi.1003352.e009"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e009" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1b)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the variance of the distribution of the number of contacts. The static case corresponds to networks in which the identity of contacts is fixed (as approximatively seen in sexual contact networks) and the fully mixed dynamic case corresponds to a situation in which individuals update their contacts dynamically in a fully mixed fashion within the population (as approximatively seen in airborne infections).</p>
<p><inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represent the lower and upper bounds of the basic reproductive ratio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Volz1">[8]</xref> for SIR epidemics on random networks if individuals transmit the infection at a rate <italic>β</italic> and recover from the infection at a rate <italic>γ</italic>. On both static and dynamic heterogeneous networks with a large or even diverging variance in the distribution of the number of contacts, epidemics die out only for very small or even vanishing transmission rates <italic>β</italic>.</p>
<p>One of the typical key assumptions epidemiological models on networks make to obtain such elegant expressions for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is that the transmission rate is the same between all pairs of individuals. This is materialized by the fact that all the edges of the contact matrix have a weight of 0 or 1. This is known to be a simplifying assumption <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Barrat1">[9]</xref>. A well-studied example related to infectious diseases is that of sexual contact networks, where the number of sex acts per unit of time is not constant in all partnerships <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Blower1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Britton1">[12]</xref>. More generally, the number of interaction events (which correspond to potential transmission events) may vary among contact pairs and is likely to decrease with the number of contacts an individual has (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003352.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Simplifying the reality is commendable but the problem is that tampering with the weighting of the network has been shown to lead to the loss of important epidemiological properties of heterogeneous unweighted networks, such as the low value of the epidemiological threshold or the negative correlation between the epidemiological threshold value and network size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-MoslonkaLefebvre2">[13]</xref>. To summarize, although contact networks appear to be ‘scale free’ in structure, they might not exhibit the properties one might expect from this structure.</p>
<p>An increasing number of studies in epidemiology point to the importance of considering weighted networks. Some examples include the spread of sexually-transmitted infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-MoslonkaLefebvre2">[13]</xref>, disease transmission in sheep flocks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Schley1">[14]</xref>, respiratory diseases of humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Stehl1">[15]</xref> or general infectious diseases of human spreading on a social contact network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Eames1">[16]</xref> or on airline connection networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Colizza1">[17]</xref>. Several more conceptual studies have also been published in the theoretical physics literature (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Newman1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Joo1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Britton2">[20]</xref>). Most of these studies have in common that they use weighted networks and resort to (heavy) numerical simulations. Indeed, contrary to unweighted networks, we lack analytical frameworks to analyze epidemic spread on weighted networks.</p>
<p>Here, we present an original framework, which builds on configuration type network epidemic approaches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Volz2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Kamp1">[22]</xref> that offers an alternative to simulating epidemics on full networks. It allows to model the dynamics of a disease spreading on a weighted network and to estimate key epidemiological variables from the network's properties. The framework provides us with explicit expressions for the rate of early epidemic expansion (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and the basic reproductive ratio (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) of the infection without requiring strong simplifying assumptions regarding epidemiological processes or the distribution of weights on the contact network. It also allows for a derivation of the full time course of epidemic prevalence and contact behaviour of susceptible, infected and recovered individuals (in terms of the probability generating functions – PGFs – of the degree distributions). As sketched in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003352-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, the parametrisation is done in a general fashion using the joint probability distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of an individual to have <italic>k</italic> contacts among which (s)he randomly distributes <italic>l</italic> interaction events. We validate our analytical results using numerical simulations on networks.</p>

<title>Weighting between contacts.</title>
<p>Both the number of contacts that an individual maintains and the weight that (s)he assigns to each contact are relevant for the spread of an infectious agent. Here, each individual has <italic>l</italic> interaction events that (s)he can distribute among his/her <italic>k</italic> contacts. On the scale of the transmission network, these are modelled by the joint probability distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to find an individual with <italic>k</italic> contacts and <italic>l</italic> interaction events per time interval.</p>

<p>Importantly, since this framework relies on summary statistics of the network and does not require knowledge of the exact shape of the network, it can be parametrized using large scale survey data. The network information we lose by using these summary statistics requires that we make the assumption that there is no assortativity between individuals in our framework. However, we show that even with these assumption we can approximate epidemic dynamics better than with non weighted networks.</p>

<title>The configuration model</title>
<p>Individuals have <italic>k</italic> contacts and <italic>l</italic> interaction events per time interval, which are distributed among their <italic>k</italic> contacts (<italic>l</italic> is sometimes also referred to as the strength of the node <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Barrat1">[9]</xref>).</p>
<p>The model is broadly applicable as it can be parameterised through any joint probability distribution of the number of partners (<italic>k</italic>) and number of interaction events (<italic>l</italic>). Such a joint probability distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> can be written as the product <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> being the probability distribution of the number of interaction events per time <italic>l</italic> given that the individual has <italic>k</italic> contacts. If <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is 1 if <italic>l</italic> = <italic>k</italic> and 0 otherwise, we are then back to a ‘classical’ network case, with an exact linear dependency between the number of contacts and the number of interaction events (for a detailed <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">discussion</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003352.s006">Text S1</xref>, Section D, <italic>The recovery of the classical equations in the linear case</italic>). Our framework can capture more general situations by explicitly choosing <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>Our analytical approximation assumes that an individual distributes his/her <italic>l</italic> interaction events multinomially among his/her <italic>k</italic> contacts, which are static and are randomly assigned as in configuration models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Volz2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Kamp1">[22]</xref>. This individual is infected at a rate proportional to his/her average number of interaction events with <italic>i</italic> infected contacts among his/her total <italic>k</italic> contacts (so <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). This averaging implies the choice of a time scale for the number of interaction events such that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (the network shape is assumed to be constant over the time period considered so the number of contacts is not affected by the time scale). The analytical approach only relies on the nodes' statistics and does not consider the constraints for half-contacts to match half-contacts with similar weight, whereas in reality, the weight on a link between two nodes should be the same for the two nodes. This could lead to an unrealistic network segregation for some artificial networks where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This network segregation can affect epidemic dynamics in these networks in a way that is not seen in the analytical approach <italic>per se</italic> but can be considered through corrections in the analytical approach as we discuss later on.</p>

<title>Generating networks from PGF</title>
<p>Networks were generated by assigning each host a number <italic>k</italic> of ‘half-contacts’ (stubs) and <italic>l</italic> interaction events per time interval drawn from the distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Each host then shared his/her interaction events equi-probably at random (i.e. multinomially) among his/her <italic>k</italic> contacts. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was chosen to satisfy <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> corresponding to a timescale in which a host has on average 2 interaction events per contact.</p>
<p>The matching of half-contacts (stubs) was done at random but by respecting their assigned number of interaction events per contact. The problem is that not all probability distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> can be realised topologically within a network. Indeed, weighting of interactions between contacts can impose strong constraints on network topology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Serrano1">[23]</xref>. The fact that contacts can only occur between stubs with the same weight can lead to network segregation and assortative effects that are not seen in the analytical approach <italic>per se</italic> due to its node-centric view (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003352.s006">Text S1</xref>, Section E, <italic>Network segregation and the limiting case</italic> <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e089" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). It is even possible to devise joint probability distributions <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e090" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that cannot be represented through a network topology (although this is not a problem for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e091" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> empirically derived from realised networks). In simulated networks, this necessity for exact matching segregates the network into subnetworks, which can show assortativity either with respect to the degree of connected nodes or with respect to their edge weights.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c3">
<title>Correcting for assortativity</title>
<p>If the number of interaction events per time and per contact is large (i.e. if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e092" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), hosts nearly equi-distribute their interaction events among all their contacts due to convergence under the law of large numbers. Decreasing <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> yields a more realistic network, as this introduces some variability in the number of interaction events among a host's contacts, which offers more flexibility in the assignment of interaction events on short time scales and reduces assortative effects.</p>
<p><italic>Weight assortativity</italic> arises in networks that have a (nearly) constant number of contacts <italic>k</italic> per individual and where the number of interaction events <italic>l</italic> is distributed in a heterogeneous way, thus leading to an early expansion among the most highly active individuals. This can accelerate the initial expansion of an epidemic but, at the same time, it also constrains disease spread compared to what one could expect from the analytical approach. Alternatively, the network can also segregate with respect to the number of contacts an individual holds (i.e. <italic>contact or degree assortativity</italic>). An extreme case can be observed when a (nearly) constant number of interaction events has to be distributed among a heterogeneous number of contacts. This leads to a (near) isolation of individuals with single contacts from the epidemic process (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003352.s006">Text S1</xref>, Section E, <italic>Network segregation and the limiting case</italic> <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e094" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>).</p>
<p>We can introduce some tolerance in ‘negotiating’ the number of interaction events per contact. Another way to deal with weight and degree correlations between neighbouring individuals is to drop the assumption that weights are multinomially distributed among an individual's contact. Indeed, heterogeneous weight distributions among an individual's contacts can reduce correlations among neighbouring individuals' degrees and weights <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Serrano1">[23]</xref>. However, this cannot be done without changing <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e095" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to an empirical distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e096" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, while at the same time deviations might arise from the analytical approach as the assumption of multinomial distribution of weights is violated.</p>

<title>Simulations on weighted networks</title>
<p>Networks for simulation are obtained by first generating 10,000 nodes with <italic>k</italic> half-contacts (stubs) and <italic>l</italic> interaction events as drawn from the probability distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e097" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The <italic>l</italic> interaction events a node has are then distributed multinomially among its <italic>k</italic> stubs. Stubs are randomly matched together, with matches being rejected if the weights of the stubs differ by more than one interaction event. In addition matches are rejected if they differ by more than 10% of the smaller weight involved to avoid biases in nodes with few links. If stubs with non-identical weights are matched, the contact is assigned the mean weight randomly rounded to the next integer. This results in the empirical distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e098" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as mentioned in the previous subsection.</p>

<p>As there is no explicit expression for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> we have to rely on approximate equations that are valid in the early stages of an epidemic. In the mean field approximation, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e107" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is approximated by the number of infected individuals (<italic>I</italic>) and the average number of contacts per individual found originally in the total population (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e108" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). As soon as the epidemic is set, i.e. once we are beyond the mean field approximation relying on a randomly picked node, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e109" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is given by the product of <italic>I</italic> and a slightly more sophisticated estimate of the number of contacts of infected hosts than in the mean field approximation.

<title>Validation of the analytical model with simulations on networks</title>
<p>In order to test our analytical model, we consider epidemiological dynamics taking place on artificial networks on which we release the constraints found in ‘classical’/unweighted networks by assuming that the number of interaction events <italic>l</italic> an individual has does not necessarily increase linearly with his/her number of partners <italic>k</italic>. To create these networks, we used combinations of Poisson and power law distributions for the number of contacts <italic>k</italic> and interaction events per time <italic>l</italic>.

<p>Overall, the analytical approach matches the simulation results well if the constraints imposed by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e160" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on the specific networks topology are properly taken into account. The assortativity correction (in orange) is most relevant for a heterogeneous distribution of contacts (<italic>k</italic> follows a power law) and a homogeneous distribution of interaction events (<italic>l</italic> is Poisson distributed). This is because the strongest constraints on network topology are expected to occur with these distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003352-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, top panel, right side). On the contrary, for more homogeneous networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003352-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, left panel), the assortativity correction is less needed. In the linear case, the correction is not relevant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003352-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, bottom panel).</p>
<p>A particularly interesting observation is that epidemics spread slower on networks with heterogeneous contacts if the network is weighted than if the number of interaction events scales linearly with the number of contacts for each individual (i.e. ‘classical’ linear networks). This is particularly true in networks where the average weight per contact is inversely proportional to the number of contacts an individual has. In our simulations, this effect is the clearest when <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e161" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> follows a power law distribution and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e162" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> a Poisson distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003352-g002">Fig. 2</xref> top panel, right side).</p>

<title>Capturing epidemic characteristics (expressions for <italic>r</italic><sub>0</sub> and <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>)</title>
<p>There are different ways to assess the initial propagation of an infectious agent in an otherwise fully susceptible population. One possibility is to estimate the initial exponential growth rate in the number of infected individuals (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e163" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Another possibility consists in estimating the number of secondary cases created by a newly infected host in a fully susceptible population, which is classically referred to as the basic reproductive ratio <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e164" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Anderson1">[1]</xref>.</p>
<p>Subtle effects arise depending on whether we choose the neighbourhood of a random individual as a reference or the neighbourhood of a ‘typically’ infected individual. The first case corresponds to what is usually referred to as a ‘mean field approximation’ and captures well the very first infection events. The second case (using a ‘typical’ infected individual) is more appropriate to capture the next stages of early epidemic expansion because it accounts for the fact that spatial structure has been sensed or set by the epidemic process.

Such sexual contact networks have been surveyed in many studies covering homosexual as well as heterosexual populations and different societal contexts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Schneeberger1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Hamilton1">[29]</xref> to understand and prevent the spread of STI. The National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (NATSAL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Johnson1">[28]</xref>) provides detailed data on the situation in the United Kingdom, including distributions in the number of sexual partners (<italic>k</italic>) and sex acts (interaction events, <italic>l</italic>) a person has within certain time frames.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003352-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, both the number of partners (contacts, <italic>k</italic>) and sex acts (interaction events, <italic>l</italic>) an individual has are heterogeneously distributed. However, their joint distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e205" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> does not show a linear behaviour, implying that the number of sex acts <italic>l</italic> does not scale linearly with the number of partners <italic>k</italic> an individual has. This is also supported by Pearson's correlation coefficient which is 0.15, i.e. positive but not indicating a strong linear relationship between <italic>k</italic> and <italic>l</italic> (see also Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003352.s003">Figure S3</xref>). When they combine a linear relationship between number of partners and number of sex acts with the observed broad distributions of sexual contacts and sex acts, several models predict extremely rapid early epidemic expansion and an epidemic threshold that is potentially vanishing in the limit of infinite network size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Durrett1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Volz1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Boguna1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Bansal1">[31]</xref>, as can be seen from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003352.e009">equation (1)</xref>.</p>

<p>A) Characteristics of the heterosexual contact network inferred from the NATSAL contact tracing study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Johnson1">[28]</xref>. The network shows a heterogeneous joint probability distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e206" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which is the probability for an individual to have <italic>k</italic> contacts during the last 5 years and <italic>l</italic> sex acts during the last 4 weeks (higher values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e207" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are in red and lower values are in green). This heterogeneity is also seen for the marginal distributions <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e208" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (on the right) and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e209" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (on the top). B) Dynamics of an SI epidemic spreading on an unweighted (black line) or a weighted sexual contact network. The results of simulations on the weighted network are in grey, the approximations of our model are in red or in orange for the case with assortativity correction. The network has been reduced to nodes with <italic>k</italic>&gt;0 and transmission probability per sex act is <italic>β</italic> = 0.01. C) Dynamics of the average number of contacts <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e210" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of susceptible (in green) and infected individuals (in red) over the course of an epidemic spreading on the weighted network. The inset shows the probability of a host to be susceptible or infected at <italic>t</italic> = 10 years conditioned to the number of contacts during the last 5 years (more or less than 3 contacts).

In Panels B, C and D, the weighting is done using the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e212" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> shown in panel A. Individuals with more contacts tend to be disproportionally infected (panel C). Individuals with more sex acts tend to be even more infected (panel D).</p>

<p>In our ‘Validation’ section we have shown that, regarding the number of interaction events, a deviation from the linear behaviour decreases epidemic expansion and peak prevalence, especially for transmission networks that are characterized by a heterogeneous distribution in the number of contacts per individual <italic>k</italic> and regardless of whether the distribution of interaction events/sex acts is homogeneous (Poisson) or heterogeneous (power law). This is also reflected more quantitatively in the expression for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e213" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which is dominated by the second moment <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e214" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e215" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In other words, (as explained above when interpreting our approximations) the more the number of partners (<italic>k</italic>) correlates with their number of sex acts (<italic>l</italic>) the faster the early epidemic expansion.</p>
<p>These differences between weighted and unweighted networks are visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003352-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, which shows the epidemic expansion of a susceptible-infected (SI) epidemic with transmission probability <italic>β</italic> = 0.01 per sex act in two scenarios. We chose to model SI dynamics by setting <italic>γ</italic> = 0 in order to simulate HIV spreading on a short time scale, but the model could be evaluated with analogous results for SIR dynamics (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003352.s006">Text S1</xref>, Section G, <italic>Captions of the Supplementary Figures</italic>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003352.s001">Figure S1</xref>). In the first scenario (black curve, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003352-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), the number of sex acts grows linearly with the number of contacts respecting the average number of sex acts (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e216" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> during 4 weeks). In the second scenario we use a weighted network, where the joint probability distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e217" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is obtained from the NATSAL data (red curve, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003352-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>) and can be complemented by a correction for assortative effects (orange curve, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003352-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>The exponential growth rates of the epidemics are <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e218" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> per year for the linear, unweighted, network and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e219" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> per year for the weighted network. This confirms that the ‘linear’ scenario supports faster epidemic expansion. The correction for assortative effects underestimates the epidemic prevalence in the network because in the NATSAL network heterogeneity in the number of contacts and interaction events does not lead to a strong network segregation, i.e. individuals with a single or few contacts are not isolated (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003352-g002">Fig. 2</xref> and the case in which both <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e220" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e221" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> follow power law distributions). Although the survey data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003352-g003">Fig. 3A</xref> only provide us with a rough picture of the real transmission network and although relying on the number of partners during 5 years overestimates the number of concurrent partners, the data are sufficient to confirm a remarkable reduction in the speed of epidemic expansion when shifting from a classical unweighted transmission network towards a more realistic weighted transmission network. This finding is in particular consistent with an earlier simulation study on epidemic spreading along a network of homosexual contacts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-MoslonkaLefebvre2">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>The framework can also be used to follow the dynamics in the epidemic subgroups and to identify risk groups along the course of the epidemics (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003352.s006">Text S1</xref>, Section B, <italic>Conditional probabilities and risk groups</italic>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003352-g003">Fig. 3C and D</xref> show that the average number of contacts <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e222" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and sex acts <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e223" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> per individual increases early on in the infected population and decreases in the healthy population. This reflects the over-representation of some individuals among those being infected as sketched by the insets: during the epidemic (here shown at <italic>t</italic> = 10 years) the probability of being infected grows with the number of contacts <italic>k</italic> an individual has, and even more so with the number of sex acts <italic>l</italic> (s)he has.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Network theory has broadened our understanding of the spread of infectious agents — or other entities such as information, money, travellers or goods — in complex settings. In their simplest form, network models do not consider that contacts may show variability in their transmission capacity. However, the probability of disease transmission along a contact strongly depends on the intensity of the contact, transportation links vary in their throughput and information may not be shared equally among all possible channels. Although earlier studies have shown that this weighting in terms of interactions between contacts has non-negligible impact on the spreading dynamics, the modelling of epidemics on weighted networks largely focuses on simulation studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-MoslonkaLefebvre2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Eames1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Chu1">[32]</xref>, regular networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Rattana1">[33]</xref>, mean field approximations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Chu2">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Yang1">[35]</xref> or discrete time dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Britton2">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Deijfen1">[36]</xref>. Therefore, explicit expressions for epidemic characteristics such as the basic reproductive ratio <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e224" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are available only in special cases.</p>
<p>It is possible to simplify the epidemiology by using a Reed-Frost model. For this, one needs to assume that infections take place in discrete time steps, with non-overlapping generations and that each infected individual recovers with certainty one time step after infection. These simplifications allow to assess outbreak probabilities using branching processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Britton2">[20]</xref>. In this formalism, as shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Deijfen1">[36]</xref>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e225" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, denoted <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e226" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, can be derived as the dominant eigenvalue of the mean offspring matrix (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e227" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e228" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represents the expected number of individuals with <italic>k</italic> contacts that an individual with <italic>d</italic> contacts infects considering potentially degree-dependent network weights. Importantly, it is only because Britton <italic>et al.</italic> make strong simplifying assumptions in their model, such as the independence between network weights and nodes' degrees, that they can derive an explicit form of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e229" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In contrast to our findings on NATSAL data, the Reed-Frost approach systematically predicts negative exponential growth rates of the epidemics for both scenarios (the network average of linear case is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e230" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and that of survey data case is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e231" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). The discrepancy between our model and that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Britton2">[20]</xref> stems from the implicit assumption of the Reed-Frost model with discrete time steps they use, which is that recovery occurs immediately after infection and therefore that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e232" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>We extend earlier results by developing a framework based on partial differential equations that allows to model continuous time SIR epidemic dynamics for general weighted networks defined through the joint probability distribution for an individual to have <italic>k</italic> contacts and <italic>l</italic> interaction events. From this we are able to derive the full epidemic dynamics in terms of the number of susceptible, infected and recovered individuals over time as well as explicit expressions for the basic reproductive ratio <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e233" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the exponent of early epidemic expansion <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352.e234" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The application of the method to epidemics on artificial and empirically-motivated networks matches well with simulation results on these same networks. Moreover, it also stresses the impact of assortative effects introduced by contact weighting on epidemic dynamics; an aspect that will need closer attention in future research.</p>
<p>One limitation to our approach is due to potential errors in the inference of the network. There are known biases in the self-reporting of number of partners (with different trends between men and women <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Smith1">[37]</xref>) and self-reported number of sex acts are likely to exhibit similar biases. One extension of this study would be to see how such noise in the network inference could affect epidemic spread. Our intuition is that the consequences should be less important than for non weighted networks because heterogeneity in the weights is already likely to dampen striking network properties in terms of disease spread <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-MoslonkaLefebvre2">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>As many earlier methods, ours analyses model disease spread on networks from a node centric summary statistics, by considering the number of contacts and transmission events per time. Therefore, it inherently neglects correlation between nodes. In other words there is no consideration of assortativity between individuals based on their number of contacts or transmission events per time. At the same time, individuals share their activity randomly among all their contacts (weights are homogeneously, or multinomially, distributed among edges that leave a node), which can enforce correlations among nodes in certain networks. Also clustering is observed in many contact networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003352-Danon1">[38]</xref> and this issue should be addressed in an extended version of our model.</p>
<p>Most analytical and numerical models predict disease spread on network using only one summary statistics, the distribution of the number of partners. We show that additional insights can be gained, while maintaining some analytical results, by including another summary statistics, such as the distribution of the number of sex acts knowing the number of partners. These data are easier to collect than full information of the contact network (especially for a weighted network), which makes our framework widely applicable. We demonstrate this applicability here using data from the NATSAL study conducted in the UK. We note that for some artificial distributions, our results begin to diverge from simulations on real networks. However, the framework has proven to be applicable for empirical distributions and analysis of more empirical data will allows us to further test the robustness of the method using more realistic assumptions.</p>
