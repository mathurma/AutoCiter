<abstract>
<p>Simple models of therapy for viral diseases such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus assume that, once therapy is started, the drug has a constant effectiveness. More realistic models have assumed either that the drug effectiveness depends on the drug concentration or that the effectiveness varies over time. Here a previously introduced varying-effectiveness (VE) model is studied mathematically in the context of HCV infection. We show that while the model is linear, it has no closed-form solution due to the time-varying nature of the effectiveness. We then show that the model can be transformed into a Bessel equation and derive an analytic solution in terms of modified Bessel functions, which are defined as infinite series, with time-varying arguments. Fitting the solution to data from HCV infected patients under therapy has yielded values for the parameters in the model. We show that for biologically realistic parameters, the predicted viral decay on therapy is generally biphasic and resembles that predicted by constant-effectiveness (CE) models. We introduce a general method for determining the time at which the transition between decay phases occurs based on calculating the point of maximum curvature of the viral decay curve. For the parameter regimes of interest, we also find approximate solutions for the VE model and establish the asymptotic behavior of the system. We show that the rate of second phase decay is determined by the death rate of infected cells multiplied by the maximum effectiveness of therapy, whereas the rate of first phase decline depends on multiple parameters including the rate of increase of drug effectiveness with time.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Fitting simple models of therapy for viral diseases, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus, to patient data has yielded significant insights into the underlying viral dynamics. In general, these models assume that, once therapy is started, the drug has a constant effectiveness. More realistic assumptions are that drug effectiveness either depends directly on the drug concentration or varies over time. Here a previously introduced varying-effectiveness (VE) differential equation model is studied in the context of HCV infection. We show that the previously-unsolved VE model can be transformed into a Bessel equation and derive an analytic solution in terms of modified Bessel functions with time-varying arguments. These analytic solutions can be more readily used to fit the model to patient data than the underlying differential equations. We also find approximate solutions and establish the asymptotic behavior of the system. Typically viral load measurements exhibit a biphasic decline after therapy initiation. We show that the rate of second phase decay is determined by the death rate of infected cells multiplied by the maximum effectiveness of therapy, whereas the rate of first phase decline may depend on multiple parameters, resulting in differing first phase declines across various HCV therapies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects between 150 and 180 million people world-wide and is a major cause of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. A number of agents have been approved for treating HCV infection including pegylated interferon-alpha (PegIFN) and ribavirin (RBV); the HCV protease inhibitors telaprevir, boceprevir, and simeprevir; and the HCV polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Schneider1">[1]</xref>. A large number of other agents are being tested in clinical trials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Pawlotsky1">[2]</xref>.</p>
<p>An early model of HCV infection and treatment developed by Neumann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Neumann1">[3]</xref> showed that the effectiveness of antiviral therapy in blocking HCV production from infected cells could be estimated from the kinetics and extent of viral decline during the first few days of therapy. Neumann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Neumann1">[3]</xref> also showed that if plasma HCV RNA levels were measured frequently after treatment initiation with interferon one observed a biphasic decline after a short delay when the logarithm of HCV RNA/ml was plotted versus time on treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003769-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). This type of biphasic decline has now been observed with many different types of HCV treatments including those employing PegIFN and RBV, and a variety of HCV protease and polymerase inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Dixit1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Snoeck1">[10]</xref>.</p>

<p>The Neumann et al. model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Neumann1">[3]</xref> assumed that there was delay before interferon became active followed by a period in which it had constant effectiveness. Under reasonable assumptions, this leads to a model described by a set of linear, constant coefficient, ordinary differential equation that can easily be solved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Neumann1">[3]</xref>. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Models</xref>, such as that of Neumann et al., in which the drug effectiveness is constant or constant after a delay have been called constant effectiveness (CE) models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Shudo3">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Shudo4">[12]</xref>. In the case of interferon therapy we now know that the delay is caused by pharmacokinetics of the drug as well as the time needed for the drug to bind cell surface interferon receptors and cause upregulation of interferon stimulated genes, whose gene products then lead to reduced viral replication.</p>
<p>For pegylated interferon, which is approved for once weekly dosing, the pharmacokinetics of the drug lead to a loss of effectiveness towards the end of the dosing interval in many patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Powers1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Talal1">[14]</xref>. To account for this, a combined pharmacokinetic/viral kinetic model was introduced by Powers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Powers1">[13]</xref> and fit to both drug concentration and HCV RNA data by Talal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Talal1">[14]</xref>. However, in most clinical studies drug concentration data is not available for each patient. A phenomenological time-varying effectiveness (VE) model was therefore introduced by Shudo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Shudo3">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Shudo4">[12]</xref> and studied numerically. Guedj at al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Guedj2">[6]</xref> studying the effects of the HCV protease inhibitor telaprevir on viral decay kinetics showed that a VE model fit clinical data better than a CE model as assessed by the Akaike Information criterion, which allows one to compare the ability of models with different numbers of parameters to fit data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Burnham1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>This study was followed by two others by Guedj et al. using VE models to analyze the HCV RNA decay kinetics observed with the nucleoside polymerase inhibitor mericitabine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Guedj3">[16]</xref>, and with the HCV nucleotide polymerase inhibitors sofosbuvir and GS-0938 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Guedj4">[17]</xref>. In these cases, the VE model accounted for the fact that these drugs need to be triphosphorylated intracellularly to become active <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Ma1">[18]</xref>. More recently, Canini et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Canini1">[19]</xref> used a VE model to analyze the viral kinetics seen in a different set of patients treated with the drug silibinin, which appears to have activity as both a polymerase and entry inhibitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Dahari1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Guedj5">[21]</xref>. In all of these studies employing VE models, numerical methods were used to solve the time-varying equations. Here, we show how a previously used and prototypic VE model can be analyzed mathematically. We obtain an analytic solution to the time-varying problem in terms of modified Bessel functions, and a set of approximate solutions involving exponential decay functions.</p>

<title>Models</title>
<p>We model HCV viral dynamics at the initiation of treatment by modifying the standard constant effectiveness viral dynamic model of Neumann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Neumann1">[3]</xref>. For infected cells, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and viral load, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the model differential equations are <disp-formula id="pcbi.1003769.e005"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e005" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>We assume the number of target cells, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, is constant and takes on its pre-therapy steady-state value, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This is an approximation that is commonly made when analyzing clinical trial data obtained over a period of one or two weeks. In the case of Neumann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Neumann1">[3]</xref>, it was used to analyze data collected over two weeks.</p>
<p>In the model given by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003769.e005">equation (1</xref>), target cells are infected by virus, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, with mass-action infectivity <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Infected cells die at rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> per cell and virus clears at rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> per virion. The infection process may be hampered by drug treatment; the efficacy of treatment in blocking infection is given by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Infected cells produce virus at rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> per cell. Drug treatment may also interfere with viral production, with efficacy <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In the constant effectiveness (CE) model the drug efficacy is assumed to be constant, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In this case the solution for the viral load dynamics from (1) is <disp-formula id="pcbi.1003769.e018"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e018" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the viral load at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Neumann1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Guedj5">[21]</xref>. Here we assume the drug efficacy in blocking viral production, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, is time dependent, i.e. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, with a build-up of activity to a maximum <disp-formula id="pcbi.1003769.e025"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e025" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the maximum drug efficacy obtained with the concentration of drug used and the exponential scale <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> determines the speed at which the drug efficacy reaches its maximum (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). In principle, the effectiveness of treatment in blocking infection, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, could also be time dependent. Here we have chosen to ignore this possibility as no published data is available to guide such modeling efforts.</p>
<p>At treatment initiation (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) we assume the system is in steady state. Let the initial viral load, i.e., pre-treatment viral load set-point, be given by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Since we assume that pre-treatment <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, then <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> Further, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, so that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Since <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula></p>
<p>Substituting for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, our system becomes <disp-formula id="pcbi.1003769.e041"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e041" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula></p>

Examples are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003769-g001">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003769-g002">2</xref>, which show the log of the viral load after treatment initiation at time <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e165" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The transition time between the fast- and slow- decay phases, marked by a dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003769-g002">Fig. 2</xref> is also of clinical interest. For example, with silibinin treatment the transition time has been shown to vary with the patient's disease progression state (chronic HCV, compensated/decompensated cirrhosis) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Canini1">[19]</xref>.</p>

<p>At the transition time, the viral load curve has maximal curvature (c.f. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003769-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). The curvature of the plane curve <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e171" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e172" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, is given by <disp-formula id="pcbi.1003769.e173"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e173" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(14)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Edwards1">[27]</xref>. Therefore, to calculate the transition time, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e174" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we calculate the time when the curvature <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e175" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is maximized. To do this we numerically solve <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e176" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> using the analytic solution for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e177" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e178" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from (11).</p>
<p>We can use this curvature-based approach to analytically calculate the transition time for the CE model (2).

<title>Parameters: Typical behaviors of different drug classes</title>
<p>The model (1), with varying drug efficacy (12), has been used to investigate a number of drug treatments for HCV. Here we discuss therapy with four drugs: the protease inhibitors (PIs) telaprevir and danoprevir, the nucleoside polymerase inhibitor (NPI) mericitabine, and silibinin, a compound extracted from milk thistle seed. Silibinin is intriguing because, in addition to interfering with viral production as with the PIs and NPIs, it also appears to have some cell infection interference capabilities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Guedj5">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Blaising1">[28]</xref>.

<p>Interestingly, examining the dynamics under telaprevir treatment reveals that there are arguably three phases, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003769-g005">Figs. 5c,d</xref>. Note from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003769-g005">Fig. 5c</xref> that the full approximation (16) is very good. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003769-g005">Fig. 5d</xref>, the initial dynamics are well captured by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e333" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (exponential decay rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e334" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), and the long-term dynamics - as always - by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e335" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (exponential decay rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e336" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>).

<p>When there are more than two decay phases, for example as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003769-g005">Figs. 5c,d</xref>, the transition time calculation becomes more complicated. We compute the transition time as the time when the curvature <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e357" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the log-viral load decay curve is maximized, treating the curvature maximization problem as a non-linear root finding problem, i.e. solving <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e358" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e359" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Multiple phase decay would yield multiple transition time solutions, with transition times indicating transition between decay regimes (e.g. under telaprevir treatment, dominance of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e360" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e361" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e362" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003769-g005">Figs. 5c,d</xref>). Unfortunately, if the intermediate phase is not sufficiently distinct from the decay phases preceding and following it, the viral load decay may become too rounded, and our method may not give correct transition times.</p>
<p>The approximations (16) are valid for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e363" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> small, and therefore we expect the approximations to improve for smaller <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e364" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and larger <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e365" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (so that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e366" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> faster).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Viral dynamic models of infection and treatment have frequently described the effect of therapy by a parameter, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e432" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the effectiveness of therapy, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e433" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. For example, if therapy blocks production of new virus from infected cells, then the rate of production <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e434" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> under therapy is modeled as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e435" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, so that when the drug is 100% effective, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e436" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and no viral production occurs. This type of formulation has been used in modeling treatment for HIV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Perelson1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Perelson2">[30]</xref>, HBV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Tsiang1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Dahari2">[33]</xref>, HCV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Neumann1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Rong1">[7]</xref>, and influenza <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Baccam1">[34]</xref>. However, the effectiveness of a drug frequently depends on its concentration and more complex models incorporating drug pharmacokinetics (PK) and drug pharmacodynamics (PD) have also made their way into viral dynamic modeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Powers1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Talal1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Guedj4">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Beauchemin1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Murphy1">[37]</xref>.</p>
<p>In many cases, drug concentrations are not measured and detailed PK/PD modeling cannot be performed. Nonetheless, it is clear that variations in time occur in drug concentration. Further, drug activity can also be time-dependent particular when the drug given is a “pro-drug” that needs to be metabolized into an active compound. For example, nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors and polymerase inhibitors need to phosphorylated intracellularly to become active inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Dixit2">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Goldschmidt1">[39]</xref>. One mechanism to account for time dependent changes in drug activity is to assume that the drug effectiveness, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e437" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, rather than being constant is time dependent. Here we have studied in detail an HCV model in which the effectiveness increases with time to a maximum, assuming either <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e438" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or a more general form <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e439" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e440" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> plays the role of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e441" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We showed that the HCV model with time-varying effectiveness, previously used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Guedj2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Shudo3">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Shudo4">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Guedj3">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Guedj4">[17]</xref>, can be solved explicitly in terms of modified Bessel functions.</p>
<p>One reason the model equations can be solved analytically is that the assumption <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e442" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = constant is made, linearizing the mass-action infection term <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e443" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The assumption of constant <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e444" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> has typically been made when short-term (2 week or less) clinical trials are examined. However, the obtained solution may be more general, particularly for direct-acting antivirals. When therapy is very potent so the viral load rapidly decays many logs during the first days of therapy, as seen for example with daclatasvir, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e445" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> decays 3 logs in the first 12 hrs of therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Guedj6">[26]</xref>, the term <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e446" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> no longer significantly influences the dynamics. Thus, after a very brief transient, whether <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e447" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is constant or not may have no practical effect on the underlying viral dynamics. Guedj et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Guedj6">[26]</xref> showed this to be the case for daclatasvir by finding an extremely accurate approximate solution to the viral dynamic model they used by assuming there were no new infections after therapy started, i.e. that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e448" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 0.</p>
<p>Plotting the solution for the viral load, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e449" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, on a logscale we noticed that the virus appeared to decay with time on treatment in a biphasic manner for certain parameters of interest. Such biphasic declines have been observed in HCV patients treated with many different therapies and the lengths of each phase and the rates of decay during each phase are of biological interest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Canini1">[19]</xref>. We characterized the transition between phases as the point of maximum curvature in the solution, which can be computed from the solution. However, in order to ascertain the dominant decay rates during these two observable phases, we wanted to find approximations in terms of exponentials. While the model differential equations are sufficient to fit the data, the analysis that permits us to characterize the decay phases is only possible given the analytic solution. To this end, we examined classic approximations to Bessel functions as well as series expansions and showed that the long-time decay is dominated by the rate of loss of HCV-infected cells, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e450" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, as had previously been shown in constant effectiveness models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Neumann1">[3]</xref>. This is not surprising since at long times, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e451" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the drug effectiveness approaches a constant value, its maximum. At short times, the constant effectiveness model predicts the rate of viral decay is governed by the rate of viral clearance, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e452" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Here with the variable-effectiveness model we find that this need not be the case and more complex relationships between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e453" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e454" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e455" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> govern the short-term behavior. Using parameters estimated in previously published drug-treatment studies we showed how different combinations of parameters govern the short-term decay for different drug therapies. For example, when <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e456" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is large compared to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e457" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e458" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, as had been previously found for the HCV protease inhibitor danoprevir, the effectiveness rapidly approaches a constant and the first phase decline is essentially governed by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e459" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as in the constant effectiveness model. However, when <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e460" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is comparable to or small than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e461" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> this is no longer the case and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e462" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> then plays a role in determining the first phase decay. We discovered for parameters governing the HCV protease inhibitor telaprevir, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e463" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that three distinct exponential phases appeared to govern the viral load decay, with rates of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e464" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e465" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e466" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Viral decline under telaprevir treatment had been previously described as biphasic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003769-Guedj2">[6]</xref>; it is only through the approximations to the analytic solution that the middle, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e467" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, phase was revealed.</p>
<p>The model upon which we based our analysis, while derived for HCV, applies to a number of viral infections. For example, essentially the same model can be used for protease inhibitor treatment of HIV, since HIV protease inhibitors reduce the rate of production of infectious virus. Similarly, neuraminidase inhibitors used to treat influenza A virus infection also reduce the rate of production of infectious virus and again our results would apply. HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors act to block infection. To analyze this situation would require a generalizationq of our current model in which the parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003769.e468" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> rather than being constant was allowed to be time-varying. This remains an interesting problem for the future.</p>
