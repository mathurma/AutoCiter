<p>Astrocytes secrete ATP by exocytosis from synaptic-like vesicles, activating neuronal P2X receptors, which contribute to postsynaptic GABA receptor down-regulation, ultimately mediating the communication between astrocytes and neurons required for brain function.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Communication between neuronal and glial cells is important for many brain functions. Astrocytes can modulate synaptic strength via Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated release of various gliotransmitters, including glutamate and ATP. A physiological role of ATP release from astrocytes was suggested by its contribution to glial Ca<sup>2+</sup>-waves and purinergic modulation of neuronal activity and sleep homeostasis. The mechanisms underlying release of gliotransmitters remain uncertain, and exocytosis is the most intriguing and debated pathway. We investigated release of ATP from acutely dissociated cortical astrocytes using “sniff-cell” approach and demonstrated that release is vesicular in nature and can be triggered by elevation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> via metabotropic and ionotropic receptors or direct UV-uncaging. The exocytosis of ATP from neocortical astrocytes occurred in the millisecond time scale contrasting with much slower nonvesicular release of gliotransmitters via Best1 and TREK-1 channels, reported recently in hippocampus. Furthermore, we discovered that elevation of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in cortical astrocytes triggered the release of ATP that directly activated quantal purinergic currents in the pyramidal neurons. The glia-driven burst of purinergic currents in neurons was followed by significant attenuation of both synaptic and tonic inhibition. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-entry through the neuronal P2X purinoreceptors led to phosphorylation-dependent down-regulation of GABAA receptors. The negative purinergic modulation of postsynaptic GABA receptors was accompanied by small presynaptic enhancement of GABA release. Glia-driven purinergic modulation of inhibitory transmission was not observed in neurons when astrocytes expressed dn-SNARE to impair exocytosis. The astrocyte-driven purinergic currents and glia-driven modulation of GABA receptors were significantly reduced in the P2X4 KO mice. Our data provide a key evidence to support the physiological importance of exocytosis of ATP from astrocytes in the neocortex.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Brain function depends on the interaction between two major types of cells: neurons transmitting electrical signals and glial cells, which control cerebral circulation and neuronal homeostasis. There is a growing evidence of the participation of astrocytes in regulating neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity via the release of “gliotransmitters,” which include glutamate and ATP. The importance of ATP release from astrocytes was suggested by studies that demonstrated its contribution to neuronal activity and sleep homeostasis via modulation of known “purinergic” receptors. But the mechanisms underlying gliotransmitter release and the physiological significance of direct glia-to-neuron communication remain unknown and intensively debated. Here, we investigate the release of ATP from astrocytes of brain neocortex and demonstrate that astrocytes can release ATP by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent exocytosis, most likely from synaptic-like microvesicles. We also find that vesicular release of ATP from astrocytes can directly activate excitatory signaling in the neighboring neurons, operating through purinergic P2X receptors. We saw that activation of these P2X receptors by astrocyte-driven ATP down-regulated the inhibitory synaptic signaling in the neocortical neurons. Our results imply that exocytosis of gliotransmitters is important for the communication between astrocytes and neurons in the neocortex.</p>

By virtue of the high Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeability of P2X receptors and the ability of P2Y receptors to stimulate IP<sub>3</sub>-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from endoplasmic reticulum, purinergic receptors can transmit robust Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signals and thereby modulate activity and trafficking of excitatory and inhibitory receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Gordon1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Pankratov1">[11]</xref>.

Different mechanisms of ATP release have been identified, such as vesicular release from nerve terminals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Pankratov2">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Jo1">[14]</xref> and several nonvesicular pathways, including concentration gradient-driven diffusion through gap-junction hemichannels, anion channels, and dilated P2X7 receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Fields1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Pearson1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Garre1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Hamilton1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>A physiological role of ATP release from astrocytes has been suggested by the participation of ATP in the propagation of glial Ca<sup>2+</sup>-waves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Volterra1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Gourine1">[19]</xref> and significant contribution of ATP and adenosine to the astroglia-driven modulation of neuronal activity and sleep homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Fields1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Pascual1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Halassa2">[20]</xref>. There is growing evidence, albeit obtained mostly in cell cultures, that the release of gliotransmitters may share common mechanisms of vesicular neurotransmitter release such as a dependence on the proton gradient and vesicular transporters, SNARE proteins, andintracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Halassa1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-BalPrice1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Bezzi1">[22]</xref>.

<p>However, the mechanism of gliotransmitter release from astrocytes has been disputed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Hamilton1">[16]</xref>. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent exocytosis of glutamate and ATP, mainly from cultured hippocampal astrocytes, has been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-BalPrice1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Sawada1">[26]</xref>. By contrast, alteration of astroglial InsP3-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling did not have a significant effect on glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the hippocampal slices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Agulhon1">[27]</xref>, fuelling the debate on the role for glial exocytosis in more intact tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Hamilton1">[16]</xref>. Still, more recent <italic>in situ</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> data demonstrated an effect of astroglial InsP3-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling on cholinergic modulation of synaptic plasticity in hippocampus and neocortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Takata1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Chen1">[30]</xref>. At the same time, two recent studies reported the possibility of nonvesicular release of astroglial glutamate through the TREK-1 and best1 channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Woo1">[31]</xref> and the lack of immunostaining for vesicular glutamate transporters in brain astrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Li2">[32]</xref>, contrasting with the bulk of evidence for glial exocytosis obtained by variety of different techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-BalPrice1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Sawada1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Martineau1">[33]</xref>. Thus, physiological relevance of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent exocytosis of gliotransmitters remains controversial.</p>
<p>In this study, to avoid possible artifacts of cell culture, we investigate release of ATP from acutely isolated cortical astrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Lalo2">[34]</xref> and astrocytes in the neocortical slices. We provide several lines of evidence for (1) existence of functional vesicular mechanism of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent gliotransmitter release in neocortical astrocytes, (2) quantal P2X receptor-mediated currents directly activated in neocortical neurons by release of ATP from astrocytes, and (3) glia-driven purinergic modulation of GABAergic transmission that is impaired by astrocytic expression of dn-SNARE or deletion of P2X4 receptors.</p>

<title>Vesicular Release of ATP From Acutely Isolated Cortical Astrocytes</title>
<p>As a first step in demonstrating the presence of quantal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent release of ATP from astrocytes, we used a sniffer cell approach where ATP release from astrocyte was detected by HEK293 expressing P2X2 receptors (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details). We compared release of ATP from astroglia of somatosensory cortex of wild-type mice and from mice conditionally expressing the SNARE domain of VAMP2 selectively in astrocytes (dn-SNARE mice) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Pascual1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Halassa2">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>Acutely isolated cortical astrocytes were separately loaded with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-indicator Fluo-4 and photosensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup>-chelator NP-EGTA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Shigetomi1">[35]</xref> and then distributed into a recording chamber containing preplated HEK293-P2X2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were made from a HEK293-P2X2 cell lying in the immediate vicinity to astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Identification of astrocytes was confirmed by their functional characterization at the end of experiment, including low input resistance, lack of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup>-conductance, large K<sup>+</sup>-conductance, large conductance mediated by glutamate transporters, and NMDA receptors lacking Mg<sup>2+</sup>-block (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s019">Table S1</xref>). Thus, influence of nonastrocytic cells in the experiments reported below can be ruled out.</p>

<title>Detection of ATP released from cortical astrocytes with the aid of sniffer cells.</title>
<p>(A) Astrocytes acutely dissociated from the wild-type mouse neocortex have been loaded with UV-photoliable Ca<sup>2+</sup>-chelator NP-EGTA and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-indicator Fluo4-AM and placed over HEK293 cells expressing P2X2 receptors. The graphs below show the depolarization-activated currents and responses to application of 20 µM NMDA and 100 µM glutamate recorded in the astrocyte at a holding potential of −80 mV after an uncaging experiment; the response recorded under NBQX and D-AP5 was mediated by glutamate transporters, as evidenced by inhibition with specific blocker of glial glutamate transporters TFB-TBOA (300 nM). (B) Fluo-4 fluorescence was monitored in the astrocyte simultaneously with recording of transmembrane current in the HEK293-P2X2 cell voltage-clamped at −80 mV. UV uncaging of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the astrocyte was followed by the burst of phasic currents in the HEK293-P2X2 cell. Both the baseline and UV-elicited phasic currents were strongly inhibited after application of P2X receptor antagonist PPADS, confirming that they were mediated by ATP receptors. The diagram in the bottom panel shows the amplitude and frequency (mean ± SD for indicated numbers of HEK293-P2X2 cells) of phasic currents; statistical significance of the effect of PPADS was as indicated (*<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.02 and **<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005, ANOVA). (C) Staining of cortical astrocyte with FM1-43 supports the existence of the mechanism of vesicular release. Acutely isolated cortical astrocytes were pre-incubated with 2.5 µM FM1-43 for 15 min and then washed out with extracellular medium for 15 min. The upper row shows the superposition of the DIC image of astrocyte and two-photon images of FM1-43 fluorescence (maximal intensity projections of Z-stack) recorded before (control) and after a 5-min-long application of the agonist of astroglial PAR-1 receptors TFLLR (10 µM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Agulhon1">[27]</xref> and glutamate; scale bar is 5 µm. Activation of astrocytes via PAR-1 and glutamate receptors led to FM1-43 destaining. To recover fluorescence, FM1-43 was applied for 5 min in the presence of glutamate (100 µM) and then washed out for 15 min. The bottom plot shows the changes in the FM1-43 fluorescent signal (mean ± SD for seven astrocytes) averaged over the whole-cell image.</p>

<p>Brief flash of UV-light caused the uncoupling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from NP-EGTA (monitored by Fluo-4 Ca<sup>2+</sup>-indicator). This was accompanied by an asynchronous burst of phasic currents in the adjacent ATP-sensitive sniffer cell in 17 of 20 experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). P2 receptor antagonist PPADS (10 µM) prevented the detection of UV-evoked phasic currents (<italic>n</italic> = 7 of 7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), confirming that they were mediated by ATP acting via P2X receptor.</p>
<p>Some phasic currents were observed in the sniffer cells having astrocytes laying on their surface even before triggering the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-rise in the astrocyte, but at much lower frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). These baseline events were not detected in the absence of astrocytes in any of 10 native HEK293-P2X2 cells tested. Application of PPADS (10 µM) reduced the frequency of baseline and UV-evoked events correspondingly by 94%±3% and 97%±3% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), confirming the purinergic nature of all phasic currents. An exocytotic mechanism of ATP release was suggested by the activity-dependent staining of astrocytes with vesicular marker FM1-43 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>To further test the role of an elevation of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration as a trigger for the release of ATP from astrocytes, we applied agonists of astroglial metabotropic PAR-1 receptors (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s003">Figure S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Shigetomi1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Lee1">[36]</xref> and ionotropic NMDA receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Palygin1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Marchaland1">[24]</xref>. The PAR-1 receptors were chosen as an ample method of astrocyte activation because of the ability to activate IP3 pathway and their predominant expression in glial but not in neuronal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Shigetomi1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Lee1">[36]</xref>. Similar to UV-uncaging, activation of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transients in the astrocyte either by application of the PAR-1 agonist TFLLR (10 µM; <italic>n</italic> = 10) or by application of NMDA (20 µM; <italic>n</italic> = 7) elicited bursts of spontaneous currents in the adjacent ATP-sensitive sniffer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). TFLLR and NMDA did not evoke any activity in the HEK293-P2X2 cells when applied in the absence of astrocytes (<italic>n</italic> = 5 agonist, unpublished data). The phasic currents in the sniffer cells had amplitudes of 11.2±2.4 pA (<italic>n</italic> = 34) and rise and decay time of 1.6±0.5 ms and 15.2±3.9 ms correspondingly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), thus resembling parameters of purinergic synaptic currents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Pankratov2">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Jo1">[14]</xref>.</p>

<title>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent release of ATP can be evoked in the cortical astrocytes of the wild-type but not of the dn-SNARE mice.</title>
<p>Release of ATP from cortical astrocytes of wild-type (A, B) and dn-SNARE mice (C) was detected using the sniffer cells as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g001">Figure 1</xref>. (A) Elevation of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> level was elicited in the astrocytes by UV uncaging and by rapid application of the agonist of PAR-1 metabotropic receptor TFLLR (10 µM) or the agonist of glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA (20 µM). (B) Inhibition of vacuolar H-ATPase in the astrocytes with Bafilomycin A1 (1 µM for 2 h) dramatically decreased both the amplitude and frequency of phasic currents. (C) Elevation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> level in any of the dn-SNARE astrocytes did not lead to activation of phasic purinergic currents in the sniffer cell. Inlays in (A–C) show examples of individual phasic currents recorded at moments indicated; scale bars are 50 ms and 10 pA. (D) The amplitude and decay time distributions of purinergic currents recorded in the HEK293-P2X2 cells after stimulation of the astrocytes; data were pooled for number of experiments indicated in (E). The grey dotted line shows the best fit of quantal model to the distribution of UV-activated currents.

<p>As a test of a vesicular mechanism of ATP release, we isolated astrocytes from cortical slices pretreated with blocker of vacuolar-type H-ATPase bafilomycin A1 (1 µM) for 2 h. Treatment with bafilomycin caused a decrease in the amplitudes and frequency of phasic currents initiated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-elevation in the astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The mean amplitude of phasic purinergic currents activated in the sniffer cell by stimulation of bafilomycin-treated astrocytes was only 3.1±0.4 pA (<italic>n</italic> = 19). The overall charge transferred by phasic currents activated after stimulation of bafilomycin-treated astrocytes by UV, TFLLR, and NMDA was 9.7%±4.2% (<italic>n</italic> = 7), 11.8%±5.6% (<italic>n</italic> = 5), and 12.6%±5.8% (<italic>n</italic> = 7) of the corresponding control values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g002">Figure 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>In support of exocytotic mechanism of ATP release, astrocytes obtained from dn-SNARE mice elicited a diminished burst of purinergic currents in sniffer cells regardless of the method used to elevate cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g002">Figure 2C,E</xref>). We also observed the SNARE-complex-dependent release of ATP from the isolated hippocampal astrocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s004">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
<p>The amplitude histograms of the phasic P2X-mediated currents activated by elevation of astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> exhibited prominent second peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g002">Figure 2D</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s005">Figure S3</xref>) at amplitude twice that of the primary peak. Fitting of amplitude distribution with simple multiquantal binomial model (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g002">Figure 2D</xref> as dotted line) gave a quantal size of 7.9±0.13 pA and release probability of 0.28±0.04. Similarly, fitting of the distributions of P2X-currents evoked in sniffer cell after application of NMDA and TFLLR gave quantal size of 8.14±0.15 pA and 8.05±0.11 pA, respectively.</p>
<p>It should be noted that astrocyte-driven purinergic currents observed in our experiments had much faster kinetics (10–25 ms) than nonvesicular release of gliotransmitters from hippocampal astrocytes, which was mediated by TREK-1 potassium channels and best1 chloride channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Woo1">[31]</xref>. To verify the lack of contribution of nonvesicular mechanisms to the quantal purinergic phasic currents in the sniffer cells, we activated astrocytes by TFLLR in presence of TREK-1 channels inhibitor fluoxetine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Heurteaux1">[37]</xref> and large conductance chloride channels inhibitors DIDS and NPPB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Marsey1">[38]</xref>. Application of fluoxetine (100 µM), DIDS (300 µM), and NPPB (100 µM) did not have marked effect on the astrocyte-evoked phasic currents in the HEK293 cells in any of five experiments for each inhibitor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s006">Figure S4</xref>).</p>
<p>Combined, the above results strongly suggest that activity-dependent release of ATP from cortical astrocytes occurs mainly via quantal exocytotic mechanism, dependent on SNARE protein complex.</p>
<p>Vesicular mechanism of ATP release from neocortical astrocytes was also supported by immunostaining of living isolated astrocytes with antibodies to vesicular nucleotide transporter VNUT1 and various vesicular, neuronal, and glial marker proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s007">Figures S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s008">S6</xref>). Although immunostaining of live cells has certain limitations (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s021">Text S1</xref>) and should be interpreted with great caution, our data suggest the good co-localization of VNUT1 and synaptic vesicle (SV) markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s007">Figure S5A</xref>), which is in agreement with previous reports of vesicular location of VNUT1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Sawada1">[26]</xref> and presence of synaptic-like vesicles in astrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Bezzi1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Marchaland1">[24]</xref>. We observed weaker correlation between VNUT1 and lysosomal markers cathepsin D and LAMP3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s007">Figure S5B</xref>,C), which goes in line with previous observation of astroglial ATP release by the lysosome exocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Li1">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>However, lysosomal exocytosis from astrocytes exhibited much slower kinetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Li1">[23]</xref> than the purinergic currents measured in the sniffer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g002">2</xref>). This argues against a major contribution of this mechanism to the present observations. As the kinetics of sniffer cell responses are more consistent with millisecond time-scale of SV exocytosis from astrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Marchaland1">[24]</xref>, we suggest that the astrocyte-driven purinergic currents observed in our experiments could be triggered by exocytosis of ATP from synaptic-like vesicles. We also observed an immunoreactivity for vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT1) in the fraction of cortical astrocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s007">Figure S5D</xref>,E; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s008">Figure S6A</xref>), which goes in line with data reported previously for hippocampal and cortical astrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Bezzi1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Martineau1">[33]</xref>.

<title>Quantal release of ATP from astrocytes triggers fast purinergic currents in the cortical neurons <italic>in situ</italic>.</title>
<p>The spontaneous transmembrane currents were monitored in the layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of neocortical slices of wild-type (A, D, G), dn-SNARE (B, E, H), and P2X4 KO mice (C, F, I). Expression of dn-SNARE in the astroglial cells of the neocortex is confirmed by EGFP-GFAP fluorescence (right column, scale bar 20 µm; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s017">Figure S15</xref>). Two distinct populations of spontaneous sEPSCs were recorded in the pyramidal neurons in the presence of TTX (1 µM), CNQX (50 µM), and D-APV (30 µM) at a holding potential of −80 mV: currents with larger amplitude and fast kinetics (orange dots) and currents with smaller amplitude and slow kinetics (green dots). (A, B, C) The representative transmembrane currents were recorded before and after activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the astrocytes by selective agonist of astroglial PAR-1 receptor. The nonglutamatergic inward spontaneous currents (sEPSCs) were inhibited by P2 receptors antagonist PPADS (10 µM) and knocking out of P2X4 receptors. (D, E, F) Time course of changes in the frequency of sEPSCs currents during application of TFLLR (10 µM). Each dot represents the frequency calculated for a 1 min time window, and data show mean ± SD for number of neurons as follows: 17 (WT), 8 (dn-SNARE), and 12 (P2X4 KO). Activation of the PAR-1 receptor caused the appearance of a large number of spontaneous currents in the neurons of wild-type but not dn-SNARE mice; the frequency of sEPSCs was significantly lower in the P2X4 KO mice. (G, H, I) The amplitude and decay time distributions of purinergic sEPSCs recorded before and after application of TFLLR reveal the presence of a distinct population of spontaneous currents of smaller amplitude and slower kinetics in the wild-type but not in the dn-SNARE mice. Shaded areas show the amplitude distribution of background noise. Stimulation of astrocytes with TFLLR significantly increases the peaks corresponding to smaller and slower sEPSCs only in the neurons of the wild-type mice, whereas currents recorded in the neurons of dn-SNARE mice exhibit single-peaked amplitude and decay distributions. Deletion of P2X4 receptors attenuated amplitudes of both fast and slow inward currents and significantly reduced the proportion of slower currents evoked by TFLLR application.</p>

<p>The partial inhibitory action of PPADS and NF-279 on nonglutamatergic sEPSCs could be explained by participation of homomeric P2X4 receptors, which are insensitive to these antagonists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Burnstock1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Suzuki1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-North1">[42]</xref>.

In the P2X4 KO mice, application of 10 µM PPADS decreased the amplitude and frequency of nonglutamatergic sEPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) by 74%±10% and 97%±6% correspondingly (<italic>n</italic> = 12); difference from the wild-type mice was statistically significant with <italic>p</italic> = 0.05 and 0.01. Taking into account that significant attenuation of sEPSCs can put them below the detection threshold, nonglutamatergic sEPSCs can be confidently attributed to neuronal P2X receptors.</p>
<p>We triggered the release of gliotransmitters from the astrocytes by rapid application of an agonist of PAR-1 receptor TFLLR to neocortical slices. As in hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Shigetomi1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Lee1">[36]</xref>, TFLLR (10 µM) triggered cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise predominantly in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s003">Figure S1</xref>). Application of TFLLR caused a dramatic increase in the frequency of ATP-mediated spontaneous currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g003">Figure 3A,D</xref>). TFLLR also elevated astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in dn-SNARE mice, but the burst of purinergic spontaneous currents was not detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g003">Figure 3B,E</xref>). In the P2X4 knockout mice, the average increase in the purinergic sEPSCs frequency reached only 28%±15% (<italic>n</italic> = 12), which was significantly lower (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005) than 72%±21% increase observed in wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g003">Figure 3C,F</xref>). Combined, these results demonstrate that activation of astrocytes can evoke synaptic-like purinergic currents in neurons. In addition to effects of knocking out and inhibiting P2X receptors, the purinergic nature of glia-driven spontaneous currents was corroborated by inhibitory action of ATP-hydrolyzing enzyme apyrase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s010">Figure S8</xref>). The apyrase application significantly decreased the mean amplitude and frequency of sEPSCs and abolished the TFLLR-induced burst. The decrease in the sEPSCs frequency is most likely related to the reduction of their amplitude below threshold of detection.</p>
<p>In the wild-type mice, purinergic sEPSCs showed bimodal amplitude distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g003">Figure 3G–I</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s011">Figure S9</xref>) with peaks at 3.1±0.9 pA and 5.7±1.6 pA (<italic>n</italic> = 14); decay time distributions had peaks at 9.1±0.9 ms and 15.3±1.8 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g003">Figure 3G</xref>). TFLLR selectively increased the probability of detection of smaller and slower sEPSCs in all 14 neurons tested.

<p>(A, B) Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling was monitored in astrocytes of somatosensory cortex layer 2/3 of wild-type (A) and dn-SNARE (B) mice simultaneously with voltage-clamp recordings of membrane currents in the pyramidal neurons. Spontaneous currents recorded in the pyramidal neurons at a holding potential of −80 mV in the presence of picrotoxin (100 µM) and CNQX (50 µM) were mediated by P2X receptors, as verified by inhibition with selective P2X antagonist NF279 (3 µM). The single episode of 100 Hz stimulation (HFS) triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in the astrocytes of both wild-type and dn-SNARE mice; representatives are the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and pseudo-color images (scale bar, 10 µm) recorded before (rest) and at the peak of response (stim). Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were followed by burst of spontaneous purinergic currents only in the neurons of wild-type mice (A), whereas neuronal spontaneous activity was not enhanced in the dn-SNARE mice (B). Inlays show the average waveforms (20 events) of spontaneous currents recorded before (rest) and 1 min after HFS (stim). (C, D). Each dot shows the average amplitude and frequency of spontaneous currents recorded in a 1 min time window in the pyramidal neurons of wild-type and dn-SNARE mice; data are presented as mean ± SD for six neurons. The asterisks (*) and (**) indicate the significant difference from the control values. The decrease in amplitude and significant increase in frequency of purinergic sEPSCs were observed in the wild-type but not in the dn-SNARE mice. (E, F) The amplitude and decay time distributions of purinergic sEPSCs recorded before, immediately after (0–30 s), and 1–3 min after HFS (pooled data for six neurons of each type) reveal the presence of a distinct population of spontaneous currents of smaller amplitude and slower kinetics in the wild-type but not in the dn-SNARE mice. Hence, these events are most likely activated by ATP released from astrocytes. The faster sEPSCs with larger amplitudes that underlie baseline activity both in wild-type and dn-SNARE mice are activated by ATP released from the nerve terminals. (G, H) The plot of decay time of purinergic sEPSCs against the amplitude demonstrates the presence of two populations of sEPSCs in the wild-type mice: slower currents of smaller amplitude (green area) and faster currents of higher amplitude (orange area). The corresponding waveforms (average of 20 traces) are shown in the inlay. HFS significantly increases the number of slower spontaneous currents. These currents were very rarely observed in the dn-SNARE mice, both in control and after HFS.</p>

<p>Elimination of the distinct population of smaller and slower currents by astrocytic dn-SNARE expression strongly suggests that this population of purinergic currents was elicited by exocytosis of ATP from astrocytes. The vesicular origin of slower purinergic sEPSCs was also supported by elimination of these events by treatment of the cortical slices with 1 µM bafilomycin A1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s020">Table S2</xref>). The slower and faster purinergic currents recorded in cortical neurons exhibited different quantal behavior (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s009">Figure S7</xref>). The slower purinergic currents evoked by application of TFLLR in the presence of TTX (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s005">Figure S3A</xref>) exhibited multiquantal amplitude distribution, whereas faster currents exhibited monoquantal distribution typical for miniature synaptic currents (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s009">Figure S7B</xref>,C).</p>
<p>Thus, detailed analysis of purinergic sEPSCs in the pyramidal cortical neurons revealed two distinct populations of events, which differ by their amplitude and kinetics. Based on their insensitivity to astrocytic dn-SNARE expression, larger and faster sEPSCs most likely have a neuronal origin. In contrast, sEPSCs of smaller amplitude and slower kinetics can be attributed to the vesicular release of ATP from astrocytes. In the following sections, we provide further experimental support of this notion.</p>

<title>Evaluation of ATP Release in the Neocortex With Microelectrode Biosensors</title>
<p>We sought to obtain a parallel line of evidence for the vesicular ATP release from cortical astrocytes via an alternative approach: we measured ATP concentration in neocortical slice using microelectrode biosensors (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), a technique that has been applied previously for evaluation of ATP release in several brain areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Pearson1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Gourine1">[19]</xref>. Selective activation of astrocytic PAR-1 receptor by TFLLR induced a robust increase in the extracellular ATP concentration in the cortical tissues of wild-type mice; this increase was impaired in the dn-SNARE mice and was blocked by bafilomycin, confirming its astroglial origin and vesicular nature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s012">Figure S10A</xref>). The increase in the “tonic” concentration of extracellular ATP after activation of astrocytes in the wild-type mice reached 1.1±0.4 µM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s012">Figure S10B</xref>) and was inhibited by 84%±5% (<italic>n</italic> = 7) after incubation with bafilomycin. The TFLLR-evoked elevation of ATP concentration in the dn-SNARE mice was decreased by 56%±12% (<italic>n</italic> = 12) as compared to wild-type. These results support the significant contribution of vesicular mechanism to the activity-dependent release of ATP from cortical astrocytes. Taking into account that bafilomycin can inhibit only re-charging of ATP-storing vesicles and not all the cortical astrocytes express dn-SNARE protein, one could not expect the full inhibition of vesicular ATP release in these experiments. Thus, the incomplete inhibition of TFLLR-evoked ATP transients in the dn-SNARE mice and in the bafilomycin-treated neocortical slices of wild-type mice could hardly be attributed to a large contribution of nonvesicular release.</p>

<p>The existence of two functionally distinct populations of purinergic events in the wild-type mice was corroborated by correlation between amplitude and decay time of sEPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g004">Figure 4G</xref>). The slower currents (decay time of 15.4±2.2 ms) had smaller amplitudes (5.5±1.3 pA, <italic>n</italic> = 6), but the faster currents (decay time of 9.2±1.3 ms) had higher amplitude (9.9±2.4 pA, <italic>n</italic> = 6). The amplitudes of slower currents closely agree with quantal amplitude of TFLLR-evoked slow purinergic currents recorded at −80 mV, whereas quantal amplitude of fast currents is close to the unitary size of TFLLR-insensitive fast purinergic sEPSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s008">Figure S6B</xref>). The train of HFS significantly increased the number of slower spontaneous currents with smaller amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g004">Figure 4G</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to wild-type mice, the only effect produced by HFS train on purinergic sEPSCs in the dn-SNARE mice was the transient increase in the number of double-quantal fast currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g004">Figure 4D,F</xref>), which led to the brief increase in the average amplitude. The expression of dn-SNARE in astrocytes caused a selective loss of the smaller and slower sEPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g004">Figure 4H</xref>). These data strongly support the different origins of fast and slow purinergic sEPSCs, from neuronal terminals and astrocytes correspondingly.</p>
<p>To verify that slower purinergic sEPSCs originated from astrocytic ATP release directly, we tested the effect of diadenosine triphosphate (AP3A) and UTP, which have been shown presviously to strongly inhibit transport of ATP into astrocytic vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Sawada1">[26]</xref>. Since these substance are not specific VNUT antagonists and can have an action on purinergic receptors, we applied them intracellulary to minimize side effects. In order to increase the impact of single-cell perfusion, we chose neuron-astrocyte pairs lying in a close proximity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). A similar strategy has been previously used to test the effects of perfusion of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-chelators into astrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Panatier1">[45]</xref>. The feasibility of this approach is based on the high probability of synapses of a single neuron falling within functional island enwraped and controlled by single nearby astrocyte <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Halassa3">[46]</xref>. When astrocytes of wild-type mice were perfused only with fluorescent dye, two consecutive HFS episodes caused the burst of slow purinergic sEPSCs in the neighboring neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) of the magnitude similar to previous experiments with intact astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Prolonged intracellular perfusion of astrocyte with 1 mM of AP3A or UTP significantly attenuated the frequency of purinergic sEPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g005">Figure 5B–E</xref>) in 10 of the 12 experiments. The effect was more prominent after the second HFS episode. This was most likely related to the depletion of the releasable pool of ATP in astrocytes. Analysis of amplitude and decay time distributions showed that inhibitors of vesicular nucleotide transporters selectively affected the fraction of slower sEPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), significantly decreasing their amplitude and frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Although slower purinergic sEPSCs were not abolished completely, this might be explained by incomplete perfusion of distal astrocytic processes or release from other astrocytes. These results strongly suggest that smaller and slower purinergic sEPSCs originated directly from vesicular release of ATP from neighboring astrocytes.</p>
<p>In summary, our data provide compelling evidence that quantal release of astrocytic ATP activates a distinct population of purinergic currents in cortical pyramidal neurons.</p>

<p>To test this hypothesis, we recorded inhibitory synaptic currents (IPSCs) in neocortical pyramidal neurons at a membrane potential of −40 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g006">Figure 6</xref>) in the presence of glutamate receptor antagonists CNQX (50 µM) and D-APV (30 µM). Under these conditions, we observed inward purinergic currents simultaneously with outward Cl<sup>−</sup>-currents mediated by GABAA receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Similar to our previous results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Pankratov2">[13]</xref>, outward IPSCs were completely inhibited by bicuculline in all 12 cells tested (unpublished data). The burst of ATP-mediated currents, induced in cortical neurons by activation of astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling via PAR1 receptors (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), was accompanied by significant decrease in the amplitude of GABA-mediated synaptic currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g006">Figure 6A,B</xref>). Amplitudes of evoked IPSCs and spontaneous mIPSCs recorded in the wild-type mice were reduced after application of 10 µM TFLLR by 44.3%±6.1% (<italic>n</italic> = 7) and 39.4%±6.3% (<italic>n</italic> = 12) correspondingly. In the dn-SNARE mice, the inactivation of GABA receptor-mediated synaptic currents was greatly diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g006">Figure 6A,B</xref>). Application of TFLLR reduced the amplitude of evoked and spontaneous IPSCs in the cortical neurons of dn-SNARE mice just by 6.4%±8.7% (<italic>n</italic> = 8) and 4.3%±6.6% (<italic>n</italic> = 8), respectively.

<p>The effect of TFLLR on inhibitory synaptic currents was mimicked by application of nonhydrolysable ATP analog ATP-γS (10 µM) and was considerably reduced by P2 receptor antagonist PPADS (10 µM). In the P2X4 KO mice, activation of astrocytes decreased the amplitude of evoked and spontaneous IPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g006">Figure 6A,B</xref>) only by 14.3%±8.2% and 15.7%±9.5% (<italic>n</italic> = 12); the difference between P2X4 KO and wild-type mice was significant with <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005. These data strongly support the participation of neuronal ATP receptors in the astrocyte-driven modulation of IPSCs.</p>
<p>We found out that exocytosis of gliotransmitters also caused long-term homeostatic modulation of inhibitory synaptic transmission. We observed a marked difference in the amplitude distribution of the baseline (control) amplitude of postsynaptic inhibitory currents in the wild-type and dn-SNARE mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). The amplitude of mIPSCs in the cortical neurons before the application of TFLLR was much higher in the dn-SNARE than in the WT mice. The average baseline amplitude of mIPSCs was 23.5±8.3 pA in the dn-SNARE mice (<italic>n</italic> = 8) and 14.9±6.9 in the WT mice. Application of TFLLR caused the leftward shift of amplitude distribution of mIPSCs only in the WT mice; this shift was significantly reduced by PPADS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). The considerable difference in the baseline amplitude of miniature inhibitory currents in the WT and dn-SNARE mice provides the first evidence that vesicular release of gliotransmitters may be involved in the long-term homeostatic regulation of inhibitory transmission in the neocortex.</p>
<p>In order to elucidate the role of post- and presynaptic mechanisms in the modulation of inhibitory transmission, we evaluated the changes in the mean quantal content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), changes in the frequency of spontaneous mIPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), and paired-pulse ratio (PPR) of evoked IPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Neither the mean quantal content of IPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) nor the mIPSCs frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) exhibited marked changes. However, we observed a moderate change in the PPR of IPSCs in the neocortical pyramidal neurons of wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). The IPSCs evoked with a 50 ms interval in the control showed paired-pulse depression with mean PPR of 0.79±0.11 (<italic>n</italic> = 12), and application of TFLLR increased PPR by 0.16±0.07 (<italic>n</italic> = 8). The application of TFLLR did not cause a significant change in PPR in the dn-SNARE mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g007">Figure 7B,D</xref>), indicating the involvement of glial exocytosis in the mechanism. The effect of TFLLR was significantly reduced by PPADS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g007">Figure 7A,D</xref>) and reproduced by application of ATP-γS both in the wild-type and dn-SNARE mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g007">Figure 7A,B,D</xref>). Hence, the presynaptic increase in the PPR of IPSCs was most likely mediated by ATP acting via P2 purinoreceptors. This result is consistent with previous reports of presynaptic facilitation of GABAergic synaptic transmission by ATP and P2 receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Burnstock1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Abbracchio1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Khakh2">[49]</xref>.</p>

(A–C) Graphs show the representative IPSCs (average of 25 traces) evoked with a 50 ms interval in control and during application of 10 µM TFLLR.

</caption><graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001747.g007" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>There was no significant difference in the effects of TFLLR and ATP-γS between wild-type and P2X4 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g007">Figure 7C,D</xref>). So the P2X4 receptors hardly make the large contribution in the increase of PPR, contrasting with their prominent role in the astrocyte-induced decrease of IPCS amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g006">Figure 6</xref>). One could speculate that presynaptic facilitation of IPSCs by glia-driven ATP can be mediated by other subtypes of P2X receptors and P2Y receptors, whose role in the presynaptic modulation in the brain was widely reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Burnstock1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Abbracchio1">[2]</xref>.</p>
<p>More importantly, the above data clearly demonstrate that the large decrease in the amplitude of evoked and spontaneous IPSCs cannot be attributed to the presynaptic modulation of GABA release, and astrocyte-induced down-regulation of inhibitory transmission operates via postsynaptic mechanism.</p>
<p>The postsynaptic mechanism of IPSCs inactivation was corroborated by experiments where the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent phosphorylation of GABA receptors was impaired by intracellular agents. First, we found that activation of P2X receptors in pyramidal neocortical neurons caused marked reduction of GABA-activated currents via Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and protein kinase C–dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s013">Figure S11</xref>). Second, application of TFLLR to the cortical slices of wild-type mice did not cause marked reduction in the mIPSCs recorded in neurons perfused with intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-chelator EGTA (10 µM) or protein kinase C antagonist GF109203X (30 nM). The mIPSC amplitude was reduced by just 2.5%±5.9% (<italic>n</italic> = 6) in the presence of intracellular EGTA and by 11.2%±5.5% (<italic>n</italic> = 4) in the presence of the protein kinase C antagonist (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s014">Figure S12</xref>). These results agree with previous reports on Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and PKC-dependent down-regulation of GABA receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Jacob1">[47]</xref>.</p>
<p>In addition to the fast IPSCs (“phasic inhibition”), central neurons also receive a diffusional inhibitory signal mediated by the extrasynaptic GABA receptors continuously activated by small concentrations of GABA present in the extrasynaptic space (“tonic inhibition”) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Semyanov1">[50]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Glykys1">[51]</xref>. Extrasynaptic GABA receptors, responsible for tonic inhibition, have been reported to undergo Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Jacob1">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Kittler1">[48]</xref>. Thus, one could expect the impact of astrocyte-driven ATP not only on phasic but also on tonic inhibitory signaling in the neocortical pyramidal neurons. To verify this hypothesis, we used a conventional experimental paradigm where tonic inhibition is assessed by the change in the whole-cell holding current under action of GABA receptor blockers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Semyanov1">[50]</xref>, in our case 50 µM bicuculline. In the wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g008">Figure 8A</xref>, top), layer 2/3 neurons showed the tonic current of 39.9±8.3 pA (<italic>n</italic> = 20) at membrane potential of −80 mV. The tonic current in the pyramidal neurons dn-SNARE mice was almost two times higher than in the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g008">Figure 8B</xref>, top), reaching 76.9±15.1 pA (<italic>n</italic> = 10). A significant difference in the amplitude of tonic current between wild-type and dn-SNARE mice suggests that exocytosis of gliotransmitters from cortical astrocytes can modulate the activity of extrasynaptic GABA receptors in the adjacent neurons. Consistent with this notion, activation of gliotransmitter release by TFLLR caused a marked upward shift in the holding current in the pyramidal neurons of wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g008">Figure 8A</xref>, middle), and the rest of holding current was efficiently diminished by bicuculline. Application of TFLLR did not have a notable effect on tonic current in the dn-SNARE mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g008">Figure 8B</xref>, middle). The amplitude of tonic current recorded under action of TFLLR in the wild-type, dn-SNARE, and P2X4 KO mice was correspondingly 12.6±6.8 pA (<italic>n</italic> = 14), 72.2±9.1 pA (<italic>n</italic> = 7), and 43.4±7.2 pA (<italic>n</italic> = 6). The relative decrease in the amplitude of tonic current caused by TFLLR was, respectively, 68%±14%, 6%±8%, and 25%±11%. The down-regulation of tonic current by PAR-1 agonist was considerably attenuated by antagonist of ATP receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g008">Figure 8A</xref>, bottom). The effects of TFLLR and PPADS in the wild-type mice as well as a difference between mice strains were statistically significant as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g007">Figure 7C</xref>. It has been recently shown that Ca-dependent modulation of astrocytic GABA GAT3 transporters in the hippocampus can alter an extracellular GABA level elevating the tonic current and decreasing the mIPSCs due to GABA receptor desensitization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Shigetomi2">[52]</xref>. One should note that this pathway did not contribute significantly to PAR-1 agonist-induced modulation of inhibitory currents in neocortical neurons, since we observed a decrease in both phasic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g006">Figure 6</xref>) and tonic currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g007">Figure 7</xref>). This notion was corroborated by our finding that blocking of the astroglial GAT3 GABA transporter increased the tonic current and decreased the amplitude of mIPSCs both in the wild-type and dn-SNARE mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s015">Figure S13</xref>). These data also show that dn-SNARE expression does significantly alter the activity of GABA transporters in cortical astrocytes.</p>

<p>(A, B) Tonic GABA-mediated signaling was evaluated by upward shift in the whole-cell holding current (ΔI<sub>hold</sub>) caused by application of bicuculline (50 µM) to the layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in brain slices of wild-type (A) and dn-SNARE (B) mice. Bicuculline was applied either in control (upper traces) or after activation of astrocytic signaling by 10 µM TFLLR (middle traces) or after application of TFLLR in the presence of ATP receptors antagonist PPADS (bottom trace). Currents were recorded in the presence of CNQX (50 µM) and D-APV (30 µM) at a holding potential of −80 mV. (C) The average amplitude of the tonic GABA-mediated current measured in different conditions in the wild-type, dn-SNARE, and P2X4 knockout mice for number of cells as indicated; statistical significance of difference in mean amplitude was as indicated (*) <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 and (**) <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01. In the wild-type mice, activation of astroglial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling significantly decreased the tonic GABA-mediate current; reduction in tonic current was attenuated by PPADS. In the dn-SNARE and P2X4 KO mice, tonic inhibitory current was significantly up-regulated, and activation of the astroglial Ca<sup>2+</sup> had a much smaller effect on the tonic current than in the wild-type mice. These results suggest that exocytosis of ATP can lead to down-regulation of tonic inhibition in the neocortical neurons, most likely via P2X receptors.</p>

They have a moderate affinity for ATP (EC<sub>50</sub> around 10 µM) that allowed us to avoid saturation and resolve the quantal behavior of astrocyte-evoked purinergic currents with a mean quantal size of about 8 pA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). To activate such response, the concentration of ATP released from astrocytes should have reached at least the low micromolar range. Detailed calculations, performed using the approach applied for extrasynaptic release and diffusion of glutamate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Hamilton1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Rusakov1">[53]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Pankratov3">[54]</xref>, show that such concentration can be reached after release of about 1,000 molecules from a single glial synaptic-like vesicle, and the size of the “active spot” due to diffusion of ATP can reach as far as 1–2 µM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s016">Figures S14A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s017">S15</xref>). This estimation is in line with our data obtained using ATP microelectrode biosensors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s012">Figure S10</xref>) as well as with previous evidence that the extracellular ATP level in the brain can reach 1–100 µM depending on the physiological and pathological context <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Burnstock1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Pearson1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Frenguelli1">[55]</xref>.</p>
<p>Similar calculations, as above, argue against involvement of lysosomal release in generation of purinergic currents observed in our experiments. Indeed, the typical lysosome has a diameter of about 300 nm and can contain more than 1,000,000 molecules of gliotransmitter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Hamilton1">[16]</xref>—that is, 1,000 times more than in the synaptic-like vesicle. Even though lysosome undergoes kiss-and-run exocytosis releasing only 10% of its content <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Hamilton1">[16]</xref>, one could expect the peak of a sniffer cell response to reach at least 200–500 pA, with most receptors on its surface saturated with agonist. So the observed quantal size of sniffer cell response (about 8 pA) is in much better agreement with release of ATP from synaptic-like vesicles.</p>
<p>The low micromolar level of ATP concentration can be sufficient for activation of P2X purinoreceptors abundantly expressed in the central neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Burnstock1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-North1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Khakh1">[44]</xref>. The data of electron microscopy and single molecular imaging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Gu1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Rubio1">[56]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Richler1">[57]</xref> show both synaptic (mostly at the periphery of synaptic density) and extrasynaptic location of P2X receptors. Interestingly, P2X2 and P2X4 receptors are generally located peri-synaptically (i.e., at the edges of postsynaptic density) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Rubio1">[56]</xref>, which makes them accessible by ATP released from both nerve terminals and extrasynaptic glial release sites. This is consistent with our observation of strong sensitivity of astrocyte-driven sIPSCs to deletion of P2X4 receptors and inhibition of P2X2 receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g003">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g004">4</xref>, and S7). The distance to the source of ATP would affect the kinetics and amplitude of input mediated by peri-synaptic P2X receptors. Due to diffusion and rapid conversion to ADP, the transient of ATP concentration reaching P2X receptor after vesicular release from the distal (astroglial) site will have less magnitude but will decay longer than ATP transient after release from a close intrasynaptic site (as illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s017">Figure S15</xref>). This would lead to smaller quantal amplitude and slower kinetics of purinergic current of the glial origin as compared to neuronally activated synaptic currents. So the diversity in location of the ATP source could be the most plausible explanation for the difference in the amplitude and kinetics of purinergic sEPSCs of neuronal and glial origin observed in the neocortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g004">4</xref>). An alternative explanation might be that EPSCs of smaller amplitude and slow kinetics were generated at neuronal synapses at a much longer electrotonic distance. In this case, however, the attenuation factor would increase gradually with distance, leading to smooth single-peaked distributions of EPSC amplitude and decay time due to the presence of large “intermediate” EPSCs. This contrasts with our observation of two peaks in the amplitude and decay time histograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g003">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g005">5</xref>). These arguments are supported by results of computer simulation using the model of neurotransmitter spillover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Rusakov1">[53]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Pankratov3">[54]</xref> adapted for release of ATP from glial and synaptic sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s016">Figures S14</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s017">S15</xref>). Importantly, the key experimental evidence of the astroglial origin of purinergic currents of slower kinetics and smaller quantal size has been provided by their selective inhibition by disruption of vesicular ATP transport in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the possibility of nonvesicular gliotransmitter release from astrocytes has been previously reported in several brain regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Fields1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Pearson1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Garre1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Huckstepp1">[58]</xref>, our results do not show a strong contribution of nonvesicular pathways to the release of ATP in the neocortex. On a contrary, both sniffer cell and biosensor data suggest that vesicular mechanism brings major contribution to activity-dependent ATP release. One should note that incomplete inhibition of ATP release in the biosensor experiments could be explained by incomplete inhibitory action of bafilomycin treatment and dn-SNARE expression on vesicular release rather than notable contribution of nonvesicular mechanisms. It is possible that vesicular and nonvesicular ATP release operates in the neocortex in the different time scale, similarly to spinal cord astrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Garre1">[15]</xref>, where the fast initial exocytosis of ATP can be followed by slow secondary release of ATP through the pannexin and connexin hemichannels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Garre1">[15]</xref>. So it is plausible that vesicular and nonvesicular mechanisms of ATP release coexists in the neocortex, but nonvesicular release was not activated in our experimental context.</p>
<p>It is traditionally considered that physiological astroglial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is driven mainly by InsP<sub>3</sub>-mediated release from intracellular stores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Hamilton1">[16]</xref>.

Co-localization of VNUT1 and synaptic vesicle markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s007">Figure S5</xref>), rather small quantal size and fast kinetics of glia-driven purinergic currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g001">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g004">4</xref>), suggest that release of ATP from synaptic-like vesicles can make a significant contribution into purinergic gliotransmission in cortical astrocytes.</p>
<p>Until recently, the action of ATP as gliotransmitter was associated mainly with presynaptic adenosine receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Fields1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Pascual1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Halassa2">[20]</xref>. It was also shown that astrocyte-derived ATP could operate through P2X7 receptors to enhance presynaptic release of glutamate in hypothalamic neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Gordon1">[10]</xref>. Although we observed a moderate presynaptic modulation of inhibitory transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g007">Figure 7</xref>), our main finding is that glia-driven ATP can directly activate excitatory currents in neurons acting via postsynaptic P2X receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g003">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g005">5</xref>). We showed that activation of neuronal purinoreceptors by astrocyte-driven ATP caused a dramatic change in the inhibitory transmission in neocortex inhibiting postsynaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g007">7</xref>). ATP receptors can act through the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent phosphorylation by protein kinase C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s013">Figures S11</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s014">S12</xref>); the latter mechanism is intrinsic for GABA receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Sim1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Brandon1">[60]</xref>.</p>
<p>The physiological relevance of exocytosis of gliotransmitters was strongly supported by our finding of significant increase in the baseline phasic and tonic inhibitory signaling in the cortical neurons of dn-SNARE mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g007">7</xref>). This result suggests that release of gliotransmitters, presumably ATP, can be involved in long-term homeostatic regulation of neuronal GABA receptors by a mechanism that has yet to be investigated. Our evidence of down-regulation of inhibitory synaptic transmission in the neocortex goes in line with observations that enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in cortical astrocytes contributed to neuronal excitotoxicity and epilepsy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Carmignoto1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Ding1">[61]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our results outline a novel mechanism of action of ATP as a gliotransmitter: in addition to catabolism of ATP to ADP and adenosine and modulation of synaptic transmission via presynaptic purinoreceptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Pascual1">[12]</xref>, ATP can enhance neuronal excitability by down-regulating the phasic and tonic inhibition acting via postsynaptic P2 receptors. Our present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g006">Figures 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g008">8</xref>) and previous <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Pankratov1">[11]</xref> results show that modulation of postsynaptic receptors activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via purinergic P2X receptors can provide an efficient mechanism of regulation of signaling within tripartite synapse. Data on a large contribution of P2X4 receptors to glia-driven modulation of neuronal signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g006">Figures 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g008">8</xref>) go in line with a previous observation of a facilitatory role for astroglial release of ATP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Pascual1">[12]</xref> and P2X4 receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Sim1">[43]</xref> in the long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus.</p>
<p>Our findings give further insight into the role of P2X receptors in the CNS. There is growing consensus that, despite a clear evidence of participation of P2X receptors in the excitatory synaptic transmission in several brain areas, they bring notable contribution to slow neuromodulation rather than fast excitation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Khakh1">[44]</xref>. The above results suggest that P2X receptors can also mediate glia-to-neuron signals, which can be activated in the millisecond time scale and have more long-lasting consequences for neuronal excitability.</p>
<p>Hippocampal astrocytes have been recently reported to decrease the amplitude of mIPSCs via Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent modulation of GABA transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Shigetomi2">[52]</xref> and increase the frequency of mIPSCs via P2Y receptors of inhibitory interneurons, presumably activated by slow release of ATP from astrocytes through connexin hemichannels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Torres1">[62]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our data suggest that presynaptic ATP receptors can enhance GABA release in the neocortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Down-regulation of both phasic and tonic postsynaptic GABA receptors by astrocyte-driven ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g007">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g008">8</xref>) can act downstream of these pathways and significantly affect their impact on inhibitory transmission. Interplay between post- and presynaptic pathways of glial modulation could have diverse effects on neuronal excitability in different physiological contexts. Apparently, the down-regulation of inhibitory transmission provided by postsynaptic P2X receptors prevails in the neocortical pyramidal neurons, at least in our experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g007">7</xref>).</p>
<p>It becomes evident now that even release of one gliotransmitter, ATP (followed by formation of ADP and adenosine), can activate a variety of pre- and postsynaptic regulatory cascades that can affect synaptic efficacy in opposite ways. Combined with diversity of vesicular and nonvesicular pathways of ATP release and the possibility of release of other gliotransmitters, such as glutamate and D-serine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Halassa1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Martineau1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Henneberger1">[63]</xref>, this may confer more complex behavior to tripartite synapse than previously assumed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Hamilton1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Agulhon1">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>In summary, our data suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation in cortical astrocytes, which might occur in response to signals from neurons and/or propagation of glial Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves, can trigger exocytosis of ATP from synaptic-like vesicles and activate neuronal P2X receptors that are located at the periphery of synapse. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling via neuronal ATP receptors can cause phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of postsynaptic GABA receptors acting downstream of astroglial modulation of presynaptic GABA release and GABA uptake. Our results strongly support physiological importance of exocytosis of gliotransmitters, in particular ATP, in communication between astrocytes and neurons and modulation of synaptic efficacy.</p>

<title>Slice and Cell Preparation</title>
<p>Mice (8–12 wk and 9 mo old) were anaesthetized by halothane and then decapitated, in accordance with UK legislation.

<p>Astrocytes were acutely isolated using the modified “vibrating ball” technique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Lalo2">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Lalo3">[59]</xref>. The glass ball (200 µm diameter) was moved slowly some 10–50 µm above the slice surface, while vibrating at 100 Hz (lateral displacements 20–30 µm). Isolation protocol was adjusted to provide a high yield of astroglial cells. This technique preserves the function of membrane proteins and therefore is devoid of many artifacts of enzymatic cell isolation and culturing procedures. In particular, vibro-dissociated astrocytes retain many morphological features (e.g., GFAP–EGFP fluorescence, size, proximal processes) and functional properties (e.g., high potassium conductance, glutamate transporters, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling) while being completely isolated from neuronal somata and nerve terminals. The composition of external solution for all isolated cell experiments was (mM) 135 NaCl, 2.7 KCl, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 1 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 15 glucose, pH adjusted with NaOH to 7.3. Astrocytes were identified by their morphology under DIC observation, EGFP fluorescence (astrocytes from dn-SNARE and GFAP-EGFP mice), and functional properties as described previously (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s019">Table S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Lalo2">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Lalo3">[59]</xref>.</p>

<title>Detection of ATP Release of Astrocytes Using Sniffer Cells</title>
<p>After isolation from a brain slice, cortical astrocytes were incubated with 5 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Fluo4-AM (or Rhod-2 AM) and 10 µM of photoliable Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator <italic>o</italic>-nitrophenyl-EGTA-AM (NP-EGTA) for 30 min, re-suspended in a small volume (200–300 µl) of fresh extracellular medium, and placed over cultured HEK293 cells expressing GFP-tagged P2X2 receptors to ATP (HEK293-P2X2, gift from Prof. R. Evans, University of Leicester, UK). To evaluate release of ATP, the transmembrane currents were recorded in the HEK293-P2X2 cells that had an astrocyte lying on their surface; simultaneously, elevation in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration was induced in the astrocytes by UV uncaging.</p>
<p>It has to be noted that contrary to the experiments with astrocytes in culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-BalPrice1">[21]</xref>, the spatial density of acutely isolated cells in our experiments was rather low, as shown previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Lalo2">[34]</xref>.

We performed recordings from the HEK293 cell–astrocyte couples, which were separated from any other cells by at least 15–20 microns of free space to ensure that HEK293-P2X2 cells were activated by ATP released only from contacting astrocyte.</p>
<p>Flash photolysis and fluorescent imaging were performed with the aid of a IX51 inverted microscope and epifluorescent illumination via UPLSAPO60XW/NA1.2 objective (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). To monitor the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> level, astrocytes were constantly illuminated at 480±10 nm using OptoLED light source (Cairn Research, Faversham, UK), and fluorescence was measured at 535±25 nm. Astrocytes from dn-SNARE and GFAP-EGFP mice were loaded with Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Rhod-2 and illuminated at 530±10 nm; fluorescence was measured at 590±30 nm. The fluorescent images were recorded using Retiga 2000R enhanced CCD camera (<italic>QImaging</italic>, Canada); exposure time was 35 ms at 2X2 binning. Elevation in the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> level was evaluated by a ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> ratio averaged over the whole cell image after background subtraction.</p>
<p>For uncaging of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, cells were illuminated by a brief pulse (200 ms) of UV light (365±10 nm) emitted by high-power LED NCSU033AT (Nichia, Tokyo, Japan), peak power 500 mW, and estimated power at an objective &gt;150 mW. Illumination was delivered via OptoLED dual-port epifluorescence condenser (Cairn Research, UK). In addition to photolysis, Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise was induced in the astrocytes by fast application of agonists of PAR-1 receptors (10 µM TFLLR) or NMDA receptors (20 µM NMDA); these agonists did not cause any response in HEK293-P2X2 cells when applied without astrocytes placed over HEK cells.</p>

<title>Electrophysiological Recordings</title>
<p>Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings from HEK293-P2X2 cells, neurons, and astrocytes were made with patch pipettes (4–5 MΩ for neurons and HEK293-P2X2 cells and 6–8 MΩ for astrocytes) filled with intracellular solution (in mM): 110 KCl, 10 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 5 MgATP, pH 7.35. Intracellular solution for recording in neurons and astrocytes contained 0.2 mM EGTA, and the solution for HEK293-P2X2 cells contained 10 mM EGTA and 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. In some experiments (simultaneous recording of GABA-mediated and ATP-mediated synaptic currents), KCl was replaced by KGluconate. Currents were monitored using an AxoPatch200B patch-clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, USA) filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 4 kHz. Experiments were controlled by the PCI-6229 data acquisition board (NI, USA) and WinFluor software (Strathclyde University, UK); data were analyzed by self-designed software. Liquid junction potentials were compensated with the patch-clamp amplifier. Series and input resistances were, respectively, 5–7 MΩ and 500–1100 MΩ in the HEK cells and neurons and 8–12 MΩ and 50–150 MΩ; both series and input resistance varied by less than 20% in the cells accepted for analysis. For activation of synaptic inputs, axons originating from layer IV–VI neurons were stimulated with a bipolar coaxial electrode (WPI, USA) placed in the layer V close to the layer IV border, approximately opposite the site of recording; the stimulus duration was 300 µs. For the recording of EPSCs and IPSCs, the stimulus magnitude was set 3–4 times higher than minimal stimulus adjusted to activate the single-axon response in the layer II pyramidal neurons as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Pankratov2">[13]</xref>. In order to trigger synaptically driven astroglial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, the single episode of theta-burst stimulation (HFS) was delivered; the HFS episode consisted of 5 pulses of 100 Hz stimulation, repeated 2 times with 200 ms interval (total 10 pulses per episode).</p>

<title>Fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> Imaging in Astrocytes Situ</title>
<p>To monitor the cytoplasmic-free Ca<sup>2+</sup>concentraton [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, cortical astrocytes were loaded by 40 min incubation with Fura-2AM. For fura-2 excitation, cells were alternately illuminated at wavelengths of 340±5 nm and 380±5 nm using the OptoScan monochromator (Cairn, Faversham, UK). Fluorescent images were recorded using Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with UMPLFL20x/NA0.95 objective and 2× intermediate magnification and Andor iXon885 EMCCD camera; exposure time was 35 ms at 2×2 binning; experiments were controlled by WinFluor software.

<p>To investigate the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling activated by PAR-1 receptor agonist, cortical neurons and astrocytes of wild-type and dn-SNARE mice were loaded with 50 µM Fluo-4. The whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were used to confirm the identification of neurons and astrocytes and verify the lack of changes in the basic electrophysiological properties of the dn-SNARE astrocytes.

<p>For investigation of vesicular dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), acutely isolated cortical astrocytes were loaded with FM1-43 fluorescent dye (2.5 µM), and FM1-43 fluorescence was excited at 820 nm and observed at 560±20 nm.</p>
<p>For immunolabeling of vesicular transporters, secretory organelles, and astroglial markers, acutely isolated astrocytes were incubated with 0.1 µg/ml of antibodies following antibodies: rabbit polyclonal anti-VNUT1 (T-12), goat polyclonal anti-cathepsin D (N-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse monoclonal anti-VGLUT1 (McKA1), mouse monoclonal anti-PSD95 (6G6-1C9), mouse monoclonal anti-GLT-1 (10B7, Abcam), mouse monoclonal anti-NeuN (A60), rabbit monoclonal anti-S100b (EP1576Y, Millipore), goat monoclonal anti-SV2A, mouse monoclonal anti-NG2, and rabbit polyclonal anti-GFAP (Sigma). Prior to cell loading, antibodies were conjugated to the green fluorescent dye DyLight488 (VNUT1, VGLUT1, PSD-95, NeuN, NG2, and GFAP) or red fluorescent dye DyLight594 (VNUT1, SV2A, cathepsin-D, LAMP3, GLT-1, S100β) using Lighting-Link antibody conjugation system (Innova Bioscience, Cambridge, UK) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Antibodies to VNUT1 (recognizing intraluminal epitopes), VGLUT1 (recognizing cytoplasmic epitope), and cathepsin-D (intraluminal epitope) were applied to living astrocytes directly; other antibodies were conjugated with BioPORTER protein delivery reagent (Genlantis, San Diego, CA) 10 min prior to incubation. Immediately after isolation from the neocortical slice, living astrocytes were pre-incubated with 2% of normal bovine serum (Sigma) in the extracellular saline for 30 min to block unspecific binding sites. After them, cells were gently washed two times with clean extracellular saline for 5 min and then incubated with antibodies for 60 min at room temperature.

<title>Measurement of Extracellular ATP Concentration in Brain Tissue</title>
<p>The concentration of ATP within cortical slices (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s012">Figure S10</xref>) was measured using microelectrode biosensors obtained from Sarissa Biomedical Ltd (Coventry, UK). A detailed description of the properties of ATP biosensors and recording procedure has been published previously in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Pearson1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Frenguelli1">[55]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Huckstepp1">[58]</xref>. Briefly, biosensors consisted of ATP metabolizing enzymes immobilized within a matrix on thin (25–50 µM) Pt/Ir wire. This allowed insertion of the sensors into the cortical slice and minimized the influence of a layer of dead surface tissue. The concentration of ATP has been calculated from the difference in the signals of two sensors: a screened ATP sensor and screened null-sensor, possessing the matrix but no enzymes. This allowed us to compensate for release of any nonspecific electro-active interferents. Biosensors show a linear response to increasing concentration of ATP and have a rise time of less than 10 s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Frenguelli1">[55]</xref>. Biosensors were calibrated with known concentrations (10 µM) of ATP before the slice was present in the perfusion chamber and after the slice had been removed. This allowed compensation of any reduction in sensitivity during the experiment. Biosensor signals were acquired at 1 kHz with a 1400 CED interface and analyzed using Spike 6.1 software (Cambridge Electronics Design, Cambridge, UK).</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>All data are presented as mean ± SD, and the statistical significance of difference between data groups was tested by two-population <italic>t</italic> test, unless indicated otherwise. The spontaneous transmembrane currents recorded in HEK293-P2X2 cells and neurons were analyzed off-line using methods described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Pankratov2">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Pankratov3">[54]</xref>. Briefly, phasic transmembrane currents of an amplitude higher than 2 SD of baseline noise were selected for the initial detection of spontaneous events. Then every single spontaneous event was analyzed within the 140 ms time window, and its amplitude and kinetics were determined by fitting the model curve with single exponential rise and decay phases. As a rule, mean square error of fit amounted to 5%–20% of peak amplitude depending on the background noise. Whenever error of fit exceeded 25%, spontaneous currents were discarded from further analyses.</p>
<p>The amplitude distributions of spontaneous and evoked currents were analyzed with the aid of probability density functions and likelihood maximization techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Pankratov3">[54]</xref>; all histograms shown were calculated as probability density functions. The amplitude distributions were fitted with either multiquantal binomial model or bimodal function consisting of two Gaussians with variable peak location, width, and amplitude. The decay time distributions were fitted with bimodal functions. Parameters of models were fit using likelihood maximization routine. For each particular distribution, the fit with quantal or bimodal model was accepted only when it has a confidence level α≤0.05. To monitor and analyze the time course of changes in the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous currents, the amplitude and frequency were averaged over the 1 min time window.</p>
<p>For the basic analysis of the time course of quantal parameters of the evoked IPSCs, the mean quantal content was evaluated as reciprocal square of coefficient of variation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Pankratov3">[54]</xref>, and the quantal size was calculated as ratio of mean amplitude to the mean quantal content.</p>

Lower panel shows functional characterization of astrocytes, using voltage-clamp recordings (performed after the uncaging experiment). From left to right, whole-cell currents activated by the series of depolarizing steps from a holding potential of −80 mV and currents evoked by fast application of 20 µM NMDA and 100 µM glutamate at −80 mV. The current evoked by glutamate in the presence of 30 µM NBQX and 50 µM D-AP5 is mediated by glutamate transporters. (B) Rhod-2 fluorescent signals have been monitored in the hippocampal astrocytes simultaneously with whole-cell recording of transmembrane current in HEK293 cells voltage-clamped at −80 mV in the control (upper panels) and in the presence of 10 µM PPADS (low panels). Flash of UV-light (365 nM) caused an elevation of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the astrocyte followed by the burst of phasic currents in the HEK293 cell; a few spontaneous events could be observed in control in the absence of UV illumination. Similar burst of activity in the sniffer cell was induced by the specific agonist of astroglial PAR-1 receptors (TFLLR). Both the baseline and UV-elicited spurious currents were strongly inhibited (decrease in the amplitude was 89%±6% and 93%±5%, respectively; <italic>n</italic> = 4) after application of P2X receptor antagonist PPADS, confirming that they were mediated by receptors to ATP.

Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were performed at a membrane potential of −80 mV in the presence of 100 µM picrotoxin, 1 µM TTX, 50 µM NBQX, and 30 µM D-AP5. Dots indicate the fast (orange) and slow (green) spontaneous currents categorized by the decay time as shown in the panel (B).

In the control, the fast sEPSCs exhibited the unimodal amplitude distribution with quantal size of 9.96 pA; slow spontaneous currents had quantal size of 5.54 pA. Application of TFLLR altered neither the frequency nor the amplitude of fast currents but significantly increased the frequency of slow currents. The amplitude distribution of slow currents underwent significant changes showing the secondary peak located at double quantal size (11.2 pA); individual slow events of double quantal size are indicated in panel (A1) by double dots. (D) The pooled data on the frequency, quantal amplitude, and mean quantal content of fast and slow spontaneous currents (mean ± SD for 12 neurons). Stimulation of astrocytes with TFLLR increased the frequency and quantal content of slow currents but did not alter the fast currents. Effects of TFLLR on frequency and quantal content of slow currents were statistically significant with <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005 (one-way ANOVA). NF279 significantly reduced the quantal size and frequency of both fast and slow spontaneous currents (*<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). These results support the different origin of fast and slow purinergic currents. The character of changes in the slow currents is compliant with the increase in the probability of ATP release under TFLLR.</p>

Note that amplitude distributions of sEPSCs recorded from individual wild-type neurons exhibit distinct fraction of small events, and number of small events rises dramatically under action of TFLLR. Good agreement between bin histograms and probability density functions, both in the individual cells and in the whole sample, verifies that the existence of two populations of purinergic currents was not an artifact of analysis procedure.

<p><bold>Interaction between P2X and GABA receptors in the mouse neocortical neurons depends on intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and activity of protein kinase C.</bold> (A) Whole-cell transmembrane currents were recorded in the acutely isolated pyramidal neuron of layer 2/3 of somatosensory cortex at a membrane potential of −80 mV. The currents were elicited by rapid application of GABA (100 µM) and nonhydrolysable ATP analogue α,β-meATP (20 µM) at time intervals indicated below. The cell was perfused with an intracellular solution containing a low concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-chelator EGTA (0.2 mM). Note the significant decrease in the amplitude of GABA-activated current recorded 2 s after application of P2X receptor agonist. (B) GABAergic and purinergic currents were recorded using the same protocol as in (A) but with intracellular solution containing 10 mM EGTA+1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> to clamp cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> at baseline level. Clamping of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> eliminated the P2X receptor-triggered inhibition of GABA-evoked currents. (C) Pooled data (mean ± SD for eight cells) on the GABA receptor-mediated currents (% of control) recorded 2 s after application of P2X receptor agonists in the presence of high and low concentrations of intracellular EGTA and in the presence of protein kinase inhibitors H-89 (3 µM), KT5720 (200 nM), staurosporine (5 nM), and GF109203x (30 nM). At concentrations used, H-89 and KT5720 were selective for protein kinase A, GF109203x was selective for protein kinase C, and staurosporine was effective on both PKA and PKC. The asterisk (*) indicates the statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005) difference in the mean amplitude of GABA-induced current recorded before and after application of P2X receptor agonist. The significant reduction of GABA-evoked currents in the presence of low intracellular EGTA strongly supports its dependence on cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation. Note that the reduction in the GABA-evoked current was abolished by inhibitors of PKC but not PKA. There was no statistically significant difference in the effects of ATP and its nonhydrolysable analog, suggesting that the observed effect was not mediated by phosphorylation of extracellular domain of GABA receptor by ectonuleotidases.</p>

The whole-cell currents were recorded at a membrane potential of −40 mV using intracellular solution containing either 0.2 mM EGTA (upper traces) or 10 mM EGTA+1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> to clamp cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> at physiological resting level (middle traces) or 0.2 mM EGTA and 100 nM of PKC blocker GF109203x.

Outward currents were mediated by GABA receptors (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g006">Figure 6</xref>), and inward currents were mediated by P2X receptors.

The asterisk (**) indicates the statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005) difference in the mean amplitude of mIPSCs recorded in control and TFLLR for 0.2 mM EGTA. The graphs on the right show changes in the frequency and amplitude of inward currents. The increase in the frequency and decrease in the mean amplitude of sEPSCs occurred due to appearance of a large number of smaller and slower sEPSCs, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001747-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001747.s005">Figure S3</xref>. There was no significant difference in the effect of TFLLR on the frequency and amplitude of sEPSCs at different conditions, verifying the independence of astroglial ATP release on intracellular perfusion of neurons. The selective attenuation of GABAergic synaptic currents in the presence of low intracellular EGTA strongly supports the postsynaptic mechanism of effect and its dependence on cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation and activity of protein kinase C.</p>

The model was based on a simplified description of neurotransmitter diffusion suggested by Rusakov and Kullman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Rusakov1">[53]</xref>. The movement of ATP molecules released from the nerve terminal (A) was considered a free two-dimensional diffusion inside of the cylindrical synaptic cleft of a radius of 100 nm and height of 20 nm and a three-dimensional diffusion in the porous medium outside of the synaptic cleft. Movement of ATP after release from the glial site (B) was also calculated as a three-dimensional diffusion in the porous medium with the following parameters: diffusion coefficient D = 0.2 µm/ms (50% lower than for glutamate diffusion), free volume factor 0.12, and tortuosity factor of 1.34. To account for the quick breakdown of ATP by ectonucleotidases, the kinetic scheme for transporter uptake was replaced by Michaelis–Menten kinetics of ATP-&gt;ADP conversion with V<sub>max</sub> and K<sub>M</sub> values of 2.2 µM/s and 33 µM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Henneberger1">[63]</xref>. In both cases, the conservative estimate (i.e., longer travel) of linear spine density as 1 spine/µm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001747-Halassa3">[46]</xref> was used. (A) Graph shows simulated time course for ATP concentration after release of 1,000 molecules from the vesicle at the centre of synaptic cleft (r = 0) for the different distances: middle of synaptic cleft (r = 0.05 µm), edge of synaptic cleft (r = 0.1 µm), and middle of typical intersynaptic distance (0.5 µm).(B) Graph shows simulated time course for ATP concentration after release of 1,000 molecules from ectopic (glial) site located at the middle of the intersynaptic distance, for the following locations: vicinity of the release site (r = 0.05 µm), edge of the nearest synapse (r = 0.5 µm), and centre of nearest synapse (r = 0.6 µm). Red horizontal line in both graphs indicates a minimal level of ATP that can reliably activate P2X2 and P2X4 receptors, set as 10% of EC50 (highest estimate for both receptors is 10 µM). Note that release of 1,000 ATP molecules from ectopic site is sufficient to activate extrasynaptic (r = 0.05) and perisynaptic (r = 0.5) but cannot reliably activate receptors inside synaptic cleft (because of hampered diffusion from extracellular space into the narrow cleft).</p>

The response to synaptic release does not show strong dependence on distance to release site (A), resulting from the saturation of receptors. Response to glial release does not show steep dependence either, and this can be explained by the decrease in the ATP concentration at r = 0.5 (edge of synapse) that is compensated by an increase in the density of receptors. Note that the simulated P2X responses to glial release have smaller amplitudes and slower kinetics than responses to the synaptic release.</p>
