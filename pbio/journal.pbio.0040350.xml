				<article-title>Can DNA Distortion Turn RAG into a Potent Transposase?</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>Antigen receptor gene rearrangements are initiated by the RAG1/2 protein complex, which recognizes specific DNA sequences termed RSS (recombination signal sequences). The RAG recombinase can also catalyze transposition: integration of a DNA segment bounded by RSS into an unrelated DNA target. For reasons that remain poorly understood, such events occur readily in vitro, but are rarely detected in vivo. Previous work showed that non-B DNA structures, particularly hairpins, stimulate transposition. Here we show that the sequence of the four nucleotides at a hairpin tip modulates transposition efficiency over a surprisingly wide (&gt;100-fold) range. Some hairpin targets stimulate extraordinarily efficient transposition (up to 15%); one serves as a potent and specific transposition inhibitor, blocking capture of targets and destabilizing preformed target capture complexes. These findings suggest novel regulatory possibilities and may provide insight into the activities of other transposases.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The normal gene-rearranging activities of V(D)J recombination bear a striking resemblance to transposition by certain “cut-and-paste” transposases, including members of the retroviral integrase superfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b003">3</xref>] and the <italic>hAT</italic> family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b004">4</xref>]. In both reactions, a segment of DNA bounded by specific recognition elements is excised from the chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b002">2</xref>]. The key difference is that in transposition, the transposase inserts the excised fragment elsewhere in the genome, whereas in V(D)J recombination, the excised segment is typically lost from the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b002">2</xref>]. Purified RAG proteins can, however, transpose a DNA sequence flanked by two conserved sequence elements (recombination signal sequences or RSS) differing in length (i.e., a 12-RSS and a 23-RSS) into an unrelated DNA target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b006">6</xref>]. This discovery led to new models for RAG involvement in many of the as-yet unexplained oncogenic translocations involving immunoglobulin and T cell receptor loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b008">8</xref>]. To date, however, few in vivo rearrangements have been unequivocally identified as RAG transposition events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b011">11</xref>]. In light of this, investigators have proposed a variety of potential regulatory controls that might limit transposition, such as reversal of the reaction by disintegration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b007">7</xref>] or inhibition of transposition by the C-terminus of RAG2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b014">14</xref>] or by GTP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b013">13</xref>].</p>
      <p>Given that some transposases show distinct preferences for certain targets, it was reasonable to hypothesize that target site selectivity could serve as a mechanism to curb RAG-mediated transposition without affecting RAG recombination activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b015">15</xref>]. Insertion into preferred target sites could steer transposition events to innocuous genomic locations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b016">16</xref>] or into the formation of harmless alternative V(D)J recombination products termed “open-and-shut” and “hybrid” joints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b016">16</xref>]. Early studies suggested that RAG transposition events, although detected throughout plasmid target sequences, favor GC-rich regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b006">6</xref>]. A subsequent study of intramolecular transposition reported a modest preference for a GC-rich hotspot sequence located near the center of a short (329 base pair [bp]) excised fragment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b017">17</xref>], although the short length of the target and the limited flexibility of short duplex DNA fragments would restrict the range of other available target sequences in this situation. More recent experiments showed that transposition is stimulated by targets bearing hairpin ends; even in a relatively large (2,700 bp) plasmid target, the overwhelming majority of transposition events (84%) occurred within the terminal four nucleotides of the hairpin tips of a cruciform structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b016">16</xref>]. Subsequent work confirmed that cruciforms are preferred targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b011">11</xref>].</p>
      <p>Given that the terminal four nucleotides of a hairpin strongly influence recognition by structure-specific endonucleases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b018">18</xref>], we sought to determine how the sequence of the terminal nucleotides of a hairpin might influence the efficiency of transposition. We investigated the ability of oligonucleotide hairpin targets bearing each of 16 possible self-complementary four-nucleotide hairpin tip sequences to stimulate transposition, and we also analyzed several different cruciform tip sequences in the context of supercoiled plasmids. Our data show that certain hairpin sequences stimulate extraordinarily efficient transposition (15% of substrate converted to product), revealing the RAG transposase to be far more active than previously suspected. We also discovered that one particular hairpin serves as a potent and specific inhibitor of transposition, impairing target capture and/or destabilizing already formed target capture complexes. This mechanism provides a potential regulatory control that acts at a specific step that is essential for transposition, but dispensable for normal V(D)J recombination.</p>

        <title>Hairpin Tip Sequence Modulates Transposition Efficiency</title>
        <p>The hairpin structures previously examined bore the tip sequence 5′ TA • TA 3′ in a variety of different stem configurations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b016">16</xref>]. To determine whether hairpins with other sequences at the tip might also act as preferred targets for RAG transposition, we designed a set of 16 self-complementary oligonucleotides with all possible four-nucleotide combinations surrounding the dyad axis of the inverted repeat. Each of these oligonucleotides bears the same stem sequence and should anneal into a double-stranded molecule bearing one hairpin end. The sequence of the stem is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, in this case terminating in the AC hairpin tip. We tested the ability of these hairpin oligonucleotides to serve as targets for in vitro transposition by incubating them with core RAG proteins and precleaved RSS (signal ends) in a standard transposition assay (in Mg<sup>2+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), followed by denaturing gel electrophoresis. Most transposition events occurred at or very near the hairpin tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), in agreement with previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b016">16</xref>].</p>

All inverted repeats fold into hairpins sharing the same stem sequence (box). Hairpins differ only in the four nucleotides surrounding the dyad axis of the inverted repeat (arrowhead) and are named according to the first two nucleotides of this sequence (bold).</p>

Error bars represent standard error of the mean. “x” indicates the median value for the 16 hairpin tips.</p>

At time points earlier than 30 min, bands representing transposition products formed from the TA target were not substantial enough for quantification. Transposition products formed from the CT target were also prepared at the same time points; there was not sufficient product for quantification.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>To quantify the effects of different hairpins, we calculated the transposition efficiency for each target as the percentage of signal ends transposed into that target. The sequence of the hairpin tip modulated the efficiency of transposition over a more than 50-fold range, from virtually undetectable (the CT hairpin) to quite robust (&gt;6% for the GC hairpin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g001">Figure 1</xref>C, lanes 19 and 3, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). The TA hairpin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g001">Figure 1</xref>C, lane 6), corresponding to the tip sequence studied previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b016">16</xref>], yielded a transposition efficiency near the median (0.9%) calculated for all 16 hairpins. One hairpin sequence, CT, was an especially poor target, with values lower than non-hairpin targets (unpublished data; also see below). These results show that the nucleotide sequence, rather than the base composition of the tip, is critical: TC, for example, gave at least 10-fold more transposition than CT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). In light of earlier work, it is particularly interesting to note that GC was at least 7-fold more active than CG; this is one clear indication that features other than GC content are important for transposition (see below).</p>
        <p>Since the C-terminus of full-length RAG2 (which is lacking from the core version of the protein) has been implicated in down-regulating transposition activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b014">14</xref>], we repeated our measurements of transposition into all 16 hairpin sequences using full-length RAG2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). The data generally followed the trends established by core RAG2. Although a few hairpin sequences showed a decrease in transposition efficiency, reducing the median transposition efficiency across all sequences from 0.9% to 0.6%, the range of efficiencies was even greater than that observed with core RAG2, with a 140-fold difference between the most active (GC) and the least active (CT) target sequences. Note that the efficiency of transposition into the GC hairpin remained roughly 7.5-fold more than the median, as observed for core RAG2. We conclude that, with precleaved ends and hairpin targets, the C-terminus of RAG2 does not substantially suppress transposition activity and does not affect the choice of hairpin tip sequences used as transposition targets.</p>
        <p>Transposition products can be “disintegrated” in vitro by a reversal of the transposition reaction: the RAG proteins can catalyze a nucleophilic attack on the phosphate backbone linking the signal end to target, either through hydrolysis or transesterification, using the 3′-hydroxyl on the target created by the initial transposition event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b007">7</xref>]. High levels of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (25 mM) are optimal for disintegration in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b007">7</xref>]. Although all of our reactions were performed at more physiologic Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels (3 mM), we considered the possibility that differences in apparent transposition efficiency might be influenced by sequence-specific effects on disintegration. To test this hypothesis, we performed time course experiments using several hairpin tip sequences: CT, TA, and GC. With TA and GC, we did not observe any decrease in the levels of products prior to the 2-h time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g001">Figure 1</xref>F), suggesting that disintegration did not play a major role in determining levels of transposition products during the 30-min incubation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g001">Figure 1</xref>C–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g001">1</xref>E. (Transposition into CT was too low to be detected at any time points in this experiment.) We conclude that the hairpin tip sequence exerts its primary effect on the formation rather than the stability of transposition products.</p>
        <p>Because self-complementary oligonucleotides can exist in two stable base-paired isoforms, hairpins (formed by intra-molecular annealing) or dimers (formed by inter-molecular annealing) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040350-sg001">Figure S1</xref>A), additional control experiments were necessary. We examined three annealed targets (the least active target, CT, and two average targets, TA and TG) by native gel electrophoresis to resolve the hairpin and dimer isoforms, both before and after a transposition reaction. Both the CT and TA hairpin targets annealed to form hairpins and remained exclusively hairpins under our conditions; only TG showed a mild tendency to form dimers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040350-sg001">Figure S1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040350-sg001">S1</xref>C). All three targets yielded the expected transposition products (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040350-sg001">Figure S1</xref>D). Based on these data as well as experiments using supercoiled plasmids bearing extruded cruciforms (see below), the variations in transposition efficiency observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g001">Figure 1</xref> are not attributable to tip sequence effects on hairpin formation or stability.</p>
        <p>We next tested how much influence the sequence distal to the four terminal nucleotides of the hairpin might have on the efficiency of transposition by altering either the entire stem sequence of the hairpin or simply the nucleotide in the third position (n-3) from the dyad axis of the inverted repeat (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040350-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040350-sg002">S2</xref>B).

These data confirm that the sequence of the four nucleotides around the hairpin tip is the primary determinant of the ability of the RAG transposase to employ the hairpin as a target.</p>

        <title>Cruciform-Bearing Plasmid Targets Also Show Strong Sequence Effects</title>
        <p>To evaluate the effects of hairpin tip sequence on transposition efficiency using more physiologic substrates, we constructed three plasmids encoding fully self-complementary inverted repeats that differ only in the four nucleotides surrounding the dyad axis of the repeat. This allowed us to place the hairpin sequences in direct competition with the 2,700-bp plasmid backbone as transposition targets. Under conditions of sufficient negative supercoiling, the 106-bp inverted repeat sequences form a stable cruciform structure composed of two 53-bp cruciform arms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b020">20</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). A series of DNA topoisomer preparations of various superhelical densities was made [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b023">23</xref>]. Upon analysis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (unpublished data), a DNA sample in which 100% of the plasmids contained fully extruded cruciforms was used for transposition studies. As a negative control, a relaxed plasmid was prepared so that the inverted repeat would remain in the linear conformation. Each of the three plasmids was tested with the inverted repeat in the linear conformation, and, in agreement with previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b016">16</xref>], each supported low levels of transposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, lanes 1, 3, and 5). In the supercoiled sample containing 100% cruciforms, hairpins containing the TA and GC tips stimulated transposition (lanes 2 and 4), whereas the CT hairpin remained a very poor target (lane 6). The GC cruciform was a better target than TA, and we observed a shift toward more double insertion products with this target. GC stimulated up to 100-fold more transposition events than CT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, compare lanes 4 and 6).</p>

        <p>To determine whether transposition events in these plasmids occurred at the site of the inverted repeat or elsewhere, we took advantage of a unique ScaI restriction site in the plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). If transposition events occurred at the inverted repeat, ScaI digestion would yield two discrete, labeled products of predictable size under denaturing conditions (to measure both single and double insertion events), but random transposition events throughout the target would yield a smear of labeled products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). ScaI digestion did in fact yield two distinct products, but only when the cruciforms were extruded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). (Note that even though the ScaI digestion was incomplete, more than 95% of the digestion products appeared in the two expected fragments, indicating that transposition is consistently targeted to the hairpin ends.) Our results clearly show that transposition is targeted to cruciform structures that compete very effectively with the 2.7-kb duplex DNA flanking the cruciforms as transposition targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). The marked difference in the efficiency with which the different cruciform tip sequences were targeted provides further evidence that the preference of the RAG transposase for a given hairpin is significantly influenced by the nucleotides at the tip.</p>

        <title>Hairpins Target Significantly More Transposition than a GC-Rich “Hotspot”</title>
        <p>We next compared one of our hairpin targets to the only specific sequence heretofore reported to represent a preferred target for RAG transposition: 5′-GCCGCCGGGCG, a “hotspot” originally discovered in the context of intramolecular transposition, in which the signal ends must insert near the center of a short (329 bp) linear DNA fragment for steric reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b017">17</xref>].

As expected, both cruciform structures strongly stimulated transposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g003">Figure 3</xref>D, compare lanes 5 and 7).

This is in sharp contrast with the cruciforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g003">Figure 3</xref>D, lanes 6 and 8).

        <title>A Novel Transposition Inhibitor</title>
        <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g002">Figure 2</xref>, the RAG transposase targeted plasmids containing linear inverted repeats with low efficiency. This efficiency rose dramatically when inverted repeats were extruded as cruciforms, with one interesting exception. Upon extrusion of the CT cruciform, transposition efficiency actually <italic>decreased</italic> from already-low levels by approximately 90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, compare lanes 5 and 6). This result suggested that the CT hairpin could be suppressing transposition events elsewhere in the plasmid.</p>
        <p>To pursue this observation, we set up a competition experiment using equal masses of two plasmid targets of equivalent length: GC cruciform and either CT cruciform or CT linear inverted repeats. The CT cruciform substantially inhibited transposition (&gt;90%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g004">Figure 4</xref>A; compare lanes 1 and 5). In contrast, the linear CT target had no effect on transposition into the GC cruciform (compare lanes 1 and 4). This result was confirmed and extended by a competition experiment using oligonucleotide targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). In this experiment, transposition into a preferred GC hairpin (lane 4) was challenged by addition of a smaller GC target (lane 2 shows transposition products formed from this target alone) or a smaller CT target (lane 3 shows transposition products formed from this target alone). Addition of an equimolar amount of the CT hairpin oligonucleotide almost completely (&gt;90%) suppressed the usually robust transposition targeted to a GC hairpin (compare lanes 4 and 6). This effect was in stark contrast to challenge of the GC target by a different (smaller) GC target (lane 5); in this case, the smaller target had little effect on transposition into the larger target. As expected, total transposition into the GC targets in lane 5 was quantitatively similar to that seen in lane 4. We conclude that inhibition of transposition is a specific effect of the CT hairpin. These findings were reproduced using full-length RAG2 preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g004">Figure 4</xref>B, lanes 7–11). The CT hairpin also inhibited transposition into an AC hairpin, indicating that this effect is not specific to the GC target (unpublished data). Furthermore, we note a 90% reduction of transposition into the 2,700-bp plasmid backbone in the presence of a 106-bp CT cruciform, suggesting that inhibition of transposition by a CT hairpin is not specific to hairpin targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, compare lanes 5 and 6).</p>

            <title>The CT Hairpin Inhibits Transposition</title>
            <p>(A) CT cruciform inhibits transposition into a plasmid target. Transposition was performed using a GC cruciform target mixed with either the linear CT inverted repeat or CT cruciform (lanes 4 and 5). Amount of each plasmid used is indicated.</p>
            <p>(B) CT oligonucleotide-encoded inverted repeat inhibits transposition into an oligonucleotide target. A total of 0.5 pmol of hairpin target or a mix of 0.25 pmol each of two targets was added to a transposition reaction (lanes 5 and 6). Reaction was performed using both core RAG2 and full-length RAG2 preparations. Transposition products were resolved on a 15% denaturing acrylamide gel. Small GC and CT hairpins are GC-2 and CT-2, as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040350-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A.</p>
            <p>(C) CT hairpin is a potent inhibitor. Experiments were performed using oligonucleotide-encoded hairpins. Error bars represent standard error of the mean calculated from three independent experiments.</p>
            <p>(D) CT hairpin does not inhibit cleavage of a PCR-generated substrate, even at 10-fold molar excess.

        </fig>
        <p>To assess the potency of the inhibitor, we examined the effect of decreasing amounts of inhibitor on transposition efficiency. At only one-fifth the concentration of the GC target, the inhibitor reduced transposition by approximately 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). We conclude that the CT cruciform is a strong inhibitor of transposition both in <italic>cis</italic> (in the same target molecule) and in <italic>trans</italic>.</p>
        <p>The inhibitory effects described above could not be attributed to effects on cleavage, because the protocol used in these experiments employs precleaved donor RSS oligonucleotides. Since the RAG proteins catalyze transposition by an intermolecular transesterification mechanism, we next assessed the effect of the inhibitor sequence on the cleavage step, which involves intramolecular transesterification (hairpin formation). We added increasing amounts of the CT hairpin to a standard cleavage reaction using molar ratios of inhibitor:recombination substrate of up to 10:1. No inhibition of double-strand break formation was observed, indicating that the inhibitor sequence does not affect nicking or hairpin formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). We also tested the ability of the RAG complex to make hairpins from a pre-nicked substrate in the presence of the inhibitor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040350-sg003">Figure S3</xref>A). Neither the CT hairpin inhibitor sequence nor the GC control sequence affected hairpin formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040350-sg003">Figure S3</xref>B). These data demonstrate that the CT hairpin specifically inhibits transposition.</p>
        <p>To probe the mechanism of inhibition, we assessed target capture of hairpin oligonucleotides by the RAG transposase. Previous work demonstrated that the RAG proteins form a target capture complex, containing target DNA and a 12/23-RSS pair, that is stable to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b016">16</xref>]. These results were recapitulated using a precleaved 12/23-RSS pair and a radiolabeled hairpin target in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g005">Figure 5</xref>A; the RAG–signal end complex exhibited robust binding to the GC hairpin (lane 4). In contrast, binding to a CT hairpin was less efficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g005">Figure 5</xref>A, lane 3). In spite of its weak interaction with the RAG–signal end complex, the CT hairpin substantially diminished target capture of the GC hairpin target when present in a 1:1 molar ratio (lane 5). This effect was not observed with control non-hairpin or with noninhibitory hairpin sequences (GC, TA) present at 1:1 molar ratios (unpublished data). These findings suggest that the CT hairpin sequence is able to inhibit or destabilize target interactions with the RAG–signal end complex.</p>

            <p>(B) GC target is bound by the RAG-signal end complex. CT hairpin is bound only weakly by the RAG–signal end complex and inhibits target capture of a GC target.

        <p>The DNA–protein complexes detected in electrophoretic mobility shift experiments such as those described above consist of two species: a target capture complex (RAG proteins, signal ends, and target) and a strand transfer complex containing the same components, but with a covalent linkage between the signal ends and the target DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b016">16</xref>]. To distinguish between these species, we split reactions into two equal parts and subjected them to gel electrophoresis with and without deproteinization (in the former case, to determine what fraction of the DNA–protein complexes correspond to covalently linked transposition products). In agreement with the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g005">Figure 5</xref>A, the CT inhibitor decreased capture of the GC target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, compare lanes 3 and 5). Deproteinization revealed that about 20% of the DNA–protein complexes with the GC target consists of transposition products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, compare lanes 3 and 4). We detected no transposition products with the CT hairpin (lane 10). As expected, the CT hairpin also markedly decreased levels of transposition products formed from the GC target (compare lanes 4 and 6).</p>
        <p>Could the inhibitor sequence destabilize preformed target capture complexes? We added unlabeled CT hairpin (at a 1:1 molar ratio with respect to labeled GC target) and assessed its effect on target capture complexes over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). The amount of target capture complex diminished substantially over the observed period, with only one-fifth the original amount remaining after 2 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g005">Figure 5</xref>C); this decrease is similar to that observed in transposition products in experiments described earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). These data indicate that the CT hairpin sequence destabilizes preformed target capture complexes.</p>
        <p>How might this destabilization take place? The CT hairpin might either destabilize target binding or disrupt the RAG–signal end complex. We therefore examined the effect of the CT hairpin on signal end complexes using an electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay that measures release of free signal ends. In this experiment, the RAG–signal end complexes generated by cleavage were not destabilized by the CT hairpin, even when it was present in a 10-fold molar excess over the signal ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). These data, along with the failure of the inhibitor sequence to affect cleavage (see above), demonstrate that the effect of the CT hairpin is specific to target (and not RSS) binding.</p>
        <p>Finally, we considered the possibility that the inhibitor sequence might stimulate removal of transposition products by disintegration. To test this, we generated oligonucleotide substrates corresponding to transposition products that would be derived from the GC hairpin and incubated these in the presence of RAG proteins and buffer, GC hairpin, or CT hairpin sequences. The results clearly show that neither of the hairpin sequences stimulated disintegration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040350-sg003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>

        <title>Hairpins Can Stimulate Surprisingly Efficient RAG Transposition</title>
        <p>Our data show that most hairpins are strongly attractive targets for RAG transposition and that the efficiency of target utilization is profoundly modulated by the sequence of the terminal nucleotides of the hairpin. Of the 16 possible tip sequences, the majority were strong targets for the RAG transposase in the context of self-complementary oligonucleotides. When we tested a subset of these sequences as both cruciforms (in supercoiled plasmids) and as linear inverted repeats (in relaxed plasmids), only the cruciform structures stimulated transposition. Finally, we found that even an average hairpin target sequence (TA) stimulated far more transposition activity than a previously reported GC-rich hotspot.</p>
        <p>When RAG transposition was first discovered, it was noted that there was a preference for GC-rich sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b006">6</xref>]. A subsequent analysis of intramolecular transposition reported a modest preference for a GC-rich hotspot sequence located near the center of a short (329 bp) excised fragment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b017">17</xref>], although the range of other available target positions in this molecule was restricted by steric constraints (the short length of the linear DNA) in this setting. The most likely explanation for the reported GC-rich sequence preference is that these base pairs are more likely to form altered DNA structures. Nevertheless, our data show that the GC content alone is not the determining factor in targetability: the GC cruciform was a significantly better target than CG, CC, or GG. Tsai et al. also compared four self-complementary oligonucleotide sequences with three different tips (CT, TG, and two TA tips) and reported that only one TA tip was a preferred target for the RAG transposase, although no quantification was provided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b017">17</xref>]. Our data agree that the CT tip is not a transposition target for the RAG proteins. It is not clear why the authors failed to detect transposition with the TG or second TA tip; it is possible that these two oligonucleotides did not form hairpins under the annealing conditions used in that study.</p>

        <title>The Sequence of the Hairpin Tip Strongly Affects Its Utilization as a Target for Transposition</title>
        <p>Transposition efficiency among the 16 oligonucleotide hairpins varied over a 50- to 140-fold range and was determined primarily by the sequence of the four nucleotides around the hairpin tip. This variation was not secondary to disintegration. The most attractive target, a hairpin with the terminal sequence GC, was surprisingly efficient, and even more so (15%) under our most physiologic in vitro transposition conditions (a plasmid target, in Mg<sup>2+</sup>). These results are especially striking in light of the fact that the in vitro cleavage efficiency of our RAG protein preparations under these conditions is generally 20%–30%. This provides the first evidence that a substantial fraction of post-cleavage signal end complexes is actually capable of transposition. This result is unexpected, given the prevailing opinion that RAG proteins are, in general, a rather inefficient transposase. The exception to the rule—the CT hairpin, which specifically inhibits transposition without affecting RSS cleavage—is no less surprising and is discussed in more detail below.</p>

        <title>How Does Hairpin Tip Sequence Influence Transposition?</title>
        <p>How does the sequence of the hairpin tip so strongly affect its use as a target? Since all hairpins tested remain largely folded as hairpins (and the cruciforms are very stable under our experimental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b019">19</xref>]), targeting to hairpin ends does not appear to be secondary to DNA melting, as was previously suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b017">17</xref>]. Our data lead us to propose an alternative hypothesis: the strong effect of hairpin sequence on transposition efficiency is driven by sequence-induced structural differences at the various hairpin tips. Two lines of evidence support this model. First, hairpin sequence affects recognition by structure-specific nucleases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b024">24</xref>]. Second, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies have shown that the sequence at a DNA hairpin tip significantly affects its three-dimensional structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b026">26</xref>]. Typically, stable self-complementary loops consist of either two or four nucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b026">26</xref>]. Some evidence suggests that many tips having a pyrimidine in the second nucleotide position 5′ of the dyad axis and a purine in the second nucleotide position 3′ of the axis (<underline>x</underline> _ • _ <underline>x</underline>) form loops of two, not four, nucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b028">28</xref>]. Indeed, our most poorly used hairpin targets, CT and TT, fit this description, suggesting a possible correlation between loop size and the ability of the RAG complex to target a given hairpin.</p>

        <title>A Specific and Potent Inhibitor of Transposition</title>
        <p>We were intrigued by the CT hairpin tip sequence that is refractory to transposition. We considered two potential explanations for this result: the RAG transposase may fail to bind to the CT tip structure(s), or it may bind in a nonproductive mode that impedes catalysis. A prediction of the second model is that the CT hairpin should inhibit transposition into other substrates, which is indeed what we observed. The CT sequence, when in hairpin form, inhibited transposition into the plasmid backbone and even into the most favorable target, the GC hairpin. It is interesting to note that the CT hairpin is a much more potent inhibitor than the only other previously reported inhibiting factor, GTP: with the hairpin, nearly complete inhibition is obtained at a 1:1 inhibitor to target ratio, as opposed to the greater than 10,000:1 ratio for GTP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b013">13</xref>]. Our data suggest that the CT hairpin tip binds the transposase in some fashion that renders the complex refractory to transposition. That the RAG–signal end complex is able to bind the CT hairpin, albeit weakly, supports this possibility. The fact that the CT hairpin rather inefficiently forms a target capture complex indicates that this DNA structure may bind in a different mode. Investigation of the precise mode and site of such binding awaits the development of more sophisticated analytical techniques.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s3e">
        <title>Mechanism of Inhibition</title>
        <p>Since our data indicate that the inhibitor does not affect DNA cleavage (hydrolysis and intramolecular transesterification), the CT hairpin likely does not affect the catalytic step of transposition. We also found that it does not stimulate disintegration. This inhibitor does, however, impede the ability of the RAG proteins to efficiently capture target, and it destabilizes preformed target capture complexes without affecting the stability of signal end complexes. These findings suggest a plausible mechanism for inhibition: we propose that the inhibitor specifically prevents stable target capture, inhibiting transposition without affecting DNA cleavage (or, presumably, the subsequent steps in V(D)J recombination).</p>
        <p>Given that hairpins are preferred targets, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the portion of the active site responsible for binding to the hairpin coding ends in the postcleavage complex could serve as the target binding site. It is not known when this binding pocket is formed during the course of the reaction. There are at least three distinct possibilities: (1) the target binding pocket is present before cleavage (and likely consists of the coding flank binding site); (2) it corresponds to a portion of the active site that stabilizes a “pre-hairpin” transition state that is present prior to completion of cleavage, but perhaps not at the beginning of the reaction; or (3) the target binding site is revealed only after cleavage, perhaps by a conformational change induced by strong binding of the RAG proteins to the signal ends forming the stable signal end complex. It is also, of course, perfectly conceivable that the target binding pocket is unrelated to the coding flank binding pocket.</p>
        <p>Assuming that the hairpin inhibitor binds to the target binding pocket, our observation that it does not inhibit cleavage (hairpin formation) even when present at substantial molar excess is consistent with the third possibility, that the target binding site is revealed only after cleavage. Further studies of this inhibitor should allow us to answer more detailed questions about the nature of target binding.</p>

        <title>Implications for RAG-Mediated Transposition In Vivo</title>
        <p>The initial discovery of RAG transposase activity prompted speculation that transposition could explain certain oncogenic translocations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b008">8</xref>]. Thus far, however, there has been no direct evidence to implicate the transposition activity of the RAG proteins in any oncogenic chromosome rearrangements—nor has there been anything to guide our search for such evidence. We have now demonstrated that the RAG transposase exhibits striking target preferences, and that these preferences are largely modulated by target structure. Given that mammalian genomes contain a variety of structural elements, including palindromic sequences, triplet and tetra nucleotide repeat sequences capable of forming hairpin structures, and quadruplex structures that possess hairpin-type ends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b033">33</xref>], there may be many preferred targets for the RAG transposase. In fact, many translocation breakpoints have been shown to lie at or near sites of DNA distortion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040350-b039">39</xref>]. The discovery of strong target preferences could serve as a useful guide to those searching for the footprint of RAG transposition in genomic rearrangements.</p>

        <title>Plasmid DNA substrates.</title>
        <p>Plasmid-encoded inverted repeats with a TA, GC, or CT tip (termed plasmids “TA,” “GC,” or “CT”) were generated by cloning a 106-bp inverted repeat into the EcoRI site of pUC8. For this, the two strands of the inverted repeat were synthesized to form a DNA fragment with a duplex EcoRI site and complementary single-strand region at the end that comprises the center of the inverted repeat. The strands were hybridized, cut with EcoRI, and ligated into EcoRI-cut pBR325. Following ligation, the plasmids were transformed into HB101 and clones selected for sensitivity to chloramphenicol. These were then transferred, as an EcoRI fragment, into pUC8. The resulting inverted repeats share a 51-bp repeat sequence (5′-pUC8 backbone-GAATTCCCAATTGATAGTGGTAAAACTACATTAGCAGACTGGGGCTGCAGG-dyad axis) and differ only in the identity of the four nucleotides at the dyad axis of the repeat, as specified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g002">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040350-g004">4</xref>.
