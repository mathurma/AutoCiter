<abstract>
<p>Small RNAs (sRNAs) can operate as regulatory agents to control protein expression by interaction with the 5′ untranslated region of the mRNA. We have developed a physicochemical framework, relying on base pair interaction energies, to design multi-state sRNA devices by solving an optimization problem with an objective function accounting for the stability of the transition and final intermolecular states. Contrary to the analysis of the reaction kinetics of an ensemble of sRNAs, we solve the inverse problem of finding sequences satisfying targeted reactions. We show here that our objective function correlates well with measured riboregulatory activity of a set of mutants. This has enabled the application of the methodology for an extended design of RNA devices with specified behavior, assuming different molecular interaction models based on Watson-Crick interaction. We designed several YES, NOT, AND, and OR logic gates, including the design of combinatorial riboregulators. In sum, our <italic>de novo</italic> approach provides a new paradigm in synthetic biology to design molecular interaction mechanisms facilitating future high-throughput functional sRNA design.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Is our current knowledge of <italic>in vivo</italic> RNA-RNA interactions and thermodynamics enough to perform the unsupervised computational design of fully synthetic sequences encoding functional RNAs in living cells? Recent work gave a positive answer for the challenging problem of designing activating riboregulators. This was done by integrating theory and computation to develop a physicochemical framework for the design of regulatory RNA systems, using Watson-Crick interactions and optimization algorithms. Still, the objective function was not directly validated, preventing using with confidence the methodology for other systems. We here validate experimentally an objective function relying on free energies of RNA complex activation and formation, which allows extending the framework to produce logic devices that can be implemented to program gene expression. We demonstrate that it is possible to design increasingly sophisticated and modular functions, pointing our results out that energy-based optimization methods can perform the large combinatorial search required for RNA design.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Small non-coding RNA (sRNA) has raised a big interest because of the predictability and modularity of its binding with a large variety of molecules and macromolecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Isaacs1">[1]</xref>. Given this functional potential, the use of sRNAs to control protein expression has triggered a new way to engineer integrated regulatory networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Isaacs2">[2]</xref>. Although rational techniques have been successfully applied to redesign natural systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Lucks1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Mutalik1">[4]</xref>, engineer synthetic ones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Isaacs2">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Bayer1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Callura1">[7]</xref> and assemble modular structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Beisel1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Carothers1">[10]</xref>, <italic>de novo</italic> sequence design still remains difficult because of the size and complexity of multi-state systems. To overcome this, we propose an evolutionary computation design strategy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Rodrigo1">[11]</xref>, where all design specifications are automatically assembled to yield an optimal solution.</p>
<p>In this work, we demonstrate a full design automation of RNA sequences that implement diverse riboregulatory mechanisms, able to produce several sRNA-based logic gates that are functional in living cells. We generalize our previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Rodrigo1">[11]</xref> on the design of riboregulators for activating protein expression, which could be considered as YES gates, to derive objective functions to design riboregulators implementing several logic gates. Furthermore, we experimentally validate our objective function by considering mutants of natural and synthetic riboregulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Rodrigo1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Mutalik1">[4]</xref>, and this allows assessing the generality of the methodology.</p>
<p>By generalizing the positive riboregulation paradigm, where an sRNA interacts through Watson-Crick pairing with a target mRNA to trigger a conformational change enabling ribosome docking, we can extend the methodology to design arbitrary logic gates, accounting for new regulatory mechanisms, such as anti-termination, and implementing constrained design strategies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003172-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). For that, we exploit antisense and allosteric RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Brantl1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Majdalani1">[13]</xref>, two conserved mechanisms based on precise secondary structures, and whose major role has been reported over the last years in bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Selinger1">[14]</xref>, but also in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Yelin1">[15]</xref> and plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Wang1">[16]</xref>. Our method starts from random sequences to proceed with successive rounds of a mutation operator, followed by selection using an objective function that accounts for the free energies of all possible reactions and the secondary structures of all species. Previous work on full design automation of nucleic acids was focused on <italic>in vitro</italic> annealing of small DNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Stojanovic1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Ran1">[20]</xref>, hammerhead ribozymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Penchovsky1">[21]</xref>, or ribosome binding sites (RBSs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Salis1">[22]</xref>.</p>

<p>In the following, we will start by formulating the RNA design problem as an inverse problem to program gene expression.

We will evaluate such an objective function by engineering and characterizing our own mutant library of synthetic riboregulators activating gene expression. Afterwards, we will show and exemplify how to design sRNA-based logic gates, including complex gates involving synergistic interactions of different sRNAs as inputs. Finally, we will discuss the results stressing the limitations of our methodology.</p>

<title>Formulation of an inverse problem</title>
<p>Riboregulation is based on conformational changes, after interaction, in the structures of RNA molecules, which allow controlling protein expression. To design such regulatory RNAs, we optimize the potential energy curve defined in the transition state theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Laidler1">[23]</xref>, minimizing the free energies of the transition and hybridization states. We assume that the individual folding state is formed before intermolecular RNA-RNA interaction, because its time scale is of milliseconds whereas hybridization takes seconds or even minutes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Sosnick1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Yurke1">[25]</xref>. The interaction mechanism is guided by means of the seed region (nucleation site; the first nucleotides that get paired) to form an intermediate complex at the transition state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Lucks1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Rodrigo1">[11]</xref>. Then, both RNAs are destabilized to form a complex with a new structure and minimal energy.</p>
<p>Here, we consider the structures of all individual species as design specifications. To address the computational design, we firstly have to find sequences folding into predefined structures and, second, find sequences able to interact specifically among them to form complexes displaying the correct behavior. The structural constraints are exploited to considerably reduce the combinatorial space and accelerate the design of nucleic acid sequences. Our computational procedure optimizes at the same time all RNA sequences of the circuit. During the optimization, we do not impose constraints in nucleotide sequence, such as stems with high GC-content or loops with YUNR motifs, which have been found in natural systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Brantl1">[12]</xref>. Importantly, our designs are just based on basic physicochemical principles and not on additional fitting, allowing the solution of the full design problem.</p>
<p>But, is the proposed objective function predictive enough to allow the designability of multi-state RNA devices? To illustrate this question, we constructed here a library of mutants of one of our previously designed circuits (the device RAJ11 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Rodrigo1">[11]</xref>, implementing a YES logic gate as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003172-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Then, we represented the experimental values of the measured activation fold against the objective function calculated for those mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003172-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). To give further support to our objective function, we evaluated it for a set of mutational variants of the IS10 antisense RNA system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Mutalik1">[4]</xref>, implementing a NOT logic gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003172-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), and then we represented those values against the experimental repression folds reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003172-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). This natural system constitutes an independent validation. The objective function here (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003172.e013">Eq. 13</xref>) accounted for the free energy of formation and the length of the seed in the sRNA-mRNA interaction. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003172-g002">Fig. 2</xref> shows a good correlation (without any fitting) for our objective function and experimental data, which supports the designability of those devices.</p>

<title>Design of simple sRNA-based logic gates</title>
<p>We first applied our design methodology to obtain sRNA-based repression and activation. Many known riboregulators impart a repressive action on their targets by promoting accelerated degradation through endoribonucleases, which initiate turnover of both RNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Bandyra1">[26]</xref>. Instead, we here account for sRNAs that bind specifically to a segment of its target mRNA in order to inhibit translation (NOT logic function) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Mutalik1">[4]</xref>. The most intuitive mechanism consists in blocking the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, which is generally located about eight base pairs upstream of the start codon (AUG), for preventing ribosome docking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003172-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). For instance, in <italic>E. coli</italic> plasmid F, sRNA FinP directly binds to the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of protein TraJ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Brantl1">[12]</xref>. We constructed the following objective functions (definitions of Δ<italic>G</italic><sub>kin</sub> and Δ<italic>G</italic><sub>str</sub> in section <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) to solve the optimization problem<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003172.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003172.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>These functions are associated to each entry of the truth Table, and then the solution of this problem will yield NOT logic gates.

<p>Although the majority of sRNA-mediated regulation in <italic>E. coli</italic> consists in repression, an sRNA can also operate as an activator (YES logic function) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Isaacs2">[2]</xref>. In this case, the sRNA <italic>trans</italic>-activates a <italic>cis</italic>-repressed gene by its 5′ UTR. After interaction, the conformational change in the 5′ UTR releases the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and allows translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003172-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). For instance, in <italic>E. coli</italic>, sRNA DsrA is responsible of activating the expression of sigma factor RpoS, which modulates the stress response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Majdalani1">[13]</xref>. Hence, we constructed the following objective functions<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003172.e002"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003172.e002" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>The solution of this problem will produce the intended function specified in the truth Table. This problem is much complex that the previous one because here the two RNA species have structure. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003172-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, we show several computational designs of YES logic gates based on conformational changes in the 5′ UTRs of the target genes. We applied our methodology with different structures for the <italic>trans</italic>-activating sRNAs, while maintaining a common structure for the 5′ UTR. We also attempted the computational design of a synthetic RNA able to interact with the RpoS 5′ UTR, and then enhance the translation rate. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003172.s002">Fig. S2</xref> shows the sequences and structures obtained.</p>

<p>In addition, we exploited our methodology to design NOT logic gates based on structured 5′ UTRs. Here, the <italic>trans</italic>-activating sRNA interacts with the 5′ UTR to induce a conformational change that blocks the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003172-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). The objective functions to solve the corresponding problem read<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003172.e003"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003172.e003" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>where the difference with <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003172.e001">Eqs. (1)</xref> relies on the imposition that the RBS must be paired at the intramolecular level. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003172-g005">Fig. 5A</xref> shows a computational design implementing this regulatory mechanism. We also designed riboregulators with activation activity based on a mechanism of anti-termination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Dawid1">[27]</xref>. This design relies on a <italic>trans</italic>-regulating sRNA able to destabilize the structure of a terminator, which is here the <italic>cis</italic>-regulating element, resulting in a complex that allows the progression of the RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003172-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>).

Exploiting further this modularity, we carried out the design of an OR logic gate using the 5′ UTR sequence just designed. We now enforced the design of a new sRNA that had also the ability of releasing the RBS, maintaining constant the 5′ UTR sequence.

<p>Motivated by the previous results, we carried out the design of cooperative riboregulations. The regulatory function of multiple-sRNA complexes has not been reported in prokaryotes (all natural systems for riboregulation involve two RNA species, at most interacting with proteins such as RNA chaperones or endoribonucleases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Lioliou1">[28]</xref>), which further encourages the exploration by means of computational methods. To illustrate the power of our approach, we focused on the design of synergistic activation (AND logic function), where two <italic>trans</italic>-regulating sRNAs first interact among them to form a complex that will then activate translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003172-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In conclusion, we have followed a bottom-up approach to design RNA devices with YES, NOT, AND, and OR logic functions, based on first physical principles. These logic gates implement multi-state sRNA devices for which there was no design method before, and that can be interconnected to create more complex logic programs. Although we could solve intermolecular inverse folding problems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Dirks1">[29]</xref>, it was not possible the systematic design of multiple RNA species implementing arbitrary logic gates. For their design, each entry of the truth Table imposes a structural specification. Here, we accounted for the free energies of all possible reactions (thermodynamic potential) to solve this multi-objective inverse problem by optimization. Because our methodology does not require natural sequences (with the exception of key motifs such as the Shine-Dalgarno sequence), we have solved the full design problem of regulatory RNA for implementing logic programs in living cells.</p>
<p>Our approach has, however, some limitations, which prospect further research in the field. One of them is the use of the secondary structure to model riboregulation. This type of regulation could involve pseudoknot interactions and even non-canonical base pairing, for which three-dimensional models could better capture the interaction features <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Das1">[30]</xref>. In addition, our model does not account for RNA chaperons (e.g., Hfq) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Vogel1">[31]</xref>, nor co-factors such as Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Zn<sup>2+</sup>, nor kinetic binding effects, which might have an impact on the designs. Another restraint of the current method is the enforcement of a given structure for all single species in the circuit (although not for the complex ones), because this constrains the sequence space of possible solutions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Rodrigo1">[11]</xref>. By leaving unconstrained those structures, we could perform additions and/or deletions (not only replacements) of nucleotides during the optimization, and we would need to include into the function Δ<italic>G</italic><sub>str</sub> a new term for the stability (e.g., based on free energy). Finally, the convergence of the algorithm is highly reduced when evolving systems with multiple species, making necessary to reduce the sequence space by reusing functional modules to obtain more sophisticated systems.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, we have demonstrated the power of computational design (through heuristic optimization) to overcome the complexity in obtaining fully synthetic riboregulation, exploring the vast combinatorial space of sequences. The proposed objective function was shown predictive enough to allow the designability of multi-state RNA devices, as Δ<italic>G</italic><sub>kin</sub> explained differences in experimental repression fold for a set of mutational variants of the IS10 antisense RNA system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003172-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Mutalik1">[4]</xref>. Moreover, we recently validated experimentally some designs of YES logic gates in bacteria, encouraging further work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Rodrigo1">[11]</xref>. Even though, the design problem does not require a perfect prediction, and similar or even lower correlations can be sufficient to tackle this problem, such as in the case of automated RBS design <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Salis1">[22]</xref>. Of course, more sophisticated objective functions will be developed in the coming years to improve the design of functional RNAs.</p>
<p>The combination of Δ<italic>G</italic><sub>kin</sub> and Δ<italic>G</italic><sub>str</sub>, for every possible conformational state (intra- or intermolecular) of a given genotype, results in an effective free energy that defines a fitness landscape. In case of riboregulation, the total search space can be about 10<sup>40</sup> sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Rodrigo1">[11]</xref>, and typical optimizations that lead to sufficiently good solutions consist of 10<sup>6</sup>–10<sup>7</sup> iterations. Indeed, the generalized problem of finding the nucleotide sequences of multi-species ensembles that will fold into specified conformations has an exponentially large number of solutions. It remains however a question how to distinguish several optimized sequences (assuming equal energetic features). For instance, differences in intracellular stability of the species will affect the ratio sRNA/mRNA, and then be key for the regulatory activity. Additionally, the kinetics of RNA folding, binding, and turnover will have significant impact on the performance of designed RNA circuits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Lucks1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Carothers1">[10]</xref>. All these criteria, either from first principles or from experimental feedback, will be exploited to enhance the design methodology.</p>
<p>Our present methodology is general and could be applied to obtain designs based on further mechanisms. In addition, instead of attempting full designs, it permits reusing complete known sequences (natural or synthetic) to constrain the design of new logic systems. This capacity enables the creation of a large variety of combinatorial sRNA systems, increasing sophistication at a reduced computational cost. Moreover, our approach can be used to analyze potential RNA sequences for a given functional circuit as a reverse engineering tool. The designed sRNA-based logic gates can be combined with transcription regulation to generate more complex functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Friedland1">[32]</xref>, and also be integrated into libraries of models for the computational design of more complex networks involving transcription and post-transcription regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Rodrigo2">[33]</xref>. Yet, our full design automation approach together with high-throughput screening techniques will propel the construction of modular and orthogonal devices for synthetic biology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Chin1">[34]</xref>.</p>

<title>Optimization algorithm</title>
<p>Our evolutionary algorithm consists in a Monte Carlo Simulated Annealing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003172-Kirkpatrick1">[40]</xref>, which can be parallelized to evolve a population of sequences. Our approach consists in optimizing an objective function accounting for the interaction and structure of the RNAs that lead to the target behavior.</p>
<p>The design specifications comprise the secondary structures of all single RNAs, critical subsequences of nucleotides (e.g., RBS), the reaction free energies, and the structure of the output complex. The algorithm starts from pure random sequences satisfying the structural and subsequence constraints, although it can also be specified an initial sequence. If the subsequence constraints do not allow satisfying the structures, the algorithm stops. Eventually, we can introduce a relaxation in the structural constraints (through an harmonic constraint) allowing having species with dissimilar structures to their targets. Subsequently, an iterative process of mutation and selection is implemented (see scheme of the algorithm in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003172.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). The mutation operator consists in either random or directed nucleotide replacements. We do not consider additions or deletions, so the length of the RNAs is maintained constant. To speed up the convergence, we generated a mutation operator that only created <italic>useful</italic> mutations, e.g., mutations that are always guaranteed to contribute for an interaction among RNA species. We do this by taking a word (i.e., set of consecutive nucleotides) from one sequence, making its reverse complementary, and randomly inserting it into another sequence. Initially, the length of this word is three, and it is reduced to one (i.e., single point mutation) during the optimization process. Those mutations speed up the <italic>in silico</italic> evolution. If a nucleotide that has to be mutated belongs to a stem, its pair in the stem is also mutated with the corresponding nucleotide with the aim of preventing the disruption of the secondary structure and improving the convergence. We avoid sequences having consecutive repeats of four or more identical nucleotides.</p>
<p>The objective function is a weighted sum of two terms to be minimized. The first term (Δ<italic>G</italic><sub>kin</sub>) accounts for the reaction kinetics of the system. For that, we compute the Δ<italic>G</italic> and <italic>α</italic> of all possible reactions, having between species <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic><disp-formula id="pcbi.1003172.e013"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003172.e013" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(13)</label></disp-formula>Notice that Δ<italic>G</italic><sub>kin</sub> is a negative-valued variable. We will minimize or maximize Δ<italic>G</italic><sub>kin</sub> if the reaction must occur or not (in order to obtain the specified behavior).

Then, 500 µL of each culture were centrifuged for 2 min at 13,000 rpm, and resuspended in the same volume of water. Subsequently, we loaded the multiwell plate with 200 µL for each sample, which was assayed in a Victor X5 (Perkin Elmer) to measure absorbance (600 nm absorbance filter) and fluorescence (485/14 nm excitation filter, 535/25 nm emission filter, for GFP). Background values of absorbance and fluorescence, which corresponded to water, were subtracted to correct the signals, and the normalized fluorescence was calculated as the ratio of fluorescence and absorbance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003172.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). Hence, we calculated the fold changes of activation (relative changes in GFP protein expression in absence or presence of sRNA).</p>
