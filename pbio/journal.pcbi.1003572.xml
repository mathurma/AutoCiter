<abstract>
<p>One of the primary mechanisms through which a cell exerts control over its metabolic state is by modulating expression levels of its enzyme-coding genes. However, the changes at the level of enzyme expression allow only indirect control over metabolite levels, for two main reasons. First, at the level of individual reactions, metabolite levels are non-linearly dependent on enzyme abundances as per the reaction kinetics mechanisms. Secondly, specific metabolite pools are tightly interlinked with the rest of the metabolic network through their production and consumption reactions. While the role of reaction kinetics in metabolite concentration control is well studied at the level of individual reactions, the contribution of network connectivity has remained relatively unclear. Here we report a modeling framework that integrates both reaction kinetics and network connectivity constraints for describing the interplay between metabolite concentrations and mRNA levels. We used this framework to investigate correlations between the gene expression and the metabolite concentration changes in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> during its metabolic cycle, as well as in response to three fundamentally different biological perturbations, namely gene knockout, nutrient shock and nutrient change. While the kinetic constraints applied at the level of individual reactions were found to be poor descriptors of the mRNA-metabolite relationship, their use in the context of the network enabled us to correlate changes in the expression of enzyme-coding genes to the alterations in metabolite levels. Our results highlight the key contribution of metabolic network connectivity in mediating cellular control over metabolite levels, and have implications towards bridging the gap between genotype and metabolic phenotype.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Regulation of metabolic activity in response to environmental and genetic perturbations is fundamental to the growth and maintenance of all cells. A primary regulatory process used by cells to control the activity of their metabolic network is the alteration in the expression of enzyme-coding genes. How these alterations regulate metabolite concentrations is an important question in the quest towards unraveling the genotype-phenotype relationship. The link between the expression levels of enzymes and metabolite concentrations is governed by the kinetics of individual reactions, which in turn are interlinked with each other due to the complex connectivity structure of metabolic networks. Although the enzyme-metabolite relationship is relatively well studied at the level of individual reactions, our understanding of the regulation of metabolite levels in complex networks has remained incomplete. In this study, we show that the constraints imposed by the network connectivity are key determinants of the relationship between gene expression and metabolite concentration changes. Our results provide mechanistic insight into the function of complex metabolic networks and have implications for health and biotechnological applications.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cellular metabolic networks provide basic biochemical building blocks and a thermodynamically favorable environment for growth and maintenance. Due to this crucial role of metabolism, cells have evolved various mechanisms to regulate metabolic reactions in response to genetic and environmental changes. Metabolic reactions can be regulated either by modulating the availability of the corresponding enzymes, e.g. through altered transcription and/or translation, or, by modulating the enzyme activities through post-translational modifications or through binding of small molecules. Our knowledge of the landscape of transcriptional, translational and post-translational regulation of metabolism is expanding with the increasing availability of datasets that provide genome-wide views of the abundance and interactions between mRNAs, proteins and metabolites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Gallego1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Wang1">[6]</xref>. Although the relative contribution of each of these regulatory layers is still unclear and is likely to be context dependent, it has long been clear that the adjustments in the cellular metabolic phenotype (i.e., rates of reactions, or fluxes, and metabolite levels) often involve changes at the level of gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Murray1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Tu1">[9]</xref>. For example, previous studies have shown that the gene expression changes in metabolic networks are centered on metabolites that are crucial for adjusting the network state in response to specific perturbations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Patil1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Zelezniak1">[11]</xref>. Despite successful outcomes of these and other studies suggesting a strong link between transcriptional regulation and changes in metabolite levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Murray1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Patil1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Bradley1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-UrbanczykWochniak1">[13]</xref>, the relationship between the two has remained elusive.</p>
<p>The task of developing models for describing the relationship between gene expression and metabolite concentrations is challenging due to the multiple layers of regulation involved in between (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003572-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Several of the regulatory mechanisms involved, such as translational control or allosteric regulation, are currently poorly understood at the scale of the whole network. Measurement of protein abundances or enzyme activities is also currently difficult to perform at the network scale and in complex systems such as human tissues. Thus, in the absence of data for intermediate molecular players, a detailed investigation of the link between gene expression and metabolite levels has both a fundamental and a practical appeal. In particular, it is of interest to estimate the degree to which the changes at the level of gene expression affect changes in metabolite concentration and to uncover the underlying mechanisms determining their relationship. In this study, we explore the hitherto poorly understood role of network connectivity constraints in controlling metabolite concentrations in a eukaryotic model organism, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. We postulate that two primary mechanisms will largely determine the association between the changes in mRNA and metabolite levels: reaction kinetics (which are non-linear by nature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Michaelis1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-VanSlyke1">[16]</xref>) and the mass balance constraints imposed by the network, i.e. the balance between production and consumption of metabolites. Although we here focus on mRNA levels due to genome-wide coverage of the available transcriptomics datasets, the proposed model can also be readily applied to enzyme abundance or activity data.</p>

<title>From gene expression to metabolite levels.</title>
<p>A) Metabolite levels are only indirectly affected by changes in gene expression levels, through changes in the corresponding enzyme abundances. Metabolites, in turn, can provide feedback to the regulatory network controlling enzyme abundance/activity. B) Transcript-metabolite relationships are usually many-to-one. We discarded transcripts with insignificant changes (P≤0.05) (grey circles). For the remaining transcripts we combined the corresponding fold changes to derive gene-expression scores for reactions and thereby for consumption or production of metabolites (see Main text). C) Schematic workflow used for the proposed concentration change coupling analysis (CoCCoA). In the first step, physiological measurements from growth experiments are used to constrain the genome-scale metabolic model (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Subsequent flux simulations (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) help in identifying the directionality and range of fluxes under the conditions being compared. Next, by using the comparative transcriptome data, fold changes at the individual gene-expression level are mapped on to the reactions in the network (panel B). CoCCoA integrates the mapped gene-expression data with the network topology by using a model formulation derived from the MM reaction kinetics mechanism and mass balance constraints (main text). The main output from the algorithm is a measure of transcriptional control over metabolite levels, or the CoCCoA scores, which are tested for correlation with the experimentally measured metabolite concentration changes. D) Schematic representation of three different CoCCoA models with varying degrees of network connectivity constraints.</p>

<p>The role of reaction kinetics in controlling metabolite concentration has been previously examined mostly from the perspective of the isolated reaction-metabolite pairs. With such a reaction-centric approach, a previous study on yeast metabolism was able to partially explain changes in the intracellular metabolite levels when using protein abundance as a measure of enzyme availability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Fendt1">[3]</xref>. However, no correlation was observed in the same study when using gene expression data instead of protein abundances. One possible reason for the lack of strong correlation between gene expression and metabolite levels when looking at the isolated enzyme-metabolite pairs is that the large connectivity inherent to metabolic networks is not taken into account. A large fraction of intra-cellular metabolites participate in multiple reactions. For example, over 25% of the yeast metabolites participate in more than three reactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Forster1">[17]</xref>. Consequently, abundance of an enzyme catalyzing a particular reaction cannot completely determine the concentrations of the participating metabolites or the rate of the reaction. Indeed, correlations between mRNA and fluxes, and even between enzyme activities and fluxes, have been often found to be poor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-DaranLapujade1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Rossell2">[21]</xref>. Approaches accounting for the network connectivity of metabolites have been successful in linking gene expression to metabolites in an empirical or qualitative manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Patil1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Bradley1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Cakir1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Moxley1">[24]</xref>, but have achieved only a limited success on the quantitative front. Advantages of both reaction-centered kinetics approaches and network topology-based approaches can be combined in network kinetic models that include detailed kinetics of all involved reactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Klipp1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Cleland1">[28]</xref>. However, application of kinetic models to large metabolic networks is difficult due to their reliance on a large number of parameters. Such parameters are either currently unavailable, or their estimation requires comprehensive measurements of intra-cellular states of interest (e.g. metabolite concentrations, enzyme abundances, and fluxes) in the vicinity of the perturbation to be modeled.</p>
<p>In this study, we propose a steady-state model of the transcriptional control of metabolite concentrations. Our model integrates reaction kinetics and metabolic network connectivity constraints without requiring the knowledge of kinetic parameters. In essence, the model uses mass balance constraints to bridge the individual reaction kinetic constraints with those of the other reactions in the network. The resulting equations provide a log-linear relationship between the fold-change in the concentration of a given metabolite to the fold-changes in the expression of its neighboring genes, as well as topologically more distant genes.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>By analogy to flux coupling analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Burgard1">[29]</xref>, which describes how steady-state fluxes are linked with each other, we termed our approach Concentration Change Coupling Analysis (CoCCoA). Starting with a classical reaction kinetics model, which treats each reaction as an isolated system consisting of a single enzyme and its substrate, we developed a network kinetics approach by accounting for the interactions between different reactions through their shared metabolites. As there is currently a lack of information on <italic>in vivo</italic> enzyme kinetics mechanisms at the network-scale, we used the single-substrate Michaelis-Menten (MM) kinetics for all reactions. In essence, MM kinetics describes the flux or reaction rate <italic>V</italic> as a function of three parameters: i) concentration of the substrate, <italic>S</italic>; ii) maximum capacity of the enzyme pool, <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub>; and iii) a parameter reflecting the enzyme's kinetic properties, <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003572-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The central idea of CoCCoA is to use mass balance constraints on the flux term <italic>V</italic> to link single-reaction kinetics to the other reactions in the network. We considered MM kinetics in the fold-change space, which allowed us to eliminate the need to know the <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> values. For each metabolite, CoCCoA provides an overall transcriptional change score (CoCCoA score) according to the CoCCoA equations, which are developed in the subsequent sub-sections. To assess the proportion of variance in metabolite changes that can be attributed to transcriptional regulation, we compared the calculated CoCCoA scores with the experimentally measured metabolite concentration changes. The overall workflow used is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003572-g001">Figure 1B</xref>.</p>
<p>The first step in our analysis is to calculate a representative transcriptional fold-change for each reaction. As the yeast metabolic network consists of several reactions that are each governed by multiple proteins, we classified all reactions into three types: i) reactions catalyzed by a single enzyme, ii) reactions catalyzed by two or more isoenzymes, and iii) reactions catalyzed by enzyme complexes. We then applied the following rules to calculate the representative fold-changes for all reactions: in the case of isoenzymes, we averaged the fold changes of the related transcripts, while in the case of complexes, we picked the transcript with the lowest fold change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003572-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). We used only significantly changed transcripts (P-value≤0.05) in the presented analysis. Relaxation of this filtering criterion did not change the overall results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003572.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Experimental datasets and the metabolic network</title>
<p>We used four published experimental datasets for evaluating the proposed CoCCoA models. These case studies included three pairwise comparisons – one genetic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Fendt1">[3]</xref> and two environmental perturbations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Kresnowati1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Wisselink1">[30]</xref> – and a time-course dataset obtained during the yeast metabolic cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Tu1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Tu2">[31]</xref>. In all pair-wise comparison studies, both gene expression and metabolite concentration data were obtained from the same experiment. In the case of the metabolic cycle data, although the sampling for transcriptome and metabolome was performed in two separate experiments, the experimental setups were identical and the sampling was performed at comparable time-points spanning all phases of the metabolic cycle. While the metabolic cycle is fundamentally a non-steady-state phenomenon, the observed transcript oscillation period of about 300 minute means that a reasonable degree of pseudo-steady-state can be assumed for applying our model. In the case of the three pairwise comparison studies, the correlations between CoCCoA scores and metabolite concentrations provided a perturbation-centered perspective wherein the responses of different metabolites were analyzed jointly. The metabolic cycle case study allowed us to additionally evaluate the gene expression-metabolite relationship from a metabolite-centered perspective, wherein the response of each metabolite was assessed individually for its conformity to the proposed model.</p>
<p>A genome-scale metabolic reconstruction of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Forster1">[17]</xref> was used to obtain the metabolite-reaction-gene connectivity information and to estimate the reaction directionalities (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). For each case study, we used the experimental measurements of exchange fluxes (uptake and secretion rates of metabolites) to constrain and simulate a flux balance model. Accordingly, we removed all blocked reactions and reactions for which the flux directions could not be unambiguously assigned. We also excluded the reactions for which the predicted flux directions did not agree between the two conditions being compared.</p>
<p>Depending on the extent to which the network connectivity information is included in the calculations, we term the CoCCoA models as 0<sup>th</sup> degree, 1<sup>st</sup> degree, 2<sup>nd</sup> degree, and so on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003572-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). 0<sup>th</sup> degree CoCCoA relies on the enzyme kinetics alone and thus considers only the consumption reaction(s) of any given metabolite. 1<sup>st</sup> degree CoCCoA additionally considers the production of the metabolite by using mass balance constraints. 2<sup>nd</sup> degree CoCCoA further expands the degree of network connectivity accounted for in the model by including the producing reactions of the precursors of the metabolite in question. Alternatively, the 2<sup>nd</sup> and higher degree models can also be expanded on both the consumption and production sides of the metabolite as described in the following sub-sections (also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003572.s011">Text S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Evaluation of non-saturation and mRNA-protein correlation assumptions</title>
<p>The first assumption used in deriving <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003572.e005">equation (2)</xref> implies that the enzyme is not saturated. The opposite situation, i.e. an enzyme approaching saturation, is not amenable for establishing the metabolite-gene expression relationship (or metabolite-enzyme abundance relationship in general), as the reaction velocity will then be only a weak function of the substrate concentration. Recent studies have shown that <italic>in vivo</italic> concentrations for several metabolites, especially from central carbon metabolism, are close to the corresponding <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> values <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Bennett1">[32]</xref>. At these concentrations, reaction rates <italic>V</italic> are close to half of the <italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic>. Although the assumption of <italic>V≪V<sub>max</sub></italic> is not strictly applicable in this flux regime, numerical simulations showed modest errors (around 20%) due to this approximation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003572.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Moreover, if the saturation level does not change drastically between the two conditions being compared, the error remains close to zero (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003572.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Given the advantage that this approximation brings, namely elimination of the need for knowing the <italic>in vivo</italic> kinetic parameters, the cost of the approximation error appears to be acceptable.</p>
<p>The second major assumption is that the fold-change in mRNA level can be used as a proxy for the fold-change in enzyme abundance and ultimately for the fold-change in <italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic>. Critical examination of this assumption is of particular importance as the role of translational efficiency and post-translational modifications in regulating metabolic enzymes is becoming increasingly evident <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-DaranLapujade1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Oliveira2">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Ptacek1">[36]</xref>.

<p>At steady state, the sum of fluxes producing a particular metabolite must be equal to the sum of fluxes through the reactions that use it as a substrate.

<p><italic>T<sup>prod</sup></italic> and <italic>T<sup>cons</sup></italic> denote expression levels of the genes corresponding to the enzymes producing and consuming <italic>S</italic>, respectively. <italic>R</italic> refers to the concentration of the metabolite that is the precursor of <italic>S</italic>. The relation described by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003572.e006">equation (3)</xref> implies a coupling between the concentration changes in <italic>R</italic> and <italic>S</italic>, and is here defined as 1<sup>st</sup> degree coupling. In comparison to the 0<sup>th</sup> degree coupling, the flux term <italic>ln(V/V*)</italic> is eliminated in the 1<sup>st</sup> degree coupling equation and is replaced by two new terms, <italic>ln(T<sup>prod</sup>/T<sup>prod*</sup>)</italic> and <italic>ln(R/R<sup>*</sup>)</italic>. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003572.e006">Equation (3)</xref> brings a new network perspective to enzyme kinetics, whereby gene expression and metabolite concentration changes in the adjacent reactions are linked through the mass balance constraint. Each metabolite pool is thus linked to the reactions consuming it as well as on the reactions producing it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003572-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). When multiple reactions are consuming (or producing) the same metabolite <italic>S</italic>, the consumption (or production) term can be approximated by the geometric mean of the transcript ratios of all the consumption (or production) reactions (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003572.s011">Text S1</xref>).</p>
<p>To evaluate the 1<sup>st</sup> degree model, we compared the experimentally measured metabolite concentration ratios with the 1<sup>st</sup> degree CoCCoA scores based on the transcript fold changes – the first two terms on the right-hand side of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003572.e006">equation (3)</xref>. We note that, although the strict application of our model requires the use of the <italic>ln(R/R<sup>*</sup>)</italic> term, these measurements are often not available. Moreover, a model that is completely independent of the metabolite concentration data will likely be of more practical value. Omitting the <italic>ln(R/R*)</italic> term equates to assuming that the preceding metabolite's concentration does not change between the two conditions; an alternative to omitting this term is explored below, in the 2<sup>nd</sup> degree CoCCoA model, in which the <italic>ln(R/R*)</italic> term is estimated by use of the 1<sup>st</sup> degree CoCCoA model. The effect of omitting the <italic>ln(R/R<sup>*</sup>)</italic> term on CoCCoA scores is further discussed in the later sub-section “<italic>Post-transcriptional regulation</italic>”.</p>
<p>Comparisons of the 1<sup>st</sup> degree CoCCoA scores to metabolite concentrations yielded significant correlations in the two environmental perturbation case studies (<italic>r</italic> = 0.88, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0099 and <italic>r</italic> = −0.96, <italic>P</italic> = 0.038), and a reasonably good correlation (<italic>r</italic> = −0.61, <italic>P</italic> = 0.06) for the genetic perturbation case study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003572-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003572.s001">Figure S1</xref>). For the metabolic cycle case study, around 25% of the measured metabolites showed significant correlations (FDR 10%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003572-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003572.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Although our model suggests positive correlation between CoCCoA scores and metabolite changes, we observed negative correlations in the cases of two of the pairwise comparisons and for some of the metabolites in the metabolic cycle case study. The possible reasons underlying this discrepancy are discussed in the subsequent sub-section “<italic>Negative correlations in CoCCoA</italic>”. We maintain that the negative slopes do not invalidate the significance of the observed correlations, but rather hint at the existence of unaccounted parameters/mechanisms leading to the reversal of slope in some cases.</p>
<p>The number of transcripts that can be used for the calculation of the CoCCoA scores typically increases as more distant reaction nodes in the network are included with the increasing CoCCoA degree. Consequently, the number of metabolites that could be assigned CoCCoA scores varied between the coupling degrees. For example, in the C-source change study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Wisselink1">[30]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003572-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), only 4 metabolites have significant transcript changes corresponding to their consuming reactions and hence only these could be compared against the experimental data for the 0<sup>th</sup> degree analysis. In contrast, 2<sup>nd</sup> degree CoCCoA scores could be calculated for 7 metabolites.</p>

<title>Network propagation of concentration control</title>
<p>In a similar manner as going from the 0<sup>th</sup> to the 1<sup>st</sup> degree coupling, the CoCCoA equations can be further extended to include more distant nodes in the metabolic network. By replacing the concentration ratio in the right-hand side of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003572.e006">Equation 3</xref> (i.e. <italic>R/R*</italic>) with the 1<sup>st</sup> degree CoCCoA relationship for the corresponding precursor metabolite (in this case, <italic>R</italic>), we obtained the 2<sup>nd</sup> degree coupling relationship. This 2<sup>nd</sup> degree model accounts for the gene expression changes corresponding to the precursor's production reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003572-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003572.s011">Text S1</xref>). In all case studies, the 2<sup>nd</sup> degree correlations remained as strong as for the 1<sup>st</sup> degree. This result is notable since the 2<sup>nd</sup> degree coupling score includes expression data from the genes that are further away from the metabolites in question. With further extension of the CoCCoA model in a similar manner, we observed significant correlations up to the 6<sup>th</sup> degree coupling (<italic>P</italic>≤0.05, Fendt <italic>et al.</italic> case study, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003572.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>
<p>To gain further insight into the metabolite concentration control at different network distances, we examined this problem from a metabolite-centric perspective by taking advantage of the broad metabolite coverage of the metabolic cycle case study. First, we extended the higher degree CoCCoA formulation so as to include information from all intermediate reaction steps up to the desired degree (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003572.s011">Text S1</xref>). For example, the calculation of the 3<sup>rd</sup> degree CoCCoA score includes fold changes from the genes associated with the reactions involving all metabolites that are three steps upstream or downstream from the metabolite in question. The inclusion of genes within a desired network distance can either be restricted to the consumption or the production side of the metabolite, or both included simultaneously. This formulation also allowed us to include, if available, measured concentrations of the neighboring metabolites within the desired distance of a given metabolite, and thereby to assess the effect of changes in neighboring metabolites over its concentration. The algorithm used for calculating CoCCoA scores using this formulation is described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003572.s011">Text S1</xref>. In brief, this algorithm first enumerates all paths starting from the metabolite of interest to identify genes that are within a given network distance. Next, it uses graph topology-based heuristics to weight and incorporate the expression fold-changes corresponding to these genes into the CoCCoA equations by using mass balance considerations. Following this, we evaluated the ability of these CoCCoA scores to explain the concentration changes observed during the metabolic cycle. Overall, positive correlations are apparent for most of the metabolites (∼66%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003572-g004">Figure 4A,C</xref>). For the long distance scores, a slightly lower number of metabolites showed positive correlations. The contrast between the close and distant neighbors, however, should be interpreted in light of the highly connected nature of the metabolic network. The numbers of genes that are included in the calculation of CoCCoA scores already reach a plateau at the 4<sup>th</sup> degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003572-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), and thus, even relatively modest distances can mean inclusion of a very large fraction of the network. Consequently, the CoCCoA scores for a given metabolite will become ‘diluted’ due to the noise stemming from the inclusion of gene expression changes pertaining to the reactions that are only indirectly affecting the metabolite of interest. These results from the metabolic cycle case study, together with the results from the pairwise comparison studies, suggest that the close neighbors in the metabolic network exert the majority of the control over metabolite concentrations.</p>

<title>Limitations of CoCCoA formulation</title>
<p>CoCCoA is not applicable in the case of perturbations that are likely to drastically affect the kinetic properties (<italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> values) of several enzymes in the network, or if the metabolite concentrations are considerably above the corresponding <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> values (saturated enzymes). Furthermore, the CoCCoA model needs to exclude reactions for which the flux directionality is ambiguous, and it assumes that the flux directions do not change for the rest of the reactions. Post-translational regulatory mechanisms, which can affect the kinetic parameters, are also not included in the current CoCCoA formulation, as sufficient data are not available to enable their modeling. The latter is perhaps the most restrictive limitation of our model. Post-translational regulation is known to play a crucial role in the yeast central metabolism, wherein several enzymes are controlled by allosteric binding of small molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Metallo1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Braus1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Luttik1">[44]</xref> and/or through post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Oliveira2">[33]</xref>. Together, these various assumptions and limitations can lead to poor or no correlations. In the case of the pairwise comparisons, poor correlations can also result from the pooling of metabolites with positive and negative correlation with CoCCoA scores into a single plot.</p>
<p>According to the CoCCoA model, all examined correlations would be expected to be positive. Among the pairwise comparison case studies, positive correlations were observed only for the glucose pulse study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003572-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).

Flux regulation due to allosteric binding by small molecules and post-translational modifications are likely to be the major factors underlying this discrepancy between the expected positive slopes and the observed negative slopes for the remaining 34% metabolites.

<title>Robustness of CoCCoA towards differences in gene expression and protein abundance fold changes</title>

<title>Network constraints over metabolite concentration changes</title>
<p>The correlation between metabolites concentrations and transcript fold changes becomes evident only when including network connectivity constraints (1<sup>st</sup> and higher degree CoCCoA). Thus, inclusion of gene expression changes associated with the both upstream and downstream reactions was critical for explaining metabolite concentration changes. For all three pairwise comparison case studies, CoCCoA models explained more than 60% of the variation in metabolite changes based on gene expression. For the metabolic cycle case study, CoCCoA could explain variation in about 33% of the measured metabolites, with correlation coefficients as strong as 0.90.</p>
<p>The use of a genome-scale metabolic model was crucial in CoCCoA analysis in order to capture the large connectivity inherent to metabolic networks. Even for a sparsely connected metabolite such as D-Ribose 5-phosphate, for which the 0<sup>th</sup> degree score accounted for only 4 transcripts, the 2<sup>nd</sup> degree CoCCoA score accounted for transcriptional information from 47 genes in the Fendt <italic>et al.</italic> study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Fendt1">[3]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003572-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). With the increasing degree of CoCCoA equations, larger numbers of genes become part of the CoCCoA score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003572-g003">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003572-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). We also observed that, in general, the inclusion of new genes when moving from the 1<sup>st</sup> to the 2<sup>nd</sup> degree CoCCoA maintains the significance of the correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003572-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003572-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). This observation implies strong co-regulation of genes that are linked through common substrates/products. Indeed, co-expression of metabolic genes at short network distances has been observed in earlier studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Kharchenko1">[45]</xref>. The CoCCoA theory suggests that homeostasis of metabolite concentrations is one of the objectives of such topology-oriented co-regulation in metabolic networks.</p>

<title>Post-transcriptional regulation</title>
<p>There are several layers of regulation that the CoCCoA model does not take into account: translational and post-translational regulation, and the kinetic effects of neighboring metabolites' concentrations. With regard to translational regulation, we observed strong correlations between transcript and protein fold changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003572-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003572.s003">Figure S3</xref>), and the CoCCoA results were found to be relatively robust in light of the known variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003572-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). However, it remains to be seen whether these correlations extend through post-translational regulation to enzyme activity. Increasing availability of the genome-wide protein phosphorylation/acetylation data may aid in addressing this question. The CoCCoA framework can be used with enzyme abundance or enzyme activity fold changes in place of transcript fold changes. Using this information could lead to more accuracy in CoCCoA scores, and could furthermore aid in identifying the relative contribution of the different regulatory layers in controlling metabolite concentrations.</p>
<p>The effects of neighboring metabolites' concentrations could be examined thanks to the large coverage of metabolite measurements in the metabolic cycle dataset. The power of CoCCoA in explaining variance in metabolite concentration changes was substantially improved following the inclusion of data for the neighboring metabolites, representing <italic>ln(R/R<sup>*</sup>)</italic> terms in the CoCCoA equations (2.54 fold increase in the median correlation coefficient; <italic>P</italic> = 6.6×10<sup>−8</sup>, Wilcox test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003572-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).

<title>Negative correlations in CoCCoA</title>
<p>Intriguingly, several of the observed negative correlations were found to be not only significant but also quite strong, with <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> values as high as 0.86 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003572-g004">Figure 4</xref>). These negative correlations are indicative of the mechanisms that are unaccounted for in the CoCCoA model and/or highlight cases in which the assumptions of the model do not apply. We observed that the number of positive correlations in the metabolic cycle case study increased considerably when using the concentration change data from the neighboring metabolites (the <italic>ln(R/R<sup>*</sup>)</italic> term in the right-hand side of the 1<sup>st</sup> degree CoCCoA equation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003572-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). This observation suggests that the kinetic effect due to changes in the neighboring metabolites is an important factor contributing to negative correlations. The results from the analysis of the metabolic cycle data also hint that the negative slopes might be characteristic to certain metabolites, for example, those for which the producing/consuming enzymes are regulated predominantly and/or prevalently at the post-translational level. Indeed, we found that the metabolites with poor or negative correlations in the metabolic cycle case study are enriched in the metabolites with previous evidence for post-translational regulation of at least one of their neighboring enzymes (metabolites marked with † in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003572-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, data for post-translationally regulated enzymes from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Oliveira3">[34]</xref>, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0006). In these cases, the post-translational regulation may be counteracting the transcriptional change. Post-translational regulation of an enzyme can change its <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> value and can thereby directly affect CoCCoA scores. Consider, for example, 1<sup>st</sup> degree CoCCoA score. When changes in <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> values are included in the 1<sup>st</sup> degree CoCCoA formula, the score becomes: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003572.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. If the post-translational modifications counteract the transcriptional changes, the <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> ratios in this new score will partially cancel out or even override the transcript ratios. When assuming constant <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> values, the discrepancy between the transcript and <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> ratios in some cases might be sufficiently large to result in CoCCoA scores with opposite sign. On the other hand, the inconsistency between the directions of transcriptional and post-translational regulation (or post-transcriptional regulation in general) implies non-optimal regulation and is unlikely to be a general mechanism used by the cell. However, non-optimal regulation is a possibility for certain enzymes, with two plausible biological explanations: i) the highly non-linear scenario of regulation (resulting from the concerted action of reaction kinetics, incl. allosteric regulation, and mass balance and thermodynamic constraints) can mean that the cell needs to make some locally non-optimal choices in order to achieve a global optimality in regulating the overall metabolism (for example, to take advantage of the distinct time-scales at which post-translational and transcriptional regulations act); ii) the observed behavior is both locally and globally non-optimal in case of certain perturbations. The second scenario would imply that the perturbations in question are unknown or new to the cells in the evolutionary sense.</p>
<p>In addition to the unaccounted post-transcriptional regulation, the simplifying assumptions of constant flux directions and flux split ratios may also be contributing to the observed negative correlations. A wrongly considered flux direction for a reaction would mean that the corresponding fold change in the expression level would be treated in the opposite direction. Similarly, moderate changes in the flux split ratio can also cause a sign reversal in the CoCCoA score if one of the fluxes is significantly lower than the other(s). The interaction between the various missing/simplifying factors in our model can further amplify the difference between the CoCCoA scores and actual concentration changes. How these interactions lead to the reversal of correlation while retaining statistical significance is yet unclear. Further investigation into the mechanisms underlying these intriguing negative correlations would require network-wide <italic>in vivo</italic> measurements of fluxes, metabolite concentrations, protein abundances and functional post-translational modifications. Nevertheless, we note that our model revealed significant correlations in several cases, including perturbations of very different nature. We also note that, in the case of metabolic cycle dataset, significantly more positive correlations were observed than negative (<italic>P</italic> = 2.9e-08, exact binomial test). Together, the statistical and mechanistic considerations suggest that the CoCCoA model captures considerable mechanistic essence of the complex processes governing metabolite levels.</p>
<p>Overall, our model-guided analysis highlighted the role of metabolic network connectivity in modulating metabolite concentration changes and revealed much stronger correlations between gene expression and metabolite levels than previously appreciated. The proposed model can be extended to include translational and post-translational regulation as the data becomes available. From this perspective, we see CoCCoA as a framework with a strong mechanistic yet parameter-free basis, rather than a general relationship. We anticipate that, due to its parameter-free nature, the CoCCoA framework will be widely applicable for modeling metabolite level changes in large metabolic networks.</p>

<title>Experimental datasets</title>
<p>Four different experimental studies reporting gene expression and metabolite concentration measurements for the yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> were used. The first study, Fendt <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Fendt1">[3]</xref>, includes a comparison between wild type yeast and a mutant strain lacking <italic>GCR2</italic>, a transcription factor responsible for activation of glycolytic genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Uemura1">[46]</xref>. In the second study, Kresnowati <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Kresnowati1">[23]</xref>, yeast cultures were grown in carbon-limited chemostat cultures and subjected to a step change in glucose concentration. In the third study, Wisselink <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Wisselink1">[30]</xref>, an evolutionarily engineered strain was grown on either glucose or arabinose as the sole carbon source. In the fourth study, oscillating chemostat cultures were sampled covering different phases of the metabolic cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Tu1">[9]</xref>. A summary of the growth conditions and descriptions of datasets from all case studies is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003572.s006">Table S1</xref>. Metabolite data was used as available in the original studies; a significance cut-off α = 10% was chosen to control for the type 1 error. For the metabolic cycle data, we considered metabolites with the periodicity P-value≤0.05 as reported in the original study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003572-Tu2">[31]</xref>. As the datasets used did not distinguish between the cytosolic and mitochondrial concentration of metabolites, we regarded all metabolite concentrations as cytosolic. Since 2-phosphoglycerate and 3-phosphoglycerate are usually indistinguishable in the MS measurements, we considered only 3-phosphoglycerate gene neighbors and excluded 2-phospoglycerate.</p>
