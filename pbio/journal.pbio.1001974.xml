<p>A ligand of the sex peptide receptor maintains sleep stability and homeostasis by inhibiting wakefulness-promoting neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Sleep, a reversible quiescent state found in both invertebrate and vertebrate animals, disconnects animals from their environment and is highly regulated for coordination with wakeful activities, such as reproduction. The fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, has proven to be a valuable model for studying the regulation of sleep by circadian clock and homeostatic mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that the sex peptide receptor (SPR) of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, known for its role in female reproduction, is also important in stabilizing sleep in both males and females. Mutants lacking either the SPR or its central ligand, myoinhibitory peptide (MIP), fall asleep normally, but have difficulty in maintaining a sleep-like state. Our analyses have mapped the SPR sleep function to <italic>pigment dispersing factor</italic> (<italic>pdf</italic>) neurons, an arousal center in the insect brain. MIP downregulates intracellular cAMP levels in <italic>pdf</italic> neurons through the SPR. MIP is released centrally before and during night-time sleep, when the sleep drive is elevated. Sleep deprivation during the night facilitates MIP secretion from specific brain neurons innervating <italic>pdf</italic> neurons. Moreover, flies lacking either SPR or MIP cannot recover sleep after the night-time sleep deprivation. These results delineate a central neuropeptide circuit that stabilizes the sleep state by feeding a slow-acting inhibitory input into the arousal system and plays an important role in sleep homeostasis.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Sleep is a common trait in animals, from insects to mammals, and it needs to be coordinated with other critical activities such as feeding and reproduction. However, the mechanisms by which this is achieved are not fully understood. The fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has become a key model organism for sleep research and it has been shown that reproduction is one of the factors that can modulate sleep in these animals. Researchers have observed that mating reduces the daytime sleep of female flies and shown that the seminal fluid protein Sex Peptide (SP), a ligand of the Sex Peptide Receptor (SPR) that is transferred to females during copulation, is responsible for this reduction of siesta sleep. Here, we investigated further the role of SPR in sleep regulation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We show that SPR is required for sleep stabilization in both sexes and that in mutant flies lacking SPR or its ligand myoinhibitory peptide (MIP) sleep is fragmented independently of reproduction. Unlike SP, MIP is expressed in the brain of both sexes and acts on SPR to silence specific neurons that keep flies awake, stabilizing sleep. Hence, our results reveal that SPR interacts with two distinct ligands to control different behaviors: SP for reproduction and MIP for sleep.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sleep is an evolutionarily conserved physiological state marked by sustained and reversible quiescence during which animals display reduced responsiveness to external stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Campbell1">[1]</xref>. Sleep is important for diverse biological processes, such as immune responses, metabolism, obesity, longevity, and learning and memory, and reduction in the quality and quantity of sleep in humans, can give rise to sleep disorders and increased morbidity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Palma1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Siegel1">[3]</xref>. Despite its medical importance and wide occurrence across animal phylogeny, the evolutionary and functional origins of sleep remain poorly understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Mignot1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>Recently, the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has become an important invertebrate model for sleep research <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Sehgal1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Cirelli1">[6]</xref>. This genetically amenable organism has a simpler central nervous system (CNS) and shares defining characteristics of mammalian sleep, such as reduced sensory responsiveness, dual circadian and homeostatic regulation, and reduced brain activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Shaw1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Huber1">[10]</xref>. Genetic studies on <italic>Drosophila</italic> have identified many molecules and pathways important for sleep control, many of which have conserved roles in regulating mammalian sleep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Campbell1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Sehgal1">[5]</xref>. As in mammals, GABAergic signaling promotes sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic> mainly by suppressing activities of the arousal systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Mignot1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Parisky1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Chung1">[12]</xref>. Studies on a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor mutant revealed that sleep onset and sleep maintenance are genetically dissociable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Palma1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Siegel1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Agosto1">[13]</xref>. However, how sleep initiation and maintenance are differentially regulated is not known.</p>
<p>Sleep is governed mainly by two regulatory systems: circadian and homeostatic drive. The molecular model that explains circadian control of the wake-sleep cycle is well established (for a review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Sehgal1">[5]</xref>). In contrast, no coherent mechanism for sleep homeostasis is yet available. Sleep is also shaped by other competing or complementary behaviors, such as ones associated with learning, feeding, and reproduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Sehgal1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Cirelli1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Griffith1">[14]</xref>. Mating was shown to induce female <italic>Drosophila</italic> to sleep less, particularly during the daytime <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Isaac1">[15]</xref>. Sex peptide (SP), a male seminal protein transferred to the female during copulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Chen1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Peng1">[17]</xref>, was implicated in the post-mating reduction of siesta sleep, because females that copulated with males lacking <italic>SP</italic> did not lose sleep. Sex peptide receptor (SPR), a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) mediates many of the actions of SP on female reproductive behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Yapici1">[18]</xref>. On transfer to the female, SP activates SPR in a small number of uterine neurons and triggers post-mating behavioral responses (PMR), characterized by (but not restricted to) suppression of mating receptivity and initiation of egg laying <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Yang1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Hsemeyer1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>For the PMR induction, SPR is required only in a small number of female-specific internal sensory neurons. However, SPR expression in the CNS is broad, and shows little sexual difference, suggesting it has additional roles in both males and females <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Yapici1">[18]</xref>. Recently, the brain-gut myoinhibitory peptides (MIPs) (also known as allatostatin-B or prothoracicostatic peptides), have been shown to also activate SPR when expressed heterologously in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Kim1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Poels1">[23]</xref>. Unlike SP, however, MIP, which is expressed in the central interneurons with little sexual dimorphism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Kolodziejczyk1">[24]</xref>, is unable to induce the PMR in <italic>Drosophila</italic> females <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Kim1">[21]</xref>. Thus, the biological function of MIP-SPR signaling in <italic>Drosophila</italic> remains elusive.</p>
<p>Here, we demonstrate that mutants lacking either SPR or its ligand, MIP, slept less regardless of sex and mating status, primarily because of difficulty in maintaining sleep. By combining genetic analyses and optical activity imaging, we found that SPR mediates MIP actions to modulate neural activities of a fly arousal system involving <italic>pigment dispersing factor</italic> (<italic>pdf</italic>) neurons. The brain MIP neurons release MIP before and during night-time sleep. Sleep deprivation facilitates MIP secretion from a small subset of brain neurons, axonal processes of which innervate dendritic fields of <italic>pdf</italic> neurons. Mutants lacking either SPR or MIP failed to show normal sleep homeostasis. We conclude that the MIP-SPR signaling pathway functions as a sleep homeostat that senses the need for sleep and stabilizes sleep by providing a slow-acting inhibitory input to an arousal center.</p>

<title><italic>SPR</italic> Is Important for Sleep Maintenance</title>
<p>To determine whether SPR was necessary for the SP-induced daytime sleep loss, we examined the sleep profile of the <italic>SPR</italic>-deficient mutants (<italic>SPR<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) that carry a micro-deletion of the genomic region containing <italic>SPR</italic> and a few neighboring genes. The <italic>SPR<sup>−/−</sup></italic> females fail to switch reproductive behaviors upon mating or SP injection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Yapici1">[18]</xref>. To control for possible genetic background differences, we compared wild-type <italic>Canton-S</italic> (<italic>CS</italic>) flies with <italic>SPR</italic>-deficient mutants backcrossed with <italic>CS</italic> for six generations. We examined the sleep profiles of virgin females, mated females and males separately. Strikingly, the <italic>SPR</italic>-deficient mutants slept less than the isogenic wild-type counterparts regardless of sex and mating status (virgin versus mated) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001974-g001">Figure 1A–1K</xref>). However, virgin and mated females demonstrated almost equal levels of daily sleep in any given genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001974-g001">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001974.s001">S1</xref>). In <italic>CS</italic> females, the mating effects on siesta sleep are temporary and do not last more than three days after mating (RE Isaac, unpublished data). Because we examined the sleep profile of females at least 5 days after mating, this observation may explain the absence of a mating effect on sleep in our experiments. Nevertheless, lack of SPR expression suppressed both day- and night-time sleep duration by approximately 48% and 77%, respectively, compared to <italic>CS</italic> virgin females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001974-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). This observation contrasts with the daytime sleep loss reported previously for mated females, suggesting that SPR has a role in sleep regulation independent of mating status.</p>

<p>In terms of waking activity, however, <italic>SPR</italic>-deficient mutants did not differ from <italic>CS</italic>, indicating that the sleep loss observed in mutants is not attributable to nonspecific hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001974-g001">Figure 1C and 1H</xref>). We also measured the number of sleep bouts and the average length of each sleep bout, which indicates sleep initiation and sleep maintenance abilities, respectively. The <italic>SPR</italic>-deficient mutant had almost the same number of sleep bouts, but markedly shorter average sleep-bout length compared to wild-type flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001974-g001">Figure 1D, 1E, 1I, and 1J</xref>). Since environmental light was shown to affect sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Shang1">[25]</xref>, we examined the baseline sleep of the SPR deficient mutant in light-dark (LD) and dark-dark (DD) environments. In both conditions, the SPR mutant displayed significant reductions in daytime and night-time sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001974-g001">Figures 1F, 1K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001974.s002">S2A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001974.s002">S2B</xref>).</p>
<p>To test whether SPR expression in the nervous system is sufficient for normal sleep behavior, we introduced <italic>elav-Gal4</italic> and upstream activation sequence (<italic>UAS</italic>)-<italic>Drosophila SPR</italic> (<italic>DrmSPR</italic>) into the <italic>SPR</italic>-deficient mutant lines. In these flies, we observed complete rescue of the sleep phenotype in both sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001974-g001">Figure 1L and 1M</xref>). Subsequently, we tested whether the sleep phenotype was rescued by expressing SPR in <italic>pickpocket</italic> (<italic>ppk</italic>) neurons, in which SPR expression is essential for the SP-induced PMR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Yang1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Hsemeyer1">[20]</xref>. Unlike PMR, sleep was not restored by SPR expression in <italic>ppk</italic> neurons, indicating that the sleep-regulating SPR circuit can be separated from the PMR-regulating SPR circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001974-g001">Figure 1L</xref>). On the basis of these results, we conclude that SPR is essential for baseline sleep maintenance in both males and females.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Identification of the Sleep-Regulating SPR Circuit</title>
<p>To map the SPR neurons responsible for sleep regulation, we suppressed SPR expression in the major sleep circuits using <italic>SPR-RNAi</italic>. First, we confirmed <italic>SPR-RNAi</italic> efficacy on the sleep phenotype by examining pan-neural <italic>SPR-RNAi (elav-Gal4/UAS-SPR-IR1)</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001974.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Like <italic>SPR</italic>-deficient mutants, pan-neural <italic>SPR-RNAi</italic> flies slept considerably less than controls, regardless of sex and mating status, and their total sleep loss was attributable mainly to reduced sleep-bout duration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001974.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Next, we ran the <italic>SPR-RNAi</italic> screen with 15 <italic>Gal4</italic> drivers, targeting either the sex-behavior circuit or known sleep-control circuits, including ellipsoid body, mushroom body, fan-shaped body, monoaminergic, and circadian clock neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001974-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Knockdown of SPR expression in <italic>fruitless<sup>Gal4</sup></italic> neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Stockinger1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Manoli1">[27]</xref> did not produce the sleep phenotype, but it did result in defects in the female PMR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Yapici1">[18]</xref>. Again, this result dissociates the SPR circuit regulating sleep from the circuit regulating sexual behavior.</p>

<p>In this screen, we identified three circadian clock-specific <italic>Gal4</italic> neural populations in which SPR expression is required for wild-type levels of sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001974-g002">Figure 2A</xref>): <italic>cry-Gal4</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Zhao1">[28]</xref>, <italic>C929-Gal4</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Hewes1">[29]</xref>, and <italic>pdf-Gal4</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Renn1">[30]</xref>. SPR knockdown resulted in significant sleep loss with all three <italic>Gal4</italic> lines. To test whether SPR expression in these <italic>Gal4</italic> neurons was sufficient for wild-type sleep levels, we combined each of these <italic>Gal4</italic> drivers with <italic>UAS-DrmSPR</italic> in <italic>SPR</italic>-deficient mutants.

<title>SPR Is Expressed in Both Large and Small Lateral Ventral Neurons</title>
<p>Among three <italic>Gal4</italic> neuron populations in which SPR expression was essential for sleep function, <italic>pdf-Gal4</italic> had the most restricted expression pattern. Thus, we investigated whether <italic>pdf</italic> neurons express SPR by staining brains in which <italic>pdf</italic> neurons produce enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) with anti-SPR antibody. The <italic>pdf-Gal4</italic> neurons are largely divided into two groups: the large and small lateral ventral neurons (l-LNvs and s-LNvs). We detected anti-SPR staining in both groups of <italic>pdf</italic> neurons, as well as many other CNS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001974-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). As expected, <italic>pdf</italic> neurons in brains of SPR-deficient mutants did not stain with the SPR antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001974-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>Previously, Rosbash and colleagues used microarray technology to identify 1,000 to 2,000 mRNAs enriched in either l-LNvs or s-LNvs as compared to the population of neurons labeled by the pan-neuronal driver <italic>elav-Gal4</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-KulaEversole1">[31]</xref>. We were able to verify from their results that SPR is significantly enriched in l-LNvs, but not in s-LNvs. It should be noted that lack of enrichment does not mean absence of expression.</p>
<p>Recently, it was reported that s-LNvs release the inhibitory short neuropeptide F (sNPF), which stabilizes night-time sleep by acting on l-LNvs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Shang2">[32]</xref>. Since this result implicated differential roles of l-LNvs and s-LNvs in sleep regulation, we examined day- and night-time sleep separately in <italic>SPR-RNAi</italic> targeting either <italic>pdf-Gal4</italic> neurons, including both l-LNvs and s-LNvs, or <italic>C929-Gal4</italic>, including l-LNvs and other peptidergic secretory neurons, but not s-LNvs. Knockdown of SPR expression in l-LNvs with <italic>C929-Gal4</italic> reduced night-time sleep, but not daytime sleep (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001974.s005">Figure S5A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001974.s005">S5C</xref>), and sleep-bout duration was only reduced during night-time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001974.s005">Figure S5D and S5E</xref>).

<title>MIP Downregulates cAMP in <italic>pdf</italic> Neurons Via SPR</title>
<p>Having shown that both SPR, and its ligand MIP, are essential for sleep maintenance and that wake-promoting <italic>pdf</italic> neurons are key <italic>SPR</italic> neurons, we next investigated whether MIP modulates the activity of <italic>pdf</italic> neurons through SPR. In the isolated brain, <italic>pdf</italic> neurons respond to bath-applied peptides, such as PDF and diuretic hormone 31, by upregulating intracellular cAMP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Shafer1">[35]</xref>.

Therefore, we monitored MIP-induced cAMP dynamics in <italic>pdf</italic> neurons using Epac1-camps, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based cAMP sensor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Shafer1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Nikolaev1">[36]</xref>.

<p>Using <italic>pdf-Gal4/UAS-Epac1-camps</italic> females, we asked if the l-LNvs are responsive to synthetic MIP peptide. Bath perfusions of MIP at 10–100 µM resulted in significant reductions in inverse Epac1-camps FRET (henceforth, reduction of cAMP) in l-LNvs, compared to vehicle control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001974-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>). Perfusions of MIP at 1 and 3 µM concentrations yielded inhibitory trends, but a comparison of maximal loss of inverse FRET did not reveal a statistically significant difference from vehicle controls. We also examined s-LNvs in the explanted brain. Like l-LNvs, s-LNvs also displayed inhibitory trends in response to MIP at concentrations higher than 10 µM; however, these were of lower magnitude and more variable compared to the responses of the l-LNvs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001974.s010">Figure S10</xref>).</p>

A Dunn's multiple comparison test revealed significant differences (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) between vehicle controls and the 10, 50, and 100 µM MIP treatments. The sample sizes for (A) and (B) were as follows: for vehicle, 24 neurons from 14 brains (24, 14), 1 µM MIP (14, 8), 3 µM MIP (16, 3) 10 µM MIP (20, 11), 50 µM MIP (20, 10), and 100 µM MIP (12, 9).

<p>Next, we asked whether MIP action on the l-LNvs occurs through SPR by examining MIP-induced cAMP dynamics in the l-LNvs of <italic>SPR</italic>-deficient mutants (<italic>SPR<sup>−/−</sup></italic>; <italic>pdf-Gal4/UAS-Epac1-camps</italic>). Unlike wild-type neurons, mutant neurons did not display obvious reduction in cAMP in response to 50 µM MIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001974-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). When SPR expression was rescued in SPR<sup>−/−</sup> mutant l-LNvs, these neurons now responded to 50 µM MIP with a reduction in the cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001974-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). These results support the hypothesis that MIP acts directly to reduce cAMP levels in <italic>pdf</italic> neurons through SPR.</p>
<p>In our <italic>ex vivo</italic> cAMP monitoring experiments, the minimum MIP concentration required to elicit statistically significant maximum Epac1-camps inverse FRET changes in l-LNvs neurons was ∼10 µM. This is substantially higher than the MIP concentration required for SPR expressed in cultured cells to start responding, which is around 1 nM. Because we did not remove neurolemma, a blood-brain barrier that separates bathing saline and the brain neurons, it was expected that much higher doses of peptides would be necessary to elicit a response detectable with live brain imaging. Similarly, <italic>pdf</italic> neurons expressing PDF receptor (PDFR) start to respond to micromolar concentrations of bath-applied PDF in the explanted brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Shafer1">[35]</xref>, whereas PDFR in cultured cells can respond to PDF at a concentration as low as 0.1 nM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Hyun1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Mertens1">[38]</xref>. Furthermore, low doses of cAMP function mainly via the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), whereas higher cAMP concentrations exert additional effects through Epac <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Zwartkruis1">[39]</xref>. Indeed, in some case the Epac1-camps sensor failed to report low levels of cAMP, which a PKA-based cAMP sensor could reliably detect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Ponsioen1">[40]</xref>. Thus, it is also possible that low concentrations of MIP modulate <italic>pdf</italic> neurons by reducing PKA activity without causing measurable FRET changes in the Epac1-camps cAMP sensor.</p>

<title>Major MIP Secretion Occurs prior to and during Night-time Sleep</title>
<p>Our results show that MIP is a sleep-promoting factor, which presumably reduces the excitability of wake-promoting <italic>pdf</italic> neurons by decreasing their intracellular cAMP levels. As a sleep regulator, MIP would be released prior to or during sleep. Thus, we used an anti-MIP antibody to measure MIP levels during normal sleep-wake cycles. Remarkably, the intensity of anti-MIP activity in the brain oscillates throughout the cycle. The oscillation is synchronized in most brain MIP neurons and processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001974-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>). The brain anti-MIP level increases early in the morning (zeitgeber time [ZT] 0) and stays elevated during daytime (ZT 0–8). Then, it drops markedly at ZT 12, prior to onset of the night-time sleep phase, and remains low during the night. The strongest reduction was detected at ZT 20 h, when the sleep stabilizing drive is most required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001974-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).

<p>Next, we examined MIP mRNA levels in the brain using <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. Unlike anti-MIP activities, the MIP transcript level does not oscillate and remains stable during the wake-sleep cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001974-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). This result was also confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR experiments, which showed that MIP mRNA in the head remains constant throughout the day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001974-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). In contrast, the transcript levels of a central clock gene <italic>period</italic> changed during the cycle, and revealed the peak level at ZT 8 and 12. Because neuropeptides are packaged in large dense-core vesicles and transported to distal axon terminals slowly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Wong1">[43]</xref>, it takes at least several hours to replenish the peptide vesicle pools after depletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-vandenPol1">[44]</xref>. Thus, the strong reduction of anti-MIP staining without measurable changes in transcript levels reflects massive secretory activity of the brain MIP neurons. To verify that the loss of anti-MIP staining is a consequence of prolonged neural activation, we used the <italic>Drosophila</italic> transient receptor potential A1 (dTrpA1), a warmth-activated cation channel, to confirm that thermal activation of MIP neurons depletes anti-MIP staining, almost completely (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001974.s012">Figure S12</xref>). All together, these results strongly suggest that MIP neurons in the brain become active between ZT 8 and ZT 20, and secrete their peptidergic contents constitutively and synchronously, during which time the sleep drive is greater than any other time of the day.</p>

<title>Sleep Deprivation Depletes MIP in Medulla</title>
<p>The marked reduction of the brain anti-MIP levels during sleep cycle is consistent with the release of MIP to promote sleep <italic>in vivo</italic>. To further explore this hypothesis, we asked whether sleep deprivation changes MIP levels in the brain. Since MIP works as a sleep-promoting factor and its level decreases during the sleep state, sleep deprivation should drive flies to release MIP continuously, and in consequence result in considerable loss of anti-MIP staining. Indeed, 12 h-long mechanical sleep deprivation significantly reduced anti-MIP labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001974-g006">Figure 6A–6C</xref>).

<title>MIP and SPR Are Required for Sleep Homeostasis</title>

The lack of phenotype in the 6 h rebound could be due to insufficient knockdown of MIP expression in this particular genotype.

<p>Marked reduction of anti-MIP labeling in the medulla of sleep-deprived flies suggests that <italic>LMIo</italic> neurons are linked to sleep regulation.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we report the discovery of a peptidergic modulatory pathway particularly important in stabilizing sleep and maintaining sleep homeostasis in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The key molecules in this novel sleep-regulating pathway are SPR and its peptide ligand MIP. SPR was first identified as a receptor that triggers PMR by mediating actions of the seminal protein SP in females <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Yapici1">[18]</xref>. Although previous biochemical studies demonstrated that SPR could interact with MIP as well as SP, there was no evidence that the interaction between MIP and SPR is biologically relevant in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Kim1">[21]</xref>. By combining genetic analyses and optical activity imaging, we provide several independent lines of evidence demonstrating that MIP consolidates sleep state and maintain sleep homeostasis by acting through SPR expressed in arousal-promoting <italic>pdf</italic> neurons.</p>
<p>First, flies lacking either SPR or MIP have a highly similar sleep phenotype. Second, sleep phenotypes of MIP or SPR mutant are manifested regardless of sex, consistent with previous accounts that unlike SP, MIP and SPR expression in the brain show little sexual difference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Yapici1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Kolodziejczyk2">[33]</xref>. Third, <italic>ex vivo</italic> optical activity imaging revealed that exogenous application of MIP downregulates cAMP levels in SPR-expressing <italic>pdf</italic> neurons, but not in SPR-deficient mutant neurons. Fourth, the sleep phenotypes of SPR-deficient mutants are rescued by restoring SPR expression with insect SPRs that are highly sensitive to MIP, but less sensitive to SP. Hence, SPR interacts with two evolutionarily unrelated sets of ligands, each of which controls completely different behaviors: SP for reproductive behaviors and MIP for sleep behavior. For sleep behaviors, all phenotypes observed in the SPR deficient mutant were also observed in <italic>MIP-RNAi</italic>. Thus, there is no reason to assume additional ligand(s) for SPR besides SP and MIP at this moment. Nevertheless, our finding that a peptide GPCR can mediate actions of multiple, unrelated groups of ligands should be taken into consideration in searching for peptides and/or other types of ligands for GPCRs.</p>
<p>Our genetic analyses demonstrated that the expression of SPR in three <italic>Gal4</italic> neural populations (<italic>cry-Gal4</italic>, <italic>C929-Gal4</italic>, and <italic>pdf-Gal4</italic>) is required and sufficient for wild-type levels of sleep maintenance. Furthermore, anti-SPR staining confirmed the SPR expression in two major subsets of <italic>pdf</italic> neurons, l-LNvs and s-LNvs. In particular, l-LNvs are common to all three <italic>Gal4</italic> populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Zhao1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Renn1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Shang3">[49]</xref>. Thus, the most parsimonious explanation of our results is that SPR in l-LNvs mediates a sleep-related MIP function. This rationale is also supported by previous reports. Firstly, l-LNvs respond to light and other modulatory cues and promote arousal by releasing PDF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Shang1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Shang3">[49]</xref>, a major wake-promoting factor functionally analogous to vertebrate orexin/hypocretin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Sehgal1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Parisky1">[11]</xref>. Secondly, excitation of l-LNvs suppresses night-time sleep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Parisky1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Sheeba1">[50]</xref>. Third, l-LNvs are major targets of inhibitory GABA-GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling, which promotes sleep both in flies and mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Parisky1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Chung1">[12]</xref>. Fourth, blocking sNPF-mediated inhibitory input to l-LNvs impairs sleep stability particularly in night-time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Shang2">[32]</xref>. Finally, MIP signaling through SPR can down-regulate cAMP levels in l-LNvs. Together, these and our genetic data provide cogent support for a role for MIP signaling in stabilizing the sleep state by modulating l-LNvs activities through the SPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001974-g009">Figure 9</xref>).</p>
<fig id="pbio-1001974-g009" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1001974.g009</object-id><label>Figure 9</label><caption>
<title>A model depicting an operating principle of three major metabotropic pathways that regulate sleep.</title>
<p>During the day, light and modulatory inputs from other brain areas activate l-LNvs to secrete PDF, a major arousal-promoting factor. PDF from l-LNvs in turn activates the motor control center directly or indirectly through s-LNvs, and keeps flies awake. During the day, the sleep pressure gradually builds up and stimulates <italic>MIP-LMIo</italic> neurons to secrete MIP, which attenuates PDF release by modulating s-LNvs and allows the daytime sleep to ensue. Released MIP is expected to act on l-LNvs as well, but its effects are probably cancelled by direct excitatory inputs from light, octopamine, and dopamine. At the beginning of the night, waning excitatory inputs and elevating GABAergic input to l-LNvs (mainly through ionotropic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor) drive flies fall asleep (not shown in the model). Thereafter, three metabotropic pathways (sNPF, MIP, and GABA) stabilize and maintain sleep state during the night by supplying inhibitory modulations to l-LNvs, and keeping them from releasing PDF. <italic>MIP-LMIos</italic> function as a sleep-pressure sensor and adjust their secretory activities accordingly. As the night approaches the end, sleep pressure declines and metabotropic GABA input is needed.</p>
</caption><graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001974.g009" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>Another group of <italic>pdf</italic> neurons, s-LNvs are critical in timing the onset of morning behavior and are the key pacemaker cells controlling the circadian locomotor rhythm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Grima1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Stoleru1">[42]</xref>. Although the precise role of s-LNvs in sleep regulation remains less clear, previous reports implicated that s-LNvs regulate sleep mainly by relaying information from l-LNvs. In response to light and modulatory substances, such as dopamine and octopamine, l-LNvs secrete PDF, which in turn elevates cAMP levels in s-LNvs by activating the PDFR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Shang3">[49]</xref>. Consistent with the role of s-LNvs in sleep regulation, knockdown of PDFR in <italic>pdf</italic> neurons (presumably affecting the s-LNvs and not the l-LNvs) elevates total sleep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Parisky1">[11]</xref>. Recently, it was shown that s-LNvs produce sNPF, which modulates l-LNvs and stabilizes sleep, particularly in night-time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Shang2">[32]</xref>. Here, we also report that SPR expression in s-LNvs is important for maintaining daily sleep architecture. Knockdown of SPR in s-LNvs reduced daytime sleep and its average bout duration, whereas knockdown of SPR in l-LNvs reduced night-time sleep and its average bout duration. Together with previous results, our observations suggest that s-LNvs are involved in sleep regulation, and that MIP-SPR signaling stabilizes sleep by modulating the activity of s-LNvs directly and indirectly through l-LNvs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001974-g009">Figure 9</xref>).</p>
<p>Our genetic and cAMP imaging results indicate that MIP regulates sleep as a ligand for SPR. Thus, it is also important to know whether MIP is secreted at biologically relevant times. The monitoring of levels of MIP peptide and mRNA at various time points in a day suggested that almost all brain MIP neurons release their contents synchronously from dusk to dawn, when the majority of flies fall and stay asleep. The rhythmic secretory activity of MIP neurons is likely to be under the control of the circadian clock rather than environmental light, because initiation and termination of the MIP secretion occurs prior to the light-off (ZT 12) and the light-on time (ZT 24), respectively. Since MIP neurons are not part of the circadian clock network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Kolodziejczyk2">[33]</xref>, it would be interesting to see in the future to elucidate how they interact with the neuronal circadian clock network.</p>
<p>Our results indicate that MIP release in most brain neurons appears synchronized, and MIP neurons in the brain arborize in many areas of the brain, including the olfactory glomeruli, the SOG, the lateral ventral protocerebrum, mushroom body, and so on (for further evidence, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Kolodziejczyk1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Kolodziejczyk2">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Jiang1">[45]</xref>). Considering SPR is expressed broadly in large numbers of the brain neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Yapici1">[18]</xref>, massively secreted MIP in these sites probably modulates not only neurons important for locomotor activities and but also many others involved in diverse biological processes, such as olfactory, feeding, sexual activity, learning, and memory.</p>
<p>Like in the human situation, sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is also affected by other behavioral aspects, such as stress, social interactions, learning, diet, feeding, and reproduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Griffith1">[14]</xref>. In females, mating suppresses daytime sleep, and male-derived SP is responsible for this sleep modulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Isaac1">[15]</xref>. On the other hand, SP also plays key roles in eliciting the PMR, such as reduced receptivity to further mating and increased egg-laying <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Yapici1">[18]</xref>. In this study, we clearly demonstrated that the sleep-relevant SPR circuits (l-LNvs and s-LNvs) are distinct from the PMR-relevant SPR circuit (<italic>ppk<sup>+</sup> fru<sup>+</sup></italic> neurons). Intriguingly, however, SP circulates in the haemolymph of mated females <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Lung1">[51]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Pilpel1">[52]</xref>, raising the possibility that the haemolymph-born SP activates SPR in the sleep circuit and modulates sleep. This is certainly a plausible scenario, considering that SP is a potent agonist for the SPR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Yapici1">[18]</xref>, and bath-applied SPR agonist (in this case, MIP) can affect cAMP levels in s-LNvs. In theory, however, the SPR activation in the sleep circuit either by haemolymph-born SP or centrally released MIP should promote sleep, rather than suppress it. Thus, we suspect that the daytime sleep loss observed in the mated female is not due to direct modulation of the SPR-sleep circuit by SP. Rather, SP actions on the PMR circuit elevate reproductive drives in mated females, which in consequence makes them spend more time during the day searching for food and egg-laying sites, and less time in falling asleep. Nevertheless, we cannot formally exclude the possibility that SP modulates female sleep. In theory, SP circulating in haemolymph of the mated female can promote sleep drive and counter wakefulness driven by reproductive motivations. Thus, we speculate that SPR may serve as a molecular integrator that computes reproductive-state coding signal (SP) and sleep-pressure coding signal (MIP) and therefore contribute to shaping daily sleep architecture.</p>
<p>Multiple lines of evidence indicate that MIP-SPR signaling is a part of the homeostatic control system. First, mutants lacking either MIP or SPR show significant reduction in total amount of sleep, which is an indicator of homeostatic regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Sehgal1">[5]</xref>. Second, sleep deprivation drives <italic>MIP-LMIo</italic>, a subset of brain MIP neurons to release MIP into the optic lobe medulla where <italic>pdf</italic> neurons innervate. We propose that <italic>MIP-LMIo</italic> senses sleep pressure and modulates MIP secretion to maintain optimum sleep duration. Lastly and most importantly, mutants lacking either MIP or SPR show no sleep rebound after sleep deprivation. Together, these observations suggest that the activity of MIP neurons is controlled by two separable pathways; one associated with the circadian clock network (see above), and the other associated with a sleep homeostat.</p>
<p>It has been proposed in mammals that activity-dependent metabolites, such as adenosine, GABA, prostaglandins, and cytokines, are involved in sleep homeostasis, particularly the sleep initiation phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Datta1">[53]</xref>. The role of GABA signaling in sleep is conserved both in mammals and flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Sehgal1">[5]</xref>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, GABA regulates both sleep initiation and maintenance because silencing GABAergic neurons results in a significant decrease of sleep latency from lights-off as well as mean sleep-bout duration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Parisky1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Agosto1">[13]</xref>. At the beginning of the night, GABA initiates sleep by inhibiting the activities of wake-promoting <italic>pdf</italic> neurons through the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, a ligand-gated Cl<sup>−</sup> channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Parisky1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Chung1">[12]</xref>. After animals fall asleep, at least three modulatory pathways stabilize the sleep state and sustain it throughout the night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001974-g009">Figure 9</xref>): sNPF-sNPF receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Shang2">[32]</xref>, GABA-GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor 2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Gmeiner1">[54]</xref>, and MIP-SPR (this study). All three pathways feed inhibitory modulation into l-LNvs, and in consequence keep these neurons from releasing PDF during the night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001974-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Unlike the other two pathways, MIP-SPR signaling is also important for stabilizing daytime sleep. Our model predicts that in the morning, shortly before light-on, s-LNvs release less sNPF than PDF. This probably is due to faster depletion of sNPF pool in s-LNvs during the night, as suggested by the fact that sNPF mRNA levels in s-LNvs are 30-fold higher in the morning (ZT 0) than in the evening (ZT 12) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-KulaEversole1">[31]</xref>. Then, subsequent to light-on l-LNvs are stimulated to release PDF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Sheeba2">[55]</xref>, which in turn modulates the motor control centers either directly or indirectly through s-LNvs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Parisky1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Sheeba1">[50]</xref>, and in consequence promotes wakefulness. Later, as sleep pressure builds up during the day, <italic>MIP-LMIos</italic> sense the sleep pressure and release MIP, allowing sleep to ensue in the middle of the day. MIP is expected to act via volume transmission, meaning that once released, it can access both l-LNvs as well as s-LNvs. In daytime, however the inhibitory actions of MIP on l-LNvs are fully countered by excitatory inputs from environmental light via dopamine and octopamine signaling, partly because MIP secretion is weaker at this time of day than at night-time. For siesta sleep, therefore SPR activation in s-LNvs is more important than that in l-LNvs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001974-g009">Figure 9</xref>).</p>
<p>Several lines of evidence indicate that MIP, not SP, is the ancestral ligand of SPR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Kim1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Poels1">[23]</xref>. MIP can activate SPRs from diverse species including the sea slug <italic>Aplysia</italic>, whereas SP can only activate SPRs from <italic>Drosophila</italic> species at physiological levels. MIPs are also more potent than SP as SPR agonists. Furthermore, orthologs of <italic>SPR</italic> and <italic>MIP</italic> are clearly detectable in most (but not all) sequenced genomes from Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa. By contrast, <italic>SP</italic> has been found only in the genomes of a few closely related <italic>Drosophila</italic> species, indicative of their recent origin. Together, these observations suggest that the SPR-MIP signaling axis is evolutionarily ancestral, whereas the SPR-SP signaling axis arose only recently in <italic>Drosophila</italic> evolution, concomitantly with the emergence of SP. Our discovery that sleep regulation is a possible ancestral SPR function is a critical step forward in understanding how the SPR evolved functional multiplicity by recruiting a newly emerging ligand.</p>

Flies for imaging experiments were reared at 25°C under a 12∶12 light-dark cycle. Living brains expressing the cAMP sensor Epac1-camps in neurons of interest were dissected from 3- to 5-day-old flies into room temperature hemolymph-like saline (HL3) consisting of (in mM): 70 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 5 trehalose, 115 sucrose, 5 HEPES; pH 7.1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Stewart1">[66]</xref> and stuck to the bottom of 35×10 mm Falcon Petri Dishes containing a petri dish perfusion insert containing 360 µl HL3 (Bioscience Tools). Dissections were always performed between 6 and 11 hours after lights-on. Brains were allowed to settle and adhere to the bottom of the dish for 10 minutes before imaging. Epac1-camps imaging of relative cAMP levels was conducted as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Lelito1">[67]</xref>. Briefly, frames containing LNv cell bodies were scanned as single optical sections once every five seconds. After 30 s of initial scanning, 40 µl of MIP peptide (at 10× the target concentration in 1% DMSO) was gently added into the perfusion insert by hand with a micropipette to yield the target MIP concentration and 0.1% DMSO. cAMP responses of neurons of interest were monitored for a total of 5 min with an Olympus Fluoview 1000 confocal microscope equipped with the Fluoview software (Olympus). Post-imaging analysis of Epac1-camps responses was done as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Yao1">[68]</xref>. HPLC-purified synthetic MIP4 (EPTWNNLKGMW-amide) was obtained from AnyGen.</p>

<title>Sleep Deprivation and Sleep Rebound</title>
<p>For sleep deprivation, 3-day-old flies were individually loaded into 65-mm×5-mm glass tubes containing food, and entrained to a 12 h LD cycle. After 3 days of entrainment, flies were subjected to the sleep deprivation protocol described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Koh1">[69]</xref> previously during the dark cycle (ZT 12–24) at day 4. For the behavioral sleep homeostasis assay, flies were subjected to the SNAP-based sleep deprivation described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Shaw2">[70]</xref> and allowed to recover the sleep loss in the following morning (day 7) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Pfeiffenberger1">[71]</xref>.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry and In Situ Hybridization</title>
<p>For SPR staining, the brains were dissected under ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4) and fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C. Note that it was crucial to fix the tissue for more than 24 h for the successful anti-SPR staining <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Yapici1">[18]</xref>. After washing and blocking, the brain tissues were incubated in an anti-SPR antibody (1∶500) for 48 h at 4°C and then with an HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1∶100; Invitrogen catalogue number T20924) for 1 h at RT. Then, the brain was stained with Tyramide signal amplification kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction, and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Labs).</p>
<p>For MIP and DenMark labelling, brains were processed similarly, but fixed for 30 min at RT. Mouse monoclonal anti-MIP antibody 1A4 (1∶1,000) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Kim2">[72]</xref> and an Alexa-488 goat anti-mouse (1∶1,000; Invitrogen catalogue number A11001) were used as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. To visualize DenMark, an anti-RFP antibody (1∶2,000; Invitrogen catalogue number R10367) and an Alexa-568 goat anti-rabbit antibody (1∶2,000; Invitrogen catalogue number A11011) were used. Images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM700/Axioscope laser scanning microscope and processed using ImageJ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Schneider1">[73]</xref>. For quantification of anti-MIP labeling, labeling intensity was measured as the corrected total fluorescence (CTF), calculated by subtracting the integrated fluorescence of an area of interest with its background fluorescence. Because MIP-immunoreactivity in the subesophageal ganglion (SOG) area were not different between treatments, CTF of each brain area were normalized by dividing CTF of the SOG.</p>
<p>In situ hybridization was performed as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001974-Kim2">[72]</xref>. Dissected brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for overnight at 4°C, stored in 70% ethanol, washed with PBS with Tween-20, treated with proteinase K and glycine, and hybridized with a digoxygenin (DIG)-labeled single-stranded DNA probe for overnight at 48°C. Blocked with 1% BSA, the brains were incubated with anti-DIG antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Roche) for overnight at 4°C, and stained with NBT-BCIP (Roche). Primers used to generate MIP probe was a forward primer (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-CTGATGGTGCTCCTCATCCT-3′</named-content>) and a reverse primer (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-CTGTGCTACGGCGATTCTCT-3′</named-content>). Images were taken in a bright field microscope (Olympus BX53).</p>
