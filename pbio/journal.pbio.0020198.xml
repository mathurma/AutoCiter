				<article-title>Regulating the Regulators: Immune System Regulators Are Highly Susceptible to HIV Infection</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>A T-cell subset, defined as CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup> (regulatory T-cells [Treg cells]), was recently shown to suppress T-cell activation. We demonstrate that human Treg cells isolated from healthy donors express the HIV-coreceptor CCR5 and are highly susceptible to HIV infection and replication. Because Treg cells are present in very few numbers and are difficult to expand in vitro, we genetically modified conventional human T-cells to generate Treg cells in vitro by ectopic expression of FoxP3, a transcription factor associated with reprogramming T-cells into a Treg subset. Overexpression of FoxP3 in naïve human CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells recapitulated the hyporesponsiveness and suppressive function of naturally occurring Treg cells. However, FoxP3 was less efficient in reprogramming memory T-cell subset into regulatory cells. In addition, FoxP3-transduced T-cells also became more susceptible to HIV infection. Remarkably, a portion of HIV-positive individuals with a low percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup> and higher levels of activated T-cells have greatly reduced levels of FoxP3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup> T-cells, suggesting disruption of the Treg cells during HIV infection. Targeting and disruption of the T-cell regulatory system by HIV may contribute to hyperactivation of conventional T-cells, a characteristic of HIV disease progression. Moreover, the ability to reprogram human T-cells into Treg cells in vitro will greatly aid in decoding their mechanism of suppression, their enhanced susceptibility to HIV infection, and the unique markers expressed by this subset.</p>

These findings strongly suggest that Treg cells play a key role in immune regulation.</p>
      <p>Human and murine Treg cells are functionally characterized by a decrease in both proliferation and IL-2 secretion in response to T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation and by their ability to suppress activation of conventional T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Asano1">Asano et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Takahashi1">Takahashi et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Thornton1">Thornton and Shevach 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Baecher-Allan1">Baecher-Allan et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Dieckmann1">Dieckmann et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Jonuleit1">Jonuleit et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Levings1">Levings et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Ng1">Ng et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Taams1">Taams et al. 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Taams2">2002</xref>). Treg cells mediate their suppressive effects only when stimulated via their TCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Takahashi1">Takahashi et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Thornton1">Thornton and Shevach 1998</xref>), although their suppressive effector function is antigen nonspecific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Thornton2">Thornton and Shevach 2000</xref>). Treg cells are clearly enriched within peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells that also express the α subunit of the IL-2 receptor (CD25), which is currently the best marker for identifying these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Shevach2">Shevach 2002</xref>). However, CD25 is also expressed on activated effector T-cells, and not all CD4<sup>+</sup> Treg cells express CD25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Annacker2">Annacker et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Stephens1">Stephens et al. 2001</xref>). In adults, Treg cells are exclusively found in the CD45RO<sup>+</sup> memory subset, and a sizable portion of these cells express the activation marker HLA-DR and the recently identified molecule glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor (GITR, also known as TNFRSF18) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Gumperz1">Gumperz et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Lee1">Lee et al. 2002</xref>). Upon activation, Treg cells express the inhibitory receptor CTLA-4 at a higher level and for a longer period of time than conventional T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Read1">Read et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Salomon1">Salomon et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Takahashi2">Takahashi et al. 2000</xref>). Interestingly, Treg cells have also been shown to express high levels of certain chemokine receptors such as CCR4 and CCR8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Iellem1">Iellem et al. 2001</xref>).</p>
      <p>The forkhead transcription factor FOXP3 was recently shown to be specifically expressed in mouse Treg cells and is required for their development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-OaGarra1">O'Garra and Vieira 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Ramsdell1">Ramsdell 2003</xref>). A mutation in the <italic>FOXP3</italic> gene carried by the <italic>scurfy</italic> mouse strain or a knockout of this gene causes a CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell-mediated lymphoproliferative disease characterized by cachexia and multiorgan lymphocytic infiltrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Lyon1">Lyon et al. 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Brunkow1">Brunkow et al. 2001</xref>). The human genetic disease immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked syndrome (also called X-linked autoimmunity-allergic disregulation syndrome) is caused by mutations in the human homolog of <italic>FoxP3</italic> and is characterized by hyperactivation of T-cells with autoimmune endocrinopathy, early-onset type 1 diabetes and thyroiditis, and in some cases manifestations of severe atopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Chatila1">Chatila et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Bennett1">Bennett and Ochs 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Bennett2">Bennett et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Wildin1">Wildin et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Gambineri1">Gambineri et al. 2003</xref>). In addition, expression of FOXP3 in conventional T-cells either in transgenic mice or by retroviral transduction is sufficient to confer a Treg cell phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Fontenot1">Fontenot et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Hori1">Hori et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Khattri1">Khattri et al. 2003</xref>). However, the role of FoxP3 in the development of human Treg cells has not been examined.</p>
      <p>The role of Treg cells in controlling T-cell activation during immune responses to pathogens such as chronic viral infections is currently a subject of great interest. Recently it was shown that Treg cells can regulate virus-specific or memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses, thus diminishing the magnitude of the immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Kursar1">Kursar et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Kursar2">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Murakami1">Murakami et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Suvas1">Suvas et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Aandahl1">Aandahl et al. 2004</xref>). Because Treg cells express CD4<bold>,</bold> they are also potential targets of HIV in vivo. HIV entry into target cells also requires cellular expression of the chemokine receptors CCR5 or CXCR4 in conjunction with CD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Boshoff1">Boshoff et al. 1997</xref>). However, the ability of HIV to establish a persistent infection is also critically dependent on activation signals that regulate HIV replication within target T-cells. Quiescent T-cells are resistant to infection unless TCR or cytokine activation signals are provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Unutmaz1">Unutmaz 2001</xref>). Indeed, chronic states of T-cell hyperactivation, viral persistence, and T-cell depletion are all hallmarks of HIV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Grossman1">Grossman et al. 2002</xref>). Consequently, this state of chronic immune activation combined with the direct destruction of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells by HIV leads to a profound immunodeficiency characterized by progressive deterioration of immune function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Fauci1">Fauci 1993</xref>). If Treg cells are lost because of HIV infection, this could potentially result in hyperactivation of conventional T-cells due to lack of immunoregulation. In contrast, if Treg cells are activated to expand during certain stages of the infection, this could have a suppressive effect on protective immune responses against the virus. Thus, in both scenarios dysregulation of Treg subset during HIV infection could have a profound impact on anti-HIV immune responses and pathogenesis of the infection.</p>
      <p>We tested the susceptibility of both naturally occurring and in vitro genetically reprogrammed Treg cells to HIV infection. We found that Treg cells isolated from healthy donors express CCR5 and are highly susceptible to HIV infection. Ectopic expression of FoxP3 in conventional human T-cells genetically reprogrammed them into a Treg phenotype and enhanced their susceptibility to HIV infection. Remarkably, we also found a profound defect of FoxP3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup> T-cells in HIV-infected patients with low CD4<sup>+</sup> and a high percentage of activated T-cells.</p>
      <p>Our findings have important implications in understanding the role of Treg cells and the chronic activated state of T-cells during HIV infection. Furthermore, reprogramming of T-cells in vitro into Treg cells establishes a novel system to understand the mechanism of T-cell suppression and enhanced susceptibility of this subset to HIV infection.</p>

        <title>Isolation and Characterization of Human Treg Cells</title>
        <p>To analyze susceptibility of Treg cells to HIV infection, we first developed a method to isolate these cells from peripheral blood. A sizable portion of human CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells (between 10%–20%) express CD25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020198-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). However, approximately 1%–2% of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells within the memory subset (CD45RO<sup>+</sup>) express high levels of CD25 (CD25<sup>hi</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020198-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Previous studies suggested that human Treg cells resided within the CD45RO<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup> subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Baecher-Allan1">Baecher-Allan et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Taams1">Taams et al. 2001</xref>). We first performed a phenotypic analysis of CD45RO<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup> (referred to as Treg), CD45RO<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>low/neg</sup> (memory T) and CD45RO<sup>−</sup>CD25<sup>neg</sup> (naïve T) cells.

        <title>Treg Cells Are Highly Susceptible to HIV Infection</title>
        <p>The ability to obtain a pure population of functional human Treg cells provides an excellent model to study their role in HIV pathogenesis. To determine whether Treg cells were susceptible to HIV infection, purified Treg cells were first activated through the TCR and were infected with either replication-competent HIV, which uses CCR5 as a coreceptor (R5.HIV), or replication-defective viruses pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G.HIV) that encode green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a marker of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Motsinger1">Motsinger et al. 2002</xref>). Treg and memory T-cells challenged with VSV-G.HIV resulted in an equivalent infection rate, while in some experiments R5.HIV resulted in about a 2-fold higher infection rate of the Treg cells as compared to the memory T-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020198-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). To determine the level of HIV replication in the Treg cells as compared to activated memory T-cells, both subsets were infected with R5.HIV for 2 d and washed to remove input virus. Supernatants were collected from the infected cultures daily and p24 levels were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). HIV replicated in Treg cells as efficiently as in memory T-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020198-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). To assess whether the virus produced by Treg cells was infectious, supernatants from infected cells were added to Hut78/CCR5 cells, which are highly susceptible to HIV infection, and the titer of infectious virus was determined by GFP expression. Treg cells produced levels of infectious virus similar to those of the memory T subset (data not shown). The viability of infected cultures was also determined at days 3 and 7 to determine if HIV infection killed Treg cells. Indeed, infection with replication-competent HIV was highly cytotoxic to both Treg and memory T-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020198-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). We conclude that Treg cells are highly susceptible to HIV infection and are killed by viral replication.</p>

        <title>Genetic Reprogramming of Conventional Human T-cells into Treg Cells by Ectopic Expression of FoxP3</title>
        <p>Treg cells constitute less than 1%–2% of total human T-cells (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Baecher-Allan1">Baecher-Allan et al. 2001</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020198-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Although we could purify several hundred thousand Treg cells from 300 ml of blood as described below, isolation of sufficient numbers of Treg cells is clearly an obstacle to studying their function and susceptibility to HIV infection. Recently, a transcription factor called FOXP3 was shown to program murine T-cells into a Treg subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Fontenot1">Fontenot et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Hori1">Hori et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Khattri1">Khattri et al. 2003</xref>). Therefore we hypothesized that ectopic expression of FoxP3 in naïve T-cells could facilitate the generation of large numbers of human Treg cells. Accordingly, we subcloned <italic>FoxP3</italic> cDNA into a HIV-derived vector (HDV) that encodes murine CD24 (mCD24) as a marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Sundrud1">Sundrud et al. 2003</xref>). CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells were purified from both neonatal cord blood (CB) and adult blood (AB), activated through the TCR and transduced with FoxP3-expressing HDV (HDV.FoxP3) or control HDV as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Sundrud1">Sundrud et al. 2003</xref>). Expression of <italic>FoxP3</italic> mRNA in transduced cells was confirmed by real-time PCR analysis and was found to be about 50- to 100-fold higher in FoxP3 transduced primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells as compared to control HDV-transduced cells (data not shown).</p>
        <p>FoxP3-transduced and control cells were expanded for 14 d in IL-2-containing medium. Cells were then stained for mCD24 and also for CD25, GITR, and CCR4 markers that are expressed at higher levels on naturally occurring Treg cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020198-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Naïve T-cells ectopically expressing FoxP3 displayed higher levels of CD25, GITR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020198-g005">Figure 5</xref>A), and CCR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020198-g005">Figure 5</xref>B) as compared to control transduced T-cells. FoxP3-transduced memory T-cells displayed much less upregulation of these markers (data not shown). However, while the majority of these transduced T-cells also expressed CCR5, its expression levels on FoxP3-transduced and control T-cells were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020198-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). To determine whether FoxP3-transduced T-cells display functional properties such as hyporesponsiveness to TCR triggering, similar to freshly isolated Treg cells, transduced cells were purified by sorting mCD24<sup>+</sup> cells as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Sundrud1">Sundrud et al. 2003</xref>). Equal numbers of purified cells were then stimulated using plate-bound anti-CD3 and soluble anti-CD28 antibodies, and cytokine secretion was monitored. Secretion of IL-2 from both CB and AB naïve T-cells was reduced between 8- and 10-fold in FoxP3-expressing cells as compared to control cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020198-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). Secretion of IL-4, IL-5, and IFNγ was also reduced in FoxP3-expressing naïve T-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020198-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). In contrast, FoxP3-transduced memory T-cells secreted similar levels of IL-2 as compared to cells transduced with HDV alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020198-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). To assess the proliferative capacity of FoxP3-expressing cells, transduced cells were labeled with CFSE and stimulated through the TCR. After 4 d of activation, very few FoxP3-transduced naïve T-cells had divided as compared to control lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020198-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). Although, FoxP3-expressing memory T-cells also divided fewer times as compared to HDV-transduced cells, the effect of FoxP3 was greatly diminished in this subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020198-g007">Figure 7</xref>A).</p>

        <title>HIV-Infected Patients Have Greatly Decreased Levels of FoxP3-Expressing CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup> T-cells</title>
        <p>Our findings that Treg cells are highly susceptible to HIV infection prompted us to determine if this subset was disturbed within HIV-infected individuals. However, a major difficulty in such analysis is that many of the cell surface markers that define Treg cells are also expressed on activated T-cells (CD25, HLA-DR, GITR). Because a portion of HIV-positive individuals contain high levels of activated T-cells, simple cell surface analysis would not be sufficiently reliable to quantify Treg cells in these donors. Therefore, we utilized FoxP3 expression as the most reliable marker that defines Treg cells. To accomplish this, we sorted CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup>, naïve, and memory T-cells from 11 HIV-negative, healthy donors (median age, 31; 64% male) and 24 HIV-infected individuals (median age, 38; 85% male; 88% receiving antiretroviral therapy). Total RNA was then isolated from each subset and <italic>FoxP3</italic> mRNA expression was quantified using real-time PCR analysis. In order to normalize for experimental variability, <italic>FoxP3</italic> expression of the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup> cells was normalized to <italic>GAPDH</italic> levels from the same samples and compared to the naïve T-cell subset isolated from the same donor. We found that within HIV-negative subjects there was on average a 49-fold higher level of expression of <italic>FoxP3</italic> in CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup> cells as compared to naïve T-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020198-g009">Figure 9</xref>A).

There was a similar increase in <italic>FoxP3</italic> expression as compared to memory T-cells (data not shown). In HIV-positive subjects <italic>FoxP3</italic> expression was only increased a mean of 25-fold in CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup> cells. In contrast to healthy donors, we also observed that in about half of the HIV-positive subjects, CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup> cells expressed very low to undetectable levels of <italic>FoxP3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020198-g009">Figure 9</xref>A). <italic>FoxP3</italic> expression in memory T-cells was similar in HIV-positive and HIV-negative subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020198-g009">Figure 9</xref>A).</p>

        <p>Progressive HIV disease is associated with decreased CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell percentages and increased levels of activated T-cells. We hypothesized that this hyperactivation may be due to a loss of Treg cells. Therefore, to further evaluate relationships between FoxP3 expression and these parameters in HIV-infected individuals, samples were divided into low FoxP3 expressors (less than 10-fold higher expression in CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup> T-cells compared to naïve T-cells, designated FoxP3-low) versus high FoxP3 expressors (greater than 10-fold higher expression compared to naïve T-cells, designated FoxP3-high). HIV-positive subjects with a FoxP3-low profile had significantly lower CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell percentages, while FoxP3-high HIV-positive subjects had CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell percentages comparable to HIV-seronegative subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020198-g009">Figure 9</xref>B). Similarly, HIV-positive FoxP3-low subjects had significantly greater activated CD4<sup>+</sup>T-cells (CD4<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>) than either HIV-positive subjects with FoxP3-high profiles or HIV-seronegative subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020198-g009">Figure 9</xref>C). Interestingly, the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup> T-cells are also significantly increased in FoxP3-low expressors as compared to HIV-negative or HIV-positive FoxP3-high expressors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020198-g009">Figure 9</xref>D). These differences are most likely due to recently activated T-cells that also express high levels of CD25, as shown by higher HLA-DR expression on T-cells from the same subset of subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020198-g009">Figure 9</xref>C). Among HIV-positive subjects there was no significant association between FoxP3 expression and plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration, age, race, sex, or whether the subject was receiving antiretroviral therapy (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05 for each comparison). These findings demonstrate that a decrease in Treg cells is associated with HIV disease progression and suggest that loss of Treg cells may contribute to increased T-cell hyperactivation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study we demonstrated that human Treg cells are highly susceptible to HIV infection and that ectopic expression of FoxP3 genetically reprograms conventional naïve T-cells, phenotypically and functionally, into Treg cells. Remarkably, overexpression of FoxP3 also greatly enhances the susceptibility of activated T-cells to HIV infection. Although Treg cells constitute a small subset of the total T-cells in humans (less than 1%–2%) and thus may not be a significant target population for HIV, they appear to have very potent suppressive activity against activation of T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Takahashi1">Takahashi et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Thornton1">Thornton and Shevach 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Baecher-Allan1">Baecher-Allan et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Curotto1">Curotto de Lafaille and Lafaille 2002</xref>). Here we demonstrate that FoxP3-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup> T-cells are greatly decreased in a portion of HIV-infected individuals with low CD4 and high activated T-cells, suggesting a loss of Treg cells. We therefore propose that infection and disruption of Treg cells during HIV infection could have a major influence on T-cell homeostasis and immune regulation.</p>
      <p>Similar to previous reports, our findings demonstrate that human Treg cells appear to be enriched within the CD25<sup>hi</sup> subset of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells. However, it is not clear if Treg cells are the only population represented in the CD25<sup>hi</sup> subset since they share this phenotype with recently activated T-cells. Indeed, a portion of purified CD25<sup>hi</sup> cells proliferated and their suppressive function was less efficient as compared to FoxP3-expressing cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020198-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Because the purification of Treg cells is rather arbitrary (brightest 1%–2% of antibody-stained CD25<sup>+</sup> memory T-cells), it is conceivable that there is sizable contamination of non-Treg cells in these sorted preparations. In addition, the differences seen in the infection susceptibility of Tregs as compared to FoxP3-expressing cells may also be partly due to presence of non-Treg activated T-cells within the purified cells. Identification of the Treg subset in disease conditions with chronic T-cell activation, such as HIV, is even more problematic because a large proportion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup> cells possibly represent recently activated T-cells. Availability of large numbers of genetically reprogrammed Treg cells should facilitate the identification of novel markers that can reliably detect human Treg cells.</p>
      <p>Our results clearly demonstrate that, similar to the mouse system, ectopic expression of FoxP3 is sufficient to recapitulate all of the characteristics of Treg cells, including lower cytokine secretion, higher expression of CD25 and GITR, and their suppressive functions. This system has allowed us to generate large numbers of Treg cells, which will be invaluable in characterizing their suppressive function as well as mechanisms of enhanced HIV susceptibility. The ability to genetically manipulate primary T-cells to reprogram them into the Treg phenotype also could have profound implications for preventing graft-versus-host disease, a serious clinical condition that can be manifested following hematopoietic cell transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Hoffmann1">Hoffmann et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Taylor2">Taylor et al. 2002</xref>).</p>
      <p>It is interesting to note that naïve T-cells are more prone to reprogramming into a Treg phenotype than memory T-cells are. This loss in flexibility of reprogramming with a master transcription factor is reminiscent of Th1- and Th2-type T-cell reprogramming with ectopic expression of lineage-specific transcription factors T-bet and GATA-3, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Sundrud1">Sundrud et al. 2003</xref>). The loss of flexibility in genetic modification of effector/memory T-cells could reflect heritable epigenetic changes at effector gene loci that might otherwise be responsive to FoxP3-mediated transcription. A recent study supports this hypothesis by demonstrating that lineage-committed human memory cells failed to modify their histone acetylation patterns of cytokine genes, unlike naïve T-cells, to differentiate into Th1- or Th2-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Messi1">Messi et al. 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>The cause of progressive depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> cells and the reason for high T-cell activation or turnover during HIV infection remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Hazenberg1">Hazenberg et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Grossman1">Grossman et al. 2002</xref>). It is thought that HIV-mediated destruction of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells results in decline of this subset and that to maintain homeostasis the immune system attempts to replenish this subset, resulting in a massive turnover of T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Ho1">Ho et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Wei1">Wei et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Perelson1">Perelson et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Mohri1">Mohri et al. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Mohri2">2001</xref>). This excessive turnover rate eventually compromises proper function of homeostatic responses. Alternatively, T-cell depletion could result from disrupted thymic and peripheral homeostatic mechanisms by virus-induced generalized T-cell activation and gradual wasting of T-cell supplies, eventually leading to T-cell depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Hazenberg1">Hazenberg et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020198-Grossman1">Grossman et al. 2002</xref>).</p>
      <p>Indeed, several mechanisms control unwanted activation of T-cells, including thymic deletion of autoreactive T-cells and induction of anergy in the periphery. In addition to these passive mechanisms, recent evidence clearly demonstrates that Treg cells exert an active suppression of T-cell activation. We postulate that the high susceptibility of Treg cells to HIV in vivo, as demonstrated by our in vitro studies, could result in gradual elimination of this subset. This Treg cell decline during HIV infection would in turn reduce active suppression of conventional T-cells and, hence, contribute to hyperactivation of T-cells. Our analyses of peripheral blood T-cells from HIV-infected subjects support this hypothesis that loss of Treg cells during HIV infection contributes to HIV disease progression. Indeed, we found that in a subset of HIV-infected subjects, the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup> T-cell subset had greatly reduced FoxP3 expression, suggesting that these cells represent recently activated T-cells rather then Treg cells. The presence of a higher percent of activated T-cells in this FoxP3-low profile supports this conjecture. The HIV-infected subjects with lower levels of FoxP3<sup>+</sup> T-cells also contained a lower percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells. It is conceivable that the loss of Treg cells may be a correlative factor for disease progression; however, more detailed prospective studies will be required to address this important implication of our findings.</p>
      <p>Our findings show a 2- to 3-fold enhancement of HIV infection in FoxP3-expressing T-cells. While freshly purified Treg and memory T-cells are similar in their susceptibility to HIV infection, activated effector T-cells become gradually more resistant to infection (unpublished results). Indeed, preactivated T-cells require reactivation to render them susceptible to infection after about 1–2 weeks in culture (unpublished results). We do not yet know the mechanisms by which FoxP3 renders activated T-cells more susceptible to infection; however, two possibilities can be considered: (1) FoxP3 may be overcoming innate resistance factor(s) that accumulate in activated T-cells that block HIV infection, or (2) FoxP3 expression may be inducing critical host factors that are required for efficient completion of the HIV life cycle in primary T-cells. It is important to note that since FoxP3 expression enhances VSV-G.HIV single-round infections, it likely affects an early, postentry step in viral replication. Determining the mechanisms by which FoxP3 enhances HIV infection could reveal host factors involved in this process.</p>
      <p>In summary, our results indicate that both naturally occurring and genetically reprogrammed Treg cells are susceptible to HIV infection and that ectopic FoxP3 expression greatly increases the susceptibility of T-cells to HIV infection. Our finding that FoxP3-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T-cells are greatly reduced in HIV patients with low CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell percentages and increased T-cell activation suggests that loss of Treg cells may contribute to HIV disease progression. Further prospective studies will be required to unravel the role of this important subset in HIV infection. The ability to genetically reprogram conventional human T-cells to generate Treg cells will also lead the way to identifying unique markers expressed on this population in order to further investigate their status in HIV-infected individuals. Moreover, understanding how FoxP3 enhances HIV infection and programs T-cells into the Treg subset could help in the identification of novel host factors that mediate HIV infection in primary T-cells and decoding the molecular mechanisms by which Treg cells mediate their suppressive function.</p>
