<p>A substantial fraction of extragenic Pol II transcription sites coincides with transcriptional enhancers, which may be relevant for functional annotation of mammalian genomes.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>Mammalian genomes are pervasively transcribed outside mapped protein-coding genes. One class of extragenic transcription products is represented by long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), some of which result from Pol_II transcription of bona-fide RNA genes. Whether all lncRNAs described insofar are products of RNA genes, however, is still unclear. Here we have characterized transcription sites located outside protein-coding genes in a highly regulated response, macrophage activation by endotoxin. Using chromatin signatures, we could unambiguously classify extragenic Pol_II binding sites as belonging to either canonical RNA genes or transcribed enhancers. Unexpectedly, 70% of extragenic Pol_II peaks were associated with genomic regions with a canonical chromatin signature of enhancers. Enhancer-associated extragenic transcription was frequently adjacent to inducible inflammatory genes, was regulated in response to endotoxin stimulation, and generated very low abundance transcripts. Moreover, transcribed enhancers were under purifying selection and contained binding sites for inflammatory transcription factors, thus suggesting their functionality. These data demonstrate that a large fraction of extragenic Pol_II transcription sites can be ascribed to <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory genomic regions. Discrimination between lncRNAs generated by canonical RNA genes and products of transcribed enhancers will provide a framework for experimental approaches to lncRNAs and help complete the annotation of mammalian genomes.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Mammalian genomes contain vast intergenic regions that are extensively transcribed and generate various types of short and long non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Although in some cases specific functions have been assigned to intergenic transcripts, the functional significance of this transcriptional output remains largely unknown, and the possibility exists that part of this transcription reflects noise generated by random collisions of the transcriptional machinery with the genome to generate meaningless transcription. In this study we used chromatin signatures to characterize extragenic transcription sites targeted by RNA Polymerase II (RNA Pol II) in a highly regulated response—endotoxin activation of macrophages. We found that a significant portion of extragenic transcription sites are associated with the chromatin signature characteristic of enhancers. Consistent with their chromatin signature, we found that these extragenic transcription sites are under purifying selection and contain binding sites for inflammatory transcription factors, as well as for PU.1, a hematopoietic transcription factor that marks enhancers in macrophages. Moreover, much of this extragenic transcription is regulated by stimulation. We also identified hundreds of transcribed regions with a signature of canonical RNA genes. Our data indicate that extragenic transcription sites can be efficiently classified using chromatin signatures, which will be relevant for functional annotation of mammalian genomes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A most striking finding of modern genomic biology has been the identification of a large amount of transcription that occurs outside mapped protein-coding genes and generates a heterogeneous spectrum of transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Birney1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Prasanth1">[2]</xref>, which may in principle exert broad regulatory or effector functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Mercer1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Wilusz1">[5]</xref>. These data imply that the amount of information contained in the complex genomes of eukaryotes, and higher eukaryotes in particular, is much higher than the classical linear models of genomic organization can accommodate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Kapranov1">[6]</xref>. The abundance of non-coding transcription also generates novel conceptual and experimental challenges. Probably the most outstanding and urgent issues are (i) to define how many, and which, of the transcriptional events occurring outside protein-coding genes are functional and regulated (as opposed to those that represent noise) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Struhl1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Ponting1">[8]</xref>; (ii) to discriminate if functionality is conveyed by the transcript, by the act of transcription, or both; (iii) to classify functional transcription sites as canonical RNA genes or regulatory sequences undergoing transcription, like enhancers and locus control regions (LCRs), that in anecdotal cases were shown to be transcribed and to generate ncRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Ashe1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Lefevre1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>Regarding functionality, the two extreme views are that most of this extragenic non-coding transcription merely represents noise, namely the consequence of unscheduled but productive collisions of RNA polymerases with random genomic regions, and that most of the products of non-coding transcription are functional RNA molecules exerting downstream functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Mercer1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Struhl1">[7]</xref>. Examples of transcriptional noise may be represented both by the recently described “ripples” of transcription extending from one protein coding-gene into the adjacent genomic regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Ebisuya1">[14]</xref> and by the spurious intragenic transcription initiation events, which in yeast seem to be actively suppressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Carrozza1">[15]</xref>. In several cases, including the Xist, Air, and Kcnq1ot1 ncRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Feng1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Penny1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Nagano1">[23]</xref>, specific functions have been ascribed to selected lncRNAs on the basis of loss- or gain-of-function experiments. Evidence for functionality of lncRNAs as a class also stems from evolutionary analyses indicating that purifying selection has acted on both the promoters and the internal sequences of lncRNA genes to eliminate nucleotide substitutions, insertions and deletions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Mercer1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Ponting1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Ponjavic1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Guttman1">[25]</xref>. Two aspects of these evolutionary signatures of functionality deserve a more detailed analysis. First, the overall level of conservation, albeit significant, is comparatively low, with point mutations occurring with a frequency about 10-fold higher in lncRNA sequences as compared to protein-coding genes, although lncRNA splice sites tend to be conserved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Ponjavic1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Guttman1">[25]</xref>. Second, conservation was found to be much higher at promoters than within the transcript sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Ponjavic1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Carninci1">[26]</xref>, which may indicate either the stronger sequence constraints of regulatory regions as compared to the ncRNA products or that at least in some cases the target of purifying selection may be represented by the act of transcription rather than by its products.</p>
<p>The concept that transcription has roles other than generating functional products mainly stems from the analysis of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements like LCRs and enhancers. Unidirectional transcription of the β-globin LCR by RNA Pol_II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Ashe1">[9]</xref> is required to generate and maintain an open chromatin domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Gribnau1">[10]</xref>. Similarly, the switch of polycomb group response elements (PRE) from a repressed to an activated state in <italic>Drosophila</italic> requires intergenic transcription through the PRE, indicating that in some cases transcription may provide an anti-silencing mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Schmitt1">[27]</xref>. Additional examples of non-coding transcription correlating with (and causing) locus activation were described in the LCR of the major histocompatibility complex II locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Masternak1">[28]</xref>, in the T cell receptor locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Abarrategui1">[11]</xref>, and upstream of the lysozyme gene in activated macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Lefevre1">[13]</xref>. Non-coding transcription occurring close to protein-coding genes also has the potential to cause gene repression. Transcription of the non-coding gene <italic>SRG1</italic> through the promoter of <italic>SER3</italic> in yeast interferes with binding of transcription factors and subsequent activation, thus providing a paradigmatic example of transcriptional interference mediated by non-coding transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Martens1">[29]</xref>. Similarly, the <italic>Ubx</italic> gene in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is repressed by non-coding transcription elongating from the upstream <italic>bxd</italic> locus, which results in complementary and non-overlapping patterns of expression of <italic>Ubx</italic> mRNA and <italic>bxd</italic> ncRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Petruk1">[30]</xref>. In some (but not all) cases described above, formal evidence was provided that the act of transcription <italic>per se</italic> (rather than the transcripts) mediates downstream effects. For instance, intergenic transcription extending in the yeast <italic>PHO5</italic> promoter is required for nucleosome eviction and gene activation; however, increasing the level of the unstable lncRNA generated in this region didn't affect gene activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Uhler1">[31]</xref>. In other cases the lncRNA generated by extragenic transcription was found to impart regulation. For instance, nascent ncRNAs were shown to act as platforms for the recruitment of an RNA-binding transcriptional regulator upstream of the <italic>CCND1</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Wang1">[20]</xref>, and the Evf2 ncRNA (derived from an ultraconserved regulatory region) was shown to act in <italic>trans</italic> to coactivate the homeodomain TF Dlx-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Feng1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>Mechanistically, transcriptional elongation causes a broad spectrum of effects to the underlying chromatin template, including chromatin remodeling, nucleosome eviction, and changes in the acetylation and methylation state of histone tails <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Travers1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Shilatifard1">[33]</xref>, effects that are all due to the association of multiple enzymatic activities with the elongating Pol_II complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Belotserkovskaya1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Wittschieben1">[35]</xref>. Direct biochemical and genetic evidence supporting this type of mechanism comes from a recent time-resolved analysis in <italic>S. Pombe</italic>: transiently inducible non-coding Pol_II transcription upstream of the <italic>fbp1</italic> locus caused a wave of chromatin remodeling preceding, and required for, binding of activating transcription factors to cognate sites in the <italic>fbp1</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Hirota1">[36]</xref>. However, the possible role of the nascent, very low abundance ncRNAs generated by transcription upstream of <italic>fbp1</italic> was not directly addressed.</p>
<p>In spite of all these observations, it is still unclear to what extent each of these reports represents an anecdotal description of uncommon gene regulatory mechanisms or conversely a paradigmatic example of a more general contribution of non-coding transcription to gene control. Moreover, the extent to which transcription occurring outside protein-coding genes indicates underlying RNA genes rather than Pol_II elongation along distant <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions (like enhancers and LCRs) is completely unknown.</p>
<p>Here we took advantage of a dataset of extragenic Pol_II sites in a model of highly regulated gene expression (endotoxin-stimulated primary macrophages). Using chromatin signatures we discriminated between transcribed enhancers and transcription start sites (TSS) of RNA genes. Remarkably, 70% of extragenic transcription sites (which were frequently up- or down-regulated by endotoxin stimulation) corresponded to genomic regions with an enhancer-type chromatin signature. These Pol_II peaks overlapped with annotated lncRNAs, were associated with binding sites for inflammatory transcription factors, and displayed enhancer activity in reporter assays. We also identified about 700 extragenic Pol_II clusters with a typical signature of active TSS and highly enriched for CpG islands, thus likely representing the 5′ end of bona fide RNA-coding genes. Overall, enhancers overlap a sizeable fraction of extragenic transcription sites in higher eukaryotes.</p>

<title>Regulated Extragenic Transcription Upstream of LPS-Inducible Genes</title>
<p>We first determined the genomic distribution of RNA Pol_II in unstimulated and activated mouse macrophages (stimulated for 2 h with LPS in the presence of gamma interferon, γIFN). These ChIP-Sequencing datasets (described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-DeSanta1">[37]</xref>) were generated with an antibody recognizing all isoforms of the large RNA Pol_II subunit, Rbp1, irrespective of their phosphorylation state. Therefore, they provide a snapshot of global Pol_II distribution over the mouse genome.</p>
<p>We first browsed genomic regions containing genes regulated by LPS stimulation, like cytokine and chemokine genes, to identify sites of extragenic transcription. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g001">Figure 1A</xref> shows an example of extragenic Pol_II sites induced by LPS stimulation and located upstream of the inflammatory chemokine gene Ccl5. Upstream Pol_II peaks are extremely broad, covering about 20 kb of extragenic sequence with no annotation of known or predicted exons; moreover their height is much lower than that found inside the coding region. Upstream Pol_II signals do not seem to be continuous (with three or four distinct clusters) and stop just upstream of the Ccl5 TSS. Upstream of another chemokine gene, Cxcl11 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000384.s001">Figure S1</xref>), two discrete inducible peaks can be observed, covering an area of about 10 kb. Although these peaks overlap a gene (Art3) that extends in antisense orientation over Cxcl11 (and the closely spaced Cxcl10), they cannot be ascribed to the activity of Art3, which is very poor in these cells (as indicated by the very small amount of Pol_II loaded on its TSS). Intergenic Pol_II (with no continuity with the Pol_II signals tracking from the 3′ of Cxcl11) can also be detected in the space separating the 3′ of Cxcl11 from the 5′ of Cxcl10. Other examples are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000384.s001">Figure S1</xref>.</p>

<p>To determine if Pol_II is actively transcribing these extragenic regions, we also generated ChIP-Seq datasets using an antibody specific for an elongating Pol_II isoform (phosphorylated at Ser5 of the carboxy-terminal domain of Rbp1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Sutherland1">[38]</xref>. Ser5 profiles confirmed that Pol_II binding upstream of Ccl5 reflects active transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

<title>Upstream Extragenic Transcription Frequently Precedes the Induction of the Adjacent Coding Gene</title>
<p>To start characterizing the properties of the extragenic transcription described above, we first analyzed kinetics of induction of the corresponding ncRNA relative to that of the downstream coding gene. We carried out quantitative RT-PCR with primers designed in regions contained within the extragenic Pol_II peaks. In the case of Ccl5 we explored the three regions of extragenic transcription (named −<italic>1</italic>, −<italic>2</italic>, and −<italic>3</italic>) indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g001">Figure 1A</xref>. Importantly, the Q-PCR primers were designed at a fixed distance in order to generate products of 200 nucleotides. Therefore, a positive signal implies the existence of RNA species of at least 200 nt. The kinetics of activation of these regions, as evaluated by the behavior of the corresponding transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), were very similar with each other, appearing already at 30′ after stimulation and reaching maximal levels between 60 and 90 min. At Cxcl11 the two upstream transcripts tested appeared even faster, peaking between 30 and 60 min, to be then rapidly downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In both cases, however, kinetics of induction of upstream extragenic transcription preceded the appearance of the mature mRNA generated from the downstream coding genes, a concept also supported by the analysis of the nascent transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000384.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Moreover, extragenic transcription was downregulated when the coding gene reached its maximal level of expression, a result particularly obvious at Cxcl11. This type of behavior was not specific to these two genes, as it could be detected at several other genes associated with inducible upstream extragenic transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Therefore, extragenic transcription associated with inducible gene expression at these loci displays a clear temporal pattern in which upstream (presumably non-coding) transcription precedes the induction of the downstream protein-coding gene. This kinetic behavior is reminiscent of the relative temporal profiles of non-coding versus coding transcription observed in other systems. At the <italic>fbp1</italic> gene in <italic>S.Pombe</italic>, a rapidly induced, low-level upstream transcription (which is required for chromatin opening at the locus) precedes downstream gene activation and is turned off when the gene is activated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Hirota1">[36]</xref>.</p>

<p>Importantly, all the ncRNAs we detected in this analysis accumulated at very low levels, usually hundreds of folds less than the adjacent coding genes. This may reflect the combination of a low transcription rate (indicated by both the low intensity of both the Pol_II peaks and the nascent transcripts shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000384.s002">Figure S2</xref>) and a high instability of the final product (see below).</p>

<title>Inducible Upstream Extragenic Transcripts Are Strand-Specific, Poly-Adenylated, Unspliced, and Very Unstable Nuclear Species</title>
<p>Detailed structural characterization of these inducible extragenic transcripts is hindered by their very low abundance. Priming the reverse reaction with oligo-dT indicates that transcripts generated upstream of Ccl5 are poly-adenylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Moreover, they can be detected exclusively in the nuclear compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Priming the cDNA synthesis with antisense primers located upstream of the 5′ of Ccl5 showed that upstream transcription generates long unspliced RNAs extending for a few kilobases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). However, using the same cDNAs we couldn't obtain Q-PCR signals in peaks further upstream (indicated as −2 and −3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) (unpublished data). cDNAs primed by multiple oligonucleotides on the opposite strand didn't generate any Q-PCR product (unpublished data), indicating that transcription is strand-specific, occurring on the upper strand toward Ccl5, and as such unlikely to reflect random transcriptional events occurring at open chromatin.</p>

<title>Characterization of the extragenic transcripts generated upstream of LPS-inducible genes.</title>
<p>(A) Polyadenylation of extragenic Ccl5 transcripts. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed using oligo-dT primers. cDNA was then amplified with primers corresponding to regions <italic>−1</italic>, <italic>−2</italic>, and <italic>−3</italic> upstream of Ccl5 (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g001">Figure 1</xref>). (B) Upstream extragenic transcripts are nuclear RNAs. Macrophages were fractionated before RNA extraction. RNA from the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions was then reverse transcribed and amplified with the indicated primers. Neat1 is a nuclear non-coding RNA that was used as a control of the fractionation procedure. (C) Extragenic transcription upstream of Ccl5 generates long unspliced transcripts. RNA was reverse transcribed using antisense primers in the region just upstream of Ccl5 TSS, as indicated. cDNA was then PCR-amplified using primers in the extragenic region <italic>−1</italic> (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). (D) Extragenic Ccl5 and Cxcl11 transcripts are very unstable. Cells were stimulated with LPS for 2 h, followed by a 30 min actinomycinD (5 µg/ml) chase. mRNAs for Ccl5 and Cxcl11 and the corresponding extragenic transcripts were measured by quantitative PCR. UT, untreated. (E) DRB insensitivity of extragenic Ccl5 and Cxcl11 transcripts. Macrophages were stimulated with LPS for 2 h in the presence or absence of DRB (50 µg/ml), as indicated.

<p>Finally we measured the stability of these transcripts using an actinomycinD chase. In comparison to both the mRNAs generated by the associated protein-coding genes and some known lncRNAs (like Xist and Neat), the upstream non-coding transcripts were very unstable, being reduced by 80% to 90% after a 30 min actinomycinD treatment (indicating a half-life lower than 7.5 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g003">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000384.s003">Figure S3</xref>). High instability of a subset of lncRNAs both in yeast and mammals mainly depends on degradation by the nuclear exosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Wyers1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Preker1">[40]</xref> and often results in the generation of more stable short RNA products <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Kapranov2">[41]</xref>, which in principle might be responsible for downstream functional effects.</p>
<p>Another interesting property of some of the upstream transcripts is that, unlike mRNAs, they are poorly sensitive to DRB treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). DRB is an inhibitor of Cdk9, the catalytic subunit of the elongation factor pTEFb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Peterlin1">[42]</xref>. Cdk9 acts on multiple substrates to promote Pol_II entry into the elongation phase and cotranscriptional mRNA processing. The previous finding that up to 40% of nuclear RNA synthesis is unaffected by DRB treatment, as opposed to the 95% reduction of cytoplasmic polyadenylated transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Sehgal1">[43]</xref>, may indirectly suggest that at least part of extragenic transcription is subjected to control mechanisms different from those acting at protein coding genes, and specifically that P-TEFb may not be required for Pol_II activity at some of these regions.</p>

<title>Genome-Wide Annotation of Extragenic Pol_II Transcription Sites</title>
<p>Browsing through the data indicated some major challenges towards a systematic and correct identification of extragenic Pol_II peaks. The most obvious one was represented by the extension of elongating Pol_II molecules several kilobases beyond the end of annotated protein coding genes, namely in regions that by definition are extragenic. This is most likely due to the lack of specific and strong termination signals for RNA Pol_II. Moreover, alternative TSSs located upstream of the annotated ones contribute to create ambiguity in extragenic Pol_II peak annotation. To systematically annotate sites of extragenic transcription, we first filtered out all Pol_II signals overlapping UCSC known genes as well as peaks within 10 kb from the 3′ end of annotated genes (which after several tests proved to be an optimal length to eliminate most signals due to Pol_II tracking from the upstream gene). It is important to stress that because of this design, our analysis does not take into account gene boundaries, which represent a major source of long and short non-coding RNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Preker1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Kapranov2">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Katayama1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Core1">[47]</xref>.</p>
<p>The initial list was eventually curated for additional filtering (mainly to eliminate Pol_II signals showing continuity with upstream genes), leading to 4,588 high-confidence extragenic Pol_II peaks. Using a statistical approach for ChIP-Seq data analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Zhang1">[48]</xref> we classified these peaks as constitutive (895), inducible (1,482), or repressed (2,211) in response to stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g004">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000384.s009">Table S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Classification of Extragenic Pol_II Sites Based on Chromatin Signatures</title>
<p>Chromatin signatures generated by specific combinations of post-translational modifications of core histone tails are powerful and sensitive indicators of functionality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Roh1">[49]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Zhao1">[51]</xref>. A simple, yet informative combination of modifications includes the mono-methylation of H3K4 (H3K4me1) and the tri-methylation of the same residue (H3K4me3). TSSs of genes that are either active or poised for activity are characterized by high levels of H3K4me3 (peaking just downstream of the TSS and confined to a few nucleosomes), flanked on both sides by regions enriched for H3K4me1. Conversely, enhancers display high levels of H3K4me1, usually distributed over several kilobases, associated with low or no H3K4me3 (H3K4me1<sup>hi</sup>/H3K4me3<sup>lo</sup> domains) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Heintzman1">[52]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Heintzman2">[53]</xref>. Enhancers are also frequently bound by the histone acetyltransferase p300 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Heintzman1">[52]</xref>.</p>
<p>In order to assign the extragenic Pol_II clusters in our dataset to either TSSs of lncRNA genes or to enhancers, we used a machine-learning algorithm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000384.s019">Text S1</xref>). The algorithm was instructed to discriminate enhancers from promoters using the H3K4me3/H3K4me1 chromatin profiles at 556 informative (unambiguous) extragenic p300 peaks (described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Ghisletti1">[54]</xref>) and the H3K4me3/H3K4me1 profiles at an identical number of promoters/TSSs with a broad range of Pol_II levels. This approach was validated by multiple tests (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000384.s019">Text S1</xref>) including its ability to properly classify ChIP-Seq peaks of the macrophage TF PU.1, which we found to be strongly but not exclusively enriched in enhancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Ghisletti1">[54]</xref>: PU.1 peaks that were classified as promoters/TSSs using this algorithm overlapped annotated TSSs of UCSC known genes in 67% of cases, while PU.1 peaks classified as enhancers overlapped annotated TSS only in 7% of cases (and in most cases visual inspection confirmed that these TSS did not show a typical signature of promoters).</p>

<title>A Large Fraction of Extragenic Pol_II Activity Occurs at Enhancers</title>
<p>We thus applied this machine-learning algorithm to the dataset of 4,588 extragenic Pol_II peaks described above. We found that 3,227/4,588 peaks were contained in regions with a chromatin signature of enhancers, 1,004 were in regions with a signature of active or poised TSSs, while 357 were associated with regions with a non-predictive signature. Peaks were then clustered (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) and then filtered against Ensembl protein coding genes to definitively discard regions with protein-coding potential. The final dataset consisted of 3,216 Pol_II clusters, including 2,236 enhancers (69%), 779 promoters (24%), and 201 unpredictable regions (7%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g004">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000384.s012">Table S4</xref>). Chromatin signatures at the enhancer and promoter groups are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, and examples of predicted enhancers and promoters associated with extragenic Pol_II clusters are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g004">Figure 4D</xref>. The chromatin signature at the region upstream of Ccl5 is also compatible with its enhancer activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000384.s004">Figure S4</xref>). If these predictions are correct, an obvious expectation is that the group associated with the promoter/TSS signature should be enriched for CpG islands. This was indeed the case: 165/779 promoters (21.2%) were associated with an underlying CpG island (<italic>p</italic>&lt;1e-3) as compared to only 11/2,236 enhancer clusters (0.5%, which is similar to what was found in random sets of genomic sequences with similar composition) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). The association between putative ncRNA genes and CpG islands is clearly much lower than observed at protein-coding genes (72%) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Saxonov1">[55]</xref>; however, our results are similar to those reported by Ponjavic et al. for ncRNA genes expressed in mouse development, which were associated with CpG islands in about 30% of cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Ponjavic2">[56]</xref>. The TSSs of annotated, bona-fide RNA genes (like Neat1, Malat, and Xist) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Prasanth1">[2]</xref> have chromatin features analogous to those of protein-coding genes and perfectly fitting the pattern of our promoters/TSSs group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000384.s005">Figure S5</xref> and unpublished data). This is in keeping with the notion that lncRNA genes can be retrieved using the same H3K4me3/H3K36me3 chromatin signature that was originally described at active protein coding genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Guttman1">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>We next investigated the relationship between the transcriptional activity of predicted enhancers and that of the associated protein-coding genes. First, we assigned predicted transcribed enhancers to adjacent coding genes if distant from them less than 20 kb. We considered this restrictive criterion essential to limit incorrect or arbitrary matches. Enhancers whose association with Pol_II was induced or increased by stimulation were strongly associated with inducible genes (<italic>p</italic>&lt;1e-7 when compared to the expected fraction), while association with constitutive and repressed genes was underrepresented in a statistically significant manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g004">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000384.s013">Table S5</xref>). In a specular manner, repressed enhancers were associated with repressed genes, albeit at low statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). It should be stressed that repressed enhancers are also associated with a large number of genes that are induced by stimulation. Although from a statistical point of view this group of inducible genes is underrepresented as compared to what is expected, the possibility should not be discounted that transcriptional downregulation of an enhancer may be involved in the activation of the associated gene, possibly by relieving transcriptional interference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Martens1">[29]</xref>.</p>

<title>Evidence for Active Transcription at Enhancers</title>
<p>In the cases shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g002">Figure 2</xref> we could detect and measure low-abundance long RNAs (≥200 nt) generated at regions of extragenic Pol_II binding. However, Pol_II recruitment to chromatin is not necessarily followed by elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Lis1">[57]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Guenther1">[58]</xref>. To address this crucial issue, we carried out several complementary analyses and experiments. First, we analyzed the overlap between extragenic Pol_II sites and annotated ncRNAs datasets. We used two different catalogues: a “macroRNA” dataset (2,168 ncRNAs) generated by the FANTOM consortium by massive cDNA sequencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Carninci1">[26]</xref> and then filtered to eliminate RNAs overlapping all current protein-coding gene annotations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Ponjavic1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Marques1">[59]</xref>, and a dataset of large intervening ncRNAs (1,408 “lincRNAs”) identified by the H3K4me3/H3K36me3 chromatin signatures characteristic of bona fide active genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Guttman1">[25]</xref> and then filtered against the Ensemble protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000384.s010">Table S2</xref>). These two catalogues show little overlap, suggesting that each of them includes only a small fraction of a presumably much larger ncRNA repertoire <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Marques1">[59]</xref>. 26/2,236 predicted enhancers and 21/779 promoters/TSSs overlapped annotated macroRNAs (albeit low, the overlap was statistically significant) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000384.s011">Table S3</xref>). LincRNAs were associated with the promoter group (122/779; 15.6%) and, to a lower extent, to the enhancer group (167/2,236; 7.4%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000384.s011">Table S3</xref>). As lincRNAs were identified on the basis of an H3K4me3/H3K36me3 chromatin signature that distinguishes active genes, the overlap with the enhancer group may appear surprising. However, visual inspection of these enhancers was consistent with the notion that they represent regulatory regions located within these extended H3K4me3/H3K36me3 domains (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000384.s006">Figure S6</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, using a database of CAGE tags generated from the FANTOM consortium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Kawaji1">[60]</xref>, we found that the transcriptional potential of 72% of regions in the promoter group and 53% in the enhancer group was supported by overlapping CAGE tags. In interpreting these data it should be considered that the lncRNAs generated at the β-globin LCR do not contain a CAP at their 5′ end <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Ling1">[61]</xref>, which implies that a fraction of the transcripts generated at regulatory regions is not represented in CAGE tags libraries. Interestingly, the median distance between multiple CAGE tags is significantly higher in enhancers than in promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). These data confirm the transcriptional potential of predicted enhancers and suggest that while TSSs are tightly clustered in the promoter group, they are distributed over broader distances in the enhancer group (presumably generating primary transcripts with heterogeneous 5′ ends).</p>

<p>Third, we generated ChIP-Seq datasets in untreated and LPS-treated macrophages using an antibody that recognizes the large Pol_II subunit Rbp1 only when phosphorylated at Ser5 of its C-terminal domain (CTD). Ser5 phosphorylation by TFIIH occurs at the transition to transcription initiation and is maintained throughout the length of transcribed genes to be then removed by a phosphatase at the very 3′ end <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Sutherland1">[38]</xref>. Ser5-P was extensively associated with both predicted enhancers and promoters in our datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000384.s014">Table S6</xref>). Median Ser5 peak length is 479 bp, with a minimum of 110 bp and a maximum of 7341 bp, indirectly suggesting that in most cases long (&gt;200 nt) primary transcripts are generated. This result confirms that, independently of the final abundance of the transcripts, enhancers associated with Pol_II are actively transcribed. Similar results were obtained for promoters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000384.s007">Figure S7</xref>).</p>
<p>Fourth, we analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR a representative set of 100 predicted enhancers within the whole range of <italic>p</italic> values associated with the corresponding Pol_II peaks (as in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000384.s009">Table S1</xref>). Primers were designed to generate 200 nt amplicons. 96/100 tested regions generated detectable transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000384.s015">Table S7</xref>), indirectly indicating that the vast majority of extragenic Pol_II peaks likely generate transcripts.</p>
<p>Due to their very low abundance, a comprehensive analysis of extragenic ncRNAs and their detailed structural characterization present obvious difficulties. RNA sequencing is a powerful approach for detection of potentially all RNA species in a cell, although low abundance transcripts can be identified only at very high sequencing depth. As an initial step toward characterization of enhancer-associated transcripts, we generated an RNA-Seq dataset in untreated macrophages using total nuclear RNAs. At the level of sequencing depth we reached (11.5 million aligned tags from four Solexa GAII lanes) we could detect 225,439 transcripts corresponding to 13,702 RefSeq genes and 28,247 UCSC known genes. We found RNA-Seq tags overlapping 193/484 promoters and 369/1,660 enhancers active in untreated macrophages (corresponding to the constitutive and repressed groups; <italic>p</italic>&lt;1e-3 compared to random sets of intergenic genomic sequences). In most cases, however, low density of tags precluded the identification of well-defined transcripts. Importantly, the extragenic regions associated with RNA-Seq tags displayed median Pol_II signals about 1.5 orders of magnitude higher than the regions for which transcripts could not be detected at this sequencing depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Therefore, only the transcripts produced at the extragenic regions with high transcriptional activity could be detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000384.s012">Table S4</xref>). Nevertheless, these data further confirm that Pol_II-bound extragenic regions are in general subjected to active transcription.</p>

<title>Evidence of Functionality of Enhancer-Type Extragenic Transcribed Regions</title>
<p>While a large fraction of extragenic transcription sites bear an enhancer-associated chromatin signature, this doesn't demonstrate that these regions have functional properties of enhancers.

<p>Sequence conservation in both the enhancer and the promoter group was stronger in the central regions (and precisely in the sequences just flanking the summit of the Pol_II peaks) and it was progressively diluted moving outwards.</p>
<p>We next cloned some of these predicted enhancer sequences in a plasmid bearing a minimal promoter driving luciferase expression and tested their ability to increase reporter gene activity. All the sequences tested increased basal expression and some provided responsiveness to LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). The first sequence from the left was also assayed for orientation-independence of enhancer activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). As additional evidence that these regions are in fact bona fide enhancers, we tested their ability to fold onto the neighboring promoter using chromosome conformation capture (3C) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Dekker1">[63]</xref>.

Association was not dependent on stimulation as it could be found also in basal conditions. In fact, stimulation reduced to a various extent the degree of looping.</p>
<p>Finally, we evaluated the degree of overlap between extragenic Pol_II and binding of the transcription factor PU.1, which (in addition to being recruited to active promoters) is very extensively associated with enhancers in macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Ghisletti1">[54]</xref>. Considering a search space of ±500 nt surrounding ChIP-Seq PU.1 peaks, we found that 84.4% of enhancer-type extragenic Pol_II clusters were associated with PU.1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g006">Figure 6D</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000384.s004">Figures S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000384.s006">S6</xref> for some examples). PU.1 association with promoter/TSS-type transcribed regions was also very frequent (69.3%), while Pol_II peaks with a non-predictive chromatin signature were associated with PU.1 only in 33.8% of cases. Such a substantial association between extragenic Pol_II and binding of a sequence-specific TF (72% overlap considering the entire dataset) strongly argues against the notion that this extensive transcriptional activity is mere noise and conversely confirms its nature as a regulated process.</p>

<title>Different Sets of Transcription Factors Are Associated with Different Behaviors of Enhancer-Associated Extragenic RNA Pol_II</title>
<p>Enhancer functionality depends on the transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) contained in their sequence. TFs activated by stimulation with LPS+IFNγ include NF-kB/Rel family members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Hayden1">[64]</xref>, IRFs (interferon regulatory factors) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Taniguchi1">[65]</xref>, and STAT1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Ivashkiv1">[66]</xref>. Moreover, the hematopoietic Ets family member PU.1, which is constitutively expressed at highest levels in macrophages, is highly enriched in enhancers, where it provides context dependence to responses driven by inflammatory TFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Ghisletti1">[54]</xref>. We therefore searched our dataset of 2,236 predicted enhancers associated with extragenic Pol_II for enriched TFBSs. To this aim, we first assembled a library of 338 position weight matrices (PWMs) by combining the DNA binding motifs in the Jaspar database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Sandelin1">[67]</xref> and those in a recently reported set of PWMs for 104 mouse transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Badis1">[68]</xref>. Then we divided the enhancers in three groups based on Pol_II behavior (constitutive, inducible, and repressed) and used a statistical approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Frith1">[69]</xref> to score TFBS enrichment in each group relative to two background sets (namely the whole mouse chr 19 and a set of all 5 kb sequences located upstream of the TSSs of mouse RefSeq genes).</p>
<p>In the inducible group we found a strong enrichment for IRFs and STAT1 (which bind related sites and were recognized by five distinct PWMs), as well as for NF-kB/Rel (identified by four PWMs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g007">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000384.s016">Table S8</xref>). Moreover, the dataset was strongly enriched for PU.1/Spi1 PWMs, which is in keeping with its association with enhancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Ghisletti1">[54]</xref>. The constitutive group, in addition to a strong enrichment for PU.1/Spi1, showed a comparatively lower but anyway significant enrichment for IRF/STAT1 and NF-kB/Rel PWMs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000384.s016">Table S8</xref>). In this regard, it should be noticed that some of the enhancers that we define as “constitutive,” in fact show LPS-induced increases in Pol_II levels that do not reach the threshold we set for the inclusion among the inducible peaks. Remarkably, the group of putative enhancers repressed by stimulation was strongly enriched for PU.1/Spi1 but not for any of the PWMs for the inducible, inflammatory TFs associated with the other two groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000384.s016">Table S8</xref>). Therefore the enhancers whose association with Pol_II is reduced by stimulation appear to represent a distinct group with a completely different TFBS composition. Importantly, also the group of the induced promoters (and to a lesser extent the one including the constitutive promoters) was enriched for binding sites for inflammatory TFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000384.s016">Table S8</xref>), indicating that the TFs driving the inflammatory gene expression program also control many canonical RNA genes.</p>

<p>We next evaluated if the identified TFBSs are functional. Some of the inducible Pol_II peaks in the region upstream of Ccl5 scored positively for IRF3 (as well as other IRFs) and NF-kB, which are known to coregulate Ccl5 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Doyle1">[70]</xref>. Blocking IRF3 and NF-kB activity with specific mutants in stable Raw264.7 macrophage cell lines (kindly provided by G. Cheng, UCLA) blocked not only the induction of the Ccl5 mRNA but also the appearance of the upstream non-coding transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Moreover, the NF-kB subunit p65/RelA was recruited to the Ccl5 upstream region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g007">Figure 7C</xref>), thus further supporting the functionality of the identified sites. Interestingly, maximal p65 recruitment to this region preceded recruitment to the NF-kB binding sites contained in the Ccl5 promoter, which is in keeping with the faster kinetics of induction of upstream transcription as compared to that of the Ccl5 mRNA (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Enhancer Associated Extragenic Transcription May Promote Domain-Wide Acetylation and Pol_II Loading on Downstream TSSs</title>
<p>As we could detect thousands of enhancer-associated extragenic Pol_II peaks with distinct behaviors, some degree of functional heterogeneity is expected. Moreover, definitive understanding of the function of each extragenic transcription site would require dedicated genetic approaches to interfere with Pol_II loading and/or elongation (like the knock-in of transcriptional terminator sequences; see for instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Abarrategui1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Hirota1">[36]</xref>). Attempts to deplete ncRNA generated at enhancers by RNAi were not successful, which likely reflects their constitutive instability (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>). We tried however to get an initial glimpse into the functional impact of transcription through enhancers in this system. One model supported by experimental data is that extragenic transcription leads to the repeated passage of several Pol_II-associated enzymes, including Swi/Snf remodeling complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Wilson1">[71]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Cho1">[72]</xref> and histone acetyltransferases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Wittschieben1">[35]</xref>, through chromatin regions, thus leading to extensive remodeling and changes in accessibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Travers1">[32]</xref>. We first found that macrophage activation is associated with a domain-wide increase in acetylation at the transcribed regions upstream of Ccl5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g008">Figure 8A</xref> and unpublished data). Domain-wide hyperacetylation was strongly reduced by treatment with actinomycinD but not with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). Importantly, Ccl5 is a primary response gene and as such it is not sensitive to CHX treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-RamirezCarrozzi1">[73]</xref>. Therefore, while new protein synthesis does not impact on acetylation of the locus, new transcription is required for maximal acetylation both at the TSS and at upstream regions. ActD (but not CHX) treatment also prevented recruitment of Pol_II at the Ccl5 TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g008">Figure 8B</xref>, left). Conversely, at a secondary gene (interleukin 6, IL-6), both CHX and ActD completely blocked Pol_II recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g008">Figure 8B</xref>, left). The effects of ActD on Pol_II recruitment to TSSs were not general, as they could not be detected at two other genes tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g008">Figure 8B</xref>, right). Therefore, with all the due cautions required in experiments with global inhibitors, it seems that the act (or the products) of transcription (rather than the induction of new protein products) is involved both in acetylation through the Ccl5 locus and in gene induction.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main finding of this study is that RNA Pol_II association with, and productive transcription of, a subset of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions accounts for a sizeable fraction of transcription sites located outside of coding gene borders. It is important to notice that the design of our study—which is based on the analysis of Pol_II occupancy in regions not overlapping annotated protein-coding genes—implies that gene boundaries, which contribute in a substantial manner to the repertoire of short and long ncRNAs in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Preker1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Kapranov2">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Katayama1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Core1">[47]</xref>, were not taken into consideration.</p>
<p>The concept that enhancers and LCRs in some cases undergo transcription was previously demonstrated at individual loci in various experimental models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Ashe1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Abarrategui1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Martens1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Petruk1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Hirota1">[36]</xref>. Our data demonstrate on a genomic scale that this is a common occurrence. However, based on our data on enhancers in this specific system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Ghisletti1">[54]</xref>, as well as reports in other models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Heintzman2">[53]</xref>, it seems clear that non-transcribed enhancers (in the order of magnitude of dozens of thousands in every given cell type) greatly outnumber the transcribed ones, which raises some obvious questions.</p>
<p>First, can enhancers be classified on the basis of being transcribed or not, and do Pol_II-transcribed enhancers represent a functionally and mechanistically homogeneous group? A simple model, compatible with a large body of experimental data, is that functionality of transcribed enhancers and LCRs indeed depends on the directional movement of Pol_II along their sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Travers1">[32]</xref>. Large chromatin domains often undergo regulated and extensive modifications (like acetylation and reduction of nucleosomal density) controlling their accessibility and functionality: in such cases it is difficult to imagine how chromatin-modifying enzymes recruited to discrete sites by association with sequence-specific TFs can promote such large scale changes. Conversely, loading the same enzymes onto elongating Pol_II complexes provides a regulated and specific way to catalyze rapid changes across extended regions, thus establishing transcriptional competence (discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Travers1">[32]</xref>). An example of a specific effect of the transcription process itself, in which the ncRNA product apparently has no direct role, is provided by the <italic>PHO5</italic> gene in yeast, whose activation requires nucleosome eviction stimulated by non-coding transcription across its promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Uhler1">[31]</xref>. When the level of the ensuing ncRNA was artificially increased (by either overexpression or by inactivation of the nuclear exosome), no consequences on nucleosome depletion were found <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Uhler1">[31]</xref>. In other cases it was shown that the ncRNAs generated from regulatory regions is functional <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Ponting1">[8]</xref>, either by controlling the deposition of epigenetic modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Camblong1">[21]</xref> or by promoting the recruitment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Wang1">[20]</xref> or stimulating the activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Feng1">[12]</xref> of transcriptional activators. In some of these cases, it is implicit that the ncRNAs would act at the production site, possibly when still associated with elongating Pol_II. This model may well apply to ncRNAs generated at enhancers, whose function may relate to the control of local chromatin features. Overall, the role of ncRNA transcripts versus transcription in conveying regulatory information likely varies depending on the regulatory region considered, and ad hoc experiments will be required to understand the relative frequency of the two groups of mechanisms. For those enhancers whose associated transcripts will be demonstrated to be functional (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Wang1">[20]</xref>), their distinction from canonical RNA genes may appear conceptually subtle and in the end rely exclusively on their distinct chromatin signature. However, we believe that an additional important aspect should be considered in distinguishing enhancers that generate functional RNAs from canonical RNA genes: the <italic>local</italic> and <italic>temporally restricted cis</italic>-regulatory role of the enhancer-associated ncRNA (temporal restriction being related to the rapid degradation of these transcripts after they are synthesized). On the contrary, ncRNAs generated from canonical RNA genes in most cases act at a distance from the production site (e.g. Neat1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Prasanth1">[2]</xref>; even when acting in <italic>cis</italic>, as in the case of Xist and Air, they coat (and functionally affect) broad chromosomal regions, thus in fact exerting an activity that extends far beyond the borders of their site of synthesis.</p>
<p>In this context, it appears very relevant to bring into focus the conceptual and technical problems related to the mechanistic dissection of the ncRNAs generated at regulatory regions. Assessing the functionality of these ncRNAs will require that their specific elimination or depletion be dissociated from any effect on the underlying transcription. Therefore, knocking-in transcriptional terminators to interfere with Pol_II elongation (see for instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Abarrategui1">[11]</xref>) is in fact non-informative in this regard. Depletion of ncRNAs by RNAi efficiently works when applied to stable transcripts encoded by RNA genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Rinn1">[19]</xref>. However, enhancer-generated transcripts are very unstable, possibly due to a constitutive surveillance by the nuclear exosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Wyers1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Preker1">[40]</xref>, leading to their complete degradation or the generation of short RNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Kapranov2">[41]</xref>. Moreover, the role of nascent ncRNAs in targeting to chromatin specific regulators with RNA binding modules (as suggested in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Wang1">[20]</xref>) may be limited to a very short window of opportunity during which proximity to chromatin is maintained, namely the time of Pol_II passage over a specific genomic region. Low level of expression of these ncRNAs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g002">Figure 2</xref>) may reflect the restriction of their activity to the genomic regions where they are synthesized. For both reasons, reducing their levels by RNA interference (before they are degraded or before they exert a local and transient functional activity) may not be feasible, at least using simple tools. On the other hand, for those ncRNAs acting at their site of production, overexpressing them cannot recapitulate their normal function.</p>
<p>A second outstanding question pertains to the identity of the determinants of enhancer association with RNA Pol_II factories and of the molecular mechanisms controlling transcriptional initiation at these regulatory regions. It seems clear that in some cases Pol_II can be loaded at multiple positions along the enhancer/LCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Ling1">[61]</xref>, a result in keeping with the presence of multiple distant CAGE tag clusters at enhancer regions in our dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Still, the directionality of transcription (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) implies a tight control upon formation of the preinitiation complex and rules out the possibility that transcription is a mere consequence of random Pol_II collisions with accessible loci.</p>
<p>A third related question is whether enhancer-associated transcription is mechanistically different from transcription of protein- and RNA-coding genes. This possibility is supported by several observations, including the resistance to the general elongation inhibitor DRB of part of nuclear transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Sehgal1">[43]</xref> and our own data) and, as discussed above, the fact that enhancer associated transcription often initiates at multiple points along the sequence of the enhancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Ling1">[61]</xref>, as if rules for initiation were less stringent at enhancers as compared to protein and RNA genes.</p>
<p>One important aspect of extragenic transcription, and particularly the fraction not associated with putative RNA-coding genes bearing a promoter signature at their 5′ end, is that it should be unambiguously distinguished from the transcriptional noise that may arise from spontaneous collisions of the Pol_II transcriptional machinery with some genomic sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Struhl1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Ponting1">[8]</xref>. A form of noise that has been recently described is represented by waves of transcription extending from highly active immediate early genes (IEGs) into neighboring sequences, including genes and intergenic regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Ebisuya1">[14]</xref>. This “ripple effect” is somehow similar to the inducible extragenic transcription we show here, and therefore it deserves a careful analysis. The interpretation of the authors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Ebisuya1">[14]</xref> is that ripples start from IEGs and extend into the adjacent regions: because of this behavior these Pol_II waves should be considered noise, and specifically the downstream consequence of a strong gene activation that cannot be confined to the limits of the gene itself. It should be noticed that in the system used by Ebisuya et al., namely growth factor stimulation of fibroblasts, IEG induction is extremely fast, with Pol_II peaking in several cases at 10 min after stimulation. Therefore, this system offers limited possibilities to identify complex temporal sequences in the activation of upstream extragenic regions versus associated coding genes. Conversely, the system used in this study has the advantage that genes are induced in a kinetically complex fashion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-RamirezCarrozzi1">[73]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Natoli1">[74]</xref>, in some cases relatively long after the initial stimulation. At genes like Ccl5 and Cxcl11, as well as at several others (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g002">Figure 2</xref>), this kinetic behavior allowed us to identify a recurring temporal pattern in which upstream non-coding transcription not only precedes the induction of the neighboring protein-coding gene but also peaks when the activity of the associated coding gene is hardly detectable (which is similar to what was described at the inducible <italic>fbp1</italic> gene in yeast) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Hirota1">[36]</xref>. Conversely, a ripple effect should parallel RNA Pol_II activity at the associated coding gene and reach maximal levels when the coding gene is at its peak of activity. A second expected feature of a ripple effect is that extragenic waves of Pol_II should show continuity with Pol_II elongating from the inducible coding gene. In our dataset, this is an unusual occurrence (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000384.s001">Figure S1</xref> for examples).</p>
<p>The direct evidence arguing against the possibility that extragenic Pol_II reflects transcriptional noise comes from four groups of data we obtained in this study: (1) the presence of an enhancer-associated chromatin signature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Heintzman1">[52]</xref>, (2) the enrichment for inflammatory TFBSs like NF-kB and the IRFs, (3) the functionality of some tested regions in heterologous reporter assays, and most importantly, (4) the very extensive overlap between sites of extragenic transcription and binding sites for the TF PU.1, which is required for macrophage differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-DeKoter1">[75]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Scott1">[77]</xref> and function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Grove1">[78]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Eichbaum1">[79]</xref>, and very extensively marks enhancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Ghisletti1">[54]</xref>. The only group of extragenic Pol_II peaks (about 8% of the peaks in the dataset) that in principle may represent noise (although it is not possible to formally demonstrate it with our analysis) is the one consisting of regions without an informative chromatin signature: in fact, this group shows levels of sequence conservation that are not significantly different from those of random sequences (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000384-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Overall, we can safely conclude that transcribed extragenic regions with an enhancer-associated chromatin signature represent in most cases sites of highly regulated Pol_II recruitment and elongation, possibly relevant for their function as enhancers.</p>
<p>An additional aspect worthy of attention is that at least in this system extragenic Pol_II peaks are more frequently repressed than induced by stimulation. While in many cases repression correlated with downregulation of the associated genes, in several others it correlated with gene activation of a neighboring gene. A reasonable hypothesis in this case is that, similar to what was described in other models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Martens1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Petruk1">[30]</xref>, extragenic transcription extending into neighboring genes may interfere with their activity: therefore gene induction can occur only when transcription from adjacent extragenic regions is switched off.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the pervasive transcription occurring in mammalian genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Birney1">[1]</xref> is contributed not only by RNA-coding genes but also by a large number of enhancers associated with constitutive or regulated Pol_II transcriptional activity. These data are relevant for functional genomic annotations and at the same time indicate that Pol_II-dependent transcription is integral to the activity of a fraction of functional <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements.</p>

The H3K4me1 and PU.1 datasets are described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000384-Ghisletti1">[54]</xref>. Briefly, the RNA Pol_II ChIP-Seq experiment was carried out in unstimulated and LPS+γIFN-stimulated (2 h) macrophages using an antibody recognizing all isoforms of the large Pol_II subunit, Rbp1 (Santa Cruz <italic>sc</italic>-899). The Ser5-Pol II ChIP-Seq datasets were generated using the Ab5131 antibody from Abcam, which recognizes the RNA Pol_II CTD repeat YSPT(phospho)SPS. The H3K4me3, H3K4me1, and PU.1 datasets used in this study were all obtained in unstimulated cells, and antibodies were from Abcam (H3K4me3, Ab8580; H3K4me1, Ab8895) or Santa Cruz (PU.1 <italic>sc</italic>-352). Datasets are available for download from NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo</ext-link>), accession numbers GSE17631, GSE19553, GSE19991.</p>

<title>RNA Sequencing</title>
<p>Nuclei were isolated as described in the section below and total nuclear RNA was extracted using Trizol. After quality control, RNA was processed following the same standard Solexa protocol recommended for mRNA sequencing. The dataset is available for download from GEO, accession number GSE20370.</p>

<title>Quantitative RT-PCR and Nascent Transcript Analysis</title>
<p>RNA was extracted from macrophages using Trizol (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed with random hexamers. In some experiments oligo-dT or gene specific oligonucleotides were used to prime the reverse transcription, as indicated in the text. For isolation of nascent transcripts, cells were lysed in HB buffer (10% glycerol, 60 mM KCl, 15 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 0.5 mM EDTA) containing 0.3 M sucrose and 0.8% NP40. Nuclei were then pelleted through a 0.9 M sucrose cushion in HB buffer and then resuspended in 100 µl of NRB (75 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 50% glycerol, 100 µg/ml yeast tRNA); lysis was carried out by addition of 750 µl of NLB (0.3 M NaCl, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 0.2 mM EDTA, 7.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 M urea, 1% NP-40, 100 µg/ml yeast tRNA). Chromatin was then pelleted in microfuge at 4°C and nascent transcripts extracted in Trizol. As control of the lack of genomic DNA contamination, Q-PCR was also carried out on RNA that was not reverse-transcribed. The sequences of the primers used are in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000384.s015">Tables S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000384.s017">S9</xref>.</p>
