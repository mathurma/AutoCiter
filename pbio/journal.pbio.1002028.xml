<p>Studies of tRNA synthetases that adapted to assist the splicing of group I introns provide insight into how proteins can evolve new RNA-binding functions.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>The <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (mtTyrRS; CYT-18 protein) evolved a new function as a group I intron splicing factor by acquiring the ability to bind group I intron RNAs and stabilize their catalytically active RNA structure. Previous studies showed: (i) CYT-18 binds group I introns by using both its N-terminal catalytic domain and flexibly attached C-terminal anticodon-binding domain (CTD); and (ii) the catalytic domain binds group I introns specifically via multiple structural adaptations that occurred during or after the divergence of Peziomycotina and Saccharomycotina. However, the function of the CTD and how it contributed to the evolution of splicing activity have been unclear. Here, small angle X-ray scattering analysis of CYT-18 shows that both CTDs of the homodimeric protein extend outward from the catalytic domain, but move inward to bind opposite ends of a group I intron RNA. Biochemical assays show that the isolated CTD of CYT-18 binds RNAs non-specifically, possibly contributing to its interaction with the structurally different ends of the intron RNA. Finally, we find that the yeast mtTyrRS, which diverged from Pezizomycotina fungal mtTyrRSs prior to the evolution of splicing activity, binds group I intron and other RNAs non-specifically via its CTD, but lacks further adaptations needed for group I intron splicing. Our results suggest a scenario of constructive neutral (i.e., pre-adaptive) evolution in which an initial non-specific interaction between the CTD of an ancestral fungal mtTyrRS and a self-splicing group I intron was “fixed” by an intron RNA mutation that resulted in protein-dependent splicing. Once fixed, this interaction could be elaborated by further adaptive mutations in both the catalytic domain and CTD that enabled specific binding of group I introns. Our results highlight a role for non-specific RNA binding in the evolution of RNA-binding proteins.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The acquisition of new modes of post-transcriptional gene regulation played an important role in the evolution of eukaryotes and was achieved by an increase in the number of RNA-binding proteins with new functions. RNA-binding proteins bind directly to double- or single-stranded RNA and regulate many cellular processes. Here, we address how proteins evolve new RNA-binding functions by using as a model system a fungal mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase that evolved to acquire a novel function in splicing group I introns. Group I introns are RNA enzymes (or “ribozymes”) that catalyze their own removal from transcripts, but can become dependent upon proteins to stabilize their active structure. We show that the C-terminal domain of the synthetase is flexibly attached and has high non-specific RNA-binding activity that likely pre-dated the evolution of splicing activity. Our findings suggest an evolutionary scenario in which an initial non-specific interaction between an ancestral synthetase and a self-splicing group I intron was fixed by an intron RNA mutation, thereby making it dependent upon the protein for structural stabilization. The interaction then evolved by the acquisition of adaptive mutations throughout the protein and RNA that increased both the splicing efficiency and its protein-dependence. Our results suggest a general mechanism by which non-specific binding interactions can lead to the evolution of new RNA-binding functions and provide novel insights into splicing and synthetase mechanisms.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>RNA-binding proteins play critical roles in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in all domains of life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Hall1">[1]</xref>. However, the complexity of this regulation is far greater in eukaryotes than in prokaryotes, reflecting both the larger number of RNAs requiring regulation and the evolution of new RNA processing and regulatory mechanisms. The latter include extensive RNA splicing and alternative splicing to produce different protein isoforms; an increased importance of RNA localization in larger and more complex eukaryotic cells; nonsense-mediated decay to prevent translation of intron-containing RNAs; and combinatorial regulation of mRNA translation and stability by RNA-binding proteins and miRNAs acting in ribonucleoprotein complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Martin1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Gurtan1">[5]</xref>. These new modes of post-transcriptional regulation necessitated and were enabled by corresponding increases in the number and diversity of RNA-binding proteins and the evolution of new RNA-binding functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Hogan1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Glisovic1">[6]</xref>. Thus far, however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of new RNA-binding functions have remained unclear.</p>
<p>Cellular proteins that adapted to splice autocatalytic group I and group II introns provide powerful model systems for investigating how proteins evolve new RNA-binding functions. Group I and group II introns are found in prokaryotes and in the mitochondrial (mt) and chloroplast DNAs of some eukaryotes, with group I introns also found in the nuclear rRNA genes of certain fungi and protozoa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Cannone1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Haugen1">[8]</xref>. Both types of introns are ribozymes that catalyze their own splicing as well as mobile genetic elements that can be horizontally transferred to different hosts where they propagate by inserting into new genomic sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Lambowitz1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Belfort1">[10]</xref>. Although some group I and II introns self-splice <italic>in vitro</italic>, most have acquired mutations that impair formation of a catalytically active RNA structure, necessitating the recruitment of cellular proteins to promote RNA folding for efficient splicing <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Lambowitz2">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Vicens1">[12]</xref>. These group I and group II intron splicing factors include both host-encoded proteins, such as aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) and translation factors, and intron-encoded proteins, such as DNA endonuclease and reverse transcriptases, that evolved secondarily to function in RNA splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Lambowitz2">[11]</xref>. Such co-option of pre-existing proteins to function in splicing is pertinent to the evolution of splicing mechanisms in higher organisms, as emphasized by recent findings that a key spliceosomal protein, Prp8, was derived from a group II intron-like reverse transcriptase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Dlaki1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Galej1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>One of the most extensively studied examples of a cellular protein that evolved to function in RNA splicing is the <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> mtTyrRS (CYT-18 protein), which acts as a splicing factor for mt group I introns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Mannella1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Wallweber1">[18]</xref>. Biochemical and structural studies showed that CYT-18 functions in splicing by recognizing and stabilizing the conserved phosphodiester backbone structure of group I intron RNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Guo1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Paukstelis1">[22]</xref>. This splicing function has been found only for those mtTyrRS of fungi belonging to the subphylum Pezizomycotina and can be traced to a series of structural adaptations of the protein that were acquired during or after the divergence of Pezizomycotina from Saccharomycotina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Paukstelis2">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>CYT-18 and other mtTyrRSs are class 1 aaRSs that are closely related to bacterial TyrRSs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Eriani1">[24]</xref>. They consist of an N-terminal catalytic domain, which binds the acceptor stem of tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>, followed by an intermediate α-helical domain and a C-terminal anticodon-binding domain (CTD), which bind the anticodon and variable arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002028-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>; the catalytic and intermediate α-helical domains together are denoted the N-terminal domains or NTDs). Like its bacterial counterparts, CYT-18 functions as a homodimer, with each dimer binding either one molecule of tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> or group I intron RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Jakes1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Yaremchuk1">[28]</xref>. CYT-18 binds group I introns by using both its N-terminal catalytic domain and CTD, but only some introns require the CTD for RNA splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Kittle1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Chen1">[31]</xref>.</p>

<p>(A) Schematic of a CYT-18 homodimer. CYT-18 consists of N-terminal catalytic and α-helical domains (NTDs, blue) that are connected via a flexible linker to a CTD (red). The protein dimerizes via interactions between the catalytic domains. (B) Domain architecture of the <italic>N. crassa</italic> (Nc), <italic>A. nidulans</italic> (An), and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (Sc) mtTyrRS compared to <italic>E. coli</italic> (Ec) TyrRS. The mitochondrial targeting sequence (MT) and C-terminal extension (C-tail) are in white, and Pezizomycotina-specific insertions in the NTD and CTD are highlighted with blue and red diagonal stripes, respectively. Insertions in the Sc mtTyrRS relative to <italic>E. coli</italic> TyrRS are indicated in gray and are not homologous to the Pezizomycotina insertions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Paukstelis2">[23]</xref>. (C) CYT-18 protein constructs used in this study. The wild-type CYT-18 protein corresponds to the full-length mature protein lacking the mitochondrial targeting sequence. CYT-18* additionally lacks most of the non-essential C-tail and ends nine residues after Ins 5 (residue 583) to match the short C-tail of the <italic>A. nidulans</italic> mtTyrRS for which an NMR structure was determined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Paukstelis4">[37]</xref>. CYT-18 NTDs contains the N-terminal catalytic and α-helical domains and lacks both the CTD and C-tail. The CTD construct begins with a few residues of the flexible linker (Ins 3) and ends at the same position as CYT-18*.</p>

<p>Both the N-terminal catalytic domain and CTD of Pezizomycotinia mtTyrRSs have distinctive structural adaptations that are absent in non-splicing mtTyrRSs, including the closely related Saccharomycotina mtTyrRSs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Paukstelis2">[23]</xref>. These structural adaptations include a small N-terminal α-helical extension (denoted H0) and a series of small insertions (Ins 1–5), whose presence correlates with RNA splicing activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002028-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Cherniack1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Paukstelis3">[33]</xref>. The Pezizomycotina mtTyrRS also have a non-essential C-terminal tail of variable length (C-tail; 13–152 amino acids) appended to the CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Kittle1">[29]</xref> and this work).</p>
<p>Structural studies, including a co-crystal structure of a splicing-active CYT-18 protein lacking the CTD (here denoted CYT-18 NTDs) bound to a group I intron RNA (the bacteriophage Twort <italic>orf</italic>142-I2 ribozyme), provided insight into group I intron binding by the N-terminal catalytic domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Paukstelis1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Paukstelis3">[33]</xref>. These studies showed that CYT-18 binds group I introns asymmetrically across the two subunits of the homodimer by using a newly evolved group I intron-binding surface on the side of the catalytic domain opposite that which binds tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>. This new RNA-binding surface includes the N-terminal extension H0, Ins 1, and Ins 2 and provides an extended scaffold for the conserved phosphodiester backbone structure of the group I intron catalytic core.</p>
<p>The CYT-18 constructs used for crystallography lacked the flexibly attached CTD, which has been problematic for X-ray crystallography of TyrRSs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Paukstelis3">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Kobayashi1">[36]</xref>. Recently, we determined an NMR structure of the isolated CTD of the splicing-active <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> mtTyrRS, which is closely related to CYT-18 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Paukstelis4">[37]</xref>. The structure showed that the mtTyrRS CTD resembles those of bacterial TyrRSs in having a fold similar to that of bacterial ribosomal protein S4, but with novel structural features. The latter include three Pezizomycotina-specific insertions (Ins 3–5), with Ins 3 corresponding to an expansion of the flexible linker between the NTDs and CTD. Modeling of the NMR structure onto the CYT-18 NTDs+Twort co-crystal structure using distance constraints from directed hydroxyl-radical cleavage assays suggested that the two CTDs of the homodimeric protein bind opposite ends of a group I intron RNA. This model requires that the CTD of one subunit of the CYT-18 homodimer undergo a large shift on its flexible linker to interact with either tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> or the group I intron RNA bound on opposite sides of the catalytic domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Paukstelis4">[37]</xref>. Thus far, however, there has been no structural data for a CYT-18 protein that contains both the NTDs and CTD, and the role of the CTD in promoting group I intron splicing has remained unclear.</p>
<p>CYT-18 has been used as a model for the theory of constructive neutral evolution (referred to here as “pre-adaptive evolution”). This theory holds that complex multi-protein or RNP complexes arise by a “ratchet-like process” in which a pre-existing neutral or mildly deleterious interaction is “fixed” by a mutation in one partner that makes it dependent upon the other to perform a biological function. Once fixed, this dependence can be further elaborated by adaptive changes in both partners, which increase reaction efficiency and co-dependence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Covello1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Lynch1">[40]</xref>. In the case of CYT-18, this hypothesis suggests that an ancestral non-splicing fungal mtTyrRS had a pre-existing ability to bind group I introns, which became fixed when the intron RNA acquired mutations that impaired self-splicing, resulting in dependence upon the bound protein for structural stabilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Lambowitz2">[11]</xref>. After the interaction was fixed, further adaptive mutations in both the RNA and protein increased both the efficiency of RNA splicing and its protein-dependence. Early studies suggesting that CYT-18 recognized tRNA-like structural features of group I intron RNAs were cited as a prime example of a pre-adaptive interaction leading to the evolution of a new RNA-splicing function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Stoltzfus1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Gray1">[41]</xref>. However, subsequent findings that CYT-18's N-terminal catalytic domain binds group I introns specifically by using a separate non-tRNA-binding surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Paukstelis1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Paukstelis3">[33]</xref> made the nature of the initial non-adaptive interaction unclear.</p>
<p>Here, we used small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and biofchemical assays to investigate the solution structures of full-length CYT-18 protein and its CTDs and their mode of interaction with group I intron RNAs. The SAXS analysis shows that the CTDs of both subunits of the CYT-18 homodimer extend outward from the NTDs, but move inward to bind opposite ends of the group I intron RNA. Surprisingly, we find that the CTD of CYT-18 has a high non-specific RNA binding affinity, which may contribute to its interaction with group I intron RNAs, and that the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (yeast) mtTyrRS, which diverged prior to the evolution of splicing activity, can also bind intron RNAs non-specifically via its CTD. Finally, experiments with chimeric proteins show that the yeast CTD can replace CYT-18's to promote aminoacylation but not group I intron splicing. Our results suggest a scenario of pre-adaptive evolution in which the initial non-adaptive interaction between an ancestral mtTyrRS and group I intron RNA was non-specific binding by the CTD and highlight a role for non-specific binding in the evolution of new RNA-binding functions.</p>

<title>SAXS Analysis of CYT-18 and Its CTD</title>
<p>First, we used SAXS to investigate the conformational changes of CYT-18 and the position of its CTDs in the absence and presence of a group I intron RNA. Scattering data were collected for three CYT-18 constructs: CYT-18*, a wild-type protein truncated to delete most of the non-essential C-tail in order to simplify modeling and analysis; CYT-18 NTDs, which contains the N-terminal catalytic and α-helical domains, but lacks both the CTD and C-tail; and CTD, the isolated C-terminal anticodon-binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002028-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). CYT-18* is fully active in tyrosyl-adenylation, which measures the number of TyrRS active sites, and it functions similarly to full-length CYT-18 both in aminoacylation of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>, a standard substrate for this protein, and in splicing the <italic>N. crassa</italic> mt large subunit rRNA (Nc mt LSU) intron, which requires a functional CTD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002028.s002">Figure S1</xref>). The CYT-18 NTDs construct is also fully active in tyrosyl-adenylation, but cannot aminoacylate tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> as expected because of the lack of the CTD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002028.s002">Figure S1A and S1B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Mohr2">[30]</xref>.</p>

<p>The SAXS data for the isolated CTD overlays well with a theoretical scattering curve calculated from a homology model of CYT-18's CTD constructed from the NMR structure of the <italic>A. nidulan</italic> CTD using I-TASSER (χ = 2.8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002028-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, middle curve) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Roy1">[47]</xref>. The molecular weight of 13.3 kDa estimated from the scattering data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1002028-t001">Table 1</xref>) indicates that the CTD is monomeric in solution. The <italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub> and <italic>D</italic><sub>max</sub> values for the CTD calculated from the SAXS data (17.7 and 62 Å, respectively) are in good agreement with those for the I-TASSER model (17.0 and 55.9 Å, respectively) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1002028-t001">Table 1</xref>). The DAMMIN and GASBOR models of the CYT-18 CTD (χ = 1.7 and 2.2, respectively) also superpose well with the homology model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002028-g002">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002028.s004">Figure S3</xref>, respectively). Thus, the SAXS analysis indicates that the CYT-18 CTD folds independently of the remainder of the protein and that the I-TASSER model provides a good representation of the structure of the CYT-18 CTD in solution. The latter finding validates the use of the I-TASSER model in building high-resolution structures of CYT-18* from the SAXS data (see below).</p>
<p>CYT-18* is the first CYT-18 protein to be investigated structurally that contains both the NTDs and CTD. The molecular weight for this protein estimated from the SAXS data is 119 kDa, confirming that CYT-18* is a dimer in solution (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1002028-t001">Table 1</xref>). The <italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub> and <italic>D</italic><sub>max</sub> values from the CYT-18* scattering data are 46.9 and 170 Å, respectively, both larger than that for the CYT-18 NTDs, as expected. <italic>Ab initio</italic> models of the CYT-18* homodimer indicate an open conformation with both CTDs extending outward from the NTDs (χ = 1.5 and 2.1 for the DAMMIN and GASBOR models, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002028-g002">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002028.s004">S3</xref>). A rigid-body model of CYT-18* was also built by CORAL, which constructs models that fit the SAXS data by combining high-resolution models of individual components, in this case the crystal structure of the CYT-18 NTDs and the I-TASSER model of the CTD (see above), with different conformations of flexible dummy residue linkers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Petoukhov2">[48]</xref>. The CORAL model overlays well with the scattering curve (χ = 1.8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002028-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, bottom curve) and superposes well into the SAXS envelopes of the <italic>ab initio</italic> models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002028-g002">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002028.s004">S3</xref>). These findings indicate that in the absence of intron RNA, CYT-18* adopts an S-shaped configuration with the two CTDs of the homodimer extending outward in opposite orientations.</p>

<title>CYT-18 Forms a Compact Structure When Bound to a Group I Intron RNA</title>
<p>The co-crystal structure of the CYT-18 NTDs bound to Twort intron RNA indicated that the RNA binds asymmetrically across the dimer interface and that the structure of the NTDs does not change substantially upon binding the intron RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Paukstelis1">[22]</xref>. To elucidate interacting regions and conformational changes of the CTDs upon binding to the intron RNA, we obtained SAXS data for complexes of both the CYT-18 NTDs and CYT-18* bound to the same Twort group I intron RNA. The experimental scattering curve of the CYT-18 NTDs+Twort RNA complex overlays reasonably well with the scattering curve calculated from the co-crystal structure (χ = 4.4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002028-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, top curve), and gave <italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub> and <italic>D</italic><sub>max</sub> values (39.2 and 137 Å, respectively) in agreement with those calculated from the co-crystal structure (39.1 and 134 Å, respectively) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1002028-t001">Table 1</xref>). Likewise, a rigid-body model of the CYT-18 NTDs+Twort RNA complex built using CORAL shows a good fit to the experimental SAXS curve (χ = 2.2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002028-g003">Figure 3B</xref>; top curve) and is similar in shape to the co-crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002028-g003">Figures 3A and 3B</xref>, compare insets above the top curves). These findings indicate that the CYT-18 NTDs+Twort RNA co-crystal structure is similar to the structure of the complex in solution and can be used as a component for structural modeling of the CYT-18*+Twort RNA complex from the SAXS data.</p>

<p>Finally, the scattering data for the Twort RNA complex with CYT-18*, which contains both the NTDs and CTD, gave <italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub> and <italic>D</italic><sub>max</sub> values of 41.9 Å and 146 Å, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002028-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, bottom curve; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1002028-t001">Table 1</xref>). The relatively small difference between these values and those for the CYT-18 NTDs+Twort complex (<italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub> and <italic>D</italic><sub>max</sub> values of 39.2 Å and 137 Å, respectively; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1002028-t001">Table 1</xref>) suggests that CYT-18* forms a compact complex with the RNA in which the CTDs make a smaller than expected contribution to the overall particle dimensions. This conclusion was supported by ensemble optimization analysis using the program EOM, which generates a large random pool of conformations and picks an optimized ensemble that best fits the scattering data (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). This optimized ensemble pool displayed a smaller, tighter range of <italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub> and <italic>D</italic><sub>max</sub> values than a random pool of protein-RNA conformations consistent with a compact rigid complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002028.s005">Figure S4</xref>).</p>
<p>A rigid-body model of the CYT-18*+Twort RNA complex built using CORAL indicates that both CTDs are positioned near the Twort intron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002028-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). This CORAL model can be compared to a previous model of CYT-18*+Twort built using biochemical data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002028-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Paukstelis4">[37]</xref>. While both the CORAL and biochemical models show that both CTDs are located near the intron RNA, the CORAL model better fits to the scattering data than does the biochemical model (χ = 3.2 and 8.8, respectively). In both models, the CTD of one subunit of the CYT-18 homodimer is close to and may interact with P2, P6–P6a, and P8 of the intron RNA, while the CTD of the other subunit is close to and may interact with P4–P5, and P9 of the intron RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002028-g003">Figure 3C and 3D</xref>). Considered together, the SAXS analyses indicate that upon binding a group I intron RNA, CYT-18* forms a compact complex in which both CTDs of the CYT-18 homodimer clamp down to interact with opposite ends of the group I intron RNA.</p>

At both temperatures, the strongest binding group I intron RNA was the Nc <italic>ND1</italic>m intron and the weakest was the Nc mt LSU intron, consistent with previous findings that the CTD is required for tight binding and splicing of the Nc mt LSU, but not the Nc <italic>ND</italic>1m intron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Mohr2">[30]</xref>. At 25°C, the CYT-18 NTDs bound the Ll.LtrB group II intron RNA with a <italic>K</italic><sub>1/2</sub> = 240 nM, within the range of <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>s for group I intron RNAs, but the binding curve was sigmoidal, with <italic>n</italic> = 1.6, suggesting cooperative and possibly non-specific binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002028-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), whereas at 37°C, binding of the group II intron RNA was weaker (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 440 nM) and the binding curve was hyperbolic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002028.s006">Figure S5D</xref>).

<p>Surprisingly, the isolated CYT-18 CTD bound group I and II intron RNAs and poly(U)<sub>30</sub> more strongly than did the CYT-18 NTDs and with similar affinities for all five RNAs tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002028-g004">Figure 4</xref>).

These sigmoidal binding curves (<italic>i.e.</italic>, Hill coefficients (<italic>n</italic>)&gt;1) suggest cooperative binding of two or more CTDs to each RNA. The ability of the isolated CTD to bind similarly to group I and II intron RNAs, as well as unstructured poly(U)<sub>30</sub> indicates that it is a non-specific RNA binding domain.</p>

<title>The Non-splicing <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mtTyrRS Binds Group I Introns Non-specifically Via Its CTD</title>
<p>The finding that the CYT-18 CTD is a non-specific RNA-binding domain led us to wonder whether an ancestral Pezizomycotina mtTyrRS might have initially bound group I intron RNAs non-specifically. To address this question, we turned to the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (Sc) mtTyrRS, which is closely related to CYT-18 but branched from the Pezizomycotina mtTyrRSs prior to the evolution of splicing activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Paukstelis2">[23]</xref>. We compared two constructs that were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>: recombinant wild-type Sc mtTyrRS and a derivative lacking the CTD (Sc NTDs). We confirmed that both proteins are fully active in tyrosyl-adenylation, indicating correct folding of the catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002028.s002">Figure S1A</xref>). Aminoacylation assays showed that the Sc mtTyrRS has higher activity with <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> than does CYT-18 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002028.s002">Figure S1B</xref>), possibly reflecting that the <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> and the Sc mt tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> are more similar to each other than to the Nc mt tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>. All three tyrosyl-tRNAs share the same N73 identity element (A73) and anticodon, but differ in the N1-N72 identity element at the end of the acceptor stem (G-C in <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> and Sc mt tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>, but A-U in Nc mt tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>) and the length of the variable arm (13–14 nt in <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> and Sc mt tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>, but unusually long at 16 nt in Nc mt tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002028.s007">Figure S6</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Goodman1">[49]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Sibler1">[51]</xref>.</p>
<p>Equilibrium binding assays showed that the Sc mtTyrRS, although incapable of splicing group I intron RNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Paukstelis2">[23]</xref>, can bind both the Nc mt LSU group I intron RNA and Ll.LtrB group II intron RNA with <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>s = 430 and 440 nM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002028-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>), within the range of <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>s for specific binding of CYT-18 NTDs to group I intron RNAs (see above). However, the similar affinity of the Sc mtTyrRS for the group I and group II intron RNAs suggests that this binding is non-specific. Strikingly, the ability of the Sc mtTyrRS to bind group I and II intron RNAs was entirely dependent upon its CTD, with the Sc NTDs protein showing no detectable binding of either intron RNA over the concentration range tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002028-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>).</p>

<p>To investigate if the Sc mtTyrRS CTD is a non-specific RNA-binding domain like CYT-18's CTD, we expressed and purified this domain separately including a small segment of the upstream linker region (denoted Sc CTD). We then assayed equilibrium binding of the Sc CTD to three group I introns (Nc mt LSU, Nc <italic>ND1</italic>m and Twort), a group II intron (Ll.LtrB), and poly(U)<sub>30</sub> at 25°C.

The Sc CTD had the highest affinity for the Ll.LtrB group II intron RNA (<italic>K</italic><sub>1/2</sub> = 110 nM), which it bound in a cooperative manner (<italic>n</italic> = 1.8), and the lowest affinity for poly(U)<sub>30</sub> (<italic>K</italic><sub>1/2</sub> = 1 µM; <italic>n</italic> = 1.6). Notably, for all RNAs tested, the non-specific binding by the isolated Sc mtTyrRS CTD is 1.5- to 15-fold weaker than the binding of CYT-18's CTD to the same RNA (<italic>K</italic><sub>1/2</sub>s at 25°C = 57–64 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002028-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Together, these findings indicate that the CTD of the Sc mtTyrRS is also a non-specific RNA-binding domain and that the Sc mtTyrRS binds both group I and group II intron RNAs non-specifically via its CTD.</p>

<title>Splicing Properties of CYT-18/Sc mtTyrRS Chimeric Proteins</title>
<p>Finally, we investigated whether the Sc CTD could replace the CYT-18 CTD to promote group I intron splicing by making CYT-18/Sc mtTyrRS chimeric proteins. Two chimeric constructs were made differing in whether they contain the flexible linker region from CYT-18 or the Sc mtTyrRS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002028-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Chimera 1 consists of the CYT-18 catalytic and α-helical domains fused to the Sc CTD via the Sc mtTyrRS linker region, whereas chimera 2 contains the same CYT-18 NTDs fused to the Sc CTD via the CYT-18 linker, which includes Ins 3. Both chimeric proteins showed tyrosyl-adenylation activity similar to wild-type CYT-18, but displayed differences in aminoacylation activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002028-g007">Figure 7A and 7B</xref>). Chimera 1, which contains both the Sc mtTyrRS linker and CTD, is similar to the yeast Sc mtTyrRS in having higher aminoacylation activity with <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> than does CYT-18, likely due to its better recognition of the bacterial tRNA (see above). By contrast, chimera 2, which contains the CYT-18 linker followed by the yeast mtTyrRS CTD, has substantially lower aminoacylation activity than CYT-18, indicating that the CYT-18 linker impairs charging of <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>. The findings for chimera 1 indicate that higher TyrRS activity with <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> correlates with presence of the yeast CTD and linker, regions of the TyrRS that recognize the tRNA variable arm and anticodon stem, and not with the catalytic domain, which recognizes the acceptor stem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Carter1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Yaremchuk1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Quinn1">[52]</xref>.

<p>To determine whether the Sc mtTyrRS CTD could function in splicing, we compared the ability of the chimeric proteins to splice the Nc mt LSU and <italic>ND1</italic>m group I introns, which do and do not require the CTD for splicing, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Mohr2">[30]</xref>.

The ability of the chimeric proteins to splice the Nc mt LSU and <italic>ND1</italic>m group I introns was assayed by using 200 nM <sup>32</sup>P-labeled precursor RNA containing the introns, 100 nM protein, and unlabeled GTP at three different temperatures (25°C, 30°C, and 37°C) at either 100 mM KCl (the standard condition for CYT-18) or a lower salt concentration, 25 mM KCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002028-g007">Figures 7C–7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002028.s008">S7A, and S7B</xref>). The assays showed that the chimeric proteins could splice the Nc <italic>ND1m</italic> intron, which does not require the CTD, but could not splice the Nc mt LSU intron, which requires the CTD, under all conditions examined. The inability of the chimeric proteins to splice the Nc mt LSU intron was additionally confirmed by splicing assays done with higher protein concentration (500 nM; protein excess conditions) to compensate for potentially weaker binding of the intron RNA by the Sc CTD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002028.s008">Figure S7C</xref>), and by using a more sensitive assay in which [α-<sup>32</sup>P]GTP is incubated with unlabeled precursor RNA to label the 5′ end of the intron RNA during the first step of splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002028-g007">Figures 7G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002028.s008">S7D</xref>).</p>
<p>Notably, although the chimeric proteins were capable of splicing the <italic>ND1</italic>m intron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002028-g007">Figures 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002028.s008">S7B</xref>), they did so at a slower rate than full-length CYT-18, with the rate decreasing further at higher salt conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002028-g007">Figure 7E and 7F</xref>). The slower rate of <italic>ND1</italic>m intron splicing by the chimeric proteins is similar to that found previously for the CYT-18 NTDs alone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Mohr2">[30]</xref>, suggesting that it reflects a lack of contributing but nonessential interactions with the CTD. Interestingly, chimera 2 has higher splicing activity with the <italic>ND1</italic>m intron than does chimera 1, the reverse of what was found for TyrRS activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002028-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). This finding suggests that the longer CYT-18-linker region, which is present in chimera 2 but not chimera 1, contributes to splicing activity. This contribution could involve either specific or non-specific interaction of Ins 3 with the group I intron RNA or increased conformational flexibility of the CTD due to expansion of the linker. Considered together, the findings for chimera 1 and chimera 2 indicate that although both the Sc mtTyrRS and CYT-18 CTDs bind group I intron RNAs non-specifically, the Sc CTD lacks further adaptations required for group I intron splicing activity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results provide insight into the function of CYT-18's CTD and its contribution to the evolution of group I intron splicing activity, highlighting a role for non-specific binding interactions in the evolution of new RNA-binding functions. First, the SAXS analysis indicates that the CTDs of both subunits of the CYT-18 homodimer have a preferred orientation in solution extending outward in opposite directions from the NTDs, but move inward to bind opposite ends of a group I intron RNA. The CORAL model of CYT-18* bound to Twort intron RNA based on the SAXS data suggests that the CTD of one subunit binds the intron near P2, P6–P6a, and P8, while the CTD of the other subunit likely interacts with P4–P5 and P9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002028-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). These interaction sites agree with a previous biochemical model based on directed hydroxyl-radical cleavage assays in which Fe-EPD with a cleavage radius of 25 Å was conjugated at two sites in the CTD (G493C and C494) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Paukstelis4">[37]</xref>. These assays found cleavage sites in P6–P6a, P3–P8, and P5 in the Nc <italic>ND1</italic>m intron and P2, P4, and P6–P6a in the Nc mt LSU intron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Paukstelis4">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Myers1">[54]</xref>. The additional cleavages in the Nc mt LSU intron P2 helix, which is considerably longer than P2 of the Twort or Nc <italic>ND1</italic> introns, are consistent with its proximity to P8. The putative interaction sites between the CTDs and intron RNA in our CORAL model are also consistent with genetic experiments showing that CTD binding can suppress intron RNA mutations that impair long-range tertiary interactions P5-L9 and P2-L8 on opposite ends of the intron RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Chen1">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>The relatively fixed orientation of the CTDs in the free CYT-18 protein agrees with previous <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H- two-dimensional NMR analysis showing that the CTDs of the full-length <italic>A. nidulans</italic> mt and <italic>Geobacillus stearothermophilus</italic> TyrRSs do not tumble independently in solution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Paukstelis4">[37]</xref>. Nevertheless, the linker must be sufficiently flexible to allow the CTDs to bind to group I introns or tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> on opposite sides of the catalytic domain, and the SAXS analysis provides the first direct evidence for this conformational flexibility by showing the two CTDs of the homodimer swing downward from their starting position in the free protein to interact with different regions of a group I intron RNA.</p>
<p>We were surprised to find that the CTDs of both CYT-18 and the non-splicing yeast mtTyrRS are non-specific RNA-binding domains. The isolated CTDs of both proteins bind structured group I and group II intron RNAs, or the simple homopolymer, poly(U)<sub>30</sub> with similar affinities, with this non-specific binding 1.5- to 15-fold stronger for the CYT-18 CTD than the yeast mtTyrRS CTD (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>). The non-specific RNA-binding activity of the TyrRS CTDs may contribute to its function in aminoacylation by augmenting its specific-binding interactions with tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>, which include recognition of the variable arm and anticodon bases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Yaremchuk1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Bedouelle1">[55]</xref>. Likewise, the high non-specific binding activity of the CYT-18 CTD does not preclude and may bolster specific-binding interactions of this domain with group I intron RNAs. The latter could result either from further adaptive evolution of the CTD or simply from positioning of the CTD on the intron RNA via specific binding of the NTDs.</p>
<p>Although non-specific RNA binding was unexpected for an aaRS domain involved in tRNA recognition, yeast and higher eukaryotic aaRSs have been shown previously to have appended non-specific RNA-binding domains that are not present in their bacterial counterparts and contribute to aminoacylation efficiency. Thus, the yeast glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS) has an N-terminal non-specific RNA binding domain, which when fused to a bacterial GlnRS enabled it to functionally replace the yeast enzyme <italic>in vivo</italic>, as did fusion of the yeast Arc1 protein, a non-specific RNA-binding protein that ordinarily helps mediate tRNA/aaRS interactions in <italic>trans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Whelihan1">[56]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Wang1">[57]</xref>. Similarly, some higher eukaryotic aaRSs have tandem repeats of a small non-specific RNA-binding motif that enhances tRNA binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Cahuzac1">[58]</xref>. These non-specific RNA-binding domains are thought to act by adding sufficient binding energy to compensate for relatively weak specific binding interactions of aaRSs with tRNA substrates, similar to the augmentation of specific binding of tRNA and intron RNA substrates suggested above for the TyrRS CTD.</p>
<p>Notably, the ribosomal protein S4-like fold, which forms the core of bacterial and mitochondrial TyrRS CTDs, has been identified previously as an ancient RNA-binding domain. This domain is found in all three kingdoms of life in a variety of proteins that bind structurally different RNAs, including two families of pseudouridine synthetases, a family of predicted RNA methylases, an RNA-modification enzyme with both pseudouridine synthetase and cytidine deaminase activity, threonyl-tRNA synthetases, and a heat-shock protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Aravind1">[59]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Staker1">[61]</xref>. The S4-like fold consists of two α-helices arranged as a helical hairpin packed against three or four β-sheets. Connecting two of the β-sheets is a characteristic L-shaped loop, which together with the two α-helices is termed the αL motif. This motif generally contains clusters of basic and polar residues that are capable of interacting with various nucleic acid substrates in the different S4-like fold containing proteins. In TyrRSs, the αL motif interacts in a region between the variable and anticodon arms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Staker1">[61]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Volpon1">[62]</xref>. We suggest that the inherently high non-specific RNA-binding affinity of the S4-like fold was the key factor enabling it to evolve interactions with different RNA substrates in the course of evolution. Indeed, the fungal mtTyrRSs provide a dramatic example of a case in which the S4-like fold of a single enzyme may bolster specific-binding interactions with three different regions of two different RNA substrates, a mt tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> and a group I intron RNA.</p>
<p>Although we suggest that the non-specific binding of the CTD played a key role in initial interaction with group I intron RNAs, the CTDs of present-day fungal mtTyrRS appear to have evolved specific interactions with group I intron RNAs. Thus chimeric proteins containing the CYT-18 NTDs linked to the yeast CTD can efficiently aminoacylate <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>, as well as splice the Nc <italic>ND1</italic> intron, which requires only the NTDs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Mohr2">[30]</xref>. However, the chimeric proteins splice the Nc <italic>ND1m</italic> intron less efficiently than full-length CYT-18 at a rate expected for loss of contributing CTD interactions, and they are unable to splice the Nc mt LSU intron, which requires the CTD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Mohr2">[30]</xref>. Additional adaptations of the CYT-18 CTD required to promote splicing may include RNA-binding contacts by Ins 3–5, which are found in the CTDs of splicing-competent Pezizomycotina mtTyrRS, but not in the Sc mtTyrRS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Paukstelis4">[37]</xref>. Both the previous biochemical model of CYT-18*+Twort <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Paukstelis4">[37]</xref> and the new CORAL model based on the SAXS data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002028-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) place Ins 4 and 5 in position to bind group I intron RNAs.</p>
<p>Since the discovery of the splicing function of CYT-18 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Akins1">[17]</xref>, there have been numerous additional examples of aaRSs that have acquired new functions unrelated to translation, in most cases via addition of non-catalytic domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Guo2">[63]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Smirnova1">[64]</xref>. The acquisition of these new domains and functions is thought to reflect that aaRS are ancient essential enzymes whose presence early in evolution of the cell provided a robust scaffold for the addition of new structural elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Park1">[65]</xref>. In archael and eukaryotic TyrRSs, the N-terminal catalytic domain is followed by a different anticodon-binding domain, known as the C-W/Y domain, which is homologous to the anticodon-binding domain of TrpRSs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Bonnefond1">[66]</xref>. Two additional structural elements were acquired during the evolution of higher eukaryotes and function in receptor-mediated signaling pathways associated with angiogenesis: the ELR motif in the catalytic domain and a C-terminal EMAP II-like domain, which has non-specific RNA-binding properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Guo2">[63]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Kleeman1">[67]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Kim1">[69]</xref>. The ELR motif is on the intron-binding side of the catalytic domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Yang1">[70]</xref> and incorporated in the same α-helix as Ins1 in the fungal mtTyrRS, suggesting that this region may be a particularly robust location for insertion of new functional elements.</p>
<p>Finally, our results provide evidence that non-specific binding can play a key and perhaps widespread role in pre-adaptive interactions that lead to the evolution of new RNA-binding functions of proteins. For the group I intron splicing activity of fungal mtTyrRSs, our findings suggest a scenario outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002028-g008">Figure 8</xref> in which an initial non-specific interaction between the CTD of an ancestral mtTyrRS and a group I intron RNA was fixed by an intron RNA mutation that made formation of active ribozyme structure dependent upon interaction with the protein. After the interaction was fixed, the mtTyrRS and group I intron were forced to co-evolve, with further adaptive mutations in the protein leading to specific binding of both the catalytic domain and CTD to the intron RNA. These specific-binding interactions extended the intron RNA-binding surface, both increasing the efficiency of splicing and permitting additional mutations in the intron RNA that made it more dependent upon the protein for structural stabilization. RNA-editing enzymes such as APOBEC1, which evolved from enzymes that acted on mononucleotide substrates, may be additional examples of constructive neutral evolution in which a relatively non-specific pre-adaptive interaction with an RNA substrate was fixed by a deleterious mutation, in this case one that could be corrected by RNA editing, and then elaborated by further adaptive mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Navaratnam1">[71]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Gray2">[72]</xref>. Indeed, a similar evolutionary pathway may have been used more generally for other RNA-modification enzymes, including the ones mentioned above that contain an S4-like non-specific RNA-binding domain.</p>

<title>Model for the evolution of the RNA splicing activity of fungal mtTyrRSs via non-adaptive non-specific RNA-binding by the CTD.</title>
<p>(A) A Pezizomycotina ancestor contained a self-splicing group I intron and an mtTyrRS, which functions in aminoacylation by specifically binding tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>. (B) The ancestral mtTyrRS could bind non-specifically to the group I intron and other RNAs via its CTD, and its interaction with a group I intron RNA was fixed by an intron RNA mutation (orange star) that made it dependent upon the binding of the mtTyrRs for formation or stabilization of the active ribozyme structure. (C) Once fixed, this initial non-specific interaction was elaborated by further adaptive mutations in both the protein (orange spheres) and intron RNA (orange stars) that increased both the efficiency and protein-dependence of RNA splicing. The adaptive mutations in the fungal mtTyrRSs resulted in specific binding of the conserved tertiary structure of the group I intron RNA catalytic core, conferring the ability to bind and splice additional group I introns (blue, pink).</p>

<p>Beyond the initial pre-adaptive phase, the extensive structural data for the interaction of fungal mtTyrRSs with group I intron RNAs provide strong evidence for a ratchet-like process in which multiple adaptive mutations, including six different Peziomycotina-specific insertions, led to the evolution of an efficient splicing apparatus for group I introns. It is highly unlikely that the multiple adaptive mutations in the protein leading to an extensive group I intron-binding surface occurred in one step. The surprising finding that the structural adaptations of the mtTyrRS catalytic domain utilized a non-tRNA-binding surface could reflect that the tRNA-binding site in the catalytic domain could not be easily modified to function in group I intron splicing without inhibiting mtTyrRS activity, which is essential in an obligate aerobe. Additionally, the non-tRNA-binding side of the catalytic domain may have had a pre-existing auxiliary RNA-binding function, as found for some aaRSs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Beebe1">[73]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Roy2">[74]</xref>. By contrast to the catalytic domain, the regions of the CTD needed for splicing activity overlap tRNA-binding regions requiring co-evolution with both the intron RNA and mt tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>. Indeed, the unusually long variable arm of Pezizomycotina mt tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>s (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002028.s007">Figure S6</xref>) may be an example of a feature that co-evolved with the CTD to allow it to better accommodate group I intron RNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Paukstelis4">[37]</xref>. We also note that although the initial interaction of an ancestral fungal mtTyrRS likely involved a single group I intron RNA, perhaps the mt LSU intron, which is dependent upon the mtTyrRS for splicing in all Pezizomycotina fungi examined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Paukstelis2">[23]</xref>, the fungal mtTyrRSs ultimately evolved to function in splicing multiple group I introns by recognizing the conserved phosphodiester backbone structure of the catalytic core. This binding mode has the evolutionary advantages of enabling the fungal mtTyrRSs to coordinate the splicing of multiple group I introns as well as the ability to accommodate new group I introns that invade genomes as mobile genetic elements.</p>

<p>Rigid-body models of CYT-18* by itself and of CYT-18* and the CYT-18 NTDs bound to Twort RNA were built by using the program CORAL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Petoukhov2">[48]</xref>. This program employs a simulated annealing method to place high resolution models of individual components in orientations that minimize the discrepancy between the calculated SAXS profile and the experimental SAXS data, with distances between the structured components constrained by randomized dummy residue linkers chosen from a generated library of non-clashing loop structures. To build models of CYT-18*, a homology model of the CYT-18 CTD (amino acids 448–583) was generated by I-TASSER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Roy1">[47]</xref>, using the <italic>A. nidulans</italic> CTD NMR structure (PDB:2KTL) as a template for modeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Paukstelis4">[37]</xref>. The confidence (C-score) and TM-scores of the CYT-18 CTD homology model, which are indicators of model quality, are high at 0.98 and 0.85, respectively. This CYT-18 CTD model and available high-resolution crystal structures for CYT-18 NTDs+Twort RNA (PDB:2RKJ) were used for rigid-body modeling. The final CORAL models were chosen from among ten independently derived models based on the best fit to the experimental scattering data as indicated by a low χ value <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Petoukhov2">[48]</xref>.</p>
<p>Ensemble optimization analysis to characterize the flexibility of CYT-18*+Twort system was conducted by using the program, EOM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Bernad1">[83]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Petoukhov3">[84]</xref>. This program generates a random pool of 10,000 structures and creates an optimized ensemble from this pool, such that the average scattering pattern of the ensemble fits the experimental SAXS data. Comparison of the shape of the <italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub> and <italic>D</italic><sub>max</sub> distributions of the optimized ensemble with those of the random pool provides information about the size and flexibility of the structure, with a broad peak resembling that of the random pool suggesting a flexible, extended structure and a peak narrower than the random pool suggesting a more rigid structure.</p>

<title>Tyrosyl-Adenylation and TyrRS Assays</title>
<p>Tyrosyl-adenylation assays were done by incubating 100 nM protein in a 50-µl reaction containing 5 mM ATP, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 144 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA (New England Biolabs), 0.1 unit of yeast inorganic phosphatase (New England Biolabs), and 5 µCi of L-[3,5-<sup>3</sup>H]-tyrosine (53 Ci mmol<sup>−1</sup>; Amersham Biosciences Corp.) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Mohr2">[30]</xref>. Reactions were initiated by adding protein and incubated at 30°C for 10 min. Reactions were terminated by adding 1 ml of reaction medium and immediately filtering through a nitrocellulose membrane to trap protein bound tyrosyl-adenylate. Radioactivity was measured by Beckman Coulter LS 6500 scintillation counter using Ready Protein scintillation cocktail (Beckman).</p>
<p>Aminoacylation assays were done as described previously with protein concentrations normalized to tyrosyl-adenylation activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002028-Paukstelis2">[23]</xref>. Reactions of 120 µl contained 100 nM protein and 6 µM <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> (Sigma-Aldrich) in 100 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM ATP, and 10 mM L-tyrosine (a 1∶10 mixture of L-[3,5-<sup>3</sup>H]-tyrosine and unlabeled L-tyrosine). Reactions were initiated by adding protein and incubated at 30°C. For time courses, 20-µl portions were removed after times ranging from 2 to 60 min, and the reaction was terminated by precipitation with 0.8 ml of a solution containing 10% trichloroacetic acid and 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate. Reactions were filtered through Whatman 3 MM filter paper to collect the precipitates, and the filters were washed three times with 1 ml of a solution containing 5% trichloroacetic acid and 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate followed by 2 ml of 95% ethanol. The filters were then dried and quantified by using a Beckman Coulter LS 6500 scintillation counter as above.</p>

<title>Equilibrium-Binding Assays</title>
<p><sup>32</sup>P-labeled RNAs (5 pM; 300 Ci/mmol) were incubated with increasing concentrations of protein in a 50-µl reaction containing 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 10% glycerol at either 25°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002028-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002028-g005">5</xref>) or 37°C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002028.s005">Figure S4</xref>). Binding reactions were initiated by adding 10 µl protein and terminated after 30 min by filtering 10 µl of the reaction through a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Hybond ECL nitrocellulose; GE Healthcare Life Sciences) backed by a nylon membrane (Amersham Hybond-N+; GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The nitrocellulose membrane retains protein-bound RNA and the nylon membrane retains free RNA. The end point (30 min) was chosen after determining that incubations times of 20, 30, or 60 min gave indistinguishable results for all proteins assayed. After application of samples, the membranes were washed three times with 20-µl wash buffer containing 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), then dried and quantified using a PhosphorImager and the program ImageQuant (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).</p>

<title>RNA Splicing Assays</title>
<p>Splicing time courses for the Nc mt LSU and Nc <italic>ND1</italic>m introns were done by pre-incubating <sup>32</sup>P-labeled precursor intron RNA (50 or 200 nM; 0.13–0.4 Ci mmol<sup>−1</sup>) with protein (25 or 100 nM) in a 100-µl reaction containing 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 10% glycerol for 10 min on ice, followed by 5 min at reaction temperature. Reactions were initiated by adding 1 mM GTP-Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Portions (8 µl) were removed at different times, and the reaction terminated by adding 50 mM EDTA, followed by phenol-CIA extraction and mixing 10 µl of sample with 10 µl of 2× gel loading dye (95% formamide, 0.02% SDS, 0.02% bromophenol blue, 0.01% xylene cyanol, and 1 mM EDTA). End-point splicing assays were done similarly in reaction medium containing 25 or 100 mM KCl for 60 min. Splicing assays comparing wild-type CYT-18 and chimera CYT-18/Sc mtTyrRS proteins were also done with higher concentrations of <sup>32</sup>P-labeled precursor RNA (200 nM, 0.13–0.4 Ci mmol<sup>−1</sup>) and protein (100 nM or 500 nM dimer) and with 200 nM unlabeled precursor, 500 nM protein, and 500 nM [α-<sup>32</sup>P]GTP (3,000 Ci mmol<sup>−1</sup>; PerkinElmer). In all cases, samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in a denaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel, which was dried and quantified with a PhosphorImager, and data were analyzed by using ImageQuant TL.</p>

The chimeric proteins spliced the Nc <italic>ND1</italic>m intron, which is not dependent upon the CYT-18 CTD, but were unable to splice Nc mt LSU intron, which is dependent upon the CYT-18 CTD, under any condition tested.
