Using luciferase reporters that allow automated monitoring of circadian gene expression in mammalian fibroblasts, we report the collection and analysis of precise rhythmic data from these cells. We use these methods to analyze signaling pathways of peripheral tissues by studying the responses of Rat-1 fibroblasts to ten different compounds. To quantify these rhythms, which show significant variation and large non-stationarities (damping and baseline drifting), we developed a new fast Fourier transform–nonlinear least squares analysis procedure that specifically optimizes the quantification of amplitude for circadian rhythm data. This enhanced analysis method successfully distinguishes among the ten signaling compounds for their rhythm-inducing properties. We pursued detailed analyses of the responses to two of these compounds that induced the highest amplitude rhythms in fibroblasts, forskolin (an activator of adenylyl cyclase), and dexamethasone (an agonist of glucocorticoid receptors). Our quantitative analyses clearly indicate that the synchronization mechanisms by the cAMP and glucocorticoid pathways are different, implying that actions of different genes stimulated by these pathways lead to distinctive programs of circadian synchronization.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>The circadian biological clock controls the adaptation of animals and plants to the daily environmental cycle of light and darkness. As such, this clock is responsible for jet lag and has consequences for mental health (e.g., depression), physical health (e.g., athletic performance and the timing of heart attacks), and social issues (e.g., shift work). The central circadian pacemaker is located in the hypothalamus of the mammalian brain, but essentially the same oscillating system operates in nonneural tissues. Using luciferase, an enzyme that emits light, the authors could monitor circadian gene expression in mammalian fibroblasts via luminescence emission that is controlled by the biological clock. Using this method, they report the collection and analysis of precise rhythmic data from these cells. These methods were used to analyze signaling pathways by studying the responses of fibroblasts to a variety of different treatments, including drugs, growth factors, and serum. The authors developed a new analysis procedure that specifically optimizes the quantification of amplitude for cyclic data to analyze these rhythms. This enhanced analysis method successfully distinguishes among the various signaling treatments for their rhythm inducing properties. The quantitative analyses clearly indicate that the synchronization mechanisms by the cyclic AMP and glucocorticoid pathways are different. Therefore, these pathways lead to distinctive programs of circadian synchronization.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>TRS is a Japan Society for the Protection of Science (JSPS) fellow.

Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock have been identified and cloned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b001">1</xref>]. They constitute at least two interlocked negative feedback loops: one loop is composed of PER1/PER2 and CRY1/CRY2 as repressing factors that inhibit their own transcription, and CLOCK/BMAL1 transcription factors as positive elements to activate clock-controlled genes from E-boxes on genetic regulatory elements; the other loop is an interlocked circuit in which REV-ERBα and RORα regulate <italic>bmal1</italic> transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b002">2</xref>]. The core clock components have been extensively studied, but many questions remain: (1) how circadian oscillators are entrained; (2) how the individual oscillators that are present throughout the body are coordinated; and (3) what molecular mechanisms underlie these resetting and synchronization events.</p><p>While it might be simplistically thought that the “master” oscillator in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus could govern the rhythmic expression of peripheral tissues by driving overt rhythms in physiology and behavior, data from mammals, <italic>Drosophila,</italic> and other organisms have long suggested the existence of multi-oscillators that were organized in a hierarchical fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b004">4</xref>]. Studies showing that isolated peripheral tissues from <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b005">5</xref>], zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b006">6</xref>], rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b004">4</xref>], and even immortalized mammalian cultured cells such as Rat-1 fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b007">7</xref>] and NIH3T3 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b008">8</xref>] are capable of generating circadian rhythmicity of gene expression in vitro have provided experimental evidence for hierarchically organized multi-oscillators. In addition to the theoretical concept of oscillators being expressed throughout the organism, the fact that tissue culture cells contain autonomous functional clocks has practical significance. For example, whereas SCN tissue is difficult to obtain and manipulate, cell cultures have important advantages: they are easy to maintain, accessible to molecular genetic tools, and can produce the large amount of material that is necessary for biochemical assays. Because of these advantages, cultured cells have provided an excellent alternative to the SCN for the study of the molecular and biochemical mechanisms of mammalian circadian systems in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b020">20</xref>].</p><p>To facilitate the collection of highly time-resolved data from cell cultures, we and others developed an in vitro bioluminescence reporter system to study the dynamics of temporal expression of clock genes in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b023">23</xref>]. This noninvasive automated monitoring system is a powerful tool to study circadian clocks in mammals. However, quantitative analysis of circadian rhythms in peripheral tissues and cultured cells is challenging for a variety of reasons. First, the response of cell cultures to different treatments (e.g., drugs, hormones) is highly variable. Second, the rhythms of the cell cultures exhibit damping (i.e. variance non-stationarities; see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b015">15</xref>]). Third, these rhythms often show unstable baseline shifting (i.e., mean non-stationarities) that changes from experiment to experiment, or even from sample to sample. In the context of studying input signaling pathways, it is particularly challenging to statistically differentiate between residual low-amplitude rhythms (such as those stimulated by solvent controls or media changes) and high-amplitude rhythms that have been induced by drugs/hormones of interest. Thus, we set out to develop a computational method to analyze the data from cell culture experiments for (1) the presence of rhythmicity, (2) the significance level of the rhythmicity, and (3) the “strength” of the resulting oscillation.</p><p>We used fast Fourier transform–nonlinear least squares (FFT-NLLS) analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b025">25</xref>] coupled with detrending to remove mean non-stationarities and variance non-stationarities that are consistently encountered in the Rat-1 cell data. Analysis in this manner permits assignment of values to parameters characterizing the period and phase as well as the degree of rhythmicity via relative amplitude error (RAE). To quantitatively assess oscillatory “strength,” we developed a method for analyzing the <italic>amplitude</italic> of the rhythms. Amplitude analyses have historically been avoided as gauges of circadian pacemakers because the amplitude of an output rhythm will be a reflection of not only the pacemaker's amplitude, but also of the output pathway characteristics, including transients, masking, and other amplitude effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b026">26</xref>]. The importance of amplitude has been appreciated in the modeling of circadian oscillations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b028">28</xref>] and its role in photoperiodic induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b029">29</xref>], but for physiological and molecular studies, phase and period have traditionally been considered to be the most reliable indicators of pacemaker action to avoid complications of the observed output assay. In particular, by virtue of elegant “two-pulse phase response curve” analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b030">30</xref>], phase-shifting properties were determined to be accurate indicators of the underlying oscillator that were not altered by output considerations. However, our current understanding of the circadian clockwork has advanced to the stage where reasonable molecular candidates that could act as state variables have been identified. We herein describe reporters of promoter activity for the clock genes <italic>mper1, mper2,</italic> and <italic>bmal1;</italic> the transcription rates of these genes are state variables in current transcription/translation feedback models of the mammalian clock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b031">31</xref>]. Therefore, quantifying the amplitude of the luminescence rhythms expressed by these reporters as a gauge of the amplitude of the underlying oscillator may contribute important information at a finer level of detail than previously possible.</p><p>Our primary goal in the current study lies in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of input signaling and cellular synchronization in the mammalian circadian clock. To examine the precise expression patterns induced by various drug/hormone treatments, we enlisted new luminescence reporters using the <italic>mper2, bmal1,</italic> and <italic>dbp</italic> promoters, thereby extending beyond the repertoire of previous reporter systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b015">15</xref>]. Among ten drug/hormone treatments, the enhanced FFT-NLLS analysis identified (1) 50% horse serum, (2) dexamethasone (Dex), (3) forskolin (Fsk), and (4) epidermal growth factor (EGF) as being most effective in generating high-amplitude rhythms in Rat-1 cells. The association of signaling strength, promoter activation, and the initiation of rhythmicity was further examined in the cases of Fsk and Dex. Our quantitative analyses revealed that the mode of rhythm initiation by Fsk is dramatically different from that by Dex, and this difference is likely to be due to different molecular communication pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Modified Luciferase Reporter System in Rat-1 Cells</title><p>We previously reported the generation of a stable Rat-1 reporter cell line harboring the firefly luciferase cDNA (Luc) driven by a 3.0-kb <italic>mper1</italic> promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b015">15</xref>]. While this reporter cell line has been useful in examining rhythmic <italic>mper1</italic> promoter activity, the amplitude of its oscillation is relatively low and therefore has not been optimal for distinguishing the properties of different rhythm-initiating treatments.</p><p>To improve the reporter system, we modified both the promoter region and the luciferase region. For the promoter region, we first generated and tested a stable reporter line using a longer <italic>mper1</italic> regulatory region (6.8 kb) that contained five canonical E-boxes and was used to make a P<italic>mper1</italic>::Luc transgenic reporter rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b032">32</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Although the basal expression level increased with this reporter, there was no significant change in the oscillatory amplitude. Therefore, we tested the promoters of other genes: P<italic>mper2</italic> (1.7 kb from the transcription start site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b033">33</xref>]), P<italic>bmal1</italic> (0.9-kb promoter region [−776 to +99][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b034">34</xref>]), and P<italic>dbp</italic> (5.0-kb regulatory region containing introns 1 to 3 [−579 to +4430 as a translational fusion] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b036">36</xref>]). The temporal expression patterns of Rat-1 fibroblast cells that were stably transfected with these reporters all exhibited more robust circadian expression than those of the P<italic>mper1</italic> reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Unexpectedly, the <italic>mper2</italic> promoter, which has no canonical E-boxes but only a single noncanonical E-box at −23 relative to the transcription start site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b038">38</xref>], showed high-amplitude rhythms. Of this second generation of reporters, we chose P<italic>mper2</italic>::dLuc for further studies in this paper, because (1) this reporter combination exhibited consistently robust oscillations, and (2) the mPER2 protein is one of the critical core clock components that has been implicated in resetting of the clock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b039">39</xref>]. For this study, one reproducibly high expression line was selected (line no. 3–72, called “Rat1/P<italic>mper2</italic>::dLuc” hereafter).</p><fig id="pcbi-0020136-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020136.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Bioluminescence Rhythms from Various Reporter Constructs That Were Stably Transfected into Rat-1 Fibroblasts</title><p>Traces from three individual clones are shown for each reporter.

When the half-life of this luciferase reporter was assessed by inhibiting protein synthesis with cycloheximide (50 μg/ml), it exhibited a half-life of 4.38 ± 0.16 h (<italic>n</italic> = 4) in the stably transfected Rat-1 cells. Because other groups have reported that the half-life of native luciferase in cultured SCN slices from P<italic>mper1</italic>::Luc transgenic mice is 1.2–1.4 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b041">41</xref>], we concluded that the relatively slower turnover of native luciferase in our system is characteristic of the Rat-1 fibroblast cells. To enable the measurement of more dynamic changes in circadian gene expression in vivo, we replaced the native reporter (“Luc”) with luciferase that has been destabilized by the fusion of a PEST sequence from a mouse ornithine decarboxylase gene to the C-terminal end of firefly luciferase cDNA (“dLuc”) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b016">16</xref>]. Using Rat-1 cells that were stably transfected with a P<italic>mper1</italic>::dLuc construct, we measured the half-life of dLuc to be 2.83 ± 0.39 h (<italic>n</italic> = 5). Although the half life was shortened by only 1.5 h, the major benefit of using dLuc is that it shows no apparent accumulation of inactive luciferase in the absence of the luciferin substrate that causes the high basal activity of wild-type Luc during the first 12 h of recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g002">Figure 2</xref>; see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b042">42</xref>] for a description of this phenomenon in other systems).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g003">Figure 3</xref>, we observed very significant variation in the subsequent rhythmic expression patterns induced by the different treatments.</p><p>The principal advantages of the real-time monitoring of luminescent cell cultures are the ability to obtain data that are highly resolved in time and to measure multiple samples in high-throughput mode. However, quantitative analyses of circadian rhythmicity in the Rat-1 fibroblast system are technically challenging because of the strong damping trend in the oscillations (i.e., variance non-stationarities). In addition to damping, these Rat-1 rhythms also exhibit a strong tendency for baselines to drift (i.e., mean non-stationarities). Furthermore, as shown by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g003">Figure 3</xref> as well as by our previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b015">15</xref>], different treatments evoke variable circadian gene expression patterns, and even the solvent controls or medium changes induce a certain degree of rhythmicity that is difficult to differentiate from some of the experimental treatments.</p><p>To analyze these time-series data, we employed step-wise quantification methods as follows: (1) detrending the luminescence time series data to extract rhythmic components; (2) FFT-NLLS analysis coupled with an RAE assessment to quantitatively determine rhythmicity; (3) estimation of period and phase by FFT-NLLS; and (4) a comparative analysis of oscillatory strength by deriving a measure of absolute amplitude and of normalized amplitude. FFT-NLLS is a multicomponent cosine fit analysis designed to objectively extract periods and phases from relatively noisy data sets at a user-specified confidence level (usually 95%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b025">25</xref>]. Most importantly, FFT-NLLS is coupled to a statistical assessment of the rhythmicity by a measure of RAE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b025">25</xref>]. In addition to the period, phase, and RAE, we were also interested in calculating the magnitude of the observed luminescence oscillations, as we found that there was a distinct trend in the amplitude of circadian expression induced by various treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Differentiating gene expression patterns on the basis of magnitudes of oscillatory amplitude allows discrimination of weak versus strong synchronizing treatments. We therefore developed a method to assess the absolute amplitude and the normalized amplitude as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g004">Figure 4</xref>.

All the treatments induced a significant level of rhythmicity (RAE &lt; 0.123). Among the ten compounds tested, horse serum, Dex, Fsk, and EGF were the most effective in generating rhythms with large oscillatory amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g006">Figure 6</xref>); Fsk induced a relatively higher degree of rhythmicity (RAE = 0.029; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020136-t001">Table 1</xref>) than other treatments. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g006">Figure 6</xref>, “normalized amplitude” gives the best indication of the efficacy of Fsk, possibly because the overall luminescence level of Fsk-treated cultures tends to be low and therefore the unnormalized amplitude is depressed.</p><p>Among these four efficacious treatments, we focused on Fsk and Dex for further analysis, as they induced the highest amplitude rhythms in Rat-1 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020136-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). In addition, the actions of both Fsk and Dex have been well characterized. Fsk is an activator of adenylyl cyclase in the cAMP signaling pathway and a potent inducer of CREB phosphorylation, and Dex is an analog of the endogenous ligand (glucocorticoid) for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a transcription factor that belongs to a nuclear receptor superfamily.</p><p>Solvent controls (0.1% DMSO and 0.001% EtOH) induced expression patterns that were possibly rhythmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g007">Figure 7</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g007">7</xref>C). According to the FFT-NLLS analysis, however, the rhythmicity in these DMSO/EtOH samples was barely significant (average RAE = 0.142 and 0.118, respectively). Individual DMSO/EtOH samples that exceeded the “rhythmicity threshold” showed only a minimal oscillatory amplitude (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020136-t002">Table 2</xref>). These RAE results are in close agreement and, hence, consistent with our empirical determination of 0.123 as an effective RAE threshold for rhythmic determination. On the other hand, when stimulated by 10 μM Fsk and 100 nM Dex for 2 h, Rat1/P<italic>mper2</italic>::dLuc cells exhibited a high degree of rhythmicity (average RAE = 0.050 and 0.051, respectively) as well as high-amplitude oscillations that were significantly stronger than either control sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g007">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020136-t002">Table 2</xref>).

Treatments with either Fsk or Dex (even for only 30 min) initiated significant oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g008">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020136-t003">Table 3</xref>). There was a significant difference between the periods of Fsk- vs. Dex-stimulated rhythms for 1-h treatments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020136-t003">Table 3</xref>, and also in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020136-t001">Table 1</xref>), but these period differences were not significant for 0.5-, 2-, or 4-h treatments (nor were the periods of Fsk- vs. Dex-stimulated rhythms significantly different in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020136-t002">Table 2</xref>). In addition to the observations noted for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g007">Figure 7</xref>, longer-duration treatments of Fsk elicited higher-amplitude oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g008">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g009">Figure 9</xref>, ANOVA <italic>p</italic> = 0.030 among Fsk-treated samples). On the other hand, Dex treatments provoked the strongest oscillatory amplitude for 30-min treatments, and the oscillatory amplitude did not significantly increase with longer treatments, suggesting that 30-min treatments were already saturating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g008">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g009">Figure 9</xref>, ANOVA <italic>p</italic> = 0.91 among Dex-treated samples). Moreover, the oscillatory amplitude of Dex-induced rhythms was consistently larger than with Fsk-induced rhythms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g008">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g009">Figure 9</xref>). In contrast to Fsk treatments, which downregulated <italic>mper2</italic> promoter activity soon after washout, <italic>mper2</italic> promoter activity continued to climb for several hours after the termination of Dex treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g007">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g008">Figure 8</xref>). This phenomenon may relate to the observation that the phase of Dex-induced rhythms was consistently delayed compared to that of Fsk-induced rhythms (7.44 h later in the case of 2-h treatments with Fsk vs. Dex; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g008">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020136-t003">Table 3</xref>). When cells were treated with both Fsk and Dex, the final phase was intermediate between that by Fsk or Dex (4.7 h later than the Fsk-only phase and 2.3 h earlier than the Dex-only phase; see below). These results clearly suggest that the mechanism underlying synchronization by Fsk is different from that of Dex.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Kinetics of Acute Promoter Responses Stimulated by Fsk and Dex</title><p>The <italic>per1</italic> gene has been implicated in phase-resetting, and indeed, <italic>per1</italic> transcription can be induced by a variety of signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b033">33</xref>].

Confluent cultures of Rat1/P<italic>mper2</italic>::dLuc cells were shocked with 50% horse serum, and treated with 2-h pulses of 10 μM Fsk and 100 nM Dex (in parallel with pulses of solvents as controls) at different phases during the second cycle (day 2). The phases corrected for the minor shifts evoked by the solvent controls were plotted in hours after the serum shock and depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g011">Figure 11</xref>. Comparison of the Fsk-stimulated PRC with that stimulated by Dex showed that the magnitude of the phase-shifts caused by 10 μM Fsk is smaller than those by 100 nM Dex and that the two PRCs are phased differently—the “breakpoint” for the Fsk PRC is at approximately 37 h after serum shock, whereas that for Dex is about 3 h earlier, at approximately 34 h after serum shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g011">Figure 11</xref>). Because the PRCs for Fsk vs. Dex are phased differently, the phase of Rat-1 cells treated with these stimuli will initiate rhythms with different phases, as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g003">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g007">7</xref>, and 8 and as tabulated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020136-t001">Tables 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020136-t003">3</xref>.

As assessed by RAE values (considering only those with RAE &lt; 0.123, indicative of statistically significant rhythmicity), rhythmicity was initiated by all ten compounds presently considered (serum, Dex, ionomycin, PMA, Fsk, 8-bromo-cAMP, EGF, basic FGF [bFGF], ET-1, and PGE<sub>2</sub>). Whereas the solvent controls also elicited weak oscillations, in all likelihood these rhythms arose not as a consequence of the solvents per se, but rather the transfer from growth medium (containing 5% fetal bovine serum [FBS]) to fresh assay medium (containing 10% FBS), a procedure employed for both control and experimental samples (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b012">12</xref>]). These weak oscillations, induced by media transfer, were characterized by RAE values very similar to the RAE values determined empirically to be expected for constitutively expressed markers (i.e., SV40) in this Rat-1 fibroblast model system.</p><p>Our amplitude analyses indicated that serum, Dex, Fsk, and EGF were the most effective inducers in generating high-amplitude rhythms in Rat-1 cells. Intriguingly, these treatments also initiated rhythms with different phase relationships (see below). Based upon a predicted ultimate action on CREB phosphorylation and transcription activation from CRE sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b033">33</xref>], we initially expected that Fsk, 8-bromo-cAMP (a potent protein kinase A activator), EGF, bFGF (factors for the receptor tyrosine kinase–mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway), and ET-1 (an activator of the protein kinase C–activated mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway) would have had relatively equivalent effects. However, of this group of activators, only Fsk and EGF initiated statistically significant rhythms (of significantly higher amplitude than the nonsignificant rhythms elicited by 8-bromo-cAMP, EGF, bFGF, and ET-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g006">6</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020136-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>These differences are likely to be due to both (1) different efficacies in activating the CREB phosphorylation pathway and (2) the certitude that many of these treatments activated various secondary pathways in addition to those that terminate on CREB phosphorylation. For example, direct addition of the substrate cAMP (8-bromo-cAMP) usually requires relatively high concentrations (in the range of 0.1–2.0 mM) to elicit a response so as to overcome poor membrane permeability. Fsk, on the other hand, at much lower concentrations (1–20 μM), enhances the activity of adenylyl cyclase, the enzyme that subsequently produces more locally high concentrations of cAMP that can act upon protein kinase A.</p><table-wrap content-type="2col" id="pcbi-0020136-t002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020136.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Summary of Quantification Analysis of Experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g007">Figure 7</xref></p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020136.t002" xlink:type="simple"/><!-- <table frame="hsides" rules="none"><colgroup><col id="tb2col1" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb2col2" align="char" charoff="0" char="."/><col id="tb2col3" align="char" charoff="0" char="("/><col id="tb2col4" align="char" charoff="0" char="."/><col id="tb2col5" align="char" charoff="0" char="."/><col id="tb2col6" align="char" charoff="0" char="."/><col id="tb2col7" align="char" charoff="0" char="."/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left"><hr/>Treatment</td><td><hr/>RAE</td><td><hr/>Rhythmic Sample <italic>N</italic> (Total <italic>N</italic>)</td><td><hr/>Period (h)</td><td><hr/>Phase (h)</td><td><hr/>Amp (&alpha;)</td><td><hr/>Norm Amp (&alpha;/Mean y)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0.1&percnt; DMSO</td><td>0.142 &plusmn; 0.063</td><td>3 (10)</td><td>22.82 &plusmn; 0.41</td><td>&minus;8.32 &plusmn; 0.85</td><td>223.5 &plusmn; 131.3</td><td>0.104 &plusmn; 0.033</td></tr><tr><td>10 &mu;M Fsk</td><td>0.050 &plusmn; 0.019</td><td>10 (10)</td><td>22.71 &plusmn; 0.38</td><td>&minus;1.56 &plusmn; 1.38</td><td>269.1 &plusmn; 68.6</td><td>0.255 &plusmn; 0.059</td></tr><tr><td><italic>t</italic> test</td><td>0.0004<sup>a</sup></td><td></td><td>0.9489</td><td>0.0211<sup>a</sup></td><td>0.0210<sup>a</sup></td><td>0.0082<sup>a</sup></td></tr><tr><td>0.001&percnt; EtOH</td><td>0.118 &plusmn; 0.046</td><td>6 (10)</td><td>22.62 &plusmn; 0.45</td><td>&minus;7.32 &plusmn; 2.24</td><td>178.3 &plusmn; 183.4</td><td>0.062 &plusmn; 0.044</td></tr><tr><td>100 nM Dex</td><td>0.051 &plusmn; 0.019</td><td>10 (10)</td><td>22.56 &plusmn; 0.28</td><td>&minus;9.93 &plusmn; 1.29</td><td>506.3 &plusmn; 187.5</td><td>0.307 &plusmn; 0.052</td></tr><tr><td><italic>t</italic> test</td><td>0.0009<sup>a</sup></td><td></td><td>0.4356</td><td>0.0335<sup>a</sup></td><td>0.0050<sup>a</sup></td><td>0.0004<sup>a</sup></td></tr><tr><td><italic>t</italic> test &alpha; Fsk</td><td>0.9083</td><td></td><td></td><td>&lt;0.0001<sup>a</sup></td><td>0.0016<sup>a</sup></td><td>0.0209<sup>a</sup></td></tr></tbody></table> --><!-- <table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt201"><p>Onset of the stimulation is used as a reference point.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b045">45</xref>]. Specifically, Rat-1 cells do not express the PGE<sub>2</sub> receptor EP-1, whereas NIH3T3 cells do [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b023">23</xref>].

Finally, another explanation for the differences between our study and other studies may be related to differences in the ingredients used in the assay medium. For example, in our previous paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b015">15</xref>], we compared the inclusion of FBS with the serum-free supplement B27. When B27 is included in the assay medium, simple medium changes elicit significant rhythmicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b048">48</xref>]. Some earlier studies used serum-free medium, and it is possible that our inclusion of 10% FBS in this investigation may have masked relatively subtle effects that were elicited by treatments used in prior studies using serum-free medium. We included FBS in our assay medium because it allows cell viability to be extended so that we can measure more cycles. Finally, the source of DMEM can affect the assay; we have found a difference in the free-running rhythm when Rat-1 cells are assayed in DMEM obtained from GIBCO vs. Sigma (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020136-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), and there might be other unreported consequences of using DMEM from different sources.</p><fig id="pcbi-0020136-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020136.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Time-Dependent Stimulation Effect of Two Drugs on the Initiation of Rhythmicity in Rat-1/P<italic>mper2</italic>::dLuc Reporter Cells</title><p>Rat-1/P<italic>mper2</italic>::dLuc reporter cells were treated with either 10 μM Fsk or 100 nM Dex for the indicated period of time before monitoring luminescence rhythms. 0 h indicates no drug treatment (only a medium change).

One difference is the application of an aggressive detrending procedure that effectively reduces mean and variance non-stationarities in a model-independent manner prior to the FFT-NLLS analysis (this part of the procedure is called DTRNDANL—see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020136-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>). We found this to be necessary because the extent of the non-stationarities in our original data was such that analysis without the DTRNDANL preprocessing produced results prone to bias (i.e., FFT-NLLS was unable to handle the original data reliably). The other difference from the previous method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b025">25</xref>] is that the current procedure also characterized absolute oscillatory amplitude magnitudes for subsequent interpretation.

There is a convenient analysis package that is included with the LumiCycle for detrending and period/phase analyses. Our method described herein differs from that included with the LumiCycle in several respects. We use a more aggressive detrending algorithm (DTRNDANL) that is model independent and objective because the only user-specified variable is the filter period, whereas the detrending LumiCycle program models baseline drift as a polynomial of user-specified order (a subjective and potentially arbitrary process; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020136-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>). Moreover, our analytical procedure performs a statistical assessment of model parameter confidence limits and rhythmic significance by way of RAE from the FFT-NLLS procedure (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020136-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>). As described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020136-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>, the LumiCycle's software includes several methods for period analysis, but most do not assess statistical significance or confidence (with the exception of chi-square periodograms, which can reliably produce assessments of significance, but only for truly mean- and variance-stationary data). The current analysis procedure has been optimized for (1) considering statistical issues regarding relatively subtle differences among conditions in chronobiological data and (2) discerning the magnitude of rhythmic amplitude or “strength” (in particular, RAE helps answer the question, “Is there a rhythm in that data…or not?”).</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>What Does “Oscillatory Amplitude” Reflect?</title><p>The underlying basis for our observation that some treatments evoke higher amplitude rhythms than others is, in all likelihood, related to the contributions of two combined effects: (1) ensemble synchronization of cell populations; and (2) cellular factors influencing the rhythmicity of individual cells.</p><p>Regarding population effects, Schibler and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b022">22</xref>] and Welsh and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b048">48</xref>] recently reported bioluminescence imaging experiments on individual cells in which they persuasively demonstrated that rhythmic damping in their cell cultures was predominantly due to phase-desynchronization of individually oscillating cells. These reports indicated that the rhythmicity manifested in an ensemble of cultured cells is a result of the resynchronization of individually oscillating, but asynchronous, cells. By this mechanism, initiation of rhythmicity in cell cultures by signaling stimuli would be due to phase-resetting within a population of individually oscillating cells. As such, differences in oscillatory amplitude elicited by different treatments would be a reflection of the phase-shifting and coordinating efficacy of the various treatments.</p><p>The second relevant effect is cellular. Differences in oscillatory amplitude in cell cultures will also reflect the amplitude of the oscillation in each individual cell. In this case, the different stimuli that initiate circadian oscillations of different oscillatory strength would be inferred to invoke different genetic expression patterns that ultimately result in oscillations of “clockwork” genes of varying amplitude. On the basis of the change in waveform/bandwidth of P<italic>mper1</italic>::Luc rhythms as they damp in Rat-1 cell populations, we previously proposed that damping of the rhythms is possibly due to a progressive decrease of the Rat-1 pacemaker's amplitude in each cell over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b015">15</xref>]. Whereas the aforementioned studies suggest that desynchronization among oscillating cells is the predominant basis for the progressive decline of oscillatory amplitude in populations of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b048">48</xref>], differential oscillatory amplitudes at the cellular level cannot be ruled out as also playing a contributory role.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Two Distinct Pathways Can Initiate Circadian Expression in Fibroblasts</title><p>We found that both Fsk and Dex elicit high-amplitude rhythmicity in Rat-1 fibroblasts, so these cells must express receptor/signaling components that allow responsiveness to these two compounds (other studies confirm this conclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b043">43</xref>]). However, quantitative analyses of Fsk- and Dex-induced rhythms revealed several distinct characteristics. A significant phase angle difference was found between Fsk and Dex treatments (7.44 h difference after 2-h treatments; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g008">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020136-t003">Table 3</xref>) that is attributable to the phase angle difference of PRCs evoked by these treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g011">Figure 11</xref>). Also, the magnitude of the oscillatory amplitude was consistently larger with Dex treatment than with Fsk treatment for all incubation periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g008">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020136-t003">Table 3</xref>). Our time-course analyses of Fsk treatment demonstrated that longer incubation times elicited progressively larger oscillatory amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g008">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020136-t003">Table 3</xref>), implying that 30-min treatment with 10 μM Fsk was below the saturation threshold and longer treatments are needed for effective population synchronization and/or cellular initiation by the cAMP pathway. On the other hand, Dex stimulation showed a different trend, whereby 100 nM Dex for 30 min appeared to be saturating for maximal population synchronization and/or cellular initiation. These phase and amplitude differences clearly suggest that the resetting and synchronization mechanisms of Fsk and Dex are different, as is graphically demonstrated by the PRCs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g011">Figure 11</xref>.</p><p>These phase and amplitude differences are likely to be a consequence of (1) the <italic>magnitude/kinetics</italic> of the circadian gene expression that is activated, and/or (2) the different <italic>repertoire</italic> of genes activated by Fsk vs. Dex. These distinct patterns of gene expression subsequently orchestrate the resetting characteristics observed in the present study. <italic>Per1</italic> promoter activity serves as an indicator of the differential activation of core circadian clock genes, as well as of immediate early genes, both of which are important examples of coordinate regulation. Fsk is expected to act primarily via CREB phosphorylation, whereas Dex acts via the GR pathway, both of which ultimately modulate a wide variety of transcriptional activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b049">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b051">51</xref>]. Transcriptional activation by CREB and GR generally begins within 5–30 min of stimulus onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b052">52</xref>]. However, Fsk and Dex showed different kinetics in activating <italic>per1</italic>, in which Fsk showed rapid/strong activation whereas Dex showed slow/weak activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g010">Figure 10</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g010">10</xref>B). Our results are consistent with those of Balsalobre et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b010">10</xref>], who measured the induction of <italic>rper1</italic> mRNA in response to Fsk and Dex. They also found that Fsk rapidly induced <italic>rper1</italic> mRNA, reaching maximal levels at 1–1.5 h, while the Dex response was considerably slower [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b010">10</xref>]. For Fsk-induced rhythms, the rapid induction kinetics we observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g010">Figure 10</xref>) were likely due to acute induction of a set of CREB-induced genes (including <italic>per1</italic> itself), which subsequently rapidly initiate rhythmicity. On the other hand, the relatively slower kinetics of <italic>per1</italic> gene induction by the GR pathway are consistent with Dex-induced rhythms, manifesting a delayed phase. An additional component is that the level of genes that are activated by Fsk and Dex may affect circadian gene expression by negative feedback. For instance, <italic>per1</italic> is a repressor of circadian oscillations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b001">1</xref>] and thus its strong induction (e.g., by 10 μM Fsk) may have a negative effect on the overall gene expression (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b044">44</xref>]). Therefore, the differences between Fsk- and Dex-induced rhythms observed in this study are possibly the result of the treatment-specific kinetics of gene expression and of the different sets of genes that are activated by Fsk vs. Dex.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Implications of Different Signaling Mechanisms Elicited by Fsk versus Dex</title><p>The phase angle difference we have observed between Fsk vs. Dex induction in Rat-1 cells may help explain the 3–9 h later phase of rhythms in peripheral tissues relative to those in the SCN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b054">54</xref>]. Because the SCN lacks GRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b056">56</xref>], there is likely to be a fundamental difference in the resetting mechanisms in SCN relative to peripheral tissues (at least, with those expressing GRs). Photically stimulated CREB (via glutamate, PACAP, Ca<sup>++</sup>, and protein kinase A, etc.) likely plays a predominant role in SCN, whereas peripheral tissues are more likely to be responding to humoral signals that activate CREB pathways, as well as glucocorticoid pathways (and probably others as well). This concept is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g012">Figure 12</xref>. A tissue that is receptive to signaling by the CREB pathway alone might behave analogously to that of Rat-1 cells treated with Fsk alone, whereas a peripheral tissue that is responsive to CREB signaling and multiple other pathways might behave analogously to that of Rat-1 cells treated with both Fsk and Dex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020136-g012">Figure 12</xref>). The phase of cells treated with Fsk + Dex (and Dex alone) are later than those of cells treated with Fsk alone. These differential effects may help explain the specific phase angle differences among individual tissues and organs, each of which utilize unique signaling pathways based on different sets and distributions of expressed receptors and activators.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plasmid constructs.</title><p>The promoter/regulatory region of each construct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b036">36</xref>] along with firefly luciferase cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Hygro<sup>+</sup> vectors (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, United States) so that (1) the luciferase cDNA was in frame and (2) the 5′ end of the promoter was protected by transcription termination (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020136-b015">15</xref>]).

In order to compensate for a possible variation between samples (e.g., resulting from differences in total cell number, luminescence intensity, etc.), “normalized amplitude” was also computed by dividing the absolute amplitude (α) by background, which was calculated as an average of luminescence intensity between 36–60 h in the raw data.

Rat-1 cells were stably transfected with pMOS/P<italic>sv40</italic>::dLuc so that the linearized plasmids would be randomly integrated throughout the genome, and were subsequently pooled after selection. We prepared four independent transfections with three different concentrations of pMOS/P<italic>sv40</italic>::dLuc plasmid, and measured 96 samples for Fsk treatment and 88 samples for Dex treatments, as each drug treatment caused different expression patterning.

Assuming a normal distribution, 5% of the lowest RAE values from Rat1/P<italic>sv40</italic>::dLuc represents the “strong rhythmicity level” of the SV40 promoter. Based on the assumption that the SV40 promoter is arhythmic, a critical RAE value was calculated to be 0.124 for Fsk treatment and 0.123 for Dex treatment. We used 0.123 to be the threshold to define rhythmicity at a 95% confidence level. In this study, data whose RAE value was &lt;0.123 were judged to be rhythmic.
