				<article-title>PGC-1β: A Regulator of Mitochondrial Function with Subtle Roles in Energy Metabolism</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>The transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1β (PGC-1β) has been implicated in important metabolic processes. A mouse lacking PGC-1β (PGC1βKO) was generated and phenotyped using physiological, molecular, and bioinformatic approaches. PGC1βKO mice are generally viable and metabolically healthy. Using systems biology, we identified a general defect in the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial function and, specifically, the electron transport chain. This defect correlated with reduced mitochondrial volume fraction in soleus muscle and heart, but not brown adipose tissue (BAT). Under ambient temperature conditions, PGC-1β ablation was partially compensated by up-regulation of PGC-1α in BAT and white adipose tissue (WAT) that lead to increased thermogenesis, reduced body weight, and reduced fat mass. Despite their decreased fat mass, PGC1βKO mice had hypertrophic adipocytes in WAT. The thermogenic role of PGC-1β was identified in thermoneutral and cold-adapted conditions by inadequate responses to norepinephrine injection. Furthermore, PGC1βKO hearts showed a blunted chronotropic response to dobutamine stimulation, and isolated soleus muscle fibres from PGC1βKO mice have impaired mitochondrial function. Lack of PGC-1β also impaired hepatic lipid metabolism in response to acute high fat dietary loads, resulting in hepatic steatosis and reduced lipoprotein-associated triglyceride and cholesterol content. Altogether, our data suggest that PGC-1β plays a general role in controlling basal mitochondrial function and also participates in tissue-specific adaptive responses during metabolic stress.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Transcriptional coactivators (TCs) have emerged as key proteins that are capable of regulating entire metabolic networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b001">1</xref>]. TCs are often selective with respect to the repertoire of transcription factor partners. The mechanisms used to modulate transcription may vary according to the specific TC, their transcription factor partners, and the nucleic acid environment in which they operate. TCs provide an additional layer of control by facilitating temporal and tissue-specific regulation of metabolic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b001">1</xref>].</p>
      <p>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α, previously known as PGC-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b002">2</xref>] is involved in coordinating diverse organ-specific transcription programs. For example, PGC-1α not only activates the thermogenic program in brown adipose tissue (BAT) in response to environmental cold exposure but also modulates the metabolic transition from the fed to the fasted state in the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b004">4</xref>]. Two other PGC-1α-related genes have subsequently been found, PGC-1-related coactivator (PRC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b005">5</xref>] and PGC-1β (PERC/ERRL-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b008">8</xref>]. All three family members share a similar basic structure; an N-terminal domain containing nuclear hormone receptor–interacting motifs (the LXXLL motifs) and a C-terminal region containing RNA-binding motifs (RMM) and serine-arginine rich (RS) domains. Whereas PRC is primarily an activator of nuclear respiratory factor-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b005">5</xref>], PGC-1α and PGC-1β have a broader repertoire of partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b012">12</xref>].</p>
      <p>The gene expression level of PRC is conserved between tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b005">5</xref>], but the highest expression of PGC-1α and PGC-1β is found in oxidative tissues, including BAT, heart, and skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b007">7</xref>]. However, despite this overlap of expression pattern, PGC-1α and −1β display different responses to physiological stimuli. Whereas PGC-1α is transcriptionally up-regulated in BAT and skeletal muscle during cold exposure, PGC-1β expression remains stable under these conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b007">7</xref>]. Furthermore, up-regulation of PGC-1α is essential for a normal response to acute cold exposure, indicating that PGC-1β is not able to compensate for all aspects of a lack of PGC-1α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b014">14</xref>]. Similarly PGC-1α is up-regulated in liver in response to fasting, whereas PGC-1β expression remained stable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b009">9</xref>], further suggesting that PGC-1α is more often regulated transcriptionally than PGC-1β.</p>
      <p>Overexpression studies both in vivo and in vitro have revealed that both PGC-1α and −1β are capable of stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis, increasing mitochondrial oxygen consumption, and elevating gene expression of fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b015">15</xref>]. In addition, bioenergetic studies of C2C12 myotubes demonstrated that overexpression of PGC-1α or −1β enhances mitochondrial proton leak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b015">15</xref>]. Thus PGC-1β increases mitochondrial energy production through a combination of activated fatty acid oxidation gene expression with increased mitochondrial activity. A role for PGC-1β enhancing mitochondrial activity is further supported by the fact that transgenic overexpression of PGC-1β in mice results in elevated energy expenditure, resistance to high-fat diet (HFD), and genetically induced obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b010">10</xref>].</p>
      <p>Despite their functional similarities, it has recently been suggested that PGC-1α and −1β may have differing metabolic roles in liver. PGC-1α stimulates expression of gluconeogenic genes both in vivo and in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b016">16</xref>], and based on data from mice exposed to a diet enriched in saturated fat for a short period of time, it appears that PGC-1β but not PGC-1α interacts with SREBP and LXRα to enhance hepatic lipogenesis and lipoprotein secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b011">11</xref>]. In addition, PGC-1β interacts with Foxa2 to facilitate hepatic secretion of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b017">17</xref>], suggesting a central role for PGC-1β in hepatic lipid metabolism. The second organ where PGC-1α and −1β are also highly expressed is the heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b006">6</xref>], but only the role of PGC-1α in cardiac energy metabolism has been studied in detail. Overexpression of PGC-1α in cardiac muscle in vivo leads to uncontrolled mitochondrial proliferation, leading to cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure due to contractile dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b019">19</xref>]. Similarly, PGC-1α knockout mice also develop heart failure with abnormal heart rate and impaired ventricular function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b020">20</xref>], again suggesting that despite their similar mode of action, PGC-1β is unable to compensate fully for a lack of PGC-1α.</p>
      <p>To investigate the function of PGC-1β, we have generated and phenotyped a mouse model lacking PGC-1β (the PGC1βKO mouse). Using a combination of physiological experiments guided by a systems biology approach, we showed that PGC-1β plays a general role in regulating the mitochondrial activity in tissues with active oxidative metabolism. In all tissues studied, lack of PGC-1β was associated with a reduction in the expression of mitochondrial genes, including intermediary subunits and enzymes connected to ETC and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Despite these mitochondrial defects, the PGC1βKO mouse was able to cope when challenged with a range of physiological stressors including cold acclimatisation and adrenergically-mediated BAT and cardiac stimulation but with abnormal compensatory responses. Altogether, these data suggest that PGC-1β is an important regulator of basal energy homeostasis and essential for the proper metabolic tuning in acute stress situations in multiple organs.</p>

        <p>Body composition analysis using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) confirmed decreased body weight at the expense of fat mass rather than lean mass in both young (8-wk) and older (27-wk) male PGC1βKO mice compared to WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040369-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). This was confirmed in an independent group of weight-matched 14-wk-old male PGC1βKO mice that had smaller gonadal adipose tissue depots than WT littermates. Other organs examined did not show differences in their weights relative to body weight (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040369-st002">Table S2</xref>). Histological analysis of male gonadal WAT from PGC1βKO mice showed a reduced fraction of small adipocytes (up to an area of 2,000 μm<sup>2</sup>) and an elevated fraction of larger adipocytes in the PGC1βKO WAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040369-g002">Figure 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040369-g002">2</xref>D). This pattern for larger white adipocytes was also seen in male subcutaneous and omental WAT and in female gonadal WAT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040369-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Therefore, when on a chow diet, the PGC1βKO mice had less total WAT content than WT did, but it was composed of larger adipocytes. Histological analysis of other metabolically relevant tissues—including BAT, liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas—did not reveal morphological alterations in PGC1βKO mice under basal conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040369-sg002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>Gene expression analysis of gonadal WAT from male PGC1βKO mice and WT littermates showed no significant change in markers of adipogenesis including C/EBPα, PPARγ2, <italic>aP2</italic>, and <italic>GLUT4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040369-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). There was a significant up-regulation of PGC-1α expression in WAT in the absence of PGC-1β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040369-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). Previously, increased PGC-1α expression in WAT has been associated with the development of a BAT-like phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b021">21</xref>]. However, increased expression of PGC-1α was not sufficient to increase <italic>UCP1</italic> and D2-deiodinase expression in PGC1βKO WAT (unpublished data). Combined with the WAT morphology data, elevation of PGC-1α in the PGC1βKO WAT is not enough to result in clear BAT-like adipose tissue. However, ablation of PGC-1β resulted in reduced expression in the ETC genes <italic>CytC</italic> and <italic>Cytochrome Oxidase</italic> subunit <italic>(Cox) 5b</italic> and also in <italic>leptin</italic> (<italic>p</italic> = 0.06).</p>
        <p>Ablation of PGC-1β did not result in differences in basal levels of plasma glucose or insulin. Similarly, glucose tolerance tests and insulin tolerance tests (GTTs and ITTs, respectively) performed on 16-wk male and female mice either on chow or after a 13-wk HFD did not reveal differences among genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040369-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). Therefore, the PGC1βKO mouse is leaner, has increased energy expenditure, and remains insulin sensitive.</p>

        <title>Reduced Expression of ETC Components Despite Increased PGC-1α mRNA Expression in the BAT of PGC1βKO mice</title>
        <p>Examination of BAT in chow-fed 12-wk-old PGC1βKO male mice and WT littermates showed major changes in the expression of genes involved in intermediary metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040369-g003">Figure 3</xref>). At ambient temperature, we identified a 4-fold compensatory increase in the expression of PGC-1α when PGC-1β was ablated. We also observed a 5.9-fold elevation in the thyroid-dependent pro-thermogenic enzyme <italic>D2-deiodinase</italic>. These changes were associated with up-regulation in PGC1βKO mice of genes involved in glucose and fatty acid metabolism (including <italic>GLUT4, PPARα, ADRP, LPL,</italic> and <italic>HSL</italic>) as well as elevations in PPARγ1 and 2 and all three UCP isoforms. These changes suggested that increased PGC-1α expression was overcompensating for a lack of PGC-1β. Despite this up-regulation of PGC-1α, ablation of PGC-1β still resulted in a specific decreased expression of genes involved in mitochondrial ETC such as <italic>Cox5b</italic> and <italic>CytC</italic>. In addition, a further range of mitochondrially encoded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040369-g004">Figure 4</xref>A) and nuclear-encoded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040369-g004">Figure 4</xref>B) ETC mRNAs were also reduced in PGC1βKO mouse BAT. The mitochondrially encoded <italic>Cox2</italic> was the only ETC subunit measured in PGC1βKO BAT with increased expression. Western blotting analysis of ETC components in BAT lysates from 15-wk-old female mice revealed decreases in subunits from complexes I to IV in PGC1βKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040369-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Similarly, assessment of succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (SDHB, complex II) and Cox4 protein levels in isolated mitochondrial preparations were both reduced in PGC1βKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040369-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). ATP synthase subunit β was unchanged. Taken together, these results demonstrate defective ETC expression and protein composition in the BAT of PGC1βKO mice, which cannot be fully compensated for by up-regulation of PGC-1α. Despite these defective changes, mitochondrial volume fraction was only marginally affected in BAT of PGC1βKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040369-g004">Figure 4</xref>E, WT versus PGC1βKO: 5.0 ± 0.3% versus 4.4 ± 0.2%, <italic>n</italic> = 4 mice per group, <italic>p</italic> = not significant [NS]) and there was no difference in BAT lipid content as determined by light microscopy (WT versus PGC1βKO: 13.7 ± 0.8 versus 13.1 ± 0.9, <italic>n</italic> = 4 mice per group, <italic>p</italic> = NS).

        <title>PGC1βKO Mice Are Cold-Tolerant but Display Abnormal Responses to Norepinephrine-Induced Energy Expenditure</title>
        <p>A stepwise acclimatisation to cold exposure (4 °C) and towards thermoneutrality (30 °C) was performed on male mice that were 16 wk old at the end of the 3-wk cold-acclimatisation process. The rationale for these experiments was to identify the contribution of PGC-1β to energy expenditure in these two directly opposing thermogenic scenarios. PGC1βKO mice survived at 4 °C after this acclimatisation process. BAT pad weight was similarly increased by cold-acclimatisation in both WT (BAT weight in mg for 30 °C versus 4 °C: WT 117.8 ± 7.1 versus 145.5 ± 9.4, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, <italic>n</italic> = 5 mice per group) and PGC1βKO mice (107.9 ± 9.1 versus 160.0 ± 10.3, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, <italic>n</italic> = 4 mice per group), without differences in BAT weight between the genotypes in either condition. Cold-acclimatised PGC1βKO mice had decreased basal metabolic rate compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040369-g005">Figure 5</xref>A) and had a higher RER than WT mice, suggesting that PGC1β-deficient adaptation to cold exposure may involve preferential use of carbohydrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040369-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). Thermoneutrality studies showed that contrary to the increased resting metabolic rate observed at ambient temperature, when PGC1βKO mice are housed and measured at thermoneutrality, they have reduced basal metabolic rate compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040369-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). Of note, PGC-1α up-regulation observed in PGC1βKO mice at ambient temperature was prevented at thermoneutrality (see below).</p>

        <p>To test the maximal BAT-based nonshivering thermogenesis capacity, we used a norepinephrine (NE) challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040369-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). Whereas NE provoked the expected large (almost 4-fold) increase in O<sub>2</sub> consumption in cold-adapted WT mice, the same stimulus in cold-adapted PGC1βKO mice only reached 60% of the WT response. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040369-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). NE administration to mice kept at thermoneutrality revealed that whereas WT mice exhibited a physiological small increase in O<sub>2</sub> consumption after being given NE, O<sub>2</sub> consumption in the PGC1βKO mice housed at thermoneutrality was essentially unaffected by NE. This demonstrates that the ability of the BAT to mediate thermoregulatory thermogenesis after a period of cold acclimatisation or during thermoneutrality is blunted by the absence of PGC-1β.</p>
        <p>Gene expression of BAT from cold-acclimatised and thermoneutrally maintained mice was analysed. Comparison of gene expression patterns between WT and PGC1βKO mice housed at 30 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040369-g005">Figure 5</xref>D) revealed the same differences between the genotypes as previously seen in mice housed at ambient temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040369-g003">Figure 3</xref>). In addition, many of the genes examined concerning fuel handling (e.g., <italic>SREBP1c, GLUT4, LPL, PPARγ</italic>) were similar in cold-acclimatised WT and PGC1βKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040369-g005">Figure 5</xref>D, left panel). However, cold-acclimatised PGC1βKO BAT still had decreased expression of the ETC genes <italic>Cox4, Cox5b,</italic> and <italic>CytC</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040369-g005">Figure 5</xref>D, right panel). Similarly, there was significantly lower expression of UCP1 and MCAD in cold-acclimatised PGC1βKO BAT than in WT. With cold exposure, PGC-1α mRNA was increased to a similar extent in both WT and PGC1βKO mice, and PGC-1β expression was increased in WT mice. Also, as indicated above, there was no difference in PGC-1α expression between the genotypes at thermoneutrality. As expected, cold acclimatisation increased levels of UCP1 protein in WT (total interscapular BAT UCP1 protein 30 °C versus 4 °C, standardised to WT 4 °C: 12.9 ± 2.8 versus 100.0 ± 7.4; <italic>n</italic> = 5 mice per group) and also in PGC1βKO mice (14.9 ± 2.9 versus 140.9 ± 19.9; <italic>n</italic> = 4 mice per group). Total BAT UCP1 protein was near-significantly elevated (<italic>p</italic> = 0.07) in cold-acclimatised PGC1βKO mice compared to cold-acclimatised WT mice. Thus, the inhibition of cold-acclimatisated BAT activity in PGC1βKO mice occurs as a result of reduced ETC expression, despite otherwise normal BAT recruitment and UCP1 protein expression.</p>

        <title>Gene Expression Pathway Analysis in PGC1βKO Tissues Shows Global Impairment in Mitochondrial Function and Substrate Use</title>
        <p>Binomial pathway enrichment analysis using pathways from the Kyoto Encyclopedia Genes and Genomes (KEGG) was performed on gene expression from spotted arrays generated from BAT of PGC1βKO and WT mice to identify alterations in whole genetic pathways (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040369-t002">Table 2</xref>). Down-regulated KEGG pathways include OxPhos, ubiquinone biosynthesis, and ATP synthesis. In addition, we saw decreases in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, the citric acid cycle, and many of the amino acid metabolism pathways that feed substrates into these systems. Only purine metabolism and glycerolipid metabolism pathways were significantly up-regulated in BAT. A full list of altered KEGG pathways can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040369-sd001">Dataset S1</xref>.

        <title>Tissue Mitochondrial Activity, but Not Isolated Mitochondrial Function, Is Impaired in PGC1βKO Soleus Muscle</title>
        <p>We assessed whether reduced expression of ETC genes were associated with functional defects in permeabilised soleus muscle fibres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040369-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Both state 3 and state 4 mitochondrial respiration were reduced in PGC1βKO fibres, suggesting reduced electron chain capacity and OxPhos activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040369-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). There was no change in the respiratory control ratio (RCR; state 3/state 4), suggesting that the differences between WT and PGC1βKO mice were not related to intrinsic differences in mitochondria function but to reduced numbers of mitochondria per fibre. In agreement with this, ATP synthesis was decreased in PGC1βKO fibres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040369-g006">Figure 6</xref>B), and a trend for decreased ATP/O ratio in PGC1βKO muscle fibres was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040369-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). This suggested that PGC1βKO soleus fibres not only produce less ATP than WT fibres did, but they were also less efficient at converting reduced substrate into ATP.

When compared to WT mice, the PGC1βKO mice had lower basal levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and LDL-associated cholesterol and elevated VLDL-associated cholesterol. Administration of a fat-enriched diet increased the amount of cholesterol associated with VLDL, HDL, and LDL particles in WT mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040369-t003">Table 3</xref>). However, PGC1βKO mice had inappropriately low levels of VLDL and blunted increases on total cholesterol and HDL- and LDL-associated cholesterol in plasma.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Accumulating evidence indicated that PGC-1β may play a role in energy homeostasis through its effects on substrate metabolism and mitochondrial activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b019">19</xref>]. However, the function and relevance of PGC-1β in the control of whole-organism energy metabolism is not well defined. To address this question, we generated and phenotyped a PGC1βKO mouse model. The PGC1βKO mouse is viable and apparently healthy. However, using a phenotyping strategy that combines physiological stress challenges guided by information obtained from a systems biology approach, we found that PGC1βKO mice have a general defect in mitochondrial function, a defect that is partly compensated for by mechanisms that are usually involved in adaptation to increased energy demands, such as up-regulation of PGC-1α.</p>
      <p>The effect of PGC-1β controlling mitochondrial activity was investigated at the mRNA level using spotted array technology and bioinformatics pathway analysis. This approach showed that deletion of PGC-1β results in a significant mitochondrial phenotype. Multi-tissue comparisons demonstrated that PGC-1β controls the level of expression of ETC and OxPhos genes across all the organs studied and that this defect can only be partially compensated for in BAT and WAT by up-regulation of PGC-1α. However, the decrease in mRNA expression of ETC components is not necessarily seen at the protein level. These data suggest that although PGC-1β may be a controller of mitochondrial gene expression, in the absence of PGC-1β, additional factors such as protein degradation may be counter-regulated in specific tissues in an attempt to normalise levels of mitochondrial activity.</p>
      <p>Our initial hypothesis was that dysregulation of ETC gene expression would increase the likelihood that the PGC1βKO mouse would become obese. However, despite its mitochondrial phenotype, the PGC1βKO mouse showed elevated resting metabolic rate and lower body weight compared to wild type littermates under ambient room temperature conditions. This phenotype is possibly due to the compensatory increase in expression of PGC-1α and its target genes in BAT. The increase in BAT PGC-1α expression may cause the higher degree of energy expenditure and relatively conserved mitochondria volume fraction despite reductions in ETC gene and protein expression. PGC-1α was also up-regulated in PGC-1β–deficient WAT, but its induction was not robust enough to produce a BAT-like histology or induction of typical BAT genes. Instead, within the reduced WAT content of the PGC1βKO mice, there was a greater proportion of larger, hypertrophic adipocytes. This result suggests that PGC-1β may play an as yet unknown role in white adipocyte biology, and the nature of this role requires further investigation.</p>
      <p>Of interest, despite marked elevation of PGC-1α levels in PGC1βKO BAT, we did not observe a full restoration of the expression of mitochondrial genes back to WT levels. However, unlike the heart or skeletal muscle, organs where PGC-1α was not up-regulated, the mitochondrial fraction of BAT tissue was preserved in PGC1βKO mice. Thus, there may be partial functional overlap between PGC-1α and PGC-1β, concerning mitochondrial structure and function, which allows the development of an appropriate mitochondrial BAT content but fails to correct deficiencies in ETC composition. BAT was the only tissue out of three metabolically relevant tissues examined using electron microscopy that displayed relatively normal mitochondrial fraction, suggesting that further tissue function–specific mechanisms may be able to correct for PGC-1β ablation. However, the BAT gene expression pattern in PGC1βKO mice also showed altered expression of genes involved in intermediary metabolism, a pattern of gene expression that may also be primarily the result of PGC-1α up-regulation. Our conclusion from these gene expression analyses is that whereas PGC-1β may be required to set the basal level of mitochondrial ETC gene expression, it is not essential for normal expression of metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and fatty acid oxidation.</p>
      <p>We hypothesized that the elevated resting metabolic rate seen in ambient-temperature housed PGC1βKO mice may be reversed under conditions of thermoneutrality, particularly if it was caused by compensatory up-regulation of PGC-1α. Under thermoneutral conditions, levels of PGC-1α gene expression are suppressed in BAT in response to the lower thermogenic and therefore oxidative demands of life at 30 °C. At thermoneutral conditions, PGC-1α mRNA expression was equivalent in WT and PGC1βKO BAT. Interestingly, under thermoneutral conditions, the PGC1βKO mouse exhibited reduced basal metabolic rate compared to the WT mouse. The energy expenditure measurements with mice acclimatised to 4 °C and 30 °C were performed at 33 °C. This measurement at thermoneutrality gives an indication of the basal metabolic rate. Under these experimental conditions, we can conclude that the PGC1βKO mouse has a reduced basal metabolic rate. The data from mice housed in ambient (22 °C) conditions were also generated at ambient conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040369-t001">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, this measurement represents energy expenditure in “normal” environmental conditions, when the body weights of the PGC1βKO mice are lower than WT. Under these experimental conditions, this measurement is composed of both basal metabolic rate and any additional metabolic effort required to maintain body temperature in this suboptimal thermal environment. Given that basal metabolic rate is reduced in 30 °C– and 4 °C–acclimatised PGC1βKO mice, it could be assumed that at ambient temperatures, basal metabolic rate is also reduced, but that the metabolic adaptation required for body temperature defense is actually greater in the PGC1βKO mouse. This suggests that PGC-1β may contribute to BAT thermogenesis in states of low metabolic demand (as is the case for BAT at 30 °C), whereas induction of PGC-1α regulates BAT thermogenesis as environmental temperatures fall.</p>
      <p>It has been suggested that PGC-1β plays a role in BAT accumulation and function during cold exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b006">6</xref>]. PGC1βKO mice tolerated cold acclimatisation, despite the fact that under these conditions, PGC1βKO mice had decreased ETC gene expression and had decreased maximal thermogenic capacity in BAT, as shown by the lower oxygen consumption rate in response to adrenergic stimulation. Both WT and PGC1βKO mice up-regulated PGC-1α to a similar extent under conditions of cold exposure, suggesting that there is a maximal capacity of PGC-1α up-regulation in BAT. Alternatively, survival in cold may also be facilitated by the ability of the mice to maintain some fraction of increased metabolic activity through continued shivering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b024">24</xref>]. Therefore, although the total metabolic capacity provided by PGC-1α in cold-exposed PGC1βKO mice was sufficient for their survival, our results indicate that PGC-1β regulates a large fraction of the thermogenic capacity of the BAT tissue.</p>
      <p>Studies focused in other metabolically relevant organs where PGC-1β is well expressed also indicated that ablation of PGC-1β resulted in impaired metabolic capacity. For example, mitochondrial volume fraction in soleus of PGC1βKO mice was decreased, and permeabilised soleus muscle fibres from PGC1βKO mice had reduced oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis compared to WT-derived fibres. Similar experiments using isolated soleus mitochondria from PGC1βKO mice failed to show any abnormalities in metabolic performance, indicating that metabolic defects in PGC1βKO soleus tissue relate to lower mitochondrial density relative to WT, although individual mitochondria retain similar metabolic properties.</p>
      <p>The heart is the third oxidative tissue that is a major site of PGC-1β expression. Absence of PGC-1β in heart also led to a reduction of mitochondrial fraction, consistent with reduced cardiac expression of ETC genes. However, despite these potential bioenergetic defects, PGC1βKO mice have normal basal heart rates and ventricular contractility. Left ventricular function was also maintained after dobutamine treatment, suggesting that despite their mitochondrial defect, the PGC-1β–deficient hearts are able to adapt normally to imposed hemodynamic loads. The only difference in adrenergic stress that we observed between the PGC1βKO mice and WT was a blunting of the expected increase in heart rate in the PGC1βKO mice. A similar defect in heart rate regulation was also found in the PGC-1α knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b014">14</xref>], suggesting that both PGC-1α and PGC-1β may have a direct effect in controlling the activity of heart pacemakers. Overall, our results indicate that ablation of PGC-1β impairs heart mitochondrial function but that this defect is not severe enough to induce heart failure. However, a more chronic intervention study would be required to establish the relative importance of these PGC isoforms in cardiac energy supply and control.</p>
      <p>To this point, we have discussed exclusively a role for PGC-1β in oxidative metabolism. Nonetheless, PGC-1β may also play an important role in regulating hepatic lipid production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b017">17</xref>]. Contrary to previous reports, we did not observe either PGC-1β induction after 24-h HFD in the liver of our control mice or differences in <italic>FAS</italic> and <italic>SREBP1c</italic> gene expression between controls and PGC1βKO mice. However, we did observe a reduction in circulating total cholesterol and alterations in the lipoprotein-associated cholesterol pattern in chow-fed conditions. Feeding for 24 h with a saturated fat–enriched HFD was associated with severe hepatic lipid accumulation and decreased total triglycerides, cholesterol, and VLDL and LDL-cholesterol plasma levels in PGC1βKO mice compared to WT. These results agree with a recent report suggesting that PGC-1β is a likely mediator of VLDL secretion by acting via interactions with Foxa2 to alter microsomal transfer protein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b017">17</xref>]. However, it is also possible that PGC-1β is necessary for additional aspects of hepatic lipid handling, including modification of lipid storage pathways and for controlling the balance between fatty acid synthesis and oxidation. Indeed, our pathway analysis suggests that the ETC in liver is expressed at a lower level and this may contribute to the steatosis after acute HFD treatment.</p>
      <p>Our results indicate that PGC-1β has a well-defined role in controlling mitochondrial gene expression and function in many different organs. Despite this, PGC-1β can be ablated without overt metabolic failure, at least in unstressed conditions. This may be due in part to robust compensatory mechanisms, as demonstrated by the up-regulation of PGC-1α expression in WAT and BAT. Interestingly, other organs such as liver, muscle, or heart did not show up-regulation of PGC-1α under the conditions investigated. Following from these differences in PGC-1α expression, it is likely that the lean phenotype of this mouse model at ambient temperature should be considered the result of overcompensation mediated by up-regulation of PGC-1α, at least in BAT and WAT. Conversely, defects observed in skeletal muscle, heart, and liver are more likely to be the result of the absence of PGC-1β given the lack of PGC-1α induction in those tissues. When considering the roles played by PGC-1α and PGC-1β, our results show that there are specific effects of PGC-1β that cannot be compensated for by PGC-1α. Taken altogether, our results indicate that PGC-1β seems to cover basal bioenergetic needs whereas PGC-1α provides the extra bioenergetic support required under conditions of increased energy demand.</p>

        <title>Generation of PGC1βKO mice.</title>
        <p>A triple LoxP strategy was used to target the PGC-1β locus in order to generate mice with both standard and conditional KO alleles at this locus. The targeting vector was a ~8 kilobase (kb) 129/SvJ mouse genomic subclone containing a floxed neomycin phosphotransferase selectable marker cassette inserted into intron 3 and a single LoxP site inserted into intron 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040369-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). The targeting construct was electroporated into R1 ES cells, and neomycin-resistant clones were selected in G-418-containing media. The clone was injected into C57Bl/6 blastocysts and chimeric males were crossed to C57Bl/6 females. Heterozygous triple LoxP mice were then bred to ROSA26Cre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b025">25</xref>] mice in order to generate heterozygous PGC-1β KO mice which had undergone Cre-mediated deletion of the intervening region of DNA between the outermost LoxP sites. PCR analysis gave a product of approximately 0.5 kb for the Cre-recombined allele and products of approximately 2.8 and 0.6 kb with the WT allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040369-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). Heterozygous PGC-1β KO mice were then intercrossed to generate mice that were homozygous for the PGC-1β deletion. Null mutants were verified using RNA prepared from heart and skeletal muscle to demonstrate that exons 4 and 5 had been deleted in the PGC1βKO mice. Mice used for this research were backcrossed between three and six times to a C57BL6/J background. Littermate controls were used for all experiments.

        <p>To examine 48-h food intake, cages (23 × 16 cm) were prepared with normal chow and incubated at 80 °C for 1 h to correct for any differences in humidity. After 2 h at room temperature, the cages were accurately weighed. 12-h-fasted mice were put in preweighed cages with free access to food and water. After 48 h, the mice were removed and all faecal matter was collected. The cages were reincubated at 80 °C in order to dry out waterspill and urine, and then reweighed after 2 h cooling. The difference in weights of the cage before and after the 48-h assessment produced the weight of food consumed. For measurement of energy content of faeces and food, samples were dried at 55 °C overnight and stored in airtight containers at −20 °C until assayed. The gross energy content of the dried samples was determined using a bomb calorimeter (C5000, IKA Werke GmbH &amp; Co., KG, Germany). To assess the effect of 24-h high-fat feeding, 8-wk-old female mice were assigned into two groups: ad libitum normal food or ad libitum Surwit diet (58% of calories derived from fat, predominantly hydrogenated coconut oil; D12331, Research Diets, New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States).

Animals were allowed to recover from NE administration for 2–3 h at 30 °C. The mice where then rehoused at their acclimatisation temperature for 1 wk prior to tissue collection for gene and protein expression analysis to avoid effects of NE on gene expression. Oxygen consumption in conscious animals was followed for 3 h using an open circuit system with a chamber volume of 3 l and a flow rate of 1 l/min (Somedic, Hörby, Sweden). This system allowed the ambient temperature of the instruments to be adjusted between 5 °C and 40 °C, together with the volume and flow rates to optimise the system for the particular investigation.

        <title>Measurement of proton conductance and ETC function in isolated mitochondria.</title>
        <p>The kinetics of proton conductance and ETC function were measured in mitochondria in the presence of oligomycin (1 μg/ml), where that rate of respiration is directly proportional to the leak of protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane rather than a combination of ADP phosphorylation and proton leak. Mitochondrial function was assessed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b036">36</xref>].</p>

RNA was quantified spectroscopically at 260 nm using a GeneQuant Nucleotide calculator (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK) and checked for integrity on a 1% TBE gel using ethidium bromide staining. cDNA was amplified from total RNA using template-switching PCR and labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 dyes as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040369-b037">37</xref>].

        <p>Female 15-wk-old chow-fed mice were anaesthetised using isoflurane and killed by cervical dislocation and heart removal. BAT, heart, and soleus muscle tissue was removed and either snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen or used to prepare a mitochondrial extract as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040369-sd003">Protocol S1</xref>. In general, 10 μg of total lysate or 3 μg of mitochondrial preparation was separated by SDS-PAGE on 14% gels. After transfer, the membranes were cut and placed in blocking buffer (5% powdered milk in 1× PBS and 0.1% Tween-20). We used anti-OxPhos complex I (α-subcomplex 9) and anti-OxPhos complex III (Fe-S core protein) (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, California, United State) and anti-succinate dehydrogenase subunit B, anti-Cox4, and anti-ATP synthase β-subunit from Abcam, Cambridge, UK. All primary antibodies were used at ratios of 1:2,000, except anti-Cox4, which was used at 1:20,000. Goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (Pierce, Rockford, Illinois, United States) was used at 1:40,000 for all blots, the membranes were reassembled, and the proteins detected using the ECL-Plus system (Amersham Biosystems).
