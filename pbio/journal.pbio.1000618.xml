                <p>A simple feedback model of chemotaxis explains how new pseudopods are made and
                    how eukaryotic cells steer toward chemical gradients.</p>
            </abstract><abstract>
                <p>The mechanism of eukaryotic chemotaxis remains unclear despite intensive study.
                    The most frequently described mechanism acts through attractants causing actin
                    polymerization, in turn leading to pseudopod formation and cell movement. We
                    recently proposed an alternative mechanism, supported by several lines of data,
                    in which pseudopods are made by a self-generated cycle. If chemoattractants are
                    present, they modulate the cycle rather than directly causing actin
                    polymerization. The aim of this work is to test the explanatory and predictive
                    powers of such pseudopod-based models to predict the complex behaviour of cells
                    in chemotaxis. We have now tested the effectiveness of this mechanism using a
                    computational model of cell movement and chemotaxis based on pseudopod
                    autocatalysis. The model reproduces a surprisingly wide range of existing data
                    about cell movement and chemotaxis. It simulates cell polarization and
                    persistence without stimuli and selection of accurate pseudopods when
                    chemoattractant gradients are present. It predicts both bias of pseudopod
                    position in low chemoattractant gradients and—unexpectedly—lateral
                    pseudopod initiation in high gradients. To test the predictive ability of the
                    model, we looked for untested and novel predictions. One prediction from the
                    model is that the angle between successive pseudopods at the front of the cell
                    will increase in proportion to the difference between the cell's direction
                    and the direction of the gradient. We measured the angles between pseudopods in
                    chemotaxing Dictyostelium cells under different conditions and found the results
                    agreed with the model extremely well. Our model and data together suggest that
                    in rapidly moving cells like Dictyostelium and neutrophils an intrinsic
                    pseudopod cycle lies at the heart of cell motility. This implies that the
                    mechanism behind chemotaxis relies on modification of intrinsic pseudopod
                    behaviour, more than generation of new pseudopods or actin polymerization by
                    chemoattractants.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>The efficiency, sensitivity, and huge dynamic range of eukaryotic cell chemotaxis
                    have proven very hard to explain. Cells respond to shallow gradients of
                    chemotactic molecules with directed movement, but the mechanisms remain elusive.
                    Most current models predict that cells have an internal “compass”
                    produced by processing the extracellular signal into an intracellular mechanism
                    that points the cell towards the gradient and steers it in that direction. In
                    this article, we present evidence that this internal compass does not exist;
                    instead, the cell orients itself simply by making use of its
                    pseudopods—the dynamic finger-like projections on the surface of the cell.
                    We approached the question by making a computational model of the movement of a
                    cell without a compass. In this model, the cell moves in a convincingly natural
                    way simply by using its pseudopods, which respond to positive- and
                    negative-feedback loops. The concentration of the chemoattractant molecule
                    modulates the amount of positive feedback. Apart from this, no signal processing
                    is necessary. This simple model reproduces many observations about normal
                    chemotaxis. It also accurately predicts the angle at which new pseudopods split
                    off from old ones, which had not been previously measured. The computational
                    model thus demonstrates that pseudopod-based mechanisms are powerful enough to
                    explain chemotaxis.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>Eukaryotic chemotaxis—cell migration towards a source of attractants—is
                both biologically important and theoretically interesting, so it has been widely
                studied. Recently, a majority of authors have considered that chemotaxis is driven
                by a “compass” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Swaney1">[1]</xref>. The exact meaning of the compass varies. When originally
                defined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Bourne1">[2]</xref>, it
                implied that there is a simple “compass needle” inside the cell, which
                is a localised signal that represents the direction of the chemoattractant gradient
                    (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000618-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). If the
                hypothetical compass needle points in a different direction from the cell's
                current direction, it causes new pseudopods to be made towards attractant sources,
                thus steering the cell. More recent compass-based models consider the noisy
                environment in which chemoattractants are sensed, allowing the compass to bias
                (rather than specify) the positions of new pseudopods. A number of relatives of
                compass models (including the LEGI models from the Iglesias and Devreotes groups
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Ma1">[3]</xref>, the balanced
                inactivation model of Levine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Levine1">[4]</xref>, and inositide-based models such as Narang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Narang1">[5]</xref>) share one
                property—they focus on information processing, at the level of receptor
                occupancy and immediately below, giving the cell a simplified and amplified internal
                message that determines the position and direction of future pseudopods. In these
                models the cytoskeleton mostly plays a blue-collar role, responding to the
                instructions from the internal compass.</p>

                    <p>(A) Comparison of the underlying ideas behind different mechanisms that have
                        been proposed to explain chemotaxis. Compass and LEGI mechanisms emphasize
                        signal processing to determine the correct site for pseudopod generation
                        (the “compass needle”); the local coupling mechanism restricts
                        protrusion to a leading edge and uses the attractant to bias the growth of
                        different parts of the leading edge; the pseudopod-centred mechanism
                        emphasises the endogenous, autocatalytic growth of pseudopods and allows the
                        unprocessed gradient information to bias multiple points in the cycle. (B)
                        The pseudopod cycle and pseudopod-centred mechanisms. In the traditional
                        signal-centred view, the cell forms an internal representation of the
                        gradient (the compass) that directs the formation of new pseudopods. The
                        compass can only affect the process at one point. Pseudopod-centred views
                        hold that the generation and evolution of pseudopods is driven by cyclical
                        internal processes, and when present chemoattractants bias multiple
                        different steps in the cycle.</p>

            <p>However, we <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Andrew1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Bosgraaf2">[8]</xref> and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Killich1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Millius1">[11]</xref> have found that simple
                generation of new pseudopods cannot explain observed cell steering and that, unless
                gradients are very steep, new pseudopods are usually more strongly controlled by
                internal dynamics than by chemoattractants. We have therefore proposed a
                “pseudopod-centred” mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000618-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Insall1">[12]</xref>, in which there is no
                requirement for a compass or other internal messenger representing direction.
                Rather, each cell's direction is entirely represented by the pseudopods
                themselves. We have demonstrated that new pseudopods are mainly generated by
                bifurcation and evolution of existing ones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Andrew1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Bosgraaf1">[7]</xref>. In a variety of cell types,
                close to 90% of new pseudopods are generated when existing pseudopods split
                to form two daughters. This severely limits the place and time at which pseudopods
                can emerge. We find that directional migration is accomplished by biasing the cycle
                of pseudopod generation and retraction, at any of several steps, rather than simply
                at the level of new pseudopod initiation. These include selecting the best of
                multiple pseudopods generated by random splitting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Andrew1">[6]</xref> and biasing the position at
                which new pseudopods emerge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Bosgraaf1">[7]</xref>. Several other lines of data support this mechanism. For
                example, new pseudopods on average steer the cell away from the
                attractant—which disagrees with compass models in which the aggregate effect
                of new pseudopods is to steer the cell towards the source.</p>
            <p>An alternative, groundbreaking way of addressing the same issues uses a “local
                coupling” model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000618-g001">Figure
                1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Arrieumerlou1">[13]</xref>. Here the leading edge is restricted to a proportion of
                the cell and grows by small increments. As with our pseudopod-centred model,
                chemoattractants bias an internal process and there is no need for signal
                processing. However, this model has two disadvantages. It is limited to cells like
                neutrophils with broad, stable leading edges that turn without generating or
                retracting pseudopods, and thus does not deal well with cells like Dictyostelium or
                macrophages. Similarly, the process that restricts the pseudopod size and prevents
                actin polymerization at the sides is central to the model, whereas in many cell
                types actin may polymerize at any part of the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Swanson1">[14]</xref>. In this work we therefore
                addressed the pseudopod-centred model as a potential broad or universal model for
                chemotaxis.</p>

                <title>A Pseudopod-Centred Computational Model</title>
                <p>We tested the predictive abilities of pseudopod-centred mechanisms using a
                    conceptually simple computational model, based on coupled feedback loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000618-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Feedback is
                    fundamental to chemotaxis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Brandman1">[15]</xref> and underpins both compass- and pseudopod-centred
                    mechanisms but used in different ways. In compass models, feedback is typically
                    invoked during signal processing, to amplify and simplify the noisy and complex
                    information from receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Devreotes1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Inoue1">[18]</xref>. We have predicted that such signal processing is not
                    essential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Insall1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Insall2">[19]</xref>. Rather, in our model feedback loops are used to
                    define the pseudopods themselves. Positive feedback allows pseudopods to
                    maintain themselves and to grow, while negative feedback fulfils two
                    roles—firstly, it restricts the growth of existing pseudopods and the
                    initiation of new ones at other parts of the cell, and secondly, it makes
                    pseudopods dynamic, allowing cells to change shape and direction as occurs in
                    amoeboid movement. To model chemotaxis, we therefore adapted an established
                    system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000618-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Meinhardt1">[20]</xref> based on
                    a single pseudopod activator regulated by three feedback loops, one positive and
                    two negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000618-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). In
                    the Meinhardt article <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Meinhardt1">[20]</xref>, the cell does not move—the components of the
                    feedback loop were localised, in a dynamically evolving pattern, within a static
                    cell perimeter. To allow our simulated cell to move (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000618-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), we have used an evolving surface
                    finite element method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Dziuk1">[21]</xref>, in which each point of the perimeter moves outwards
                    normal to the edge of the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-VanHaastert1">[22]</xref>, at a rate
                    proportional to the local activator level. Protrusion is counteracted by a
                    curvature-based contraction, in which the edge is retracted so that the cell
                    tends towards a constant area. The different parts of the cell retract in
                    proportion to their steepness of curvature; this effectively simulates cortical
                    tension, which retracts highly curved areas and thus causes the cell to tend
                    towards a circle. A level set method was used to evolve the cell perimeter.
                    These methods are based on an Eulerian description of a level set function,
                    where the location of the zero level set identifies the cell perimeter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Osher1">[23]</xref>. This
                    framework confers many well-known computational advantages, including use of
                    fixed Cartesian meshes and straightforward implementation of high resolution
                    numerical schemes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Mitchell1">[24]</xref>. Full details of the computational methods are given

                        <p>(A) Topology of feedback loops. Each pseudopod is driven by a local
                            activator peak (A), which in turn stimulates production of global and
                            local inhibitors (B and C). Coupled expansion of the pseudopods and
                            contraction of the rear also imposes geometric change that can act as an
                            inhibitor by diluting A levels where peaks are expanding. (B) Equations
                            (adapted from Meinhardt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Meinhardt1">[20]</xref>). Activator and
                            inhibitor levels change through diffusion, synthesis, and breakdown
                            terms, respectively. The signal is composed of two terms, one
                            representing autocatalysis and the other related to receptor occupancy,
                            each with its own a noise component. (C) Mechanics of model movement.
                            The cell is modelled as a path defined by finite element nodes. The
                            activator and inhibitor levels change according to equations
                            (1)–(4). To move the cell, each element of the perimeter is moved
                            in the outward-normal direction with a velocity that is proportional to
                            the local activator level at that point. Retractions are governed by the
                            local mean curvature of the cell and allow the cell to maintain a
                            roughly constant area over time. The new perimeter—now with
                            unequally spaced nodes—is passed to the level set toolbox to
                            maintain perimeter integrity.</p>

                <p>Importantly, movement of the leading edge greatly changes the evolution of the
                    activator levels, because areas where the level of pseudopod activator is high
                    tend to expand, diluting the activator. Evolution of the edge therefore mimics
                    the local inhibitor, in a way that might make possible a future model with only
                    two further feedback loops, one positive and one negative.</p>

                <title>Physiological Correlates</title>
                <p>The centre of our model is a pseudopod activator whose level correlates with the
                    rate of movement of the leading edge. One biologically appropriate equivalent is
                    actin nucleation driven by the Arp2/3 complex, which is a central driver of
                    actin-based movement. However, the components of the model are not intended to
                    directly represent defined molecular species. This is for two reasons. Firstly,
                    the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is not understood in the quantitative
                    detail needed to generate a defined model. Key components have not been defined
                    or cannot be measured (for example, the affinity of activated Rac for the
                    SCAR/WAVE complex), and multiple factors such as VASP may modulate the rate of
                    actin-based protrusion. Secondly, actin-based motility is frequently regulated
                    by multiple parallel components, so removing individual pathways such as
                    SCAR/WAVE, Rac, or PI 3-kinase does not block migration, despite the clear
                    importance of each of these pathways. Molecule-based models have been successful
                    and informative about individual pathways and the roles of single proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Lacayo1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Enculescu1">[29]</xref>, but the
                    dynamic morphology of chemotactic cells has proven too complex for such an
                    approach. Our approach is more similar to those successfully used by the Wang,
                    Theriot, and Mogilner labs based initially on cell shape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Satulovsky1">[30]</xref> and mechanics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Keren1">[31]</xref>. While the
                    activator is directly related to the level of actin nucleation or
                    polymerization, we envisage the local inhibitor corresponding to depletion of
                    required substrates (for example, Arp2/3 complex, activation-competent
                    SCAR/WAVE) and the global inhibitor corresponding to physical processes such as
                    mechanical tension. The positive feedback loop driving pseudopod growth could
                    act at multiple levels, including through Rac <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Srinivasan1">[32]</xref>, SCAR/WAVE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Weiner1">[10]</xref>, or actin
                    itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Killich2">[33]</xref>;
                    all three have been described and probably act concurrently in real cells,
                    though we envisage the first two as being more influential. Again, however, the
                    aim of this model is to test the predictive power of pseudopod-centred models,
                    rather than the roles of particular pathways.</p>

                    Firstly, cells polarize into a front and a rear without needing additional
                    internal signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000618-g003">Figure
                    3A</xref>). This polarization is seen as an essential part of efficient
                    migration and chemotaxis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Weiner2">[17]</xref>. Secondly, the simulated cells' migration is
                    persistent—they maintain their direction over several pseudopod cycles
                        (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000618.s003">Movie

                    are mostly made by bifurcation of the leading edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000618-g003">Figure 3C</xref>; compare with Dictyostelium cell in

                    (“pseudopod splitting”) was initially described by Andrew <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Andrew1">[6]</xref> and has

                    fibroblasts, human dendritic cells, and cultured neurites. In the measured cell

                <title>Modelling Chemotaxis</title>
                <p>To generate a pseudopod-centred model of the response to chemoattractant, we
                    departed from the Meinhardt model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Meinhardt1">[20]</xref>, which relies on hidden
                    signal processing to provide a fully localised signal (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). In our system, the magnitude of the positive
                    feedback is directly correlated with the local chemoattractant receptor
                    occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000618-g002">Figure 2B</xref>,
                    equation 4), with additional elements corresponding to noisy signal perception
                    and activator feedback. This provides a key difference between our model (and
                    pseudopod-centred models in general) and most work in the chemotaxis field. In
                    our model, neither actin polymerization nor pseudopod generation is caused by
                    extracellular signals. Rather, the signals are only able to modulate the rates
                    of internal processes. In shallow gradients, internal processes overwhelmingly
                    dominate.</p>
                <p>When this connection to external signalling is added and a moderate
                    chemoattractant gradient (from 5.3 nM to 6.5 nM across the cell) is applied, the
                    simulated cell moves very similarly to a real Dictyostelium in a similar
                    gradient (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000618.s003">Movie

                <p>Firstly, as previously stated there is no direct connection between the external
                    signal and protrusion, pseudopod generation, or actin polymerization. The
                    receptor occupancy only modulates the positive feedback that maintains the
                    leading pseudopod. Secondly, there is no signal processing—each point on
                    the cell's surface is modulated by the local attractant concentration,
                    without reference to points elsewhere in the cell.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, receptor adaptation is not required for effective chemotaxis up a static
                    attractant gradient, even at fairly high receptor occupancy, as long as there is
                    a significant difference in the proportion of occupied receptors across the
                    cell. Parts of the edge that lack pseudopods do not gain them when the overall
                    occupancy increases, because positive feedback of the activator is negligible
                    when activator levels are near zero. For adaptation to be dispensable
                    contradicts most current opinion but is supported by several articles, including
                    those showing non-adaptation of movement to high stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-VarnumFinney1">[38]</xref> and lack of
                    adaptation at the G-protein level as measured by FRET <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Janetopoulos1">[39]</xref>. Adaptation at some
                    levels occurs biologically and is required for conditions such as chemotaxis
                    towards sources of biological waves. It was nonetheless surprising that the
                    model would support simple chemotaxis up a linear gradient without
                    adaptation.</p>
                <p>The basic motile behaviour of the cell is not fundamentally changed by the
                    chemoattractant. As observed in real cells chemotaxing in moderate gradients
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Andrew1">[6]</xref> but in
                    disagreement with many compass-based explanations for chemotaxis, the rate of
                    pseudopod generation and orientation of new pseudopods are only slightly changed
                    by the chemoattractant.</p>
                <p>As the steepness of the attractant gradient applied to the model increases, the
                    accuracy of chemotaxis increases, exactly as seen in real cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000618-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). More surprisingly,
                    however, with steep gradients the model undergoes a qualitative change that
                    precisely resembles real cells. While in low gradients cells nearly always turn
                    from the front, by biasing the behaviour of leading pseudopods, in high
                    gradients they frequently generate a new pseudopod directly towards the
                    attractant source <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Gerisch1">[40]</xref>. The model replicates this behaviour (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000618.s004">Movie S2</xref>;
                        <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000618-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), which was
                    unexpected because we had believed it to be driven by an alternative mechanism.
                    This suggests that pseudopod-centred models can account for the mainstream data
                    supporting signal-induced pseudopods, given steep enough gradients.</p>
                <p>When chemotactic cells are presented with a sudden, global change in attractant
                    levels, they respond in a well-defined way. First actin polymerizes all around
                    the cell perimeter, then the cell rounds up as the new F-actin is
                    depolymerized—the “cringe” response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Chen1">[41]</xref>—which is followed by
                    repolarization, formation of new pseudopods, and a second peak of actin
                    polymerization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000618.s005">Movie S3</xref>). Because this behaviour is consistent and tractable it has
                    been widely used as an assay for chemotactic signal transduction, and the second
                    peak in F-actin in particular has been attributed to a downstream response to PI
                    3-kinase activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Chen1">[41]</xref>. When the computational model was subjected to a
                    similar sudden increase in receptor occupancy, with the addition of an
                    exponential decay function representing adaptation, the perimeter behaved in a
                    similar fashion to the experimental observations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000618.s006">Movie S4</xref>;
                        <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000618-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Activator
                    levels—corresponding to polymerization of actin filaments—rose
                    rapidly, and modelled cells rounded up, followed shortly afterwards by a drop in
                    activator levels as the inhibitors responded. The time for cells to recover is
                    defined by the rate of adaptation, not by the feedback loops. Strikingly,
                    however, a second complex activator peak occurred that strongly resembles the
                    second experimentally observed F-actin peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000618-g004">Figure 4F</xref>).</p>
                <p>This provides an alternative mechanistic explanation for the generation of
                    multiple F-actin peaks. Instead of two pathways with different signal
                    propagation times, as previously predicted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Chen1">[41]</xref>, the multiple peaks in the
                    model are caused by damped oscillation of a single pathway following a sudden
                    displacement. In this explanation, mutants that mostly lack a second F-actin
                    peak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Insall3">[42]</xref> do
                    so because of inefficient positive feedback at the pseudopod level, not separate
                    signalling pathways with different dynamics.</p>
                <p>Two further observations support the appropriateness of the pseudopod-centred
                    computational model. Firstly, movement and chemotaxis are relatively robust. The
                    parameters we use (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000618.s008">Table S1</xref>) are mainly taken directly from
                    Meinhardt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Meinhardt1">[20]</xref> and did not need optimization to produce biologically
                    plausible behaviour. Two-fold changes in most of the parameters make only minor,
                    quantitative differences to the behaviour of the simulated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000618.s001">Figure S1</xref>);
                    indeed many of the single changes shown appear to make chemotaxis more efficient
                    than in our standard conditions. Interestingly, the parameters that were most
                    sensitive to alteration concerned the production of the local inhibitor; changes
                    in the production or decay rates <italic>b<sub>c</sub></italic> and
                            <italic>r<sub>c</sub></italic> resulted in either slower migration or
                    repeated movements that are inconsistent with random migration. Raising the
                    diffusion coefficient of the activator (<italic>D<sub>a</sub></italic>) caused
                    similar problems with repetition, but these could be compensated by
                    corresponding rises in the diffusion coefficient of the local inhibitor
                            (<italic>D<sub>c</sub></italic>). Secondly, the model handles noise very
                    effectively. Even when the contribution of noise is far greater than the signal
                    from a shallow gradient, chemotaxis is efficient; in shallow gradients,
                    chemotaxis is most efficient over a substantial background of noise (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000618.s002">Figure S2</xref>).
                    Robustness and tolerance to noise are central to chemotaxis in real cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Tranquillo1">[43]</xref>.</p>

                <title>Mechanisms Underlying Eukaryotic Chemotaxis</title>
                <p>In compass models of chemotaxis, cells first identify the direction of the
                    attractant gradient, then generate new pseudopods if the cell's direction
                    needs correcting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Bourne1">[2]</xref>. However recent work suggests that pseudopods do not
                    steer cells this way in shallow gradients. Instead at least two mechanisms act
                    concurrently, both based on the tendency of new pseudopods to be made by
                    bifurcation of existing ones. In the first, new pseudopods are made without
                    requiring external guidance, but cells preferentially retain ones that point in
                    the correct direction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Andrew1">[6]</xref>. In the second, new pseudopods are generated in
                    stereotypical directions by bifurcation, but their orientation is biased by the
                    direction of the gradient, leading to accurate steering after a number of slight
                    turns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Bosgraaf1">[7]</xref>.
                    Both mechanisms act concurrently in real cells, though either would be
                    sufficient for chemotaxis alone. We therefore examined the steering of simulated
                    cells to determine whether each of these mechanisms was used.</p>
                <p>As discussed previously, our computational model generates new protrusions, by
                    bifurcating existing ones, and retracts others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Andrew1">[6]</xref>. For the analysis of
                    pseudopod selection, we simulated migration in a moderate gradient (initially
                    5.3–6.6 nM across a cell; shallower gradients give similar but less
                    emphatic results). The point at which each pseudopod splits was identified using
                    a peak detection algorithm, and the daughters followed until one was retracted.
                    We then measured the initial angle of each new pseudopod relative to the
                    direction of the attractant gradient. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000618-g005">Figure 5A</xref> shows that the simulated cells use
                    selection like real cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000618-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Andrew1">[6]</xref> Figure 3A)—new
                    pseudopods that are pointing well away from the correct direction are nearly
                    always retracted, while pseudopods that point up-gradient are more likely to be
                    retained. The pseudopod selection mechanism is therefore operating for simulated
                    cells as in live cells.</p>

                <p>The only obvious difference between the simulated and real data is in the
                    distribution of new pseudopod directions—the “rabbit ears” in
                    the real cells are caused by unequal bifurcation in which the smaller pseudopod
                    points off to one side. Simulated cells bifurcate symmetrically, and thus the
                    distribution of new pseudopods is more even.</p>
                <p>The second measured pseudopod-centred mechanism of chemotaxis is directional
                    bias. During bifurcation, new pseudopods can only be generated in a narrow range
                    of angles either side of the parent. However, the mean orientation of new
                    pseudopods is biased slightly towards the attractant source <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Bosgraaf1">[7]</xref>. This
                    makes the path qualitatively similar in the presence or absence of an
                    attractant, but biases accumulate over time and steer the cell. To test whether
                    our simulated cells used this mechanism, we repeatedly reoriented the stimulus
                    as the cell turned (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000618.s007">Movie S5</xref>). This caused the cell to move in

                    replotted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Bosgraaf1">[7]</xref>). The mean position of new pseudopods was biased about
                    15° towards the stimulus. Note that (as in real cells) pseudopods are biased
                    whether they steer the cell towards or away from the stimulus, emphasising that
                    the timing and general location of pseudopod production are not altered by the
                    stimulus. Rather, in both simulation and reality, cell-autonomous processes
                    control the rate and general site at which pseudopods are made and the general
                    area they emerge, and chemoattractant signalling fine-tunes this behaviour.</p>
                <p>For a more detailed analysis of how bifurcations are affected by the attractant
                    gradient, we simulated inaccurate migration in shallow gradients and counted a
                    large number of bifurcations. We then measured the angle between the dominant
                    pseudopods before and after the split (schematic, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000618-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). In simulations run with zero
                    external stimulus, the mean change in the absence of signal is about 55°. We
                    then measured how this angle varied for cells migrating at different angles
                    relative to the attractant gradient. When simulated cells were moving towards
                    the attractant source, the mean change dropped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000618-g005">Figure 5F</xref>) to about 30°; as the angle
                    between cell and attractant gradient increased, the mean angle between
                    successive dominant pseudopods also increased by a ratio of about 1° of
                    pseudopod per 3° of additional orientation away from the chemoattractant. At
                    70° between the gradient and the new pseudopod, the mean angle between
                    successive dominant pseudopods was not altered. Thus the model predicts that the
                    pseudopod split angle is smoothly biased by the attractant direction, in a way
                    that partially compensates for the tendency of new pseudopods to direct the cell
                    away from the attractant and which will steer the cell towards the attractant
                    source over a number of turns.</p>
                <p>To compare the simulations with real cells, we examined the data generated by
                    quantitation of movies of cells turning in shallow gradients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000618-g005">Figure 5G</xref>; new data, extracted
                    from the same data set as examined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Bosgraaf1">[7]</xref>). Again, the correlation
                    between simulated and real data is surprisingly good. Our model thus predicts
                    new data as effectively as it recreates the multiple known features of migration
                    and chemotaxis described previously.</p>

                <p>As discussed earlier, we used an undefined model because the large number of
                    incompletely defined pathways makes them require multiple biologically
                    improbable presumptions. Furthermore, many pathways that were thought essential
                    turn out to be dispensable for chemotaxis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Hoeller1">[44]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Wheeler1">[45]</xref>. However, all of the
                    components required to drive the simulation have physiological equivalents. As
                    discussed earlier, the core activating term corresponds to actin activation,
                    most likely through the Arp2/3 complex. At least three positive feedback loops
                    of the type we use have been described—direct autocatalysis of actin,
                    actin polymerization generating templates for Arp2/3 complex activation, and
                    actin activation of PI 3-kinase.</p>

                <title>Conclusions</title>
                <p>Our pseudopod-centred mechanism efficiently couples gradient sensation to
                    migration, overcoming a long-term problem with chemotaxis models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Iglesias1">[46]</xref>. The
                    similarity between the behaviour of modelled and real cells is astounding,
                    especially given the conceptual simplicity of the model and the robustness of
                    the model to changes in parameters. Two apparently separate mechanisms of
                    chemotaxis—pseudopod selection and orientation bias—both emerge from
                    the same simple model, and the complex patterns of actin polymerization and
                    depolymerization following sudden stimuli are also clearly observed without
                    multiple signalling pathways. This emphasises that much of the described complex
                    behaviour of cells is likely to be an emergent property derived from relatively
                    simple pathways.</p>
                <p>This implies that future understanding of chemotaxis will require a change in
                    experimental approach. Current research often focuses on how external signals
                    are amplified and processed, and separately on pathways that initiate new actin
                    and new pseudopods. The success of our pseudopod-centred model suggests that a
                    greater emphasis on the physiological mechanisms of pseudopod evolution, and how
                    chemoattractants modulate them, will yield greater fundamental insight.</p>

                    this article and is fully presented in reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Neilson1">[25]</xref>. In brief, equations

                    are approximated on the evolving cell perimeter using an Arbitrary Lagrangian
                    Eulerian surface finite element method using piecewise linear elements. Time
                    integration is achieved using a semi-implicit approach. The computed activator
                    profile is used to drive a mechanical model of the protrusive and retractive
                    forces exerted on the cell membrane. Movement of the cell is obtained using a
                    level set method and a moving Cartesian mesh. Calculations are performed using
                    the level set toolbox in MATLAB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000618-Mitchell1">[24]</xref>.</p>

                    original Meinhardt model, the location on the cell membrane with the highest
                    receptor occupancy is used—without specification of how it is
                    computed—to centre an assumed sinusoidal variation of the external signal.
                    That model, unlike ours, therefore bypasses a key question in chemotaxis.
                    Instead we relate the signal to the local proportional receptor occupancy, with
                    additional random terms representing noise in the pseudopod system and in the
                    receptor signalling system.</p>
