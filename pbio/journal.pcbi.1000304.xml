                <p>A growing number of solved protein structures display an elongated structural
                    domain, denoted here as alpha-rod, composed of stacked pairs of anti-parallel
                    alpha-helices. Alpha-rods are flexible and expose a large surface, which makes
                    them suitable for protein interaction. Although most likely originating by
                    tandem duplication of a two-helix unit, their detection using sequence
                    similarity between repeats is poor. Here, we show that alpha-rod repeats can be
                    detected using a neural network. The network detects more repeats than are
                    identified by domain databases using multiple profiles, with a low level of
                    false positives (&lt;10%). We identify alpha-rod repeats in
                    approximately 0.4% of proteins in eukaryotic genomes. We then
                    investigate the results for all human proteins, identifying alpha-rod repeats
                    for the first time in six protein families, including proteins STAG1-3, SERAC1,
                    and PSMD1-2 &amp; 5. We also characterize a short version of these repeats
                    in eight protein families of Archaeal, Bacterial, and Fungal species. Finally,
                    we demonstrate the utility of these predictions in directing experimental work
                    to demarcate three alpha-rods in huntingtin, a protein mutated in
                    Huntington's disease. Using yeast two hybrid analysis and an
                    immunoprecipitation technique, we show that the huntingtin fragments containing
                    alpha-rods associate with each other. This is the first definition of domains in
                    huntingtin and the first validation of predicted interactions between fragments
                    of huntingtin, which sets up directions toward functional characterization of
                    this protein. An implementation of the repeat detection algorithm is available
                    as a Web server with a simple graphical output: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ogic.ca/projects/ard" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ogic.ca/projects/ard</ext-link>. This can be further visualized
                    using BiasViz, a graphic tool for representation of multiple sequence
                    alignments.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>Many proteins have an elongated structural domain formed by a stack of alpha
                    helices (alpha-rod), often found to interact with other proteins. The
                    identification of an alpha-rod in a protein can therefore tell something about
                    both the function and the structure of that protein. Though alpha-rods can be
                    readily identified from the structure of proteins, for the vast majority of
                    known proteins this is unavailable, and we have to use their amino acid
                    sequence. Because alpha-rods have highly variable sequences, commonly used
                    methods of domain identification by sequence similarity have difficulty
                    detecting them. However, alpha-rods do have specific patterns of amino acid
                    properties along their sequences, so we used a computational method based on a
                    neural network to learn these patterns. We illustrate how this method finds
                    novel instances of the domain in proteins from a wide range of organisms. We
                    performed detailed analysis of huntingtin, the protein mutated in
                    Huntington's chorea, a neurodegenerative disease. The function of
                    huntingtin remains a mystery partially due to the lack of knowledge about its
                    structure. Therefore, we defined three alpha-rods in this protein and
                    experimentally verified how they interact with each other, a novel result that
                    opens new avenues for huntingtin research.</p>

                        respectively. This structure has no residue in beta-strand conformation and
                        is entirely composed of an alpha-rod of 14 repeats previously classified as
                        HEAT repeats of type ADB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Andrade4">[4]</xref>. The label for each repeat indicates the
                        following: repeat order, residue detected by the network, score of hit, and
                        position relative to residue used for training. For example, “1
                        N24 0.84∶1” indicates that the residue detected for
                        repeat #1 was N (amino acid code for asparagine) in position 24 of the
                        sequence, with score 0.84, but that the residue in relative position 1 (that
                        is, at 25) was the one used to train the network as being in the hinge. Ten
                        out of the 14 repeats were detected, 8 of them with
                        score&gt; = 0.80. The inset shows
                        repeats 12 (right, top) and 1 (right, bottom) with the residue used as
                        positive in the training underscored. A coloured label indicates the residue
                        identified by the network after training, which in both cases is not the one
                        given in the training but others belonging to the hinge (E25 and S438). The
                        figure was generated using NCBI's linked viewer, Cn3D <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Wang1">[70]</xref>.</p>

            <p>Some of these alpha-rod repeats have been defined in terms of sequence similarity and
                are widespread in multiple protein families: HEAT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Andrade3">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Andrade4">[4]</xref>, Armadillo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Peifer1">[5]</xref> and HAT
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Preker1">[6]</xref>.
                Others are evident in just one protein family, for example the PFTA repeats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Boguski1">[7]</xref>. Some,
                however, bear no statistically significant sequence similarity and may not have
                originated from sequence duplication (for example, the all-helical VHS domain in
                    <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Hrs protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Mao1">[8]</xref>, or the subunit H of

            <p>This divergence complicates the detection of alpha-rod repeats by methods based on
                sequence similarity. For example, profile-based methods used in the protein domain
                databases PFAM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Finn1">[10]</xref> and SMART <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Letunic1">[11]</xref> detect only two of the
                14 HEAT repeats of human AP-2 complex subunit beta-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000304-g001">Figure 1</xref>), and might fail to detect any repeats
                in other alpha-rod containing sequences.</p>
            <p>Despite the heterogeneity of alpha-rod repeats, they have common features (discussed
                in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Andrade4">[4]</xref>):
                length of about 40 amino acids, anti-parallel alpha-helices, and constraints given
                by the packing of consecutive repeats. This suggests that alpha-rod repeats are a
                protein structural feature that obeys some physical constraints irrespective of
                their evolutionary origin and particular sequence. Coiled coils and transmembrane
                alpha-helices are other examples of such structural features. Statistical methods
                have been used to predict coiled coils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Gruber1">[12]</xref> and transmembrane
                alpha-helices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Krogh1">[13]</xref> with excellent reliability, using algorithms that
                learn to recognize these features from amino acid sequences. In particular,
                back-propagation neural networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Rosenblatt1">[14]</xref> have been used with
                success to predict secondary structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Rost1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Cuff1">[16]</xref>, transmembrane

            <p>We hypothesized that a back-propagation neural network could be better suited than
                homology based methods for the detection of different types of alpha-rod repeats, if
                trained in an appropriate set of sequences containing these repeats. The last ten
                years have seen the resolution of a sufficient number of protein 3D structures of
                sequences with alpha-rod repeats to provide a useful training set for such
                predictions.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="s2">
            <title>Results</title>
            <p>We manually compiled a set of protein sequences with known structures reported to
                contain structural repetitions forming an alpha-rod composed of stacked repeats (see
                supplementary Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000304.s003">Text S1</xref>, positives). To reduce redundancy, no two
                sequences with more than 70% identity were included in the set (after
                verifying that they were full length homologs). We included one protein from each of
                three HEAT repeat types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Andrade4">[4]</xref>, two armadillo repeat proteins, and five other
                unrelated proteins. A similar sized set of sequences adopting a variety of
                structures but without alpha-rod repeats was compiled as a negative set (Table S1 in
                    <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000304.s003">Text S1</xref>,
                negatives).</p>
            <p>The input window of the neural network was chosen to be 39 amino acids, which is
                close to the average repeat length. Since these repeats are characterized by two
                helices of similar size, we chose as the central defining feature the middle residue
                in the hinge between the two helices. This residue should be equidistant from two
                secondary structure elements with particular packing features, likely presenting a
                periodicity of small and hydrophobic residues constrained by the intra-repeat
                interactions between the two helices and the inter-repeat interactions with the
                stack of consecutive repeats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Andrade4">[4]</xref>. Therefore, the network was trained to detect the
                central residue of the hinge (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). The file with the annotated sequences
                used for the training is provided as supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000304.s001">Dataset S1</xref>.</p>
            <sec id="s2a">
                <title>Analysis of Proteins of Known Structure</title>
                <p>The parameters of the method were optimized using the analysis of proteins of
                    known structure. We found that hits above a score of 0.8 were reliable,
                    especially when the protein had several of them in the appropriate periodicity.
                    Identification of a sequence as containing an alpha-rod was optimal when
                    requiring at least three hits above a score of 0.8 with a minimum spacing of 30
                    amino acids between hits and a maximum of 135. Further details can be found in
                    the supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000304.s003">Text S1</xref>.</p>
                <p>A total of 87 sequences were selected with this threshold, which can be grouped
                    in 12 protein families of which 8 were not homologous to those used in the
                    training set (Table S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000304.s003">Text S1</xref>). Since these examples correspond to
                    proteins of known structure, it was easy to visually verify that of those eight
                    families seven were true positives and only one constituted a false positive.
                    Homology of these proteins to the ones used in the training is extremely low or
                    statistically non-significant. Therefore, we concluded that the network was
                    useful in expanding our current knowledge of the occurrences of these repeats
                    and we set to demonstrate this. For simplicity we will denote our methodology as
                    ARD (Alpha-rod Repeat Detection) henceforth.</p>

                <p>To illustrate the ability of ARD to identify new results we will focus on
                    families with at least one human gene. To illustrate how the method covers
                    various profiles used by SMART and PFAM we will examine results on families with
                    HEAT repeats of the PBS type from fungi, bacteria, and archaea. Finally, we
                    illustrate an experimental application of the method to dissect domains in
                    huntingtin, the protein mutated in Huntington's disease, for which
                    little is known regarding its structure and function.</p>

                    with repeats, which showed significant similarity to alpha-rod repeat regions in

                <p>The sixth novel assignment case is the PSMD family (proteasome 26S subunit,
                    non-ATPase) members 1, and 2, and 5. PFAM/SMART identify these as containing
                    repeats of the Proteasome/cyclosome (PC_rep), originally predicted to be
                    composed of a beta strand and a alpha helix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Lupas1">[25]</xref>. However, ARD
                    predicts 5 repeats which overlap with those. Secondary structure predictions
                    (using JPRED3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Cole1">[26]</xref>) and homology to alpha-rod repeats proposed

                    that these are alpha-rod repeats, and that the current PC_rep motif used by
                    PFAM/SMART cuts one of the helices in half. This suggests that the PFAM/SMART
                    domain definition should be revised.</p>
                <p>Another family for which a redefinition of the PFAM/SMART profile may be required
                    is RRP12, homolog to the yeast Ribosomal RNA processing 12, identified as
                    HEAT-repeat containing, Ran binding, and required for the nuclear export of both

                    identify only one HEAT repeat in the human sequence because other repeats

                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Staub1">[29]</xref>, whereas ARD identifies 9 repeats.</p>
                <p>Three other families remain undetected by PFAM and SMART profiles but have been
                    described to contain alpha-rod repeats in separate publications: these are the

                <p>For ten other gene families, PFAM and SMART suggest the presence of the repeats
                    but their coverage is more limited than that of ARD and this evidence remains

                <p>The combination of ARD analyses of the human protein homologs in other organisms,

                <p>We found that the LOC165186 and KIAA0423 hypothetical human proteins (mentioned
                    above) define two families whose structured sequence is likely alpha-rods; these
                    two proteins share a C-terminal domain possibly made of more than 10 repeats

                    composition biased region of around 500 amino acids, whereas KIAA0423, conserved
                    down to worms, has an extra N-terminal domain of alpha-rod repeats connected to
                    the C-terminal repeat domain by a middle linker that is enlarged in the chordate
                    sequences.</p>
                <p>Human CKAP5/TOG (cytoskeleton associated protein 5), a component of the
                    centrosome that is required for spindle pole assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Cassimeris1">[35]</xref>, has
                    similar-length homologs in mammals, frog, and fly. Analysis of the family
                    identifies five alpha-rods of six repeats each in these sequences and a
                    C-terminal non-repeat containing domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000304-g002">Figure 2</xref> and Figure S3D in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000304.s003">Text S1</xref>).
                    The worm homologs are shorter since they have only three of the repeat domains.

                <p>The CLASP family proteins are microtubule-associated proteins, conserved in
                    animals, fungi, and plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-MimoriKiyosue1">[37]</xref>. In humans,
                    there are two homologs, hCLASP1 and hCLASP2, which, similar to CKAP5, associate
                    with the ends of growing microtubules to participate in mitotic spindle
                    formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Akhmanova1">[38]</xref>. Their multiple sequence alignment with
                    homologs suggests that they are formed by four alpha-rods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000304-g002">Figure 2</xref> and Figure S3E in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000304.s003">Text S1</xref>),

                <p>The existence of two cases where the evidence of repeats originates from low
                    resolution electron microscopy images deserves special mention. SF3B1 (splicing
                    factor 3b, subunit 1) is proposed to have 22 repeats according to the structure
                    obtained by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy at a resolution of less than
                    10 angstroms of its complex with splicing factor 3a (SF3B14/P14) where it is
                    shown to coil around SF3B14 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Golas1">[42]</xref>. The low resolution electron microscopy
                    structure of the yeast complex of mTOR with KOG1 suggests that KOG1 has a middle
                    alpha-rod domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Adami1">[41]</xref>. We can confirm through ARD analysis that
                    both SF3B1 and KOG1 have alpha-rods in the regions suggested.</p>
                <p>As noted in the section on analysis of PDB, armadillo repeats are not well
                    detected by ARD and generally PFAM and SMART are as good or better than ARD in
                    recognizing them (for example, for JUP and ARMC8). However, two genes are
                    detected by ARD that are covered by one single PFAM armadillo match and no SMART
                    matches: these are HSPBP1 (hsp70-interacting protein) whose solved 3D structure
                    indicates four armadillo repeats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Shomura1">[43]</xref> and newly
                    identified RTRD1, for which we detect 3 and 6 repeats, respectively.</p>
                <p>Finally, of all 52 protein families with human genes we recognized just three
                    false positives: PACS2 (phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 2), OBSCN
                    (obscurin, cytoskeletal calmodulin and titin-interacting RhoGEF), and P2RY9
                    (purinergic receptor P2Y, G-protein coupled, 8). This was determined by lack of
                    further evidence (no homology to regions with repeats in other families,
                    incompatible secondary structure predictions) combined with a small number of
                    hits in the human sequence, in homologs in other species, or by the overlap of
                    those hits with other domains.</p>

                <title>Short Repeats Highly Identical within Protein Sequences</title>
                <p>In the results of fungal and prokaryotic sequences, we noted a number of cases
                    where the repeats identified for the sequences selected were so similar that it
                    was possible to align most of the repeats by hand in stark contrast to the very
                    divergent examples noted above. We illustrate these with 8 examples, which are
                    not related by homology (see Table S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000304.s003">Text S1</xref>). Their high percentage of
                    inter-repeat sequence identity is indicative of very recent events of
                    duplication occurring independently in these eight examples. Secondary structure
                    prediction suggests that the structure of the repeat is composed of two helices
                    of ∼10 residues, with a middle loop of three, and an outer loop of
                    ∼10 residues, for a total length of 31–35 aa.</p>
                <p>Although most of the repeats were identified by SMART and PFAM (EZ_HEAT and
                    HEAT_PBS profiles, respectively), not all repeat instances were marked and some
                    were detected with the alternative HEAT profile. In contrast, ARD identified all
                    obvious repetitions and some additional borderline ones.</p>
                <p>Orthologs of these eight examples were identified in related taxa (Table S3 in

                    unrelated families arose and converged to these short alpha-rod repeats. Whether
                    there are common mechanisms for the duplication and selection of these repeats
                    and for their functions is, at the moment, unclear.</p>

                <title>Dissecting Huntingtin</title>
                <p>The human protein huntingtin is involved in Huntington's disease. Its
                    function remains unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Nasir1">[44]</xref>. In 1995 we described that huntingtin
                    contains HEAT repeats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Andrade3">[3]</xref> but their identification was restricted to 10
                    units covering ∼400 scattered amino acids out of a total sequence length
                    of 3144 amino acids. Since then, no other characteristic structural features
                    have been described for this protein, which complicates its description in terms
                    of separate domains with independent folds and functions. As a result no 3D
                    structure of any fragment of this protein has been yet solved, and although
                    interacting partners of this protein have been found they are mostly restricted
                    to the N-terminal 500 amino acids of the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Harjes1">[45]</xref>. Here, we applied
                    the methodology described above to define alpha-rods in huntingtin and
                    subsequently tested the validity of our predictions experimentally.</p>
                <p>Initially, we produced an alignment of human huntingtin with a representative set
                    of homologous sequences from the database (provided as supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000304.s002">Dataset
                    S2</xref>). For this we used not only sequences from protein databases but also
                    sequences derived from ESTs and from genomic fragments. We identified for the
                    first time the existence of huntingtin homologs in worms (nematoda genus
                        <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic>, and annelida <italic>Capitella
                    sp.</italic>), amoebae (<italic>Naegleria fowleri</italic> and
                        <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic>), sea anemone <italic>Nematostella
                        vectensis</italic>, and choanoflagellate <italic>Monosiga
                    brevicollis</italic>, notably expanding the scope of this family. We did not
                    find homologs of huntingtin in fungi.</p>
                <p>The analysis of human huntingtin by ARD suggests six matches but other low
                    scoring hits are consistently present in homologs. Comparison to biased regions
                    sharply defines two N-terminal domains of six and seven repeats (H1 from amino
                    acid 114 to 413 and H2 from 672 to 969) and suggests the existence of a
                    C-terminal domain of seven repeats (H3 from 2667 to 2938) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000304-g002">Figure 2</xref> and Figure S3F in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000304.s003">Text S1</xref>).
                    Iterative sequence searches using PSIBLAST with these regions indicated homology
                    to HEAT repeats in otherwise unrelated proteins in the 2<sup>nd</sup> or
                        3<sup>rd</sup> iterations. Consistently, sequence analysis suggested a
                    HEAT-repeat fold (using SVMfold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Melvin1">[46]</xref>), and threading suggested that those regions
                    adopt a HEAT-repeat fold with high likelihood (using GenTHREADER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-McGuffin1">[47]</xref>).
                    The comparative protein structure modeling tool TASSER-Lite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Lee1">[48]</xref>
                    produced an alpha-rod for H1 and H2, but an alpha-beta barrel for H3
                    (incompatible with the predicted secondary structure of the region using JPRED3
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Cole1">[26]</xref>). Given secondary structure predictions and
                    scattered matches it is tempting to speculate that other alpha-rods exist
                    outside of the H1, H2, and H3 domains. However, we were unable to obtain
                    consistent results using PSIBLAST or threading for fragments outside these
                    regions.</p>
                <p>To test our predictions, we produced huntingtin fragments spanning the complete
                    sequence of the protein but separating the predicted alpha-rods into different
                    fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000304-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) in
                    order to study intra-molecular domain interactions in huntingtin by yeast two
                    hybrid (Y2H) assays (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Our rationale is that only well defined
                    domains will fold and produce interactions, whereas wrongly defined domains will
                    either not interact or produce nonspecific interactions.</p>

                <p>We found that the huntingtin fragment Htt507-1230 with the H2 domain
                    self-associates in the Y2H assays. In addition, interactions between Htt507-1230
                    and Htt1-506Q23 (H1 domain) as well as with the fragment Htt2721-3144 (H3

                <p>The results obtained with the Y2H assays were also confirmed in mammalian cells
                    using a modified version of the LUMIER method (luminescence-based mammalian

                    fusion proteins were co-expressed in HEK293 cells and were assessed for the

                    cell extracts with IgG coated Dynal magnetic beads. After washing, binding of
                    the Firefly-V5 Luc-tagged fusion protein is quantified by measuring the firefly
                    luciferase activity in a luminescence plate reader. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000304-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, interactions
                    between the huntingtin fragments Htt1-506Q23 and Htt507-1230, Htt507-1230 and
                    Htt507-1230, Htt507-1230 and Htt2721-3144 were observed with the assays.</p>
                <p>Taken together, these experimental results give the first evidence of domains in
                    huntingtin that mediate potential intra- as well as inter-molecular huntingtin
                    interactions. One of many plausible structural assemblies of
                    huntingtin's domains that are consistent with our results and with

                            yellow cylinder), a small domain (432 to 671, blue), the H2 alpha-rod
                            domain (672 to 969, yellow), a large domain (970 to 2666, green), the H3
                            alpha-rod domain (2667 to 2938), and a small C-terminal domain

                <title>Performance of the Method</title>
                <p>We have developed and applied a neural network for the prediction of alpha-rod
                    repeats. Analysis of the results suggests that it discovers more
                    repeat-containing proteins and repeats per protein than sequence similarity
                    based methods using manually curated profiles, which were previously the best
                    method to detect these repeats. We estimate a level of false positives below
                    10%: 1 in 12 families in the analysis of PDB (approximately
                    8%), 3 in 52 families in the analysis of human genes (below
                    6%). The level of false negatives could be eventually reduced by
                    expanding the training set after new structures of sequences with alpha-rod
                    repeats are solved, but one must be cautious about this to avoid
                    over-prediction. Here, we preferred to train the neural network with a
                    conservative set of known structures to demonstrate that they allow detection of
                    recently identified cases.</p>
                <p>We consider it very encouraging that the network learned from a small number of
                    examples and generalized to recognize repeats not used in the training, e.g. the
                    shorter PBS lyase repeats, or those found for the first time in six human
                    protein families. Most of the repeats detected correspond to HEAT, PBS, and
                    Armadillo.</p>
                <p>Whereas the network effectively detected a number of unrelated alpha-rod repeat
                    types, it failed to detect the HAT repeats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Preker1">[6]</xref>. Although their
                    length is similar, their structural arrangement in highly parallel helices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Bai1">[50]</xref> and
                    the conservation of aromatic residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Legrand1">[51]</xref> make them
                    significantly different from HEAT and Armadillo repeats explaining why they
                    cannot be detected by our method.</p>
                <p>The performance of PFAM, SMART and ARD in predicting each type of alpha-rod

                <title>Evolutionary and Structural Implications</title>
                <p>The lack of a common evolutionary origin for all repeats forming alpha-rods
                    indicates that some specific constraints drive convergent evolution to
                    repeatedly rediscover these repeats as a common solution to a general functional
                    need: protein–protein interactions. Structures of alpha-rods suggest
                    that they are extremely flexible and this allows the ensemble to coil around
                    their target as a boa constrictor would do with its prey. A good example is
                    given by the structure of Exportin Cse1p in complex with Kap60p and RanGTP,
                    where both Cse1p and Kap60p are alpha-rods which wrap around each other, and
                    Cse1p wraps around RanGTP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Matsuura1">[52]</xref>.</p>
                <p>The necessity to coil around proteins possibly explains why the length of these
                    repeats varies between 30 and 45 amino acids. Shorter repeats might not produce
                    enough interactions between the units to form the rod; consequently the rod
                    would not be stable enough and would unfold too easily. Longer repeats might not
                    produce a rod flexible enough to coil around typical protein targets of
                    diameters in the range of 30 to 50 angstroms.</p>
                <p>The current data from protein structures and the predictions of protein domains
                    for proteins with alpha-rods (See Table S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000304.s003">Text S1</xref>)
                    does not suggest the co-occurrence of alpha-rods with other protein domains. We
                    think that this constitutes further evidence that alpha-rods can be used pretty
                    much to bind any protein as needed.</p>

                    HEAT repeat domain has been proven to bind to tubulin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Yao1">[61]</xref>. Our analysis suggests
                    that this domain possibly contains seven repeats and is distantly related to the

                <title>Study of Huntingtin</title>
                <p>We demonstrated how to combine information from homologous proteins and secondary
                    structure predictions for a better definition of domains of repeats. We used
                    this approach to define three domains of alpha-rod repeats in human huntingtin:
                    H1 between positions 114–413, H2 between 672–969, and H3
                    between 2667–2938 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000304-g003">Figure
                        3A</xref>). The definition of these three domains correlates well with
                    previous definitions of cleavage sites in huntingtin. In striatum of brains from
                    patients of Huntington's disease a 40–50 kDa N-terminal and a
                    C-terminal 30–50 kDa fragment are observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-MendeMueller1">[63]</xref>, which would
                    include H1 and H3, respectively. In addition, several caspase cleavage sites
                    have been verified for huntingtin in positions 513, 552 and 586 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Wellington1">[64]</xref>, which fall in between predicted H1 and H2
                    alpha-rods.</p>
                <p>Using our predictions, we verified for the first time interactions between
                    domains of human huntingtin. These involve three domains of HEAT-repeats.
                    Interactions between domains composed of HEAT-repeats are known. For example,
                    several of the subunits of the AP1 clathrin adaptor core are an alpha-rod of
                    HEAT-repeats and interact with each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Heldwein1">[65]</xref>. We observed the
                    self-association of one of the huntingtin fragments containing a HEAT-repeat
                    domain. This suggests the possibility that huntingtin homodimerizes through
                    inter-molecular association of this domain, in agreement with previous reports
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Li1">[66]</xref>.
                    Homodimerization through interaction of domains with HEAT repeats has been
                    suggested for the DNA-PKc/Ku70/Ku80 complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Spagnolo1">[67]</xref>.</p>
                <p>The interaction of these domains implies their folding in functional units that
                    correspond to the boundaries we have defined. These results are the first
                    demonstration of domains in huntingtin. This opens avenues for further research
                    into the structure and function of this large protein, which had been hampered
                    until now by its lack of definition in terms of structural units. It is now
                    possible to study the interaction of huntingtin with other proteins on a per
                    domain basis.</p>

                <p>We used a neural network of feed-forward type with three layers of neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000304-Rosenblatt1">[14]</xref>. Inputs were obtained by scanning the sequence

                    binary string where each amino acid is codified by the binary pattern. The
                    length of the entry layer is 39 times 20, where 20 is the number of possible
                    amino acids. One hidden layer with three neurons is used for connecting the
                    inputs with the output layer containing one neuron predicting whether the window
                    is on a repeat or not (e.g. takes real values from 0.1 to 0.9 where the larger
                    values indicates the larger probability of the repeat detection). This

                    Then, yeast strains expressing bait and prey proteins were mixed in 96-well
                    microtiter plates and diploid yeast strains were formed on YPD agar plates. Y2H
                    interactions were scored by the frequency of appearance on the SDIV agar plates
                    and β-galactosidase activity in SDII and SDIV nylon membranes,
                    respectively. Growth in SDII-agar was monitored as a mating control.</p>

                    Protein complexes were isolated from 70 µl cell extracts using 5
                    µl IgG-coated Dynal magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280 Sheep anti-Rabbit

                    fusion huntingtin fragment protein was quantified by measuring the firefly
                    luciferase activity in a luminescence plate reader (TECAN Infinite M200).
