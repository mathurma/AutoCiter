				<article-title>Characterizing a Key Player in Micro, but not Small, RNA Interference</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>RNA interference is triggered by double-stranded RNA that is processed into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by Dicer enzyme. Endogenously, RNA interference triggers are created from small noncoding RNAs called microRNAs (miRNAs). RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISC) in human cells can be programmed by exogenously introduced siRNA or endogenously expressed miRNA. siRNA-programmed RISC (siRISC) silences expression by cleaving a perfectly complementary target mRNA, whereas miRNA-induced silencing complexes (miRISC) inhibits translation by binding imperfectly matched sequences in the 3′ UTR of target mRNA. Both RISCs contain Argonaute2 (Ago2), which catalyzes target mRNA cleavage by siRISC and localizes to cytoplasmic mRNA processing bodies (P-bodies). Here, we show that RCK/p54, a DEAD box helicase, interacts with argonaute proteins, Ago1 and Ago2, in affinity-purified active siRISC or miRISC from human cells; directly interacts with Ago1 and Ago2 in vivo, facilitates formation of P-bodies, and is a general repressor of translation. Disrupting P-bodies by depleting Lsm1 did not affect RCK/p54 interactions with argonaute proteins and its function in miRNA-mediated translation repression. Depletion of RCK/p54 disrupted P-bodies and dispersed Ago2 throughout the cytoplasm but did not significantly affect siRNA-mediated RNA functions of RISC. Depleting RCK/p54 released general, miRNA-induced, and 
					<italic>let</italic>-7-mediated translational repression. Therefore, we propose that translation repression is mediated by miRISC via RCK/p54 and its specificity is dictated by the miRNA sequence binding multiple copies of miRISC to complementary 3′ UTR sites in the target mRNA. These studies also suggest that translation suppression by miRISC does not require P-body structures, and location of miRISC to P-bodies is the consequence of translation repression.

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Small non-coding RNAs play important roles in the posttranscriptional regulation of genes that code for diverse biological functions, e.g., in most metazoan organisms from nematodes to mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b003">3</xref>]. Two classes of such small (∼ 21 nucleotide [nt]) RNAs that have been extensively studied in gene silencing are short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b004">4</xref>]). Currently, the best known mechanism of gene silencing is RNA interference (RNAi), an evolutionarily conserved process whereby double-stranded RNA induces the sequence-specific degradation of homologous mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b005">5</xref>]. Long double-stranded RNA and precursors of miRNAs are processed by Dicer enzyme, and siRNAs are assembled into an RNA-induced silencing complex called RISC. The RNAi machinery can also be programmed in cells by introducing duplexes of siRNAs that are assembled into RNA-induced silencing complexes (siRISC) containing Dicer, argonautes, and other proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b006">6</xref>]. Although RNAi has commonly been associated with siRNAs, this process is largely mediated in plants by miRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b007">7</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b008">8</xref>], and examples of miRNA-mediated RNAi have been found in mammals and viruses (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b006">6</xref>]). Growing evidence indicates that miRNAs are important in human disease, including cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b012">12</xref>]. For example, relatively low levels of 
				<italic>let</italic>-7 miRNA up-regulate RAS protein in lung cancer cells, demonstrating a possible role of miRNA in tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b013">13</xref>].
			</p>
      <p>Both classes of small RNAs are assembled into silencing complexes that contain Dicer, argonautes, and other proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b004">4</xref>], but they silence gene expression by two different pathways. Upon recognizing complementary mRNA, activated RISC forms an effector complex with the target mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b006">6</xref>]. Antisense siRNA in activated RISC serves as a guide for Argonaute2 (Ago2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b016">16</xref>] to catalyze the cleavage of target mRNA at a site ∼ 10 nt from the 5′ end of the siRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b017">17</xref>]. Following cleavage, the target mRNA is degraded. Activated RISC, as a multi-turnover enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b018">18</xref>], is recycled to cleave additional mRNA targets.
			</p>
      <p>In the case of miRNAs, they are assembled into miRNA-induced silencing complexes (miRISC) that contain Dicer, argonaute proteins, transactivation-responsive RNA-binding protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b022">22</xref>], and other cellular factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b004">4</xref>]. This assembly into miRISC has been implicated in miRNA functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b024">24</xref>].
			</p>
      <p>Whether siRNA-mediated RNAi or miRNA-mediated inhibition of translation is triggered depends largely on the degree of complementarity between the siRNA or miRNA and its mRNA target (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b002">2</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b025">25</xref>]). While both miRNAs and siRNAs must harbor sequences that recognize the target mRNA, miRNAs are generally not fully complementary to the mRNA target. In contrast, siRNA sequences must be completely complementary to the mRNA target cleavage site to efficiently induce cleavage through the RNAi pathway. Interestingly, miRNAs can behave like siRNAs and induce mRNA cleavage when the miRNA sequence is completely complementary to a target mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b018">18</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b026">26</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b027">27</xref>].
			</p>
      <p>In human cells, the mechanism by which the endogenous miRNA and siRNA pathways are distinguished is not clearly understood. It is also unclear how miRNAs repress the translation of target mRNAs. New insights into miRNA function have recently been provided by localization of the RISC components, Ago1 and Ago2, in mRNA-processing bodies (P-bodies) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b031">31</xref>], which are cytoplasmic foci containing translationally repressed mRNP complexes. During cellular translational control, an mRNP complex is formed containing the translationally repressed mRNA and associated repressor proteins and lacking translation initiation factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b032">32</xref>]. These translationally repressed mRNPs accumulate in P-bodies and contain proteins that mediate the translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b035">35</xref>], RNAi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b031">31</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b036">36</xref>], translation suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b037">37</xref>], and decay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b032">32</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b038">38</xref>] of cellular mRNA. P-bodies, also referred to as GW or Dcp bodies, contain GW182 proteins that have recently been reported to play a role in RNAi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b041">41</xref>]. Other proteins found in cytoplasmic P-bodies and implicated in mRNA processing are RCK/p54, Lsm1, Dcp1:2, and eIF4E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b032">32</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b033">33</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b038">38</xref>]. Given that target mRNA and RISC components have been co-localized in P-bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b029">29</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b031">31</xref>], it is possible that P-bodies are the bona fide site for RISC-induced target cleavage or repression of translation. However, the mechanism by which target mRNA and miRISC are directed to P-bodies and how translation is repressed by miRISC is still unknown.
			</p>
      <p>One P-body protein, RCK/p54, the human homolog of yeast Dhh1p, is a member of the ATP-dependent DEAD box helicase family and was originally identified as a proto-oncogene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b042">42</xref>]. In human cells, RCK/p54 interacts in P-bodies with the translation initiation factor, eIF4E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b033">33</xref>]. The 
				<italic>Xenopus</italic> homolog of RCK/p54, Xp54, which interacts with eIF4E and forms RNA-dependent oligomers, represses the translation of mRNA in oocytes and eggs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b043">43</xref>]. In yeast, Dhh1p interacts with the decapping and deadenylase complex and functions in translational repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b044">44</xref>]. Dhh1p has also recently been shown to stimulate translational repression by inhibiting production of the pre-initiation complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b045">45</xref>].
			</p>
      <p>Here, we show that RCK/p54 interacts with argonaute proteins, Ago1 and Ago2, in affinity-purified active RISC assemblies from human cells programmed with siRNA or endogenous miRNA; directly interacts with Ago1 and Ago2 in vivo, facilitates formation of cytoplasmic P-bodies, and acts as a general repressor of translation. Depletion of RCK/p54 disrupted P-bodies and dispersed Ago2 throughout the cytoplasm. We further show that depletion of RCK/p54 did not significantly affect the RNAi function of RISC, but released general, miRNA-induced and 
				<italic>let</italic>-7-mediated translational repression. Taken together, our results suggest that RCK/p54 is the effector molecule in miRISC that represses translation and that the specificity of this repression is dictated by the sequence of miRNA binding to complementary sites in the 3′ UTR of the target mRNA.

        <title>Human Argonaute Proteins Interact with RCK/p54, a Component of P-Bodies</title>
        <p>To investigate the mechanism of miRNA-mediated repression of mRNA translation and to determine the interactions of P-body components with the RNAi machinery, we constructed expression vectors for the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged P-body proteins, Lsm1, RCK/p54, Dcp2, and eIF4E. These vectors were co-expressed in HeLa cells with Myc-tagged Ago2 and immunopurified using anti-Myc antibodies. The protein composition of isolated complexes was analyzed by immunoblot using antibodies against green fluorescent protein (GFP) or Myc. When total cell extracts (TCE) were analyzed to determine the protein expression efficiencies of the vectors used in these experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, TCE lane), all YFP- and Myc-tagged proteins were expressed. Analysis of immunopurified complexes revealed that Ago1, Dcp2, RCK/p54, and eIF4E formed complexes with Ago2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, anti-Myc lane). Control experiments showed that YFP did not co-purify with Ago2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Interestingly, Lsm1 did not co-purify with Ago2, but localized to P-body structures in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g001">Figure 1</xref>B).

TCEs from HeLa cells co-expressing Myc-Ago2 and YFP-Ago1, YFP-Dcp2, YFP-RCK/p54, YFP-eIF4E, YFP-Lsm1, or YFP were treated with +/− RNase A followed by Myc-Ago2 immunoprecipitation.

FRET was measured by an acceptor photobleaching method. Fluorescence images of donor (CFP-Ago2) and acceptor (YFP-RCK/p54) molecules were taken before and after photobleaching YFP. FRET efficiencies were calculated as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b048">48</xref>,

        </fig>
        <p>Since P-bodies contain RNA and proteins, many protein components of P-bodies are likely to be assembled on a common RNA scaffold without forming functional protein–protein interactions. To address this possibility, HeLa cells were transfected with vectors to co-express Myc-Ago2 and the YFP-tagged P-body proteins, Lsm1, RCK/p54, Dcp2, and eIF4E, subjected to RNase A digestion, and immunopurified. Analysis of immunopurified complexes showed that Ago1 and RCK/p54 interactions with Myc-Ago2 were not affected by RNase treatment, whereas the amounts of Dcp2 and eIF4E protein that co-purified with Myc-Ago2 decreased significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, anti-Myc lane). Control experiments analyzing Myc-Ago2 showed that equal amounts of complexes were purified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, anti-Myc lane). Taken together, these results suggest that Ago1 and RCK/p54 directly interacted with Ago2, whereas Dcp2 and eIF4E interactions with Ago2 were RNA-mediated. These results do not rule out the possibility that Ago1 and RCK/p54 interactions with Ago2 were mediated by adapter protein(s).

        <p>Cytoplasmic P-bodies contain RCK/p54, Lsm1, Dcp2, and eIF4E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b032">32</xref>,

					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b038">38</xref>]. To confirm whether these structures also contain Ago2 as recently reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b028">28</xref>,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b031">31</xref>], we transfected HeLa cells with expression vectors containing YFP-Ago1, CFP (cyan fluorescent protein)-Ago1, YFP-Ago2, and CFP-Ago2. Transiently expressed YFP- and CFP-tagged Ago1 and Ago2 co-localized at specific foci in cytoplasm (unpublished data). To examine the contents of these cytoplasmic foci, HeLa cells were transfected with expression vectors for YFP-Lsm1 and CFP-Ago2, or YFP-RCK/p54 and CFP-Ago2, and visualized 24 h later by confocal microscopy. As shown in 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, CFP-Ago2 co-localized with YFP-Lsm1 and YFP-RCK/p54, two bona fide P-body proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b032">32</xref>,

					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b038">38</xref>]. In addition, immunofluorescence experiments showed that endogenous Ago2 co-localized with Lsm1 in P-bodies (

Interestingly, over-expressing YFP-RCK/p54 increased the average number of P-bodies in every cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, compare a and d). To confirm that the localization of Ago2 and Lsm1 to P-bodies was not the result of over-expression in transiently transfected cells, we immunostained cells with antibodies to endogenous Ago2 and Lsm1 and found that the localization of Ago2 and Lsm1 to P-bodies (

        <p>To visualize protein–protein interactions in vivo, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) as a probe. In FRET, a fluorescent donor molecule transfers energy via a nonradiative dipole–dipole interaction to an acceptor molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b046">46</xref>]. We used a well-known donor: acceptor fluorescent-protein pair, CFP:YFP, with a Förster distance (R<sub>0</sub>) of 4.9 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b047">47</xref>]. To determine whether Ago1 and Ago2 interacted in vivo with each other and with RCK/p54, we measured the FRET efficiency between the donor, CFP-Ago2, and acceptor, YFP-RCK/p54. To do so, we used a method in which the donor signal lost during FRET is restored by deliberately photobleaching the acceptor fluorophore to abolish its capacity as an energy acceptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b048">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b050">50</xref>]. In cells expressing YFP-RCK/p54 and CFP-Ago2, the FRET efficiency was 21.07% ± 2.52% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g001">Figure 1</xref>C and 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g001">1</xref>D). In cells expressing CFP-Ago2 and YFP-Lsm1, FRET efficiency was not significant (1.62% ± 1.11%), corroborating our immunoprecipitation results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Furthermore, cells co-expressing YFP-RCK/p54 and CFP showed no significant FRET efficiency (1.64% ± 1.28%). Similar to the YFP-RCK/p54 and CFP-Ago2 pair, YFP-Ago1 and CFP-Ago2 showed an efficient FRET (19.61% ± 4.51%), indicating a direct interaction between Ago1 and Ago2 in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b028">28</xref>].
				</p>
        <p>Interestingly, the FRET efficiency between Ago1 and Ago2 decreased to 12.13% ± 1.6% when we used CFP-Ago1 and YFP-Ago2, indicating that the energy transfer efficiencies were sensitive to the orientation of donor: acceptor pair in the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. Moreover, only moderate energy transfer efficiency (6.41% ± 1.96%) was seen when YFP-RCK/p54 and CFP-Ago1 were used in FRET experiments, suggesting that this donor: acceptor pair was not as ideally oriented for an efficient energy transfer as the pair CFP-Ago1 and YFP-Ago2. Alternatively, RCK/p54-Ago1-Ago2 is assembled in an RNP complex where the donor: acceptor pair is affected by the location of the probe. Nonetheless, the efficiency of energy transfer was well above the background control (0.99%). As a control experiment, cells co-expressing YFP-Ago1 and CFP showed no significant FRET efficiency (0.99% ± 0.67%). Taken together, these results indicate that Ago1 and Ago2 directly interact in vivo with each other and with RCK/p54.</p>

        <title>Depletion of RCK/p54 Does Not Affect RNAi Activity In Vivo</title>
        <p>To examine whether the P-body protein RCK/p54, also a component of RISC, is involved in siRNA-mediated gene silencing, the siRNA dose dependence of RNAi-mediated gene silencing was quantified in RCK/p54-depleted HeLa cells using a dual fluorescence reporter assay. Briefly, GFP and red fluorescent protein (RFP) were constitutively expressed in cells transfected with reporter plasmids for enhanced GFP (EGFP) and RFP, respectively. GFP expression was silenced by treating cells with a 21-nt siRNA targeting nt 238–258 of the EGFP mRNA. The fluorescence intensity ratio of target (GFP) to control (RFP) fluorophore was determined in the presence of siRNA duplexes and normalized to that observed in control-treated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b052">52</xref>].
				</p>
        <p>When HeLa cells were transfected with siRNA mismatched for CDK9 (control), the second transfection with GFP siRNA silenced GFP expression in a dose-dependent manner, i.e., GFP/RFP ratios decreased with increasing concentrations of siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, gray bars). Depleting RCK/p54 before quantifying GFP silencing resulted in moderate to no significant loss of RNAi activity, i.e., GFP/RFP again decreased with increasing concentrations of siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, green bars). Similarly, depleting Lsm1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, red bars) and the decapping enzyme, Dcp2 (unpublished data), before quantifying GFP silencing in HeLa cells did not significantly decrease RNAi activity. In contrast, prior depletion of Ago2 completely abolished RNAi activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, blue bars), as expected and consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b016">16</xref>].

        <title>RCK/p54 Represses General and miRNA-Mediated Translation</title>
        <p>Our results thus far demonstrate that RCK/p54 is a component of human RISC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g002">Figures 2</xref> and

Our data also show that siRNA-mediated RNAi may not require RCK/p54 and P-body cytoplasmic structures. Since we also identified that RCK/p54 associates with miRISC, we hypothesized that RCK/p54 might function in miRNA-mediated suppression of translation. A recent and intriguing report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b045">45</xref>] identified a yeast homolog of RCK/p54, Dhh1p, which activates decapping and facilitates P-body formation, as a general translation repressor. We therefore reasoned that RCK/p54 might be a general translation repressor used by the miRNA machinery to dictate translation suppression of target mRNAs. To test this hypothesis, we first determined whether RCK/p54 was a general translation repressor in human cells. To this end, RCK/p54 expression was silenced in HeLa cells and general translational activity was analyzed by [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g007">Figure 7</xref>A).

        <p>Since RCK/p54 is a general translational repressor and a component of human RISC, we examined the effects of depleting RCK/p54 and disrupting P-bodies on siRNA- and miRNA-mediated gene silencing. To analyze siRNA- or miRNA-mediated gene-silencing events, we chose a well-established CXCR4 mRNA reporter system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b056">56</xref>], in which siRNA- or miRNA-reporter constructs harbor 1 × perfectly matched or 4 × bulged CXCR4 siRNA target sites, respectively, in the 3′ UTR of

Depletion of RCK/p54 released only miRNA-mediated gene suppression and had no effect on siRNA-mediated gene silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). Depletion of GW182, an argonaute-interacting P-body protein, released gene suppression by miRNA, consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b041">41</xref>], and moderately released siRNA-mediated gene silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b040">40</xref>,

Knockdown of Lsm1 had no significant effect on either miRNA- or siRNA-mediated gene silencing. Taken together, these results show that RCK/p54 depletion releases miRNA-mediated translation suppression of reporter genes, but does not affect siRNA-mediated RNAi.
				</p>
        <p>We next hypothesized that the expression of a specific cellular protein, known to be controlled by miRNAs, might be up-regulated in RCK/p54-depleted cells. Such a protein, human RAS, has been elegantly shown by Slack and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b013">13</xref>] to be regulated by the 
					<italic>let</italic>-7 miRNA family. To test our hypothesis, we analyzed RAS protein levels in HeLa cells under two conditions: either 
					<italic>let</italic>-7 function was inhibited by 2′-
					<italic>O</italic>-Me oligonucleotides complementary to the 
					<italic>let</italic>-7 sequence or RCK/p54 was depleted by RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g007">Figure 7</xref>C). For control experiments, we treated cells with a CDK9 mm siRNA and a 2′ -
					<italic>O</italic>-Me oligonucleotide complementary to HIV-1 TAR RNA sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b053">53</xref>]. Total cellular protein extracts from equal numbers of cells were prepared and analyzed by immunoblot using monoclonal anti-RAS antibodies directly conjugated with HRP (see 
					<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Actin protein levels were measured as a control using HRP-conjugated anti-actin primary antibody. When cells were treated with 
					<italic>let</italic>-7 inhibitor, RAS protein levels increased, consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b013">13</xref>]. Strikingly, RAS protein expression in RCK/p54-depleted cells also showed a robust increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g007">Figure 7</xref>C) while RAS levels were not significantly affected when cells were treated with control siRNA or 2′-

        <p>To further probe our findings of endogenous RAS regulation by RCK/p54, we co-transfected HeLa cells with RAS 3′ UTR reporter constructs and

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have identified RCK/p54 as a protein that interacts with Ago2 in affinity-purified RISC assemblies to facilitate formation of cytoplasmic P-bodies and that acts as a general translational repressor in human cells. We have shown that depletion of RCK/p54 disrupts P-bodies and disperses the cytoplasmic localization of Ago2. Furthermore, depletion of RCK/p54 did not significantly affect the RNAi function of RISC, although general, miRNA-mediated, and 
				<italic>let</italic>-7-mediated translational repression were released. Together, our results provide significant insights into miRNA mechanisms in human cells (see below).
			</p>
      <p>Several recent reports show that RISC co-localizes with P-bodies, suggesting that they could be the site where RISC degrades target mRNA or represses mRNA translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b031">31</xref>]. Isolation of miRNAs on polysomes also links the suppression of protein synthesis with arrest of translation initiation or elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b029">29</xref>]. These studies also demonstrated that human Ago1 and Ago2 co-localize in P-bodies with other cellular proteins, such as Dcp1a, Dcp2, GW182, Lsm1, and Xrn1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b031">31</xref>]. A homolog of the P-body protein GW182 in 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content> is the developmental timing regulator AIN-1, which also interacts with miRISCs and may target argonaute proteins to P-bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b057">57</xref>]. To dissect and understand the relationship between RNAi function and P-bodies, we affinity-purified RISC using Myc-Ago2 and expression vectors of the YFP-tagged P-body proteins, Lsm1, RCK/p54, Dcp2, and eIF4E. Ago2 interacted with these various P-body components in ways that were RNA-dependent or RNA-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Ago1 and RCK/p54 immunoprecipitated with Ago2 after RNase A treatment of HeLa cell extracts, suggesting that these proteins directly interact with Ago2. Interestingly, RCK/p54, Ago1, and Ago2 were also identified as a component of active RISC programmed with siRNA or miRNA and purified by biotin affinity to streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g002">Figures 2</xref> and 
				<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g003">3</xref>). We examined the P-body localization of Ago2 with Lsm1 and RCK/p54 by co-expressing YFP-tagged Lsm1 and RCK/p54 with CFP-Ago2. Interestingly, overexpressing YFP-RCK/p54 in HeLa cells increased the number of P-bodies (from ∼ 8 to ∼ 20 foci/cell). The number of P-bodies containing CFP-Ago2 also increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). These results suggested a functional relationship between RCK/p54-Ago interactions and their localization to P-bodies. To visualize protein–protein interactions in vivo, we used FRET as a probe. In cells expressing YFP-RCK/p54 and CFP-Ago2, the FRET efficiency was 21.07% ± 2.52% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g001">Figure 1</xref>C and 
				<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g001">1</xref>D). We also observed an efficient FRET between YFP-Ago1 and CFP-Ago2; however, FRET between RCK/p54 and Ago1 was moderate (6.41% ± 1.96%). Since FRET is quite sensitive to the orientation of the donor: acceptor pair, it is possible that CFP and YFP in Ago1 and RCK/p54 are not suitably positioned for efficient energy transfer. Nonetheless, the FRET efficiency between Ago1 and RCK/p54 was significantly above the 0.9% background. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Ago1, Ago2, and RCK/p54 directly interact in vivo.
			</p>
      <p>Where in the cell does this physical interaction between RISC and RCK/p54 take place and does it require P-body structures? To address these questions, we disrupted P-bodies in cells by depleting Lsm1 and immunopurified endogenous miRISC, and analyzed its ability to cleave a target mRNA with perfect complementarity to 
				<italic>let</italic>-7 miRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g005">Figure 5</xref>). We observed no significant difference in miRISC activities purified from Lsm1-depleted and non-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g003">Figures 3</xref> and 
				<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g005">5</xref>) even though the P-body structures were disrupted and the total number of P-bodies per cell had significantly decreased. These results show that RCK/p54 association with RISC does not require P-bodies and suggest that localization of RISC to P-bodies is the outcome of translation repression by miRISC.
			</p>
      <p>Having established the physical interactions of RCK/p54 with RISC, we questioned the functional relevance of these interactions in the RNAi pathway and how they could facilitate RISC activity. To that end, we depleted RCK/p54 in HeLa cells and analyzed RNAi activities in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Depletion of RCK/p54 clearly disrupted the P-body structures and dispersed Ago2 localization throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Surprisingly, depleting RCK/p54 did not significantly affect siRNA-mediated gene silencing. Similar results showing the lack of P-body involvement in RNAi have been reported in 
				<italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b039">39</xref>]. In that system, depletion of the P-body proteins, GW182 or Dcp1:Dcp2 decapping complex, showed that these proteins were required for miRNA-mediated gene silencing
				<italic>,</italic> but RNAi efficiency was not affected, suggesting that these two gene-silencing mechanisms were independent in 
				<italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b039">39</xref>]. In addition, two recent studies reported that mammalian GW182 interacts with Ago2 and plays a role in miRNA function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b040">40</xref>] and in siRNA-mediated RNAi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b041">41</xref>]. Interestingly, depleting GW182 disrupted cytoplasmic foci and interfered with RNAi activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b041">41</xref>]. It is possible that GW182 is directly involved in human RISC function and does not spatially require P-bodies for its function. As an alternative approach to disrupting P-bodies, we treated HeLa cells with the translation inhibitor, cycloheximide, which did not significantly affect RNAi activities in vivo and in vitro (unpublished data). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that functional siRISC is assembled before locating to P-bodies, and P-bodies are not prerequisite sites for siRNA-mediated gene silencing.

      <p>To determine the role of RCK/p54 in miRNA-mediated translation repression, we used a CXCR4 reporter system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b056">56</xref>], in which siRNA- or miRNA-reporter constructs harbor 1 × perfectly matched or 4 × bulged CXCR4 siRNA target sites, respectively in the 3′ UTR of RL mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b056">56</xref>]. In this system, perfectly matched sequences are cleaved via siRISC and bulge-containing sequences are targets for translation suppression by miRISC. We observed that depletion of RCK/p54 released only miRNA-mediated gene suppression and had no effect on siRNA-mediated gene silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). Depletion of GW182, an argonaute-interacting P-body protein, released gene suppression by miRNA and moderately affected reporter constructs containing perfectly matched target sequences, consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b041">41</xref>]. Ago2 depletion significantly released siRNA-mediated gene silencing and moderately affected reporters containing 4 × bulged sequences. Knockdown of Lsm1 had no significant effect on either miRNA- or siRNA-mediated gene silencing. These results show that RCK/p54 depletion releases miRNA-mediated translation suppression of reporter genes and that this function of RCK/p54 was not significantly affected when P-bodies were disrupted by depleting Lsm1.
			</p>
      <p>To test our hypothesis that RCK/p54 mediates the translational repression of endogenous miRNA targets in P-bodies, we examined RAS protein levels in RCK/p54-depleted cells. We chose RAS because it is an endogenous target of 
				<italic>let</italic>-7
				<italic>,</italic> and 3′ UTRs of human 
				<italic>RAS</italic> genes contain multiple complementary sites for 
				<italic>let</italic>-7 to bind and regulate RAS expression levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b013">13</xref>]. Furthermore, 
				<italic>let</italic>-7 inhibitors are known to enhance RAS protein expression in HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b013">13</xref>]. Depleting RCK/p54 in HeLa cells up-regulated RAS protein, and this increase in RAS levels was higher than that in general translation of control actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g007">Figure 7</xref>C), suggesting that multiple sites of 
				<italic>let</italic>-7 miRISC binding to target 3′ UTR dictate the potency and specificity of translation suppression.
			</p>
      <p>RCK/p54, the human homolog of yeast Dhh1p, is a member of the ATP-dependent DEAD box helicase family and was originally identified as a proto-oncogene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b042">42</xref>]. In human cells, RCK/p54 interacts in P-bodies with the translation initiation factor, eIF4E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b033">33</xref>]. The 
				<italic>Xenopus</italic> homolog of RCK/p54, Xp54, which interacts with eIF4E and forms RNA-dependent oligomers, represses the translation of mRNA in oocytes and eggs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b043">43</xref>]. In yeast, Dhh1p interacts with the decapping and deadenylase complex and functions in translational repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b044">44</xref>]. Dhh1p has recently been shown to stimulate translational repression by inhibiting production of the pre-initiation complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b045">45</xref>]. Dhh1p and RCK/p54 also inhibit the mRNA translation driven by internal ribosomal entry sites in vitro, suggesting that this protein is a general translational repressor that may not require a cap structure for its function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b045">45</xref>]. However, the in vivo function of Dhh1p required translational initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b045">45</xref>]. Translation repression by miRISC and P-body localization require the 5′-cap structure in the target mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b029">29</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b058">58</xref>], which provides a unique and elegant control mechanism for translation and its regulation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b059">59</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b060">60</xref>]). Recently, Petersen et al. reported an intriguing study showing that miRNA represses translation after initiation by a ribosome drop-off mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b061">61</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that RCK/p54 interacts with miRISC and blocks translation elongation by binding to its multiple target sites with high affinity and creates a barrier for elongating ribosomes (see below).
			</p>
      <p>We therefore propose that the function of RISC assemblies in cells can be described by a model with two independent pathways, depending on whether RNAi is programmed by the guide strand of siRNA or miRNA. In the first pathway, the RISC recognizes a perfectly matched target mRNA and functions as siRISC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g008">Figure 8</xref>) by cleaving its target mRNA. This target mRNA cleavage activity and rapid turnover of siRISC induce the subsequent target mRNA degradation by exonucleases and does not require P-bodies. In the second pathway, the RISC recognizes the imperfectly matched target and functions as miRISC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Multiple copies of miRISC containing RCK/p54 could initiate an oligomerization event that sequesters the whole RNP and transports it to the P-bodies. This sequestration could also explain the cooperative effects of RISC function that enhance translation repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b056">56</xref>]. Once in P-bodies, translationally repressed mRNA could stay in oligomeric structures for storage or it could form a complex with decapping enzymes and cap binding proteins that would lead to the mRNA decay pathway. In other words, the miRNA in RISC could provide the sequence specificity and RCK/p54 could be the effector molecule that shuttles the target mRNA toward the fate of storage or processing in P-bodies. Since P-bodies are not a prerequisite for RCK/p54 to assemble into RISC or to function, it is possible that miRISC blocks protein synthesis by enhancing the ribosome drop-off during elongation of translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b061">61</xref>]. We propose that miRISC localization to P-bodies is the outcome of translation repression and not a prerequisite for miRISC function. Stored mRNA in P-bodies could reenter the active translation or mRNA decay pathway depending upon cellular conditions or stimuli that are presently unknown. How long mRNA translation can be repressed in the cytoplasm and which factors trigger mRNA transport to P-bodies are exciting areas for future research.

Multiple numbers 
						<italic>(n)</italic> of miRISC bind to target mRNA by forming a bulge sequence in the middle that is not suitable for RNA cleavage, accumulate in P-bodies, and repress translation by exploiting global translational suppressors such as RCK/p54. The translationally repressed mRNA is either stored in P-bodies or enters the mRNA decay pathway for destruction. Depending upon cellular conditions and stimuli, stored mRNA can either re-enter the translation or mRNA decay pathways.

      <p>Our results on the interactions between RCK/p54 and the RNAi machinery suggest an intriguing role for miRNA function in development and carcinogenesis. However, most targets of miRNA have not yet been identified. A growing body of evidence suggests that miRNAs are important in human disease, including cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b012">12</xref>]. For example, relatively low levels of 
				<italic>let</italic>-7 miRNA up-regulate RAS protein in lung cancer cells, demonstrating a possible role of miRNA in tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b013">13</xref>]. Two homologs of RCK/p54, Xp54 in

				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b063">63</xref>]. Altered regulation of RCK/p54 expression levels has been implicated in the development of human colorectal tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b064">64</xref>,

Overexpression of RCK/p54 and Dhh1p increases the number of Ago2-containing P-bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g001">Figure 1</xref>B; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b033">33</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b045">45</xref>]), suggesting that RCK/p54 is a critical factor in controlling cellular translation. Our results have identified RCK/p54 as an essential component of miRISC-mediated translation repression and provide a functional link between miRISC and P-bodies. In the context of spatially and temporally restricted miRNA expression, this system allows for exquisite regulation of protein expression by target mRNA. Therefore, perturbations of either miRNA or RCK/p54 expression levels can have deleterious consequences for the cell. What determines the balance between active translation and repression of mRNAs targeted by miRISC, and how cells control the specificity of this repression are key directions for future investigation.
