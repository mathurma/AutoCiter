<p>A study of acute lung injury reveals the involvement of transcription factor HIF1A in lung protection, where normoxic HIF1A stabilization functions to control alveolar epithelial glucose metabolism.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract><sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>While acute lung injury (ALI) contributes significantly to critical illness, it resolves spontaneously in many instances. The majority of patients experiencing ALI require mechanical ventilation. Therefore, we hypothesized that mechanical ventilation and concomitant stretch-exposure of pulmonary epithelia could activate endogenous pathways important in lung protection.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methods and Findings</title>
<p>To examine transcriptional responses during ALI, we exposed pulmonary epithelia to cyclic mechanical stretch conditions—an in vitro model resembling mechanical ventilation. A genome-wide screen revealed a transcriptional response similar to hypoxia signaling. Surprisingly, we found that stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor 1A (HIF1A) during stretch conditions in vitro or during ventilator-induced ALI in vivo occurs under normoxic conditions. Extension of these findings identified a functional role for stretch-induced inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in mediating normoxic HIF1A stabilization, concomitant increases in glycolytic capacity, and improved tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle function. Pharmacologic studies with HIF activator or inhibitor treatment implicated HIF1A-stabilization in attenuating pulmonary edema and lung inflammation during ALI in vivo. Systematic deletion of HIF1A in the lungs, endothelia, myeloid cells, or pulmonary epithelia linked these findings to alveolar-epithelial HIF1A. In vivo analysis of <sup>13</sup>C-glucose metabolites utilizing liquid-chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry demonstrated that increases in glycolytic capacity, improvement of mitochondrial respiration, and concomitant attenuation of lung inflammation during ALI were specific for alveolar-epithelial expressed HIF1A.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>These studies reveal a surprising role for HIF1A in lung protection during ALI, where normoxic HIF1A stabilization and HIF-dependent control of alveolar-epithelial glucose metabolism function as an endogenous feedback loop to dampen lung inflammation.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Acute lung injury is a devastating lung disease caused by injuries or acute infections to the lung. In patients it manifests itself as acute respiratory distress syndrome. Severe pulmonary edema and uncontrolled lung inflammation are typical symptoms of acute lung injury, which make it hard for patients to breath efficiently. In the clinical course of the disease, patients require mechanical ventilation to support their lung function and to provide sufficient oxygen levels to vital organs such as the brain, the heart, or the kidneys. We hypothesized that stretch conditions—such as those that occur during mechanical ventilation—result in transcriptional adaptation of alveolar epithelial cells—the innermost lining of the lungs. In this study we identified an unexpected involvement of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor HIF1A in lung protection. We observed that during acute lung injury, stabilization of HIF1A is mediated by increased levels of succinate, an intermediate product of the citrate cycle. Interestingly, we show that HIF1A in alveolar epithelia functions to induce a transcriptional program that improves the efficiency of carbohydrate metabolism by injured lungs, thereby helping to adapt to the injurious conditions of mechanical stretch and to reduce lung inflammation. These preclinical findings highlight the potential for pharmacological HIF1A stabilization in the treatment of acute lung injury.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Acute lung injury (ALI) is an inflammatory disease of the lungs that is characterized by hypoxemic respiratory failure with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, not attributable to left heart failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Ware1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Eltzschig2">[4]</xref>. Among the hallmarks of ALI are severe arterial hypoxemia and uncontrolled accumulation of inflammatory cells into different compartments of the lungs, in conjunction with cytokine release and inflammatory activation of recruited or resident cells. Particularly alveolar epithelial injury plays a key role in the pathogenesis of ALI, leading to disruptions of the alveolar-capillary barrier function, resulting in extensive pulmonary edema, attenuated gas exchange, and uncontrolled lung inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Eckle1">[2]</xref>. While there is currently no specific therapy available, management consists of aggressive treatment of the initiating cause, vigilant supportive care, and the prevention of nosocomial infections. From a clinical perspective, it is important to point out that ALI is among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality of patients requiring critical care medicine. For example, a large scale prospective, population-based, cohort study indicates that each year in the United States there are close to 200,000 cases of ALI, which are associated with 74,500 deaths and 3.6 million hospital days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Rubenfeld1">[5]</xref>. Moreover, long-term disabilities in ALI survivors are significant. A landmark study who followed ALI survivors over 5 years revealed that exercise limitation, physical and psychological sequelae, decreased physical quality of life, as well as increased costs and use of health care services are important legacies of severe lung injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Herridge1">[6]</xref>. Taken together, these studies highlight the importance for finding novel ALI treatment approaches with the goal to dampen excessive lung inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Eckle1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Sitkovsky1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Eltzschig3">[9]</xref> or to support its resolution phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Serhan1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Garibaldi1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>While ALI has a major impact on the morbidity and mortality of patients requiring critical care medicine and mechanically ventilation, many episodes of ALI are self-limiting, and resolve spontaneously through molecular pathways that are transcriptionally controlled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Serhan1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Serhan3">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Buckley1">[17]</xref>. In spite of profound inflammatory responses to surgery and mechanical ventilation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Pillai1">[18]</xref>, patients undergoing major thoracic surgery for lung cancer have an overall incidence of ALI of less than 5% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Licker1">[19]</xref>, open heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass less than 0.5% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Milot1">[20]</xref>, or kidney transplantation of less than 0.2% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Shorr1">[21]</xref>. Based on these clinical observations, we hypothesized that innate adaptive pathways exist that dampen acute pulmonary edema and lung inflammation during ALI in mechanically ventilated patients.</p>
<p>To identify novel endogenous pathways important for lung protection and ALI resolution that are turned on by mechanical ventilation, we utilized stretch exposure of pulmonary epithelial cells as a single-cell-based in vitro model for ventilator-induced ALI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Koeppen1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Eckle2">[23]</xref>. Very surprisingly, genome-wide microarray screening for alterations in gene transcription of human pulmonary epithelial cells exposed to cyclic mechanical stretch conditions revealed a transcriptional response that shared many similarities with ambient hypoxia exposure. Subsequent studies identified a molecular pathway resulting in normoxic stabilization of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor HIF1A during stretch conditions in vitro or during ALI induced by mechanical ventilation in vivo.</p>
<p>HIF is a transcription factor that is critical for tissue adaptation to conditions of hypoxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Eltzschig2">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Kaelin1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Taylor1">[31]</xref>. More recently, HIF has also been implicated in the control of immune responses during inflammatory processes including ischemia and reperfusion, cancer or mucosal inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Eltzschig1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Eltzschig2">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Eckle3">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Nizet1">[34]</xref>. Sites of acute inflammation are frequently characterized by considerable shifts in the supply and demand of metabolites that result in limited oxygen availability (inflammation-associated hypoxia) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Sitkovsky1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Sitkovsky2">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Eltzschig4">[38]</xref>. Consistent with a role for hypoxia-signaling in cellular adaptation to conditions of limited oxygen availability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Taylor1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Colgan1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Colgan2">[39]</xref>, several studies implicate hypoxia-dependent signaling pathways in the attenuation of mucosal inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Sitkovsky1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Rosenberger1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Eckle4">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Tambuwala1">[43]</xref>. Surprisingly and in contrast to some of the above studies on inflammatory hypoxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Colgan1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Taylor2">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Karhausen1">[44]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Cummins1">[45]</xref>, we observed that pulmonary stabilization of HIF1A during ALI occurs under normoxic conditions. Consistent with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Selak1">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Koivunen2">[48]</xref>, our findings implicate a metabolic pathway in normoxic HIF stabilization, including stretch-induced inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity. In fact, previous studies had indicated that normoxic stabilization of HIF in cancer involves inhibition or mutation of the metabolic enzyme SDH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Selak1">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Koivunen2">[48]</xref>. Extension of these initial findings utilizing pharmacologic and genetic models of hypoxia-signaling during ALI revealed that HIF controls a functional link between alveolar epithelial metabolism and lung inflammation during ALI, thus implicating pharmacologic strategies to activate these HIF-dependent metabolic pathways for ALI treatment. Indeed, compounds such as HIF activators have been used safely in patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Bernhardt1">[49]</xref>.</p>

<title>Cyclic Mechanical Stretch of Alveolar Epithelia Is Associated with a Transcriptional Program Resembling Hypoxia-Signaling</title>
<p>Previous studies had demonstrated that ALI is associated with significant alterations of gene-expression that frequently resembles endogenous adaptive responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Eckle1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Sitkovsky1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Sitkovsky2">[35]</xref>. To systematically examine alterations of pulmonary gene expression during ALI, we utilized a simple in vitro model of ALI by exposing human pulmonary epithelia to cyclic mechanical stretch conditions. This in vitro model resembles alveolar injury as occurs during ventilator-induced ALI in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Koeppen1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Eckle2">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Eckle4">[40]</xref>. For this purpose, we examined human alveolar epithelial cells (Calu-3) following 24 h stretch exposure at 30% intensity by performing a genome microarray screen (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE27128" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE27128</ext-link>). We subsequently confirmed the array results utilizing real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting for a subset of genes that were regulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001665.s009">Table S1</xref>). Surprisingly, computerized pathway analysis to examine alterations in gene transcription (Ingenuity IPA, Version 11631407) revealed that hypoxia-signaling resembled the dominant stress response pathway when comparing stretch-exposed pulmonary epithelia to un-stretched controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g001">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001665.s001">Figure S1</xref>). In fact, subsequent studies of Calu-3 pulmonary epithelia exposed to different time-periods of stretch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) or studies utilizing a HIF reporter plasmid transfected into pulmonary epithelia (A549) and exposed to stretch conditions revealed stabilization of HIF1A—the key transcription factor for hypoxia adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Semenza2">[30]</xref>. Similarly, exposure to different degrees of cyclic mechanical stretch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) showed stretch-dose-dependent stabilization of HIF1A. Moreover, studies in primary human alveolar epithelial cells demonstrated robust HIF1A stabilization following stretch exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). To examine if HIF1A stabilization during stretch has functional consequences, we generated pulmonary epithelial cell lines with stable siRNA-mediated repression of HIF1A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001665.s002">Figure S2A–C</xref>). As HIF1A functions as an important regulator of glycolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Semenza3">[50]</xref> we first explored the possibility of stretch controlling transcription of glycolytic enzymes. Exposure of control-transduced pulmonary epithelial cells demonstrated very robust induction of the transcript levels for phosphofructokinase m (PFKM), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001665.s003">Figure S3A</xref>), and lactate dehydrogenase a (LDHA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g001">Figure 1F</xref>) with stretch exposure. In contrast, stretch-induced induction of glycolytic enzymes was completely abolished in pulmonary epithelial cells with HIF1A repression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001665.s003">Figure S3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). Similarly, stretch-induced increases of lactate levels in their supernatant or increases in glycolytic flux as measured by metabolic turnover of <sup>13</sup>C-labeled glucose during stretch were HIF1A-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g001">Figure 1G, H</xref>). These findings were specific for HIF1A, as cells with pulmonary epithelial cells with siRNA-mediated HIF2A repression behaved similar to controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001665.s002">Figures S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001665.s003">S3</xref>). Together, these studies demonstrate stabilization of HIF1A during cyclic mechanical stretch exposure of human pulmonary epithelial cells in vitro and reveal transcriptional and functional consequences of HIF1A stabilization on carbohydrate metabolism.</p>

<title>Stretch-Induced HIF1A Stabilization Occurs Under Normoxic Conditions and Requires Stretch-Elicited Inhibition of SDH</title>
<p>Based on the above findings that identified stabilization and increased transcriptional and functional activity of HIF1A during cyclic mechanical stretch conditions, we next pursued studies to address the mechanism of stretch-induced HIF1A stabilization. As a first option, we considered the possibility that stretch-associated increases in oxygen consumption could lead to a decrease in oxygen availability, and subsequent hypoxic stabilization of HIF1A. Previous studies had shown that shifts in cellular oxygen levels between the cytosol and the mitochondria—as caused by nitric oxide—can cause HIF stabilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Hagen1">[51]</xref>. To address this possibility, we performed measurements of oxygen partial pressures within the supernatant of stretched pulmonary epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Haeberle1">[52]</xref>. However, we observed high oxygen partial pressures in controls or stretched pulmonary epithelial cells, indicating that HIF1A stabilization during stretch occurs under normoxic conditions. Previous studies had indicated that normoxic stabilization of HIF in cancer involves inhibition or mutation of the metabolic enzyme SDH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Selak1">[46]</xref>. These studies demonstrate that mutations of SDH are associated with inhibition of prolylhydroxylases (PHDs)—a group of enzymes responsible for tagging HIF for proteasomal degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Kaelin1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Kaelin3">[53]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Epstein1">[55]</xref>—thereby causing normoxic HIF stabilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Selak1">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Koivunen2">[48]</xref>. To examine the possibility that stretch-induced HIF1A stabilization could involve SDH inhibition, we next examined the consequences of pulmonary epithelial stretch exposure on SDH activity. We observed that stretch exposure was associated with a very robust attenuation of SDH activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). To address if increased succinate levels with following PHD inhibition were the mechanism for HIF1A stabilization associated with low SDH activity, we generated cells with siRNA repression of succinate-CoA ligase (SUCLG; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). While SDH inhibition leads to the accumulation of succinate and succinate-elicited PHD inhibition, SUCLG deletion would prevent the conversion of succinate-CoA to succinate and thereby lower succinate levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Selak1">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Koivunen2">[48]</xref>.

<p>To further address the possibility of stretch-elicited inhibition of SDH as a mechanism of normoxic HIF stabilization, we next performed studies with cell permeable α-ketoglutarate in studies on succinate-dependent HIF1A stabilization. Earlier studies found that succinate-mediated inhibition of PHD is competitive and is reversed by pharmacologically elevating intracellular α-ketoglutarate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-MacKenzie1">[56]</xref>. Introduction of α-ketoglutarate derivatives restores normal PHD activity and HIF1A levels and thereby alleviates pseudo-hypoxia. In fact and as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, α-ketoglutarate treatment prevented HIF1A stabilization in pulmonary epithelia at 8 and 24 h of stretch.</p>
<p>To address possible mechanisms of stretch/stress-induced SDH inhibition, we next pursued studies on the effect of stretch on stress kinases. Recent studies found enhanced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation following stretch of lung epithelia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Cohen1">[57]</xref>. As such we measured SDH activity during stretch with and without inhibitors of JNK, ERK, or p38. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g002">Figure 2F–H</xref>, inhibition of these MAPKs abolished stretch-mediated SDH inhibition. Based on reports of normoxic HIF1A stabilization by pro-inflammatory cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Jiang1">[58]</xref>, we next tested for stretch-induced HIF1A expression under conditions of neutralization of TNFA or IL-6 using neutralizing antibodies. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g002">Figure 2I</xref>, TNFA or IL-6 neutralizing antibodies blunted stretch-mediated HIF1A stabilization in lung epithelia. As TNFA is able to up-regulate stress kinases such as p38 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Chen1">[59]</xref>, these findings indicate that TNFA release by stretched pulmonary epithelia might be involved in the up-regulation of stress kinases with concomitant inhibition of SDH activity.</p>
<p>To address the functional consequences of HIF on stretch-associated alterations of metabolism beyond anaerobic glycolysis, we next examined tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) flux and mitochondrial functions of human pulmonary epithelial cells (Calu-3) following siRNA-mediated HIF1A repression. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, studies tracing different cellular metabolites in the presence of labeled glucose (<sup>13</sup>C-glucose) revealed that TCA flux was significantly increased in control cells, but not following siRNA-mediated HIF1A repression. As HIF1A functions to improve mitochondrial respiration and concomitant ATP production during hypoxia, we next assessed if HIF1A-dependent TCA flux increases during normoxia could be associated with increases of HIF1A-dependent mitochondrial complex IV (COX4) activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Fukuda1">[60]</xref>. In fact, stretch exposure was associated with increased COX4 activity and ATP levels in controls, but not in pulmonary epithelial cells with HIF1A repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g003">Figure 3B,C</xref>). Together, these findings indicate that HIF1A optimizes metabolic functions during stretch conditions in vitro.</p>

<p>We next performed studies to better understand increases in TCA substrate flux despite up-regulation of PDK1. As shown, stretch stress causes normoxic HIF1A stabilization and HIF1A-dependent glycolytic enzymes expression. Among them pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzym 1 (PDK1) is up-regulated. This enzyme is not to be confused with phosphoinositide-dependent-kinase-1 (also abbreviated PDK1). The pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzym 1 (PDK1) phosphorylates the enzyme of the same name (specifically PDE1), which is the major component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). Phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase at serine residue 1 of 3 possible ones by PDK1 will almost completely inhibit activity of the PDC. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g001">Figure 1G</xref>, inhibition of the PDC fits well with increased production of lactate, as pyruvate is expected to accumulate because it is less metabolized in the first step of the TCA controlled by PDC activity. However, how does up-regulation of PDK1, a master inhibitor of the PDC, fit to a several-fold increase in TCA/C13-Gucose ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). To address this question, we next measured mitochondrial PDC activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Lib1">[61]</xref> during stretch conditions. In particular, we measured the activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g003">Figure 3D</xref> we found increases of PDH activity in a HIF1A-dependent manner upon stretch. These findings further supports our hypothesis of normoxic HIF1A stabilization and HIF1A-dependent increases of TCA cycle activity despite findings of PDK1 mRNA induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001665.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Consistent with a mitochondrial dysfunction in HIF1A knock-down cells, we next observed increased reactive oxygen species (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Moreover, markers for epithelial cell inflammation were elevated in Calu-3 cells with HIF1A repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g003">Figure 3F–G</xref>). Similarly to the metabolic alterations, these findings were specific for HIF1A, since HIF2A knockdown cells showed similar responses as controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001665.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). Together, these findings indicate a functional role for normoxic HIF1A stabilization during conditions of cyclic mechanical stretch in attenuating pulmonary epithelial inflammation by optimizing cellular metabolism of carbohydrates.</p>

<title>Ventilator-Induced ALI Is Associated with Normoxic HIF1A Stabilization in Vivo</title>
<p>After having observed a transcriptional hypoxia-program in pulmonary epithelia exposed to stretch conditions in vitro, we went on to examine HIF1A during in vivo conditions of ALI. For this purpose, we utilized a previously described model of mechanical ventilation-induced ALI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Eckle2">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Eckle4">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Eckle5">[62]</xref>. We gained initial insight from immune-histochemical studies of pulmonary tissues following exposure to ALI. Consistent with in vitro studies of stretch exposure, we observed increased HIF1A staining following ALI induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Similarly, Western blotting indicated that HIF1A stabilization during ALI is time-dependent and occurs more pronounced with increased stretch conditions—such as those encountered during mechanical ventilation at higher inspiratory pressure levels (35 mbar versus 45 mbar; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g004">Figure 4B,C</xref>). In addition, we examined pulmonary HIF1A levels utilizing a previously characterized HIF reporter mouse model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Safran1">[63]</xref>. Consistent with the above studies utilizing Western blotting for HIF1A, we observed elevated HIF1A levels following ALI induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Interestingly, studies utilizing different concentrations of oxygen in the inspired air during ventilator-induced ALI (20% oxygen versus 100% oxygen) demonstrated that HIF1A stabilization is not affected by increasing the level of inspired oxygen concentration—suggesting that HIF1A stabilization occurs under conditions with sufficient oxygen availability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Similarly to stretch-associated HIF stabilization, we observed robust repression of SDH activity following exposure to ALI induced by mechanical ventilation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g004">Figure 4F</xref>), thereby implicating SDH-associated increases in succinate in the normoxic stabilization of HIF during ALI.

<title>Pharmacologic HIF1A Stabilization Attenuates Lung Inflammation and Pulmonary Edema During ALI</title>
<p>Based on the above finding that HIF1A is stabilized during ALI, we next performed pharmacologic studies to address the functional role of HIF1A stabilization on ALI outcomes. First, we utilized the HIF1A activator dimethyl-oxaloylglycine (DMOG). DMOG-associated stabilization of HIF1A involves inhibition of PHDs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Fraisl1">[64]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Eckle6">[65]</xref>—a mechanism very similar to succinate-dependent HIF stabilization. For the purpose of these studies, we pretreated mice with DMOG (1 mg i.p.) 4 h prior to the induction of ALI. This pharmacologic approach was associated with robust HIF1A stabilization in murine lungs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001665.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). Functional studies revealed that ALI-associated increases in pulmonary edema were dramatically improved following DMOG treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). In addition, pre-treatment with DMOG was associated with attenuated lung inflammation, as assessed by measurements of myeloperoxidase levels in the lungs or in the BAL, indicating that pretreatment with DMOG attenuates pulmonary neutrophil accumulation in the lungs during ALI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g005">Figure 5B,C</xref>). Similarly, attenuated gas exchange during VILI was improved in mice pre-treated with DMOG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Finally, pre-treatment with DMOG was also associated with a very dramatic increase of survival time during VILI exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g005">Figure 5E</xref>).

<title>Inhibition of HIF1A Functions Is Detrimental During ALI</title>
<p>After having observed very robust therapeutic effects for the treatment with a pharmacologic HIF activator, we next examined the consequences of a pharmacologic inhibitor of HIF1A activity.

To address the functional role of HIF-dependent induction of the glycolytic pathway, we next performed in vivo studies with the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), a well-characterized inhibitor of glycolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Maschek1">[74]</xref>. Here we found that treatment with 2-DG (200 mg/kg i.p. prior to the induction of ventilator-induced ALI) was associated with increased pulmonary edema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g009">Figure 9E</xref>), attenuated gas exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g009">Figure 9F</xref>), enhanced pulmonary neutrophil accumulation as assessed by MPO levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g009">Figure 9G</xref>), and cytokine production (IL-6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g009">Figure 9H</xref>). Moreover, survival time during ALI exposure of anesthetized mice was significantly reduced following pretreatment with 2-DG as compared to vehicle treatment in wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g009">Figure 9I</xref>), while 2-DG treatment of <italic>Hif1a<sup>f/f</sup></italic> SurfactantCre+ mice had no effect on survival time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g009">Figure 9J</xref>).

<title>Alveolar Epithelial HIF1A Increases TCA Flux and Mitochondrial Activity During ALI in Vivo</title>
<p>To gain additional insight into the metabolic functions of epithelial HIF1A during ALI in vivo, we next pursued metabolic studies on TCA flux and mitochondrial metabolism in <italic>Hif1a<sup>f/f</sup></italic> SurfactantCre+ mice.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study was designed to identify stress-elicited transcriptional pathways that could be targeted as novel treatment for ALI. For this purpose, we performed a genome-wide screen to identify transcriptional responses to cyclic mechanical stretch of pulmonary epithelial cells, such as occurs during mechanical ventilation in the context of ALI. Quite surprising, these studies revealed a transcriptional response that resembled hypoxia signaling. We found that the key transcription factor for mediating hypoxia adaptation—HIF1A—was stabilized during stretch conditions in vitro, or during ALI induced by mechanical ventilation in vivo. Unexpectedly, HIF1A stabilization occurred in the absence of tissue hypoxia, and involved normoxic inhibition of SDH, a molecular pathway that has previously been implicated in the normoxic activation of HIF during cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Selak1">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Koivunen2">[48]</xref>. In order to define the functional role of HIF1A during ALI, we subsequently performed pharmacologic studies with HIF activators or inhibitors. These findings demonstrated a protective role for HIF stabilization during ALI. Systematic deletion of the <italic>Hif1a</italic> gene in different lung tissues identified a predominant role for alveolar epithelial HIF1A signaling in these responses. Subsequent metabolic studies indicated that stretch exposure of pulmonary epithelial cells in vitro or ventilator-induced ALI in vivo is associated with the normoxic stabilization of HIF1A, thereby leading to increased glycolytic capacity, TCA flux, optimized mitochondrial respiration, and finally increased ATP generation. Indeed, HIF-dependent prevention of mitochondrial dysfunction during ALI resulted in increased alveolar epithelial capacity to produce ATP, while concomitantly preventing ROS accumulation and lung inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001665-g011">Figure 11</xref>).</p>
<p>We were surprised to find a functional role for pulmonary hypoxia-signaling during ALI—particularly because the lungs represent one of the best oxygenated environments in the body. However, this is not the first time that studies uncovered a surprising manifestation for hypoxia-signaling under normoxic conditions. As such, lactate and pyruvate have been shown to regulate hypoxia-inducible gene expression independently of hypoxia by stimulating the accumulation of HIF1A in human gliomas and other cancer cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Lu1">[75]</xref>. In contrast to those studies, we observed that HIF stabilization occurred during ALI under normoxic conditions. Combinations of in vitro stretch studies of pulmonary epithelial cells and in vivo studies of ALI induced by mechanical ventilation implicate stretch-elicited inhibition of SDH in HIF activation. These findings are consistent with previous studies of SDH-dependent HIF activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Selak1">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Koivunen2">[48]</xref>. Studies on mutations in human cancers had implicated SDH in altered cellular metabolism and cellular transformation. Inactivating SDH causes the accumulation of succinate, which inhibits 2-oxoglutarate-dependent enzymes, including PHDs that mark HIF1A for polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Koivunen2">[48]</xref>. In support of these findings, other studies have redundantly shown the critical role of metabolism in regulating HIF1A-dependent gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Zhong1">[76]</xref>.</p>
<p>Also consistent with the current studies, previous studies have shown molecular pathways for normoxic stabilization of HIF1A. For example, a recent study described hypoxia-independent activation of HIF1A by enterobacteriaceae and their siderophores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Hartmann1">[77]</xref>. Several studies had provided evidence for HIF1A stabilization during bacterial infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Kempf1">[78]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Werth1">[80]</xref>. In extension of these findings, the authors pursued the role of bacterial siderophores in HIF1A activation during infection with Enterobacteriaceae. Infection of mice with <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic> led to functional activation of HIF1A in Peyer's patches. Because mice with deletion of HIF1A in the intestinal epithelium showed a significantly higher susceptibility to orogastric <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic> infections, activation of HIF1A in host cells during bacterial infection represents a host defense mechanism in this study. Additional studies with <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic>, <italic>S. enterica subsp enterica</italic>, or <italic>E. aerogenes</italic>, and moreover, application of their siderophores (yersiniabactin, salmochelin, aerobactin), caused a robust, dose-dependent HIF1A response in human epithelia and endothelia, independent of cellular hypoxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Hartmann1">[77]</xref>. The authors conclude that bacterial siderophores account for the normoxic stabilization of HIF1A during infection with human pathogenic bacteria.</p>
<p>In the context of lung injury, previous studies had shown an indirect role for hypoxia-signaling in attenuating ALI induced by bacterial infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Eltzschig5">[81]</xref>. For example, an important study tested the hypothesis that oxygenation weakens a tissue-protecting mechanism triggered by hypoxia and concomitant HIF activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Thiel1">[41]</xref>. The authors found that the hypoxia-dependent transcriptional control of extracellular adenosine signaling protects the lungs from the toxic effects of overactive immune cells such as neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Sitkovsky2">[35]</xref>. In line with the present studies, these findings demonstrate a protective role for the activation of the HIF-pathway in the lungs by attenuating pathologic lung inflammation during ALI. These studies pointed towards a protective role for HIF-elicited increases of adenosine signaling through the Adora2a adenosine receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Sitkovsky1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Ohta1">[8]</xref>. During conditions of ischemia or inflammation, different cells release nucleotides that can be enzymatically converted to adenosine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Eckle1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Eckle2">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Eltzschig4">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Faigle1">[82]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Hart2">[85]</xref>. HIF1A can function in multiple ways to enhance the protective effects of extracellular adenosine signaling during ALI, including enhanced enzymatic adenosine production by transcriptionally inducing the ecto-5′-nucleotidase (conversion of extracellular AMP to adenosine), which is a known HIF target gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Hart3">[86]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Synnestvedt1">[87]</xref>. Similarly, other studies had shown a protective role for the extracellular production of adenosine and signaling events through adenosine receptors in lung protection—for example, by attenuating vascular leakage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Algars1">[88]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Synnestvedt2">[91]</xref> or improving alveolar fluid transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Eckle4">[40]</xref>. Moreover, other studies also implicate HIF in attenuating adenosine uptake via repression of equilibrative nucleoside transporters, and thereby enhancing extracellular-dependent tissue protection via adenosine signaling events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Eckle8">[92]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Loffler1">[95]</xref>. Interestingly, CD73 was among the genes regulated during stretch exposure of pulmonary epithelial cells in our present study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001665.s009">Table S1</xref>). Consistent with a role of HIF-dependent increases of CD73-dependent adenosine generation and lung protection during ALI, we also found that the protective effects of the HIF activator DMOG was attenuated in gene-targeted mice for <italic>cd73</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001665.s008">Figure S8</xref>). Taken together, these studies indicate the likelihood that HIF-dependent lung protection during ALI may also involve HIF-elicited increases in extracellular adenosine receptor signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Chen2">[96]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Eltzschig8">[97]</xref>. However, it remains presently unclear if the findings of HIF1A-elicited improvements in carbohydrate metabolism of pulmonary epithelial cells are related or independent of adenosine metabolism and signaling. Moreover, it will be important to examine the role of this pathway in additional models of lung injury, such as ischemia reperfusion and second organ reflow injury of the lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Qiu1">[98]</xref> or in models of inflammatory lung disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Ehrentraut2">[99]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Schingnitz1">[100]</xref>.</p>
<p>Other previous studies had implicated a functional role of HIF-dependent induction of glycolysis in inflammatory diseases. For example, previous studies had shown that HIF signaling is required for myeloid cell metabolism, and for their capability to function during conditions of inflammatory hypoxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Cramer1">[70]</xref>. These studies demonstrated that stabilization of HIF1A is essential for myeloid cell infiltration and activation in vivo via functioning as a essential regulator for their glycolytic capacity: when HIF1A is absent, the metabolic defect results in profound impairment of myeloid cell aggregation, motility, invasiveness, and bacterial killing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Cramer1">[70]</xref>. However, during conditions of ALI—such as those that were used in the present studies—the lungs remain normoxic, and PMN-dependent HIF stabilization and HIF-elicited increases of PMN-inflammatory functions appear to be an unlikely scenario. In contrast, stretch-induced stabilization of HIF1A under normoxic conditions in epithelial cells appears to contribute to lung protection during ALI. Indeed, HIF-dependent increases in alveolar epithelial cell glycolysis, TCA cycle flux, and mitochondrial respiration allows for a metabolic adaptation that is critical to dampen pathologic lung inflammation during ventilator-induced lung injury.</p>
<p>Consistent with the present studies implicating HIF in mitochondrial respiration during ALI, a previous study had demonstrated a functional role of HIF1A in mitochondrial respiration via altering mitochondrial complex IV (COX4) subunit composition under hypoxic conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Fukuda1">[60]</xref>. Moreover, the current metabolic in vivo studies in mice with tissue-specific deletion of HIF1A in alveolar epithelia are consistent with previous studies from the 1970s that examined normoxic or hypoxic metabolism of cultured pulmonary epithelia. During air cultivation, alveolar epithelial cells had a high rate of aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Simon2">[101]</xref>. However, the authors observed concomitant increases of anaerobic and aerobic glycolysis under hypoxic condition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Simon2">[101]</xref>. These findings are consistent with the present studies showing that HIF1A is responsible for increases of glycolysis and lactate production and, at the same time, for oxidative glucose flux rates during ALI in vivo. Our findings utilizing liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry analysis of metabolites following the infusion of <sup>13</sup>C-glucose-labeled glucose in mice with tissue-specific deletion of alveolar epithelial HIF1A link these early observations with a functional role for HIF1A in controlling alveolar epithelial metabolism during ALI.</p>
<p>Taken together, the present studies demonstrate a critical role for the stabilization of HIF1A during conditions of cyclic mechanical stretch in vitro, or during ALI in vivo, representing an endogenous protective mechanism. We conclude that targeting HIF-dependent metabolism of alveolar epithelia during ALI represents a powerful therapeutic strategy to dampen lung inflammation. These findings are also interesting from a translational perspective: a pharmacologic activator of HIF has recently been studied in the treatment of patients with renal anemia, and there were no safety concerns observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001665-Bernhardt1">[49]</xref>. As such, treatment of ALI with HIF activators could potentially be considered in a clinical trial of ALI. Based on the specificity of our findings for pulmonary epithelial HIF1A, an inhaled treatment approach with less systemic concentrations of the compound may also be feasible.</p>

<p>To study the consequences of cyclic mechanical stretch, we adopted a previously described in vitro model resembling mechanical ventilation by applying cyclic mechanical stretch. In short, Calu-3, A549, or HPAEpiC were plated on BioFlex culture plates-collagen type I (BF-3001C; FlexCell International) and allowed to attach and grow to 80% confluence. All cells were cultured in 4 ml media: Calu-3 cells were grown in Advanced MEM (GIBCO), A549 cells were grown in DMEM-F12 (GIBCO), both cell lines with 10% FBS, 0.02% L-Glutamine. Plates were then placed on a FlexCell FX-4000T Tension Plus System and stretched at percentage stretch indicated, 30% maximum, 0.7% stretch minimum, and sine wave 5 s on, 5 s off. Cells were collected at indicated time points from duplicate wells, flash-frozen, and stored at −80°C for further analysis.

The transcriptional profile in Calu-3 cells subjected to 30% stretch for 24 h was assessed from total RNA (isolated using Qiagen RNeasy kit) using quantitative GeneChip arrays (Human genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array). The integrity of RNA was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies), and RNA concentration was determined using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, Rockland, Delaware). Biotinylated cRNAs for hybridization to Affymetrix 3′-arrays were prepared from total RNA using the Affymetrix two-cycle target labeling assay with spike in controls (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, California). Labeled-cRNA was fragmented and hybridized to Human Genome Arrays following the manufacturer's protocols. After hybridization and staining, the arrays were scanned using a GCS3000 with the latest 7G upgrade. Each array was subjected to visual inspection for gross abnormalities. Several other QC metrics were used to monitor hybridization efficiency and RNA integrity over the entire processing procedure. Raw image files were processed using Affymetrix GCOS 1.3 software to calculate individual probe cell intensity data and generate CEL data files. Using GCOS and the MAS 5.0 algorithm, intensity data were normalized per chip to a target intensity TGT value of 500 and expression data and present/absent calls for individual probe sets calculated. Quality control was performed by examining raw DAT image files for anomalies, confirming each GeneChip array had a background value of less than 100, monitoring that the percentage present calls was appropriate for the cell type, and inspecting the poly(A) spike in controls, housekeeping genes, and hybridization controls to confirm labeling and hybridization consistency. According to our experimental setup, the arrays were normalized, grouped, and analyzed for differentially expressed transcripts based on different statistical tests. Different clustering algorithms allowed us to identify transcripts that show similar expression profiles. Using the “Ingenuity Pathway Analysis,” we were able to identify biological mechanisms, pathways, and functions most relevant to our experimental dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001665.s009">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001665.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

(B) WT mice were exposed to 3 h of VILI with and without Echinomycin pretreatment. Echinomycin blocks the transcriptional binding site of Hif1a. Levels of glycolytic enzymes were determined by real-time RT-PCR relative to Actb and expressed as fold induction relative to sham-operated controls (mean ± SD, <italic>n</italic> = 3). (C) DMOG treatment (1 mg i.p.) in mice with induced deletion of Hif1a in all tissues, including the lungs (Hif1af/f ActinCre+, whole body knockout mice). Lungs were harvested at indicated time points and Western blots were probed with anti-Hif1a antibody. A representative experiment of three is shown.</p>

(B and C) Similar findings were obtained for bronchial epithelia (B, black arrows) and alveolar cells (C, black arrows) showing moderate Hif1a expression in WT animals (left) but absence in corresponding cell-type-specific Hif1a knock-out mice after DMOG treatment. (A–C) Inflammatory cells in cell-type-specific Hif1a knock-out animals, infiltrating inflammatory cells (red arrows) served as internal positive control still exhibiting Hif1a expression.
