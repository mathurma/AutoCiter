<abstract>
<p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic condition driven by loss of homeostasis between the mucosal immune system, the commensal gut microbiota, and the intestinal epithelium. Our goal is to understand how these components of the intestinal ecosystem cooperate to control homeostasis. By combining quantitative measures of epithelial hyperplasia and immune infiltration with multivariate analysis of inter- and intracellular signaling, we identified epithelial mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling as a potential driver of inflammation in a mouse model of colitis. A kinetic analysis of mTOR inhibition revealed that the pathway regulates epithelial differentiation, which in turn controls the cytokine milieu of the colon. Consistent with our in vivo analysis, we found that cytokine expression of organoids grown ex vivo, in the absence of bacteria and immune cells, was dependent on differentiation state. Our study suggests that proper differentiation of epithelial cells is an important feature of colonic homeostasis because of its effect on the secretion of inflammatory cytokines.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal track is the common defect shared by inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, which affect many people around the world. However, the genetic and physiologic complexities of IBDs have made it difficult to identify therapeutically tractable drivers of disease that can alleviate the symptoms. We reasoned that this complexity is probably originated by a smaller number of dysregulated signaling pathways, and therefore, a “protein-centric” approach would be more suited to identify new therapeutic targets. To this end, in this study we profiled the expression and phosphorylation status of proteins that mediate signaling between and within cells in a mouse model of colitis. We found that hyperactivated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling interferes with the proper differentiation of epithelial cells, which promotes colitis by altering the epithelial inflammatory cytokine secretion in the colon.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>IBD, comprised of Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. The symptoms of IBD, which include diarrhea, abdominal pain, and intestinal blockage, are chronic and debilitating and, in extreme cases, can result in death. Treatment options include steroids, aminosalicylates, and targeted therapies such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) neutralizing antibodies, but many patients become refractory to all of these therapies and require surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref001">1</xref>]. As such, there is great need for medical therapies that exhibit a more durable response.</p>
<p>Generally, IBDs are understood to result from a loss of homeostasis between the intestinal epithelium, the mucosal immune system, and the gut microbiome. Genetic approaches, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), have identified numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with IBD risk, many of which are involved in adaptive and innate immune function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref003">3</xref>]. While the immune system is clearly one of the key drivers of IBD, the intestinal epithelium also plays a central role in preventing inflammation by maintaining homeostasis of the gut. It represents a critical physical barrier between the commensal flora and the immune system that resides in the lamina propria and also plays a central role in antigen presentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref005">5</xref>]. Without the epithelium, it would be impossible to maintain proper homeostatic control of the mucosal immune system. Indeed, IBD results from hyperactivation of the immune system in response to commensal or pathogenic bacteria in the context of epithelial damage.</p>
<p>Although experimental approaches indicate that changes to any of the 3 main components of the intestinal ecosystem can trigger IBD, the resulting clinical presentation of patients with CD or UC is indistinguishable, regardless of initiating event. Because of this, we have hypothesized that disparate initiating events converge on a shared, self-sustaining disease network composed of pathologic changes to all 3 main components of the gut ecosystem. Therefore, therapeutic approaches that target genetic initiating events might fail because inhibition of the triggering event would be ineffective in a self-sustaining disease state. An approach that focuses directly on these convergent downstream physiological processes and signaling pathways may identify novel targets that provide sustained therapeutic value for a larger number of patients.</p>
<p>In this paper, we have applied a protein-centric systems biology approach to characterize, at the tissue level, the key molecular and phenotypic features that comprise this convergent chronic inflammatory disease state. Through this work, we developed quantitative phenotypic readouts of inflammation and measured more than 50 inter- and intracellular signaling molecules that are associated with inflammation. Using dimensionality reduction algorithms, we predicted mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling as a driver of colitis. While mTOR plays numerous roles that may be linked to IBD pathogenesis, including control of immune differentiation and activation and autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref007">7</xref>], in this context we found that mTOR’s regulation of the differentiation state of the intestinal epithelium plays a key role in sustaining chronic inflammation. Using mouse models and in vitro 3D systems, we found that undifferentiated colonic epithelium produces high levels of innate immune cytokines and chemokines that drive inflammation, comparable to those proinflammatory molecules regulated by mTOR during colitis. Altogether, this work has resulted in a systems-scale model of colitis and has identified defective epithelial differentiation as a central mediator of chronic bowel inflammation. By extension, IBD patients, and particularly those with UC, who have hyperproliferative and undifferentiated colonic epithelium, may benefit from therapeutic approaches that induce differentiation to break the cycle of chronic inflammation.</p>

<title>Systems-level characterization of murine colitis</title>
<p>To create a tissue-level systems model of chronic colitis, we utilized the T-cell transfer (TCT) model of colitis, which allowed us to control the timing and severity of inflammation in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref008">8</xref>]. In this model, naïve T cells isolated from wild-type (WT) mice are injected into Rag1 null mice, which lack an adaptive immune system. In the absence of regulatory T cells (Tregs), the naïve T cells produce an inflammatory response to resident microflora, resulting in colitis with high penetrance (80%–90%) and a latency of 3–15 weeks. Our initial experimental population included 20 Rag1 null mice injected with naïve T cells and, as a negative control, 8 Rag1 null mice injected with Tregs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002417.s012">S11 Fig</xref>). Mice were weighed biweekly and assessed for symptoms of inflammation, such as diarrhea and rectal prolapse. After animals began to show severe weight loss and diarrhea, they were killed randomly over a range of time points to capture a spectrum of inflammatory states, an important feature for subsequent mathematical modeling. After humane killing, colons from individual mice were subdivided into matched sections for histology, immunophenotyping by flow cytometry, and multiplexed, Luminex-based protein measurement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002417.s002">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Naïve T-injected animals exhibited significant changes to the intestinal mucosa, including epithelial hyperplasia, expansion of the proliferative zone, loss of differentiation, and increased immune infiltrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002417.s003">S2 Fig</xref>). The majority (18/20) of the naïve T cell-injected animals showed some degree of crypt hyperplasia and immune cell infiltration, which were highly correlated to one another and with the amount of weight lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g001">Fig 1B–1D</xref>). The increased height of the colonic crypts was due to the dramatic increase in the number of epithelial cells per crypt (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002417.s003">S2 Fig</xref>). Immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002417.s003">S2 Fig</xref>) and immunophenotyping (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002417.s004">S3 Fig</xref>) revealed that many immune cell types were present in increased numbers in the colons of animals with colitis. For example, in Rag1 null control animals, CD45+ cells made up only a small proportion of total colonic cells (0.1%–0.3%), and the majority of these cells were plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). In naïve T-injected animals, the percentage of CD45+ cells showed a strong correlation with crypt hyperplasia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), and this infiltrate was composed primarily of CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002417.s004">S3 Fig</xref>), although the relative proportions of these cell types varied from animal to animal.</p>

<p>In the course of phenotyping animals with colitis, we noted that the histological manifestations of colitis were not uniform throughout the colon but rather restricted to specific colonic regions. In order to quantitatively measure inflammation as a function of the geographical position in the colon, we measured the thickness of the mucosa every 5 crypts along the entire length of the colon for every mouse. These measurements were used to generate scatter plots that graph crypt height as a function of longitudinal location along the colon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). In addition to crypt height measurements, an immune infiltration score was used to identify and locate areas of inflammation. Foci of infiltrating immune cells were rarely found in control animals but were found throughout the colons of naïve T-injected animals. These infiltrates were more prevalent in continuously inflamed colons and were closely associated with areas of crypt hyperplasia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). After analyzing our entire experimental cohort, we found that we could divide experimental animals into 2 discrete classes based on the extent of colitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). Continuously inflamed animals exhibited significant crypt hyperplasia (300–600 μm/crypt) throughout the distal colon, while focally inflamed animals were defined by variable crypt hyperplasia beginning at the proximal/distal junction and spreading distally towards the rectum. While animals that were killed at later time points had a higher prevalence of colitis, the presence and severity of colitis were most closely associated with weight loss and the time since initial weight loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). In follow-up experiments, by using this weight loss metric to select the timing of drug treatments, we were able to ensure that we treated only animals with established continuous inflammation. Together, these data establish the quantitative and qualitative histological features of chronic colitis, defining crypt hyperplasia as a tissue-level feature of colitis in this model and identifying expansion of the proliferative zone and loss of differentiation as key cellular features of disease.</p>
<p>Having established quantitative phenotypic measures of colitis, we sought to identify the inter- and intracellular signals underlying inflammation. Fresh tissue from the distal colon was lysed for Luminex-based analysis of 37 cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors and 17 phosphoproteins marking key signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002417.s005">S4</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002417.s007">S6</xref> Figs). These 54 “signals” represented all of the commercially available Luminex-based assays for which we were able to detect signal above background in the mouse colon. Many of the signals were significantly different in control animals and those receiving adoptive transfer of CD45RBhi T cells, and these changes were not simply due to the adoptive transfer, since animals that received CD45RBhi T cells did not exhibit increased signaling prior to the onset of colitis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002417.s008">S7 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We used principal component analysis (PCA) to cluster animals based on protein expression profiles and to identify key proteins driving this clustering. PCA showed a high degree of covariance between the proteins in the data set, and the majority of this variance was explained by the first principal component (PC1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Additionally, PC1 clustered each animal based on its degree of inflammation, with animals exhibiting continuous inflammation scoring positively on PC1, the focal inflammation animals scoring in the middle, and the control animals scoring negatively. Two of the naïve T cell-injected animals clustered with the negative control animals; however, these showed almost no hyperplasia or immune infiltration, representing the incomplete penetrance of this model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Scores on PC1 were plotted against average crypt height and showed a strong linear correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.80), confirming that this principal component is strongly associated with inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). PC1 showed strong positive loading for chemokines involved in macrophage, neutrophil, and T-cell chemotaxis (macrophage inflammatory proteins [MIPs], KC [keratinocyte chemoattractant], monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 [MCP-1], and RANTES [regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted]), inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1s and IL-6), and growth factors (leukemia inhibitory factor [LIF] and vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). T helper cell 2 (Th2) cytokines (IL-31 and IL-33) did not show positive loading, suggesting polarization of the T-cell response towards a Th1/Th17-type response, which is typical of CD and the TCT model of IBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref009">9</xref>]. Intracellular signaling molecules, such as Mek and the insulin receptor, showed strong negative loading, suggesting that these pathways are down-regulated in inflamed colons. The main intracellular signaling pathways up-regulated in inflamed animals included NF-κB and mTOR. We were particularly interested in the mTOR pathway because it was activated at multiple levels, including Akt, p70 S6K, and S6RP. The activation of mTOR in the context of colitis was not specific to the TCT model; we found that mTOR was activated in multiple genetic models of IBD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002417.s009">S8 Fig</xref>) and in a subset of human IBD patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002417.s010">S9 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine whether mTOR signaling was generally up-regulated in the context of colitis or whether up-regulation in a specific cellular compartment accounted for the increased signal detected via Luminex, we performed immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (p-S6) on colons from control and adoptive transfer mice. In control animals, we found high p-S6 signal only in intraepithelial lymphocytes, which is consistent with the well-characterized role for mTOR signaling in immune function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g002">Fig 2D</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref010">10</xref>]. In animals with colitis, by contrast, we detected strong p-S6 throughout the colonic epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), suggesting that the increased mTOR signal that we detected derives primarily from ectopic activation in epithelial cells.</p>

<title>mTOR activation suppresses colonic differentiation to promote inflammation</title>
<p>In order to investigate a potential role for mTOR in driving colonic inflammation by affecting epithelial homeostasis, we tested the effects of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin on colitis induced in the TCT model. To ensure experimental animals had severe inflammation, we utilized animals at late time points after adoptive transfer. We also used weight loss as a marker for onset of inflammation, beginning treatment on a mouse-by-mouse basis when an animal lost more than 1 gram of weight and did not regain the weight within 1 week. Inflamed animals were treated with rapamycin (5 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks and then processed and analyzed as described above. Colons from rapamycin-treated animals exhibited a clear reduction in immune infiltrate, normalization of the proliferative zone at the bottom of the crypts, and restoration of goblet cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). Quantification of crypt heights revealed a partial normalization of mucosal thickness and a significant decrease in average crypt height in rapamycin-treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Because rapamycin promotes expansion of Tregs in other systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref011">11</xref>], we explored whether the general reduction in inflammation following rapamycin treatment was associated with an increase in Tregs in the colonic lamina propria. While animals with colitis did have significant numbers of Tregs in the colon, those treated with rapamycin did not have greater numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g003">Fig 3D</xref>)—in fact, they had fewer—indicating that rapamycin treatment did not suppress colitis in the TCT model by expanding the number of Tregs.</p>

<p>Analysis of phosphoproteins confirmed that signaling downstream of mTOR activity was strongly inhibited by rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g003">Fig 3E</xref>), although phosphorylation of the upstream activator Akt appeared to be increased by rapamycin, presumably by relieving inhibition of the insulin-like growth factor receptor/insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref012">12</xref>]. We next sought to determine whether mTOR inhibition altered the local intracellular signaling network or whether it had a broad effect on the tissue-level inflammatory network (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002417.s005">S4</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002417.s007">S6</xref> Figs). We first applied partial least squares regression (PLSR) to signaling data from our initial specimens in order to create a mathematical model linking dysregulated signaling to colitis, regressing to epithelial thickness. As with our original PCA model, the PLSR model was able to segregate animals with continuous inflammation from control animals and those with focal inflammation based on the accumulated signals that were measured in colonic lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). When the signaling data from animals treated with rapamycin were projected onto this PLSR model, 6 out of 8 rapamycin-treated animals clustered with the focally inflamed animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). This reflects the fact that rapamycin treatment represses signaling directly downstream of mTOR and also the majority of the cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors associated with inflammation. Together, these results suggest that epithelial mTOR is a central regulator of intestinal inflammation in mouse models of IBD.</p>
<p>While long-term rapamycin treatment revealed a key role for mTOR in the maintenance of colitis, chronic inhibition does not provide mechanistic insight into the potential role that epithelial mTOR plays in this complex, tissue-level phenotype. In order to address this limitation, we treated inflamed animals acutely with rapamycin for 1, 4, 8, 24, or 48 hours. Within 1 hour of rapamycin treatment, goblet cells began to appear, and the proliferative zone began to normalize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). Within 24 hours, these cellular phenotypes were returned to nearly normal levels. By 48 hours, the inflammation-induced hyperplasia was reduced, reflecting the induced differentiation and decreased proliferation induced by mTOR inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Immune cell infiltrate changed more slowly following rapamycin treatment than did the epithelium, with a decrease in the proportion of macrophages and neutrophils only by 48 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). At that time point, the proportion of CD45+ cells that were T cells was significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Cytokine and chemokine expression showed a variable kinetic response to rapamycin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002417.s011">S10 Fig</xref>). Some proteins decreased rapidly, within 1 hour of rapamycin treatment, to control levels, while others showed a graded decrease correlating to the goblet cell phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). Some of the cytokines, like IL-6, even increased following rapamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). These data are consistent with a kinetic model in which hyperactivated mTOR suppresses differentiation to promote colitis. Upon mTOR inhibition with rapamycin, colonic epithelial cells rapidly differentiate and cease to proliferate. Subsequently, the cytokine profile of the tissue changes, and, as a consequence, the complexion of the innate immune landscape returns to a state that resembles the normal colon.</p>

<title>Rapamycin treatment does not affect the colonic microbiome</title>
<p>We next considered the possibility that rapamycin indirectly affected intestinal homeostasis by causing shifts in the composition of the commensal flora.

Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) of the beta diversity relationships between samples demonstrated that samples separated based on their inflammatory phenotype, but that rapamycin treatment did not shift the overall status of the microbiome, whether an animal had inflammation or not (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002417.s012">S11 Fig</xref>). We also plotted the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity scores between all pairs of mice to see how individual mouse pre- and post-treatment scores compared with differences between animals.

The same was true for animals with inflammation.

<title>Induction of differentiation reduces inflammation</title>
<p>In our initial hypothesis-generating experiment and in the subsequent perturbation experiments, we found an inverse correlation between epithelial differentiation and colonic inflammation. This observation led us to ask whether induction of differentiation independently of mTOR inhibition would have a similar effect on tissue homeostasis. To this end, we used the gamma-secretase inhibitor dibenzazepine (DBZ), which induces goblet cell differentiation by inhibiting Notch signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref013">13</xref>]. Animals with colitis were treated with 10 μmol/kg DBZ or vehicle by daily intraperitoneal (IP) injection for 1 week. DBZ-treated animals exhibited complete conversion of the colonic epithelium to goblet cells, with high mucous levels in almost every cell in the crypt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Consistent with rapamycin treatment experiments, induction of differentiation via Notch inhibition was accompanied by a reduction in macrophages and neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Interestingly, there was no change in the proportion of T cells within the colon, suggesting that their recruitment and maintenance within the tissue is not affected by systemic inhibition of Notch. This result is consistent with our prior observation that rapamycin treatment rapidly induced differentiation prior to having any effect on the number of T cells in the colon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). The rescue of differentiation was also associated with a decrease in the inflammation-associated chemokine profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g005">Fig 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002417.s013">S12</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002417.s014">S13</xref> Figs), particularly those associated with innate immune cell chemotaxis. When the DBZ- and vehicle-treated samples were projected onto a cytokine-specific PLSR model built from the baseline samples, DBZ-treated samples clustered with focally inflamed and negative control animals, just like the rapamycin-treated animals in our previous experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). These experiments demonstrate that 2 mechanistically independent methods of inducing differentiation in the colonic epithelium lead to a reduction in the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and subsequent reduction in inflammatory immune infiltrate. These observations provide strong evidence that the epithelium is a key player, beyond its role as a barrier, in the inflammatory process and that this connection is tightly linked to differentiation state.</p>

<title>Enrichment of transit-amplifying cells in inflamed epithelium</title>
<p>Our studies indicate a clear role for the differentiation state of the epithelium in mediating cytokine and chemokine expression and innate immune recruitment in murine colitis. Nevertheless, the stage at which the epithelial cells were arrested remained unclear. In order to address this, we performed microarray analysis on 4 control and 6 inflamed colons (GEO accession GSE87317). Analysis of individual markers for different cell types suggested that there was a pronounced decrease of goblet cells and enteroendocrine cells and a moderate decrease of enterocytes and stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>), cellular phenotypes that we have confirmed by histologic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002417.s003">S2 Fig</xref>). Because transit amplifying cells (TACs) are defined functionally, the existing monovariate markers are not sufficient to assess their enrichment. In order to determine whether there was a relative increase in TACs in inflamed colon, we employed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using published gene sets derived from epithelium enriched for various cell types. A stem cell gene set was derived from sorted Lgr5+ epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref014">14</xref>], while enterocyte and secretory progenitor gene sets were derived from various pharmacologic and genetic treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref015">15</xref>]. Finally, a TAC signature was derived from regenerative epithelium composed of 97% TACs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref016">16</xref>]. Using GSEA, we found de-enrichment for gene sets associated with secretory cells, enterocytes, and stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>). Conversely, we saw enrichment for genes associated with Atoh1 knockout (which lacks goblet cells) and the TAC signature. Importantly, several of the genes found in the TAC signature are chemokines, all of which were strongly induced transcriptionally in our microarray data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). By contrast, there were no cytokines or chemokines present in any of the gene sets for stem or differentiated cell types. This observation confirms that cytokine expression is present within the epithelium itself and that this is enhanced in TACs, but not in stem cells or differentiated cells. Together, these analyses suggest that the suppressed differentiation and enhanced proliferation that is seen in colitis is the result of expansion of the TAC compartment and not the result of stem cell expansion.</p>

<title>Differentiation state of the epithelium directly controls cytokine expression</title>
<p>Although our in vivo results were consistent with a model in which undifferentiated epithelium supplies many of the cytokines needed to recruit inflammatory cells to the colonic lamina propria, these experiments did not rule out the possibility that these cytokine and chemokine changes are secondary effects originating from immune cells. In order to test whether the expression of proinflammatory signaling molecules is intrinsic to the epithelium, we measured the production of cytokines and chemokines as a function of epithelial differentiation state in an in vitro 3D organoid model. Crypts were isolated from WT mouse colons and developed into 3D organoids in matrigel following well-established protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref017">17</xref>]. We then shifted the growth conditions to maintain a mixed cell population to enrich for proliferative stem cells or to differentiate into the enterocyte or goblet cell lineages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002417.s015">S14 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref015">15</xref>]. Following confirmation of appropriate differentiation based on expression of cell type markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g007">Fig 7A</xref>), purified organoids were analyzed for expression of the suite of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors that were measured in intact colons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002417.s016">S15</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002417.s017">S16</xref> Figs). Relative to the stem cell-enriched and mixed population organoids, the majority of cytokines and chemokines were suppressed in organoids enriched for secretory and/or absorptive cells. For example, MCP-1 was reduced during differentiation in a lineage-independent manner, while VEGF and mitokine induced by gamma interferon (MIG) were reduced only when cells were differentiated into the goblet lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Interestingly, MIP-1α, which was strongly induced in animals with inflammation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002417.s006">S5 Fig</xref>), was increased in expression when organoids were differentiated into the goblet lineage. Altogether, these data suggest that differentiation alters the cytokine and chemokine expression pattern of the colonic epithelium independent of immune cells.</p>

<p>To put the in vitro analysis of cytokine/chemokine expression into the context of our prior in vivo studies, we projected the organoid expression data onto the same PLSR model from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g005">Fig 5D</xref>, where expression of the cytokines and chemokines highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g005">Fig 5C</xref> specifies latent variable 1 (LV1). In this analysis, the more stem-like organoids were projected positively on LV1, clustering with the inflamed mouse colons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). Conversely, the absorptive- and secretory-differentiated organoids clustered with the focal and noninflamed colons. This analysis demonstrates that the patterns of cytokine and chemokine expression that correlate with loss of differentiation and immune cell infiltration in inflamed colons in vivo are largely recapitulated in an in vitro system that lacks both bacteria and immune cells. Together with the in vivo mouse experiments, this result indicates that the colonic epithelium plays an active role in inflammation that extends beyond its role in maintaining barrier integrity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The goals of this study were to define the tissue-level disease state in a mouse model of IBD and to use this information to understand how the components of the intestinal ecosystem interact to maintain homeostasis. We focused on the epithelium, the immune system, and the molecules that mediate interaction between them, using computational approaches to identify correlations between molecular, cellular, and histological characteristics of the inflammatory state in the TCT model. In doing so, we established a hypothesis-generating platform to identify pathways important for homeostasis and developed a composite phenotype that was used in subsequent experiments to measure the effects of pathway perturbation at a systems level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Using our systems approach, we identified activation of the mTOR pathway as being one of the strongest correlates of colonic inflammation in this model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g002">Fig 2</xref>). To determine whether this pathway plays an active role in the disease, we treated sick animals with rapamycin. Rapamycin (or sirolimus) is an inhibitor of the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) complex, but it should be noted that it can also exert mTOR-independent effects through its ability to bind FK506 binding protein 12 (FKBP12) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref018">18</xref>]. Rapamycin treatment resulted in global changes in the inflammatory phenotype, including reduction of crypt hyperplasia, increased differentiation and decreased proliferation in the intestinal epithelium, decreased immune infiltration, and globally decreased expression of molecular correlates of inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Notably, and contrary to prior observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref019">19</xref>], rapamycin did not increase the number of Tregs in the colon of the TCT model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g003">Fig 3D</xref>), nor did it affect the overall composition of the colonic microbiome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002417.s012">S11 Fig</xref>). While the role of mTOR signaling has not been studied in the TCT model of CD, several studies have demonstrated efficacy for rapamycin and related molecules (rapalogs) in mouse models of colitis, including chronically dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-treated and IL-10 knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref021">21</xref>], suggesting that mTOR might be a therapeutic target for IBD. In addition to our mouse studies, we also found that a subset of human IBD patients—those with ileal CD—had increased mTOR pathway activity in inflamed tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002417.s010">S9 Fig</xref>). Nevertheless, mTOR inhibitors have shown limited efficacy in unselected clinical trials for adult IBD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref022">22</xref>], although rapamycin has shown clinical efficacy in individual adult cases and in a larger study of pediatric IBD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref024">24</xref>]. A clinical trial on patients selected for high mTOR signaling, perhaps using p-S6 as a biomarker, will be required to determine whether mTOR inhibition has potential as an effective therapeutic strategy for some IBD patients.</p>
<p>The identification of mTOR signaling as a mediator of colitis in the TCT model provided an entryway to study the cellular mechanisms controlling intestinal homeostasis. While mTOR has been linked to mouse colitis through the effect of rapamycin, the pathway was presumed to promote inflammation by affecting T helper cell proliferation and polarization, and the role of epithelial mTOR was not explored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref021">21</xref>]. By contrast, one key facet of the inflammatory phenotype that we found to be controlled by mTOR was loss of differentiation and expansion of the epithelial proliferative zone. Defective epithelial differentiation is a feature of IBD in human patients; goblet cell depletion has been reported in both CD and UC and has been linked to reduced cytokine secretion and antigen presentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref026">26</xref>]. In our acute treatment experiments, we found that epithelial differentiation was rapidly induced by rapamycin and that this preceded changes in cytokines and chemokines, which preceded changes in innate immune infiltration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g004">Fig 4</xref>). These data support a mechanism whereby induction of differentiation results in reduced chemokine signaling and reduced inflammatory infiltrate. The role that epithelial differentiation plays in protection from colitis has been explored in other mouse models. For example, mice in which differentiation of goblet cells is suppressed, such as those lacking Jak3 or overexpressing Claudin-1, are predisposed to spontaneous and DSS-induced colitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref028">28</xref>]. Although goblet cells are important for establishing the barrier, these studies failed to recognize the potential for signaling interaction between the epithelial and immune components of the intestinal environment.</p>
<p>To test directly whether cellular differentiation state, rather than mTOR activation state, controlled the cytokine profile of the colon, we used the Notch inhibitor DBZ to drive goblet cell differentiation in inflamed epithelium, and this was also associated with decreased cytokine and chemokine expression and immune infiltrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Pharmacologic inhibition of Notch is known to protect against DSS-induced colitis, and genetic inhibition of Notch was found to decrease the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in cultured Caco-2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref030">30</xref>]. Notch signaling is the primary regulator of goblet cell differentiation, and most of the studies linking differentiation to colitis have focused on Notch. Interestingly, although Tsc2, an upstream regulator of mTOR signaling, has also been shown to regulate Notch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref031">31</xref>], we could not find any evidence in our protein or gene expression data indicating that Notch signaling, in addition to mTOR signaling, is activated in the TCT model of colitis. This observation suggests that mTOR is affecting differentiation independently of Notch in the TCT model. Our transcriptional profiling analysis suggested that inflammation-associated mTOR activation is associated with an expansion of the transit amplifying pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g006">Fig 6</xref>), consistent with prior observations that mTOR signaling is important for repair of the colonic epithelium following damage, a process that is driven by TACs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref033">33</xref>]. Together, these observations are consistent with our model linking differentiation, and not mTOR or Notch signaling directly, to proinflammatory signaling by the epithelium.</p>
<p>Inhibition of both mTOR and Notch can affect the function of lymphocytes directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref035">35</xref>], so our in vivo studies could not rule out a contribution of perturbation of immune cell function to the overall suppression of inflammation in animals treated with inhibitors. To address this limitation, we used an in vitro organoid system to investigate the relationship between differentiation state and cytokine secretion in epithelium that is isolated from the microbiome and the immune system. We found that proliferative organoids expressed higher levels of inflammation-associated cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors than either absorptive- or secretory-differentiated organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g007">Fig 7</xref>). This result demonstrates that, even in the absence of gut bacteria and immune cells, the differentiation state of the epithelium, and not necessarily the activation state of mTOR or Notch, specifies the expression of immunomodulatory molecules.</p>
<p>Altogether, our work clarifies the important role that epithelial differentiation and epithelium-immune cross talk plays in maintaining overall colonic homeostasis. We demonstrate that undifferentiated epithelium plays an active role in maintaining inflammation by secreting chemokines that recruit innate immune cells such as macrophages and neutrophils. By extension, altered epithelial homeostasis is a central feature of self-perpetuating inflammation in the colon; since expansion of TACs is required for epithelial repair, the repair that serves to restore barrier function during acute inflammation will also function to recruit additional inflammatory cells to the site of damage. Notably, modulation of the proliferative state of the epithelium had minimal impact on T cell numbers within the tissue. In both mouse and human IBD, dysregulated T-cell activity is thought to be the key triggering event in inflammatory pathology. Our work suggests that T-cell activation is upstream of epithelial differentiation defects in the chain of events that leads to chronic inflammation. We propose that therapeutic approaches that promote epithelial differentiation could show efficacy in reducing chronic inflammation in IBD.</p>

Gene set enrichment analysis was run using the Broad Institute’s GSEA software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref039">39</xref>].</p>

<title>Microbiome analysis</title>
<p>Mice were treated with rapamycin or vehicle daily for 2 weeks as described above. Fecal samples were harvested pretreatment and post-treatment, frozen until the end of the treatment period, and then homogenized in DNA/RNA Shield reagent (Zymo R1100-50) at 10% (v/v). DNA was extracted using the ZymoBIOMICS DNA Miniprep Kit (Zymo R2002). Generation of the 16s library, sequencing, read calling, and taxonomy assignment were performed by Zymo Research through their ZymoBIOMICS service. ZymoBIOMICS Microbial Community Standards (Zymo D6300) were used as positive controls. The library was sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq with &gt;10% PhiX spike-in. Amplicon sequences were deduced from raw reads, and chimeric sequences were removed using the Dada2 pipeline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref040">40</xref>]. Taxonomy assignment was performed using Qiime v1.9.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref041">41</xref>]. PCoA and correlation analysis of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity scores were performed using MATLAB.</p>

(B) Time course of induction and assessment of inflammation. Rag1 null animals are injected with naïve T cells or Tregs and assessed for signs of inflammation such as weight loss. When the first animals began to show sustained weight loss, the remaining animals were killed at various time points and processed as described in panel C. (C) Tissue processing strategy. Colons were resected and opened longitudinally. Approximately one-sixth was taken for flow cytometry. Matched tissue was lysed for Luminex analysis after splitting into proximal and distal regions. The remaining tissue was rolled (see hematoxylin–eosin [HE] at right side of panel), allowing for visualization of the entire colon in a single section.</p>

<title>Phenotypic characterization of T-cell transfer (TCT) mice.</title>
<p>(A) Cellular phenotypes during colitis. Mitotic cells were detected by immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated histone H3 (PH3). While restricted to the lower crypts in normal colons, mitotic cells extend to the luminal surface during colitis. Alcian Blue/Periodic Acid Schiff (AB/PAS) staining was used to stain mucins in the goblet cell cytoplasm. Secretory enteroendocrine cells and absorptive enterocytes were detected by staining for chromogranin A (Chga) and liver fatty acid binding protein (Fabpl). Both cell types are largely absent in animals with colitis. (B) Quantification of the number of epithelial cells per crypt. In this experiment, the total number of cells per crypt in a single cross section was counted, only for crypts in which the entire crypt was sectioned. <italic>N</italic> = 120 crypts for both regulatory T cell (Treg) control and for the experimental naive T recipients. The <italic>p</italic>-value was determined by Mann-Whitney test. (C) Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for mast cell tryptase. The number of mast cells in the control and inflamed colons was too low to quantify. Spleen from wild-type animals was used as a positive control.
