<abstract>
<p>Mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene affect CFTR protein biogenesis or its function as a chloride channel, resulting in dysregulation of epithelial fluid transport in the lung, pancreas and other organs in cystic fibrosis (CF). Development of pharmaceutical strategies to treat CF requires understanding of the mechanisms underlying channel function. However, incomplete 3D structural information on the unique ABC ion channel, CFTR, hinders elucidation of its functional mechanism and correction of cystic fibrosis causing mutants. Several CFTR homology models have been developed using bacterial ABC transporters as templates but these have low sequence similarity to CFTR and are not ion channels. Here, we refine an earlier model in an outward (OWF) and develop an inward (IWF) facing model employing an integrated experimental-molecular dynamics simulation (200 ns) approach. Our IWF structure agrees well with a recently solved cryo-EM structure of a CFTR IWF state. We utilize cysteine cross-linking to verify positions and orientations of residues within trans-membrane helices (TMHs) of the OWF conformation and to reconstruct a physiologically relevant pore structure. Comparison of pore profiles of the two conformations reveal a radius sufficient to permit passage of hydrated Cl<sup>-</sup> ions in the OWF but not the IWF model. To identify structural determinants that distinguish the two conformations and possible rearrangements of TMHs within them responsible for channel gating, we perform cross-linking by bifunctional reagents of multiple predicted pairs of cysteines in TMH 6 and 12 and 6 and 9. To determine whether the effects of cross-linking on gating observed are the result of switching of the channel from open to close state, we also treat the same residue pairs with monofunctional reagents in separate experiments. Both types of reagents prevent ion currents indicating that pore blockage is primarily responsible.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Cystic Fibrosis is a severe genetic disorder caused by mutations in the gene coding for CFTR. This defect induces protein misfolding and channel dysfunction, resulting in the disruption of hydration of epithelial surfaces in different organs. Restoring channel activity in the mutant protein requires a greater understanding of mechanisms underlying correct channel function but has been obstructed by the lack of CFTR structural information. By combining experiments and computational techniques, we derive and validate structural models of CFTR in both the open and closed conformations that accurately represent an ion conduction pathway. We discover that restriction of the motions of pore lining transmembrane helices via cross-linking blocks ion currents. Our new structural models provide a platform for delineating CFTR gating mechanisms and identify therapeutic strategies for correcting CF defects.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a fatal genetic disease caused by inheritance of mutations in the gene coding for CFTR. Medical advances in recent years have significantly extended the life span of CF patients, but the disease has no cure and is inevitably fatal. Delineation of the molecular mechanisms of channel gating and chloride ion permeation in wild type and disease-causing CFTR proteins is crucial for developing additional pharmaceutical strategies to restore physiological activity of the mutants.</p>
<p>Unraveling the molecular foundation of channel gating and ion permeation requires an accurate structural description of the CFTR channel. Several homology based CFTR models have been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref010">10</xref>] employing available X-ray structures of ABC exporters as templates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref016">16</xref>]. Data obtained from mutagenesis, labeling, cross-linking and single channel experiments suggest that some of the overall arrangement of membrane spanning helices is consistent with that predicted by the models. However, these homology models do not accurately reflect the structure of the channel pore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref017">17</xref>] because of very low sequence similarity (&lt;20%) in the membrane spanning domains between CFTR and other ABC proteins (for which crystal structures are resolved in their closed and open states). A recent report also provides evidence that CFTR possesses a gate near the middle of its ion conduction pathway, which is markedly different from well-known structures of ABC proteins having two separate gates located at the two ends of the pore, and with binding sites for the transported substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study we develop inward and outward facing structural models of CFTR. As the outward-facing (OWF) state is believed to be the active state, we reconstruct the pore structure of this conformation by iteratively incorporating experimental constraints from cross-linking, labeling, mutagenesis, and single channel measurements using discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref020">20</xref>] simulations that accurately represents an ion conduction pathway. Atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are carried out to generate the equilibrated structures of CFTR protein both in the closed and open configurations. Applying cysteine cross-linking and single channel measurements, we validate the equilibrated structure of the OWF state. After a 100 ns equilibration process, we determine the pore profiles of the CFTR channel using the 100 ns production run. In both conformations, these profiles match the general characteristics (i.e., wide extra- and intra-cellular vestibules connected via a narrow pore region) of the channel pore quite well. Our results reveal that, in the open state, the pore radius below the external channel entrance (<italic>selectivity filter</italic> formed by T1134, I1131 in TMH12 and S341, F337 in TMH6) is ~ 2.5 Å, similar to the radius of a hydrated chloride ion. In the closed state, the selectivity filter region is significantly narrower (&lt; 1 Å). Comparison of the two conformations of the channel suggests that structural rearrangements of transmembrane helices (TMHs) 6, 9, and 12 play a central role in channel gating. Cross-linking of cysteine pairs introduced at specific positions in the helical pore region of TMHs 6, 9 and 12 provides a clear confirmation of the positioning and orientations of the pore-lining residues. The inhibitory effect of cross-linking of pairs of cysteine residues introduced at these predicted positions could either reflect the restriction of topological rearrangements of multiple TMHs involved in channel gating transitions or pore blockage by the cross-linking reagents.</p>

<title>Molecular modeling of CFTR pore structures</title>
<p>To model CFTR pore structure in the putative conducting (OWF) and non-conducting (IWF) states, we apply an integrated computational-experimental approach. We use a simplified definition of the conducting/OWF/open and non-conducting/IWF/closed states and will use these terms interchangeably throughout the paper. We define the ‘conducting’ or ‘OWF’ or ‘open’ state to be the conformation in which channel pore is able conduct chloride ions from cytosolic to extracellular region and the pore dimension is large enough for the ion’s expulsion. Similarly, non-conducting or ‘IWF’ or ‘closed’ state is defined as the conformation in which the intracellular cavity is able to collect ions from the cytosolic domain, however the pore dimension is smaller at the extracellular end such that the channel blocks the passage of chloride ions. We construct the IWF state of CFTR using the homology based modeling method I-TASSER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref022">22</xref>] (detailed description is provided in the supplemental information (SI), <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s001">S1 Text</xref>, <bold>Modeling inward facing state of CFTR</bold> subsection). Next, we reconstruct our previous OWF atomistic model of CFTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref001">1</xref>] with special focus on the membrane domains by incorporating experimental constraints via DMD simulations. These constraints are taken from published functional data. Although the 3D structure of the permeation pathway(s) or pore(s) through which anions pass is not known, residues that influence ion conduction and span the entire pathway including membranous, extracellular and intracellular domains are considered pore-lining residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s002">S1 Table</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref035">35</xref>]. The orientation of numerous residues in the TMHs 1, 3, 6, 9, 11 and 12 (known to participate in constituting the pore interior of the CFTR open channel conformation) of an OWF CFTR structure have been identified by various biophysical and biochemical experiments over the last decade as pore-lining and non-pore-lining residues. Our newly constructed OWF model is significantly more refined compared to the previous one and is validated versus a collective pool of functional data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref044">44</xref>]. For instance, pore lining residues F200 and L218 in TMH3, W356, and D363 in TMH6, L986, T990, Q996, L997, and I1000, G1003 in TMH9 as well as T1134, S1149, D1152, and L1156 in TMH12 accurately orient toward the channel pore in the new structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s007">S1 Fig</xref>). Similarly, the correct orientations of non-pore lining residues are evident in the new model including several residues positioned in TMHs 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 (e.g., G91, T94, L101, A198, L206, T351, P355, Y362, D984, P988, L1135, I1139, D1154, S1155, M1157, R1158, and V1160) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref045">45</xref>]. Furthermore, our previous OWF model lacks the cytosolic extensions of TMH6 (extending from 366 to 390) and TMH12 (starting from 1156 to 1208). These fragments are built in our new OWF model. The same testing and modifications are not feasible for the IWF structure as the functional data relevant to the closed state discerning residue orientations in the membrane domain are unavailable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, structural comparison between the two models reveals that while some characteristics remain unaffected, orientations and positioning of several residues within the helices tracing the conduction pathway differ appreciably in the two structures. For example, TMH9 traversing the pore in the OWF state moves away from the conduction pathway especially in the lower transmembrane section in the IWF model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s007">S1 Fig</xref>). This difference is evident from the altered relative positions and hence the interactions between the residues on TMHs 6 and 9 in the two structures (specific examples are discussed below). These subtle but fundamental topological rearrangements may be involved in transitioning from an active channel conformation to inactive ones and vice versa.</p>

<title>Deriving optimized CFTR pore structures via all-atom MD simulations</title>
<p>The distinction between the previous and the newly developed OWF structures of CFTR and the diverse topological characteristics in both conformers presented above may be crucial for the physiological function of the CFTR channel. However, the conclusions drawn from the refined homology models of the CFTR channel in closed and open states could still be flawed as the static modeling might exert unphysical perturbations to the systems due to the introduction of experimental restraints. Furthermore, we risk over-fitting of the models through such modifications. Therefore, with the aim of exploring more energetically favorable, optimized structures of the channel in both open and closed conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005594.g001">Fig 1</xref>), we carry out 200 ns long all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using our starting OWF and IWF protein structures immersed into an environment mimicking native physiological conditions (detailed description of the MD protocol is reported in SI, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s001">S1 Text</xref>, <bold>Molecular dynamics simulation protocol</bold>).

The dashed lines represent the lipid membrane boundaries. To help position the TM helices in the CFTR sequence, different regions (i.e., twelve TMHs, NBD regions and R-domain) are labeled on the human CFTR sequence Aiming to regenerate experimentally verified structures of the putative pore region of CFTR in OWF conformations, this model is developed by implementing experimental restraints and DMD simulations. The structures of OWF and IWF states illustrated here are obtained from 200 ns long MD simulations (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s007">S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s009">S3</xref> Figs, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s016">S10</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s017">S11</xref> Figs and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s020">S14 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>We determine the average pore profiles of the CFTR channel in two different conformations. The dynamic pore structures in the open and closed configurations show multiple unique features dissimilar from one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005594.g002">Fig 2</xref>). For instance, the pore radius (R<sub>pore</sub>) at residue positions F337-S341 in TMH6 and G1127-I1131 in TMH12 is ~ 2.5 Å in the OWF state, while in the IWF state this region is completely closed off, yielding R<sub>pore</sub> &lt; 1 Å. This region has previously been identified as the selectivity filter of the CFTR protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref001">1</xref>]. Note that, the radius of a hydrated Cl<sup>-</sup> ion is ~ 1.6–1.9 Å. Also, as expected, the pore radius pertaining to the region where the TM helices extend below the membrane boundary into the cytosolic region is considerably larger (R<sub>pore</sub> ~ 3.0 Å) in the case of the IWF model after residue locations R352-W356 in TMH6 and W1145-S1149 in TMH12. This feature coincides very well with the hypothesis that the NBD regions dissociate in the closed channel thus creating a larger vestibule in the cytoplasmic ends of the membrane helices. We observe that both structures have large radii (R<sub>pore</sub> ≥ 4 Å) at the two ends of the pore profile depicting the entrance to the extra- and intra-cellular vestibules. In the open channel, the equilibrium pore radius remains pretty constant with R<sub>pore</sub> ranging between 2 and 3 Å ideal for permeating hydrated Cl<sup>-</sup> ions.</p>

<title>Testing model prediction using cysteine cross-linking</title>
<p>To correctly determine the pore profiles for the IWF and OWF conformations, starting from the refined homology models, we estimate the average distances between the pore lining residues in various transmembrane helices from the equilibrium simulations. The mean distances between the residue pairs in TMHs 6 and 12 for both models are very similar in the membraneous domain, while most divergences are observed in the TMH extensions into the extracellular and cytoplasmic regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s003">S2 Table</xref>). On the other hand, the relative distance between the residue pairs in the TMHs 3 and 9 as well as in TMHs 6 and 9 are appreciably different due to the altered positioning of TMH9 in the two structures. This apparent translational movement and rotational alteration exhibited by TMH9 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s007">S1 Fig</xref>) between the two structures remains unperturbed even after the 200 ns equilibration, suggesting that the positional shift of TMH9 might be a hallmark feature distinguishing the two conformations. To test the validity of the newly derived pore structures in both conformations, we have relied primarily on the cross-linking of cysteine pairs introduced into a functional Cys-less CFTR construct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref001">1</xref>]. These experiments also provide a basis for further model refinements. We have previously utilized cysteine cross-linking to successfully model the crucial interfaces between the cytoplasmic and membrane domains (e.g. NBD1-CL4 and NBD2-CL2) of the CFTR molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref046">46</xref>] and studied their interactions, but the technique has not yet been extensively used to test predicted relationships between TMHs. Others have employed functional assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref048">48</xref>] to indirectly determine the relative positions of CFTR residues without biochemical confirmation of the extent of cross-linking. Here, we perform cysteine cross-linking experiments on 29 residue pairs spanning the membrane domains to characterize the spatial arrangements of the TM helices constructing the pore interior. Among all tested pairs, 23 of them show cross-linking while six do not. With all cross-linked pairs, only the mature form (band c) and not the immature form (band b) of CFTR is cross-linked as shown by the appearance of the band with retarded mobility (x band), confirming that the residues are cross-linked by MTS reagents only when the protein has achieved a native conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005594.g003">Fig 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s010">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s013">S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s014">S8</xref> Figs). While not reliable in the dynamic, disordered regions, cysteine cross-linking results are especially informative in determining the accurate distance range between two cysteine substituted residues in the pore, where the fluctuation of membrane helices are significantly limited due to the viscous nature of the membrane and therefore can be used to create a two-dimensional map for both testing and refining the structural features of the CFTR pore. For instance, the cross-linking of S341 and T1134 clearly shows that the c band is converted to the x species most efficiently by M3M, and partially by M8M and M17M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005594.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This finding suggests that the S341 and T1134 reside within a distance of ~ 6.5 Å. Indeed, the average distance between the two residues in the current OWF and IWF structural models are 5.1 and 5.6 Å, respectively. The partial cross-linking of S341C/T1134C by M8M and M17M occurs because while these reagents are much longer in fully extended form; their flexible nature allows them to connect residues with shorter separation. Another example is W356C/D1152C; the full conversion of the c to x band of this species happens only upon the administration of M8M and M17M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005594.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Our models show that the relative average distances between the Cβ atoms of these residues, 13.5 Å (OWF model) and 18.9 Å (IWF model), are in good agreement with the relative positioning of pore lining residues obtained from cysteine cross-linking. This result indicates that under functional conditions, the distances separating several residue pairs in the membrane-solvated regions are similar in both conformations. Hence, the cross-linkers can identify either conformation or both if the relative separation between two cysteine-substituted residues is within effective cross-linking range. Similarly, according to the IWF and OWF models, the inter-distance of T338C/I1131C is ~ 9.4 Å and 12.2 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005594.g003">Fig 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s011">S5 Fig</xref>), respectively, which explains only a partial cross-linking of this residue pair by M3M and full cross-linking by M17M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005594.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The residue pair K190C/K978C at the cytoplasmic ends of TMHs 3 and 9 are 32 Å apart in the open conformation, and ~ 19 Å in the closed one (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s008">S2 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s010">S4 Fig</xref>). Thus, it is possible that M17M only cross-links the closed species, which explains the presence of complete cross-linking of the K190C/K978C species only when treated with the longest reagent. Similarly, the complete cross-linking of the R334C/G1127C species appears upon treatment with M8M. Note that their separation distance is 8 Å and 14 Å in the open and closed states, respectively; shorter cross-linkers are only minimally effective. It should also be mentioned that R334 and G1127 are located at the extracellular ends of TMHs 6 and 12 and are highly dynamic. On the other hand, K95 and S1141 are separated by 12 Å in the OWF structure and most likely only this conformation is cross-linked with MTS reagents. The distance between these residues is ~ 25 Å in the IWF conformation, which is beyond the largest distance that can be cross-linked by the longest cross-linker (M17M) used in our experiments.</p>

<title>Functional relevance of inter-helical contacts in the transmembrane domain</title>
<p>The cross-linking of the cysteine pairs outlined above supports the relative positioning and orientation of residues in different parts of the membrane spanning portions of CFTR in the computational models. To assess the functional impact of cross-linking or modifying cysteines at some of these positions we focus on helices 6, 9 and 12 already reported to make crucial contributions to the CFTR pore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref017">17</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005594.g004">Fig 4</xref>). For example, the positively charged R352 residue near the cytoplasmic end of TM 6 appears oriented towards and within ~ 6 Å of W1145 in TM12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005594.g005">Fig 5A and 5D</xref>). This relationship is confirmed biochemically by the essentially complete cross-linking by the MTS reagent, M3M as well as by the longer compounds, M8M and M17M but with minimal cross-linking by the shorter, M1M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005594.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). This R352C/W1145C construct exhibits low open probability channel activity with a unitary conductance approximately half that of wild type as expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref042">42</xref>] due to removal of the R352 positive charge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005594.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, upper tracing). On addition of M3M, gating was entirely arrested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005594.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, lower tracing). Since the relationship between the residues at these positions is little changed as visualized in the OWF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005594.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) and IWF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005594.g005">Fig 5D</xref>) models, the inhibition of gating presumably is not due to a shift between these two states. To test the alternative possibility that the pore is simply blocked when spanned by the MTS reagent, the influence of the same bifunctional compounds on the single cysteine W1145C variant is examined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s012">S6A Fig</xref>). Even in the case of MTS compound binding to only one member of this cysteine pair results in inhibition of gating, thereby supporting the notion of pore blockage rather than structural transition of the channel from conducting to non-conducting state.</p>

<p>The interaction of the R352 residue with an oppositely charged residue, D993 in TM9 has been extensively characterized by McCarty and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref043">43</xref>] who provided evidence that the amino acids can form a salt bridge, perhaps during channel opening. As viewed in our outward facing model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005594.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) R352 appears to be as accessible to D993 as to W1145, whereas in the IWF configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005594.g005">Fig 5D</xref>) the D993 containing portion of TM9 appears to have moved with D993 turning away from the pore, and becoming inaccessible to R352. When an R352C/D993C construct is treated with bifunctional MTS reagents, the pair is completely cross-linked by either M5M or M8M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005594.g005">Fig 5E</xref>), suggesting that their binding occurs in the OWF state that may coincide with a channel open state. However, addition of an effective MTS cross-linker does not promote a channel open state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005594.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). On the contrary, the robust full conductance gating observed under reducing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005594.g005">Fig 5F</xref>, upper tracing) is entirely inhibited by the cross-linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005594.g005">Fig 5F</xref>, lower tracing). This result, similar to that with the R352C/W1145C pair would not be surprising if the binding of either bifunctional or monofunctional reagents to these pore lining residues could block the ion passage and indeed we find that this is the case. The M3M cross-linker inhibits the single cysteine D993C variant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s012">S6B Fig</xref>) and the monofunctional MTSBn blocks the R352/D993C channels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s012">S6C Fig</xref>). These findings do not conflict with the demonstrated ability of the residues normally present in these positions to form a salt bridge (Discussion). However, the demonstration that a cysteine replacing R352 is efficiently cross-linked to either W1145C or D993C combined with the prevention of ion permeation by the binding of mono- or bi-functional MTS reagents provides strong support for the modeled positioning and orientation of these residues within the pore.</p>
<p>The ability of cysteines replacing residues at other positions in TMH 6 and either TMH 9 or TMH 12 were similarly evaluated biochemically and their impact on single channel gating determined. First, we observe that a cysteine substituted for R347, a more externally located TMH 6 residue, also known to strongly influence channel conductance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref044">44</xref>], could be cross-linked to D993C in TMH 9 by longer MTS reagents (M8M and M17M) and to S1141C in TMH 12 by M5M (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s013">S7B and S7E Fig</xref>). Under reducing conditions prior to cross-linking both of these pairs of constructs had low conductance (4.1 pS) single channel currents due to the absence of the R347 positive charge and in both cases the currents are entirely ablated by exposure to MTS reagents (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s013">S7C and S7E Fig</xref>). Interestingly, the reduced channel conductance of the R347C/D993C and R347C/S1141C pairs is the same indicating that the absence of the R347 positive charge has the same impact when removed together with an oppositely charged (D993) or an uncharged (S1141) amino acid. This result contrasts that with the R352/D993 salt-bridging pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005594.g005">Fig 5F</xref>) and suggests that R347 may not form a salt bridge with D993.</p>
<p>Pairs of uncharged residues located further towards the cytoplasmic ends of these helices also are replaced with cysteines and similarly analyzed. W356C of TMH 6 is completely cross-linked to S1149C in TMH 12 by M8M and M17M (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s014">S8C Fig</xref>) and to L989 in TMH 9 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s014">S8D Fig</xref>) by shorter cross-linkers. The full conductance gating displayed by these constructs before cross-linking is completely inhibited after cross-linking as with the other TMH 6/12 and TMH 6/9 cysteine pairs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s014">S8E and S8F Fig</xref>). Thus, the predicted arrangement of residues at different depths of the membrane embedded portions of these three pore-lining helices is supported by the capacity of cysteines substituted at these locations to be cross-linked and by the inhibition of channel activity by their binding of either bi-functional or mono-functional sulfhydryl binding reagents.</p>

<title>Modeling CFTR pore structures through integrated experimental-computational protocol</title>
<p>CFTR is the only member of the ABC protein super-family that acts as ion channel rather than a transporter of organic molecules indicating that some aspects of its permeation pathway and gating mechanism must be distinct. Furthermore, a number of pathogenic mutations associated with CF are located in the CFTR pore region and affect channel gating. Therefore, with the objective of developing a platform that can not only serve to understand the role of the membrane domains of this protein in the gating mechanism, but also other structural and functional aspects and drug discovery projects, we have modeled OWF and IWF states of CFTR. Upon building the CFTR structures in both conducting and non-conducting states (that is consistent with a collective pool of published functional data) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref044">44</xref>], we have rigorously validated the structural models utilizing the cross-linking of cysteine pairs introduced at model predicted positions (data reported in Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005594.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005594.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s010">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s011">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s013">S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s014">S8</xref> Figs, as well as in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s003">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s004">S3</xref> Tables).</p>
<p>To verify our model predictions, we rely on cysteine cross-linking since this technique is more effective than the single cysteine accessibility scanning (SCAM) technique because it provides a more precise two-dimensional map of the pore by cross-linking residue pairs of varying separation distances. When treated with MTS reagents, if they are within the pore, their functional impact can be detected with single channel measurements thus confirming the locations as well as the relative positions of the partnering residues within the pore. SCAM alone, on the other hand, can yield ambiguous data in determining whether the residue is pore lining or not. For instance, in previous work Dawson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref006">6</xref>] reported that several consecutive residues within the TMHs 6 and 12 are pore lining, but in the pore region the amino acids presumably assume helical structure. Therefore, five or six consecutive residues cannot all be pore lining or non-pore lining. This result indicates that those reagents may interact non-specifically or might modify the protein structure significantly upon interaction, which can lead to ambiguous interpretations.</p>
<p>In addition, we infer from our single channel measurements of cysteine cross-linked constructs that, like other ABCC proteins, CFTR exists in various closed and open states that are not structurally strikingly distinct from one another. Therefore, cysteine cross-linking can identify several or at least a few specific configurations, when the residue pairs in question are within the interaction range of the MTS reagents used. In fact, recent cryo-EM studies of the P-glycoprotein protein and MsbA transporters reported that, in a cellular environment the overall population of these kinds of proteins is an equilibrium mixture of myriads of open and closed states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref050">50</xref>]. Our results also demonstrate that cross-linking could be used to arrest the CFTR protein in various stable channel conformations and thereby may aid structural determination by crystallography and electron microscopy.</p>
<p>A recent computer modeling study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref010">10</xref>] also reveals a similar pore structure to that seen in our novel CFTR open pore structure resulting from MD simulation (that identifies F337 and the subsequent residues S341, M348, and R352 in the TMH6 and the TMH12 residues T1134, N1138, S1141 and W1145 as pore lining residues, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s007">S1 Fig</xref>). Furthermore, by comparing our newly reconstructed models in the IWF and OWF conformations, we observe that structural reorganization between the TMHs 1, 6 and 12 (residues 102–106, 337–341 and 1134–1138) in the channel pore induces the transition between the conducting and non-conducting states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s015">S9 Fig</xref>). This narrow region is believed to form the selectivity filter thus facilitating the specific ion permeation in channel open state. The overall construct of this so-called selectivity filter region found in our study matches that in the CFTR model reported by Corradi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref010">10</xref>].</p>

<title>Structural comparison of IWF model with newly solved cryo-EM structure of CFTR</title>
<p>During the course of the review process of our paper, Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref051">51</xref>] published the cryo-EM structure of the human (PDBID: 5UAK) and zebrafish (PDBID: 5TSI) CFTR proteins in its’ inactive (closed) state. We compare our homology-based IWF model and the MD-generated model with the cryo-EM based structure and the overall match is very good, close to the resolution of the cryo-EM structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s016">S10</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s017">S11</xref> Figs and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s010">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s011">S5</xref> Figs). Overall, the RMSD values indicate good correspondence between all structures. Similar structural deviations are observed when comparing our models versus the zebrafish CFTR (PDBID: 5TSI). This is not surprising as RMSD between the human and zebrafish CFTR in PDB are within 1.7 Å and the resolution of both structures are ~ 4 Å. For the MSDs and the NBDs, the corresponding RMSDs are slightly higher than the resolution of the published cryo-EM structure since in those cases we also take into account unstructured regions such as intracellular-, extracellular-loops, and other connecting domains. These differences are a little higher when comparing the cryo-EM structure versus the MD structure. This discrepancy may be due to the different conditions used in the MD simulations than the ones used in cryo-EM experiments thereby yielding an alternative structure but equally probable average state. It is also possible that these deviations are mainly due to unstructured domains. There is no structural information available for the rational modeling of the unstructured domains.</p>
<p>Specifically, the RMSDs of TMHs 7, 8 and 12 are significantly larger than other TM helices. For example, we do not observe the kink on TMH8 reported by Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref051">51</xref>]. TMH12, in our model, while positioning itself in relatively the same orientation and angular position, show a noticeable α-helical unfolding from residue A1146 to S1155 in the IWF model. It remains to be determined whether these apparent differences between our models versus the cryo-EM structure, i.e., the unfolding of TMH12 or the absence of the kink in TMH8, reflect functionally relevant different states, the limited resolution of the cryo-EM structure (~ 4.0 Å) or imprecision of the predicted structure. The cryo-EM structure represents one of the many different states that CFTR channel can assume under physiological conditions. The unfolded region is basically the cytoplasmic extension of TMH12 and is exposed to solvent, that might alter its’ structure considerably. The condition at which the cryo-EM structure is solved also requires several specific constraints. Our MD derived model may depict an alternative, slightly different conformation. Regarding the modeling of TMH7, it may be possible that incorrect positioning of the disordered R-domain might have altered the orientation of the helix significantly and therefore yield higher RMSD.</p>
<p>The relative accessibility of various residues from the intra-cellular or extra-cellular domains as well as the pore lining residues can be assessed in our model structure versus the functional data reported in the literature and the recent cryo-EM model of the zebrafish CFTR model (PDBID: 5TSI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref051">51</xref>]. The residue positions in both the homology, and MD-derived models compare fairly well to the published structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s018">S12 Fig</xref>) thus confirming the reliability of our structural model. For instance, the residues accessible from the intracellular side (S307, F311, V345, M348, A349, R352, Q353, T1112, S1141, T1142, Q1144, W1145, V1147, N1148, S1149); residues accessible from the extracellular side of the membrane (R104, L323, A326, R334, K335, I336, I1121, T1122, I1131, and I1132) and the pore lining residues (Q98, P99, L102, F337, T338, S341, I344, T1115, S1118, N1138, and M1140) match perfectly with previous experimental data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s018">S12 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Both the cysteine cross-links tested in this study (that includes pore region) and our previous work (addressing the inter-residue distances between the intracellular and NBD regions) are mapped onto our newly developed closed states of CFTR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s005">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s006">S5</xref> Tables). For the majority of residue pairs in the CFTR pore, the distances retrieved from the cross-linking experiments versus the structural model are very close (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s005">S4 Table</xref>). In fact, the estimated distances between the MD-generated model and the cryo-EM structures show more similarities in many cases (e.g., S341C/T1134C, R352C/Q996C, K190C/K978C, N186C/K978C) than the ones directly obtained from homology modeling. Therefore, we can conclude that MD simulation further optimizes the global arrangement of the preliminary homology model. The few exceptions where the cross-linking data diverge significantly from our models as well as the cryo-EM structures involve a number of residue pairs in TMHs 6 and 9 (e.g., R347C/D993C, R352C/D993C).</p>
<p>In addition to the pore profiles of our IWF models, the relative positions of the NBD regions as well as their locations with respect to the intracellular loops align well with the cryo-EM structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref051">51</xref>]. The asymmetric opening at the NBD interface is also preserved in our models as seen in the cryo-EM structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s019">S13 Fig</xref>). This asymmetry is believed to exist due to the presence of the R-domain being located on the side of the degenerate site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref051">51</xref>]. It is true that, there are some deviations between the inter-residue distances estimated from all the IWF models and the ones derived from cross-linking experiments. A possible explanation for this discrepancy could stem from the fact that the cross-linkers most likely capture the OWF conformations more frequently than the IWF ones. In fact, cross-linking results for these pairs resemble quite well the OWF conformation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s003">S2 Table</xref>). In cells, CFTR protein exists in many different stages of activation and it is hard to arrest one conformation versus the other. Also, it is possible that the channel open/close configurations are, in fact, an ensemble of very many states with small structural differences.</p>

<sec id="sec010">
<title>Dynamic alterations in the CFTR channel is essential for gating</title>
<p>Intriguingly, by comparing our open and closed models we find that there are significant conformational rearrangements of TMHs 6, 9 and 12 between the two structures. In line with previous studies, our results demonstrate that these structural alterations may be responsible for transitions between channel open and closed states, which could arise from translational and rotational movements of several TMHs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref052">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref053">53</xref>]. We examine this hypothesis by cross-linking cysteine pairs in the helical pore region of TMHs 6, 9 and 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005594.g005">Fig 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s013">S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s014">S8</xref> Figs). Our inspection provides a clear validation of the positioning and orientations of the tested residues (R347, R352, W356 in TMH 6; D993 and L989 in TMH 9; as well as S1141, W1145 and S1149 in TMH 12) within these TMHs. However, these data do not definitively establish that helical movements are involved in channel gating because the MTS reagents are found to occlude the channel pore. In fact, modifications of single cysteine substitutions of residues engaged in interactions between helices, with monofunctional reagents show that the prevention of ion permeation in our single channel measurements can arise because of the obstruction of ion passage by these molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s012">S6A and S6B Fig</xref>). However, this finding does not preclude the possibility that restricting helical motions by the formation of cross-links between them may also contribute to the changes in conductance observed.</p>
<p>In addition to multiple structural features that are distinct in the IWF and OWF models (as discussed above), the spatial relationship between the salt bridge forming R352 and D993 is of particular interest. These two residues are oriented directly towards each other in the OWF state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005594.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). In the IWF state, however, their association appears not to be possible as the D993 portion of TMH 9 seems to rotate away from the pore obstructing its accessibility to R352 in TMH 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005594.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). McCarty and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref043">43</xref>] provided evidence that R352 and D993 interact electrostatically and indicated that the cross-linking of cysteines at these positions might support a channel open state. To test this proposal, we assess the possibility of cross-linking of R352 and D993 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005594.g005">Fig 5E and 5F</xref>). The mature form of this construct is strongly cross-linked by M5M, M8M and M17M but only partially by the shorter M2M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005594.g005">Fig 5E</xref>) that the McCarty group had employed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref043">43</xref>]. Contrary to their findings, we observe only a closed channel state of regardless of whether the R352C/D993C channels are treated with monofunctional or bifunctional cross-linkers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005594.g005">Fig 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s012">S6C Fig</xref>); no locked open channel is detected. This difference could be due to the fact that our cysteine cross-linking experiments are carried out in a Cys-less background, which ensures the interactions of MTS reagents only with the intended residue positions. McCarty et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref043">43</xref>] performed their experiments using wild type CFTR containing 18 native cysteines. Therefore, in addition to the targeted R352C/D993C pair, there may have been modifications of other cysteines. Earlier studies showed that chemical modification of native cysteine residues in the R-domain stabilize a channel open state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref054">54</xref>] in the wild type protein, which might be mistakenly interpreted as arising from cross-linking between R352 and D993. With the objective of finding structural elements that distinguish active and inactive conformations, we find that translational and rotational changes in TMH9 seem to be crucial in breaking the salt bridge between R352 and D993 residues that is a hallmark feature of the open state.</p>
<p>The traditional conviction regarding CFTR gating requires that the NBDs are separated in the IWF state, and in the OWF state NBDs form a tight sandwiched configuration upon phosphorylation and nucleotide binding. Our equilibrated OWF state shows that the channel can be in conductive state even when the nucleotides are not bound to the NBDs. For example, the distance between the S549 and T1246 in Walker A and B motifs in our model is slightly larger, ~ 12 Å (S6 Table) compared to other models ~ 8–9 Å. Other residues within the vicinity of NBD interfaces also depict slightly larger opening between the two NBDs than seen previously. While nucleotides are not added in this set of simulations with the OWF state, the relative positions of NBDs as well as the dimerized NBD interface has been maintained during the length of the simulations. To validate our claim, we have calculated the relative average distances between the Cβ atoms of several residue pairs within the NBD interface throughout 200 ns long simulations, which were previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref055">55</xref>]. From the small standard deviation in the relative distances for all pairs, one can conclude that the dimerized interface is stable during the course of equilibration in both OWF and IWF model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s019">S13A Fig</xref>). Certainly, this differential feature in our model, compared to existing ones, yields a small rearrangement of the coupling helices between the TMHs 8 and 9, as well as the TMHs 11 and 12 and creates an intracellular vestibule. While tight contact between NBD1 and 2 are the hallmark of currently published structures, our observation affirms that morphing from channel ‘closed’ to ‘open’ state for ion permeation may not require major conformational change. Instead, small structural alterations may be enough for transitioning between these two states. From our data, we conclude that indeed CFTR channel is dynamic and can exist in many alternative open and closed structures and rather than one specific ‘conducting’ and ‘non-conducting’ conformations.</p>
<p>While elucidation of the CFTR channel gating mechanism remains incomplete, accumulated experimental evidence indicates that the channel is highly dynamic and can access more than one or two specific states that could be designated as open or closed states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref056">56</xref>]. Indeed, our single channel measurements distinguish multiple channels with different channel open probabilities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s014">S8 Fig</xref>). These transitions may not require significant structural shifts such as the dissociation of NBDs and can be achieved by subtle topological realignment of various pore forming membrane helices. In reality, the energetics and structural landscape of CFTR is very complex and small spatial modifications in the membrane helices can give rise to multiple transient intermediate states. In fact, based on other MD simulation studies, Mornon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref009">9</xref>] and Corradi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref010">10</xref>] suggested that CFTR could adopt various conformations that could be referred as “open” and “closed” conformations. These transition states result from minor topological reorganization of the transmembrane helices. However, their conclusions were based on very short simulations (10–30 ns long). From the cluster analyses of 1000 snapshots of the protein (acquired from our 100 ns production runs after equilibration) for both IWF and OWF models, we do not observe states resembling different conductive and non-conductive states (example OWF states shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s020">S14 Fig</xref>). As shown in the RMSD plots presented for both closed and open states, indeed the systems require long times for equilibration (~100 ns). While identifying the fine structural determinant characteristics of these alternative conducting and non-conducting conformations are imperative to understand CFTR gating, long time molecular dynamic studies are required. We can also gain insights from developing CFTR structures by applying different ABCC proteins as structural templates for which crystal structures have been solved at different states (nucleotide-bound and -unbound) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref057">57</xref>]. To this end, it should be noted that, in the cell, transitions between different conductive and non-conductive states are shown to occur in the hundreds of millisecond time scale. Therefore, drawing conclusions based on only tens of nanoseconds may be erroneous, as the results might be influenced by non-equilibrium, unphysical forces and the identified states may not be real, and thermodynamically stable. To unveil the atomistic structures of such physically tangible, intermediate states visited by the CFTR molecule and the molecular underpinnings of these transformations, at least microsecond(s) long simulations are required. For example, such simulations may be able to illuminate the structures of the recently reported transitory channel open states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref058">58</xref>]. Structural characterization of these intermediate states and insight into the dynamics of the opening conformational change will facilitate understanding of the gating defect in ΔF508 CFTR.</p>
<p>In summary, by combining experiments and computational techniques, we derive structural models of the CFTR in both the open and closed conformations that accurately represent structural and dynamic features of the ion conduction pathway. Our data suggest that structural alterations of TMHs may also generate multiple unique channel conductance states. While our study emphasizes the importance of membrane helices in the channel gating regulation, more detailed molecular level understanding of how these helices control this process remains to be elucidated. By reconstructing and validating the pore region of the OWF state of CFTR through the implementation of experimental information in the active conformation, we present a platform to understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the CFTR function. Additionally, these models could be useful in determining the structural and dynamic deviations pertaining to the disease states (especially the mutations that affect channel conductance and gating mechanisms). This information may prove essential in designing extended personalized medicine for CF.</p>

<title>Computational-experimental approach to derive structural models of CFTR</title>
<p>The putative pore region of the OWF state of our previous CFTR model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref001">1</xref>] is refined by iteratively implementing experimental constraints from a large body of functional data (e.g., cysteine scanning, and electrophysiology measurements) by utilizing DMD simulations. Upon developing the improved model of the OWF state, we test the validity the new OWF structure by carrying out cysteine cross-linking experiments on numerous residue pairs predicted to line the pore. Single channel recordings are performed to determine the functional impact of selected pore-lining residue pairs upon cross-linking. The IWF state of CFTR is constructed by using I-TASSER modeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref022">22</xref>] based on the template structure of Thermotoga maritime TM287/288 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005594.ref014">14</xref>]. Note that, TM287/288, like CFTR, contains asymmetric NBDs, with one degenerate and one consensus nucleotide-binding site. While we initially select the TM287/288 structure as template for reconstructing the IWF conformation, I-TASSER utilizes multiple other ABC transporter structures to develop the IWF model of CFTR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s021">S15 Fig</xref>). Upon the refinement of the OWF model and the derivation of the IWF model based on homology modeling, to produce physiologically relevant, optimized structures of CFTR in both conformations, we carry out a step-by-step MD simulation procedure. The final models provided here are obtained from ~200 ns MD equilibration. This precaution is taken to assure that any bias (that may have been introduced from experimental restraints) during the fine-tuning step and/or homology modeling be eliminated. Detailed procedures followed for developing the OWF and IWF models is described in the supplemental information (SI) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005594.s001">S1 Text</xref>).

The representative structures from five different clusters are very similar suggesting that the transition between different conductive and non-conductive states is not attained during the span (~ 200 ns) of the simulation. Longer simulations are required for studying channel gating and associated alternate conformations of the channel. In both cases, the clustering is obtained by isolating structures within a RMSD of ~ 2 Å of one another. Note that only backbone atoms are considered. The representative structure presented here is simply the centroid of each cluster. Cluster 5 is taken as the reference model as it has the highest population. Clustering analyses yields five clusters from the entire production run based on our clustering criterion.</p>
