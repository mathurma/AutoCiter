        <p>Cone photoreceptors and horizontal cells (HCs) have a reciprocal synapse that
                    underlies lateral inhibition and establishes the antagonistic center-surround
                    organization of the visual system. Cones transmit to HCs through an excitatory
                    synapse and HCs feed back to cones through an inhibitory synapse. Here we report
                    that HCs also transmit to cone terminals a positive feedback signal that
                    elevates intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and accelerates neurotransmitter
                    release. Positive and negative feedback are both initiated by AMPA receptors on
                    HCs, but positive feedback appears to be mediated by a change in HC
                        Ca<sup>2+</sup>, whereas negative feedback is mediated by a change in
                    HC membrane potential. Local uncaging of AMPA receptor agonists suggests that
                    positive feedback is spatially constrained to active HC-cone synapses, whereas
                    the negative feedback signal spreads through HCs to affect release from
                    surrounding cones. By locally offsetting the effects of negative feedback,
                    positive feedback may amplify photoreceptor synaptic release without sacrificing
                    HC-mediated contrast enhancement.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Visual images are projected by the lens of the eye onto a sheet of photoreceptor
                    cells in the retina called rods and cones. Like the pixels in a digital camera,
                    each photoreceptor generates an electrical response proportional to the local
                    light intensity. Each photoreceptor then initiates a chemical signal that is
                    transmitted to downstream neurons, ultimately reaching the brain. But unlike the
                    pixels of a digital camera, photoreceptors indirectly inhibit one another
                    through laterally projecting horizontal cells. Horizontal cells integrate
                    signals from many photoreceptors and provide inhibitory feedback. This feedback
                    is thought to underlie “lateral inhibition,” a process that sharpens
                    our perception of contrast and color. Here we report the surprising finding that
                    horizontal cells also provide positive feedback to photoreceptors, utilizing a
                    mechanism distinct from negative feedback. The positive feedback signal is
                    constrained to individual horizontal cell–photoreceptor connections,
                    whereas the negative feedback signal spreads throughout a horizontal cell to
                    affect many surrounding photoreceptors. By locally offsetting negative feedback,
                    positive feedback boosts the photoreceptor signal while preserving contrast
                    enhancement.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The retina is an exceptionally approachable part of the brain, hence deciphering the
                retinal neural circuit was one of the earliest triumphs of systems neuroscience
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Dowling1">[1]</xref>. The
                basic wiring diagram of the retina was determined largely from electrical recordings
                from each of the main neuronal cell types. Synaptic connections were first deduced
                by examining how the light response is transformed from one retinal cell type to the
                next <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Werblin1">[2]</xref>. Paired
                recordings from different cell types and anatomical and pharmacological studies
                confirmed the occurrence of these connections and helped define their functional
                properties.</p>
      <p>The synaptic connection between HCs and cone photoreceptors attracted particular
                interest right from the beginning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Baylor1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Baylor2">[4]</xref>. Voltage changes in HCs result in sign-inverted voltage
                changes in cone photoreceptors, a negative feedback connection. HCs project
                laterally in the retina over hundreds of microns and integrate inputs from many rods
                and cones, so negative feedback causes cones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Baylor1">[3]</xref> and rods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Thoreson1">[5]</xref> to have an antagonistic
                center-surround receptive field. This receptive field organization is reflected
                postsynaptically first in bipolar cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Werblin1">[2]</xref> and in subsequent neuronal
                layers of the visual system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Hubel1">[6]</xref>, enhancing the neural representation of spatial contrast
                and sharpening visual detection of edges.</p>
      <p>Despite decades of study, the mechanism of negative feedback from HCs remains
                controversial. Three main hypotheses have been advanced to explain how this
                sign-inverting synapse works; that is, how depolarization of the HC inhibits
                neurotransmitter release from cones. First, it was proposed that HCs release the
                neurotransmitter GABA, hyperpolarizing the cone membrane potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Wu1">[7]</xref>. Second, an ephaptic
                mechanism was proposed, in which electrical current through channels in HC dendrites
                locally changes the transmembrane potential of the cone terminal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Byzov1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Kamermans1">[9]</xref>. The ephaptic
                signal is proposed to mediate negative feedback and modulate the gain of the cone
                synapse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-VanLeeuwen1">[10]</xref>.
                Third, it was proposed that depolarization of HCs causes the efflux of protons,
                which acidifies the extracellular space and inhibits cone voltage-gated
                    Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Hirasawa1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Vessey1">[12]</xref>. The debate continues over which of these mechanisms
                predominate in generating negative feedback to cones.</p>
      <p>Here we report the surprising discovery that HCs also generate
                    <italic>positive</italic> feedback onto cones, distinct from the negative
                feedback signal that has been studied for the past 40 years. Optical imaging methods
                reveal that the cone neurotransmitter glutamate triggers a retrograde signal from
                HCs, which elevates intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in cones and enhances
                neurotransmitter release. This signaling system is robust in the intact retina but
                disrupted in retinal slices, which are often used for investigating the HC synapse.
                We propose that the positive feedback synapse between HCs and photoreceptors locally
                offsets the effect of negative feedback and boosts photoreceptor transmission,
                preserving signal strength in the visual system without sacrificing HC-mediated
                contrast enhancement.</p>

        <title>Glutamate Increases Synaptic Release from Cone Terminals</title>
        <p>To investigate feedback at the cone-HC synapse we monitored synaptic vesicle
                    release from cone terminals with fluorescence microscopy. As previously
                    described, the all-cone retina of the anole lizard was dark-adapted in
                    physiological saline containing the amphipathic dye FM1-43 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Rea1">[13]</xref>. In darkness, cone terminals
                    support continuous exocytosis and compensatory endocytosis. Vesicles
                    internalized during endocytosis incorporate the dye, producing brightly labeled
                    cone synaptic terminals. Washing the retina with a solution containing Advasep-7
                    removes FM1-43 from the surface membranes of cells but spares the dye in
                    internalized vesicles. Subsequent loss of dye from synapses results from the
                    exocytosis of labeled vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Rea1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Choi1">[14]</xref>, and this can be monitored with an infrared 2-photon

        <title>Ionotropic Glutamate Receptors Are Responsible for Accelerating Cone

                    (mGluRs), and plasma membrane transporters. To ascertain which of these is

        <p>Glutamate also binds to and activates plasma membrane transporters in cones,
                    triggering a Cl<sup>−</sup> current <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Picaud1">[21]</xref>. The current is usually
                    hyperpolarizing, but under some conditions it might depolarize the cone and
                    activate voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, increasing the release
                    rate. To preclude activation of transporters, we used the iGluR-selective
                    agonist AMPA, which depolarizes HCs but does not affect the glutamate
                    transporter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Rabl1">[22]</xref>

                    caused a large (∼6-fold) increase in the release rate from cone terminals
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The
                    AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist DNQX blocked the effect of AMPA. A
                    dose-response curve for AMPA reveals an EC<sub>50</sub> of 13 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), similar to the

        <p>Taken together, these results establish that iGluRs are responsible for
                    triggering the increase in vesicular release from cone terminals. In contrast to
                    mGluRs and glutamate transporters, which might play a negative feedback role in
                    regulating cone release, iGluRs play a positive feedback role in augmenting the
                    release rate. Cone terminals do not appear to possess iGluRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Eliasof1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Tachibana1">[24]</xref>,
                    implying that AMPA-induced acceleration of cone release operates through a
                    multi-cellular pathway, for example involving HCs.</p>
        <p>To test whether there is sufficient glutamate released in darkness to activate
                    the positive feedback mechanism, we applied DNQX. DNQX significantly decreased
                    the FM1-43 release rate by 52%±14%
                    (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g002">Figure 2D, 2E</xref>). Hence the ambient concentration of glutamate at the
                    synapse in darkness is sufficient to activate the positive feedback system.</p>
        <p>Depolarizing the cone beyond the dark membrane potential elicits more glutamate
                    release, which could further increase positive feedback. High K<sup>+</sup>
                    (50 mM) saline evoked a 2-fold increase in exocytosis as compared to darkness
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g002">Figure 2F</xref>), and
                    blocking AMPA receptors with DNQX significantly reduced high
                    K<sup>+</sup>-elicited release by 56%±12%
                        (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). The observation that DNQX reduces cone release
                    both in darkness and in high K<sup>+</sup> suggests that positive feedback
                    operates over much of the dynamic range of the cone synapse, helping to set the
                    physiological release rate.</p>
        <p>If elevated glutamate at the synapse can trigger positive feedback, suppressing
                    glutamate removal from the synapse should enhance cone release. Consistent with
                    this prediction, we found that TBOA, an inhibitor of the plasma membrane
                    glutamate transporter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Picaud1">[21]</xref>, increases cone release in darkness by
                    45%±9% (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005). However, TBOA does
                    not reduce AMPA- or glutamate-accelerated release, confirming that the glutamate
                    transporter is not required for positive feedback.</p>
        <p>We found that AMPA increased vesicular release from retinal photoreceptors in
                    species across several phyla, including zebrafish (<italic>Danio
                    rerio</italic>), tiger salamander (<italic>Ambystoma tigrinum</italic>), anole
                    lizard (<italic>Anolis carolinensis</italic>), and rabbit (<italic>Oryctolagus

                    the release rate by &gt;2-fold as compared to darkness. The enhancement of
                    release was uniform over the variety of cone and rod terminals found in the
                    outer plexiform layer of these retinas, indicating that AMPA augments release
                    from both rods and cones. In the rod-only retina of the gecko (<italic>Gecko
                        gecko</italic>) AMPA also increases release from rods. In anole retina, AMPA
                    increased the release rate to about the same final value whether the retina was
                    dark-adapted or light-adapted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001057.s002">Figure S2</xref>), suggesting that AMPA
                    receptor-regulated release operates through a mechanism that is distinct from
                    light-regulated release.</p>

        <p>We next tested the effect of AMPA on retinal slices. The transverse retinal slice
                    is a popular preparation for studying the synapse between HCs and photoreceptors
                    because it provides unimpeded access for patch-clamp recordings. However,
                    slicing can damage HCs, whose processes extend laterally over hundreds of
                    microns, and thus might compromise HC feedback. Indeed, when we prepared 200-
                    µm-thick slices from FM1-43 loaded retinas, AMPA failed to accelerate
                    release from cones. When we prepared larger 500 µm-width slices, AMPA
                    could still accelerate release from cones but only half as much as in the
                    flat-mounted retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g003">Figure
                        3</xref>). Because the width of these slices should not affect the health of
                    the cones whose diameter is ∼10 µm, these results suggest that
                    AMPA-induced feedback operates through cells that project over a more extended
                    region (&gt;200 µm).</p>
        <p>To further investigate the source of positive feedback to cones, we used laser
                    ablation to disrupt various neuronal layers in 500- µm-thick slices of the
                    anole retina. Prior to AMPA application, the power of the imaging laser was
                    increased from ∼20 mW to ∼2 W. We scanned along the slice to induce cell
                    damage in either the portion of the inner nuclear layer (INL) where HC somata
                    reside or in the inner plexiform layer (IPL), which contains processes of
                    amacrine, bipolar, ganglion, and interplexiform cells (IPCs), but not HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, top). Laser
                    ablation produced immediate cell damage, which was apparent from cellular
                    blebbing and the loss of dye in the scanned region. There was no significant
                    difference in the dark release rate from cone terminals caused by ablation of
                    either the INL or IPL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g003">Figure
                        3C</xref>, bottom). When the laser was targeted to the INL to ablate HCs,
                    AMPA failed to accelerate FM1-43 release from cone terminals. However, when the
                    laser was targeted to the IPL, there was no significant difference in the effect
                    of AMPA on cone release from slices with and without laser ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g003">Figure 3B,C</xref>,
                        <italic>p</italic> = 0.41). These results implicate
                    cells with processes in the INL, but not in the IPL, as the source of positive
                    feedback.</p>
        <p>HCs and IPCs are the only two laterally projecting neurons in the retina that are
                    known to contact cones. There are several different types of IPCs containing
                    different neurotransmitters including dopamine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Dowling2">[25]</xref> and glycine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Pow1">[26]</xref> and receptors
                    for these transmitters are found on cone terminals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Witkovsky1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Balse1">[28]</xref>. To ascertain whether IPCs
                    might be the source of positive feedback onto cones, we asked whether AMPA could
                    still accelerate the cone release rate after applying agonists or antagonists of
                    dopamine or glycine receptors. AMPA acceleration of cone release was unaffected
                    by dopamine (100 µM) or glycine (1 mM), and the glycine receptor
                    antagonist strychnine (1 µM) also failed to block AMPA-accelerated release
                        (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001057.s003">Figure
                        S3</xref>). Hence it seems unlikely that IPCs are the source of
                    AMPA-elicited positive feedback, focusing our attention on HCs.</p>

        <title>Putative Negative Feedback Mechanisms Are Not Involved in Positive
                    Feedback</title>
        <p>Three mechanisms have been proposed to account for negative feedback regulation
                    of cone neurotransmitter release by HCs: (1) GABA-ergic feedback, (2) electrical
                    (ephaptic) feedback, and (3) proton-mediated feedback. To evaluate whether any
                    of these mechanisms is involved in AMPA-elicited positive feedback, we
                    manipulated each of these systems with pharmacological agents while monitoring
                    FM1-43 release from flat-mounted anole retinas.</p>
        <p>For many years, GABA was the leading candidate as the HC negative feedback signal
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Wu1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Murakami1">[29]</xref>. In this
                    scenario, GABA released from HCs activates GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors on cone
                    terminals, hyperpolarizing the cone membrane potential and suppressing
                    neurotransmitter release. However, GABA<sub>A</sub> antagonists do not block
                    negative feedback <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Thoreson2">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Perlman1">[31]</xref> and rather than regulating a Cl<sup>−</sup>
                    conductance in cones as predicted by the GABA hypothesis, HC feedback appears to
                    regulate a voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductance in cones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Verweij1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Tatsukawa1">[32]</xref>. These
                    and other studies challenge the role of GABA as the mediator of negative
                    feedback, but we considered the possibility that GABA could be involved in
                    positive feedback. We found that neither GABA nor bicuculline, a
                        GABA<sub>A</sub> antagonist, had a significant effect on the rate of FM1-43
                    release from cone terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g004">Figure

                    did not significantly change the AMPA-induced increase in FM1-43 release. These
                    results suggest that GABA is not the positive feedback signal.</p>

        <p>The second hypothesis is that negative feedback from HCs is electrical in nature.
                    This “ephaptic” hypothesis states that electrical current through
                    ion channels in the tips of HC dendrites causes a local change in the
                    extracellular voltage, shifting the activation curve in cones such that a larger
                    depolarization is needed to activate voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Byzov1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Kamermans1">[9]</xref>. HCs
                    possess connexin hemichannels, and HC-mediated negative feedback can be blocked
                    with the hemichannel blockers Co<sup>2+</sup>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Thoreson2">[30]</xref> or
                    carbenoxolone (CBO) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Kamermans1">[9]</xref>. We used these blockers to test the possible
                    involvement of hemichannels in AMPA-elicited positive feedback. Both
                        Co<sup>2+</sup> and CBO caused a small but significant decrease in the
                    dark rate of release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g004">Figure
                        4B</xref>). Both reagents reportedly inhibit cone voltage-gated
                        Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Vessey2">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Barnes1">[34]</xref>, which could explain the
                    decreased release rate, although the concentration of Co<sup>2+</sup> used
                    (100 µM) should have a minimal effect on photoreceptor voltage-gated
                        Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Thoreson2">[30]</xref>. More to the point,
                    neither Co<sup>2+</sup> nor CBO blocked the AMPA-induced increase in
                    release. These results rule out hemichannels as mediating AMPA-elicited positive
                    feedback.</p>
        <p>The third hypothesis is that depolarization of HCs leads to the extrusion of
                    protons through pumps or channels, acidifying the extracellular space and
                    inhibiting the activation of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in the
                    cone terminal. Supporting this hypothesis, HC-mediated negative feedback is
                    blocked by high concentrations of strong pH buffers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Hirasawa1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Vessey1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Davenport1">[35]</xref>. To test whether protons
                    play a role in AMPA-elicited positive feedback, we performed similar
                    experiments, comparing the effect of AMPA on cone release with bath solutions
                    that contained either HEPES, a strong buffer that blocks negative feedback, or
                        HCO<sub>3</sub> (bicarbonate), a weak buffer that preserves negative
                    feedback. We found that a high concentration of HEPES slightly increased the
                    release rate of cones in darkness as compared to HCO<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), consistent with
                    inhibition of negative feedback. However, the AMPA-elicited increase in release
                    was the same in HCO<sub>3</sub> and HEPES, inconsistent with positive feedback
                    being mediated by a change in pH.</p>

        <p>Neurotransmitter release from cones is Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, so we next
                    asked whether AMPA leads to a rise in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the

                    feedback is impaired in the slice preparation. Flat-mounted anole retinas were
                    incubated with the AM-ester form of Oregon Green BAPTA-1 (OGB-1), resulting in
                    incorporation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator dye into cone photoreceptors,
                    retinal ganglion cells, and Muller cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Robust OGB-1 labeling was seen in
                    cone terminals, but not in the adjacent horizontal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Application of AMPA triggered a
                    large increase of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). In contrast, DNQX caused a small

                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). This result
                    indicates that the ambient activation of AMPA receptors is sufficient to keep
                    intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevated, again suggesting that the positive
                    feedback system is operating in darkness. High K<sup>+</sup> saline also
                    elevated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), but to a lesser extent than AMPA.

        <p>AMPA triggered a persistent rise in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in cone
                    terminals that was difficult to reverse, even with prolonged washing. To confirm
                    that the rise in Ca<sup>2+</sup> is reversible, we needed a faster and more
                    precisely targeted method for activating AMPA receptors. A particularly powerful
                    approach involves the photolysis of a caged neurotransmitter agonist, for
                    example 4-methoxy-7-nitroindolinyl (MNI)-glutamate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-EllisDavies1">[37]</xref>. However, glutamate
                    acts on many receptor types in the retina, and while iGluRs and mGluRs can be
                    blocked selectively, blockade of glutamate transporters will lead to an increase
                    in the ambient level of glutamate, confounding our results. In fact, uncaging of
                    MNI-glutamate triggered oscillations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in cone terminals
                    that may have been caused by activation of glutamate transporters (unpublished
                    data).</p>
        <p>To circumvent this problem, we chemically synthesized a form of caged AMPA, which
                    upon photolysis should activate AMPA receptors but not glutamate transporters.
                    We synthesized the nitroveratryl carbamate derivative of AMPA (NVOC-AMPA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g005">Figure 5D</xref>), which contains the
                    photolabile NVOC protecting group that can be removed with exposure to 365 nm
                    light. Using NVOC-AMPA on the OGB-loaded anole retina, we found that flashes of
                    UV light could trigger a repeated transient rise in Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the
                    cone terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g005">Figure 5E</xref>).
                    Unlike glutamate, AMPA is not removed from the extracellular space by plasma
                    membrane glutamate transporters, which may account for the slow decay of these
                    responses. Our ability to resolve the time-course of the cone
                        Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase was hindered by the necessity that we change
                    optical elements in the microscope when switching from two-photon imaging to
                    UV-uncaging. However, our experiments show that Ca<sup>2+</sup> peaks
                    within 5 s of the end of the uncaging flash, the shortest interval we could
                    achieve. The UV uncaging flashes had no measurable effect on cone
                        Ca<sup>2+</sup> when the caged molecule was not present. These
                    experiments demonstrate that AMPA receptor activation causes a rapid, reversible
                    rise in Ca<sup>2+</sup> in cone terminals.</p>
        <p>To evaluate the spatial spread of the positive feedback signal, we uncaged AMPA
                    in a small circular region of the OPL (100 µm diameter) and measured the
                    resulting increase in cone terminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). We found that the spatial profile
                    of Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation in the underlying array of cone terminals
                    closely matched the area of AMPA uncaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g005">Figure 5G</xref>). Hence positive feedback appears
                    to remain tightly localized to the AMPA-activated region, in contrast to
                    negative feedback, which can spread widely not only within an individual HC but
                    between coupled networks of HCs connected through gap junctions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Dowling1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Raviola1">[38]</xref>.</p>

        <title>The Positive Feedback Signal Activates a Voltage-Independent Conductance in
                    Cones</title>
        <p>We next turned to electrophysiology to compare positive and negative feedback.
                    Previous patch clamp studies showed that depolarization of HCs leads to
                    inhibition of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in cones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Verweij1">[18]</xref>, a key
                    consequence of negative feedback. We confirmed this effect by recording from
                    synaptically connected HCs and cones in a retinal slice. We used the retina from
                    tiger salamander because the compact structure of their cones allows for more
                    effective voltage-clamp of the synaptic terminal than lizard cones, which have a
                    long axon separating the terminal from the cell body.</p>
        <p>We used a ramp depolarization in cones to activate voltage-gated
                        Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, which generated an inward current at
                    potentials more positive than −40 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, top). We computed the activation
                    curve of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, bottom). Hyperpolarizing the HC
                    increases the cone Ca<sup>2+</sup> current and shifts the activation curve
                    to more negative potentials, whereas depolarizing decreases the current and
                    shifts the curve to more positive potentials. Substituting extracellular
                        HCO<sub>3</sub> with HEPES prevents the HC-induced shift in activation
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), as shown

                            simultaneous patch clamp recordings from a synaptically connected HC and
                            a cone in a slice from salamander retina. Top: Current-voltage (I-V)

                                I<sub>Ca</sub> activation curves derived from these I-V curves (see
                                <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). I-V curves were
                            generated by ramp depolarizations from −90 to 0 mV (0.5 mV/ms).
                                I<sub>Ca</sub> activation curves were obtained by subtracting the
                            linear leak current from the total membrane current during the ramp. The
                            resulting leak-subtracted I<sub>Ca</sub> was normalized to the maximal
                                I<sub>Ca</sub> and plotted only over the voltage range where
                            channels are activating (e.g., from −70 to −20 mV). Data are
                            reported as mean ± SEM. (B) Same as (A), except with HEPES (10

                            negative feedback. Traces represent average currents from five cones.
                            Data for panels (C–H) were from patch clamp recordings from cones
                            in flat-mounted salamander retinas. (D) NBQX (10 µM) reduces the

                            solution to block negative feedback. Traces represent average currents
                            from 13 cones. (E, F) I-V curve of the voltage-independent conductance
                            modulated by AMPA or NBQX. Difference currents were calculated from data

        <p>To selectively examine the consequence of positive feedback, we added HEPES to
                    the extracellular saline and recorded from cones in flat-mounted retinas instead
                    of slices. Bath application of AMPA elicited an inward current that increased
                    with hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g006">Figure
                        6C</xref>) even below the activation range of voltage-gated
                        Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. In fact, AMPA had no effect on the activation
                    curve of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Instead, AMPA elicited a current
                    that changed linearly with voltage.</p>
        <p>While AMPA elicited an <italic>inward</italic> current, the AMPA-receptor
                    antagonist NBQX elicited a small, but significant <italic>outward</italic>
                    current, also evident below the activation range of the voltage-gated
                        Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). The current versus voltage relationships of the AMPA-
                    and the NBQX-elicited currents were linear below −40 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g006">Figure 6E,F</xref>), consistent with
                    regulation of voltage-insensitive channels. The extrapolated reversal potential
                    of the AMPA and NBQX responses were −0.6±10 mV and
                    −4.8±12 mV, respectively, with AMPA causing an increase in membrane
                    conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g006">Figure 6G</xref>) and
                    NBQX causing a small but significant decrease (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05)
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g006">Figure 6H</xref>). The nature
                    of the channels that underlie this conductance is unknown, but the observation
                    that AMPA leads to rise in Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the cone terminal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g005">Figure 5</xref>) is suggestive of a
                    non-selective cation channel that is permeable to Ca<sup>2+</sup>. However,
                    we cannot exclude the possibility that the voltage-independent channels are
                        Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated rather than
                    Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable.</p>
        <p>In summary, positive feedback leads to activation of a voltage-independent
                    conductance in cones, distinct from negative feedback, which modulates a
                    voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductance. Supporting this conclusion,
                    we found that the nicardipine, a blocker of cone voltage-gated
                        Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-NachmanClewner1">[39]</xref>, had no effect on
                    AMPA-induced FM1-43 release from anole cones but did block release in darkness
                    and after exposure to high K<sup>+</sup> saline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g006">Figure 6I</xref>), both of which depolarize cones.
                    The two forms of feedback can also be distinguished using HEPES, which blocks
                    negative feedback but not positive feedback.</p>

        <title>Raising Ca<sup>2+</sup> in HCs Triggers Positive Feedback</title>
        <p>Our results thus far suggest that the effect of AMPA on cone release is mediated
                    by HCs. However, the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g006">Figure 6</xref> suggest that manipulation of HC voltage cannot completely
                    recapitulate the effects of iGluR agonists and antagonists on cone release.
                    Assuming that HCs are the source of positive feedback, something other than
                    voltage must trigger retrograde signaling to photoreceptors.</p>
        <p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> seems a likely candidate. There is evidence that HCs contain

                    has been shown to elicit a rise in internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> in HCs that
                    does not involve influx through voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels or
                    release from internal stores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Rivera1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Hayashida1">[42]</xref>. Moreover, glutamate receptors on HC dendrites are
                    located adjacent to the cone terminals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Calkins1">[43]</xref>, ideally positioned to
                    trigger a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent feedback signal. To test this
                    hypothesis, we applied philanthotoxin-74 (PhTx), a blocker of

        <p>To confirm that glutamate can increase Ca<sup>2+</sup> in HCs, we carried
                    out current-clamp recordings from cells in slices of salamander retina and
                    introduced through a patch pipette the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator dye

                    uncaging of MNI-glutamate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-EllisDavies1">[37]</xref> led to an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the
                    portion of the dendritic tree immediately adjacent to the uncaging area (within
                    2 µm), but not in more distant dendrites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001057.s005">5B</xref>,C). This
                    tight localization of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal suggests that synaptic
                    release of glutamate from photoreceptors would also result in a spatially
                    localized rise in Ca<sup>2+</sup> within an HC.</p>
        <p>To determine whether a rise in Ca<sup>2+</sup> can trigger retrograde
                    signaling from HCs, we elevated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in an HC and
                    asked whether this could increase neurotransmitter release from photoreceptors.
                    We introduced caged Ca<sup>2+</sup> (DM-nitrophen) via a patch pipette into
                    an HC in a salamander retinal slice and used UV light to trigger photolysis and
                    elevate internal Ca<sup>2+</sup>. A brief (1 ms) uncaging light flash
                    triggered an increase in the frequency of small spontaneous inward currents in
                    HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). The inward
                    currents were blocked by NBQX, identifying the events as glutamatergic miniature
                    excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), which have been shown previously to
                    result from photoreceptor vesicular release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Bartoletti1">[45]</xref>. Salamander HCs receive

        <p>We quantified the rate of these events before and after Ca<sup>2+</sup>
                    uncaging in 31 HCs. To identify mEPSCs we used a template matching procedure
                    that compared the waveform of individual events to the average mEPSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). After
                        Ca<sup>2+</sup> uncaging, the peak mEPSC rate increased in 74%
                    of cells, decreased in 10% of cells, and did not change in 16% of
                    cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Overall,
                    the average mEPSC rate increased 86%±29% in the 200 ms
                    following uncaging, which was statistically significant
                    (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). In HCs without DM-nitrophen, the flash caused no
                    significant change in the mEPSC rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g007">Figure 7E,F</xref>). The increase in mEPSC rate was
                    rapid, appearing within 100 ms after the uncaging flash (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g007">Figure 7C</xref>), and persisted for several hundred
                    milliseconds, consistent with the expected decay of the cytoplasmic
                        Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Ayer1">[46]</xref>. These results suggest that
                        Ca<sup>2+</sup> is sufficient for triggering the retrograde signal that
                    accelerates vesicular glutamate release from photoreceptors. In addition,
                    because Ca<sup>2+</sup> was uncaged within an individual HC, these results
                    identify HCs as a source of positive feedback.</p>
        <p>Depolarization of HCs decreased the mEPSC rate, opposite to the effect of
                        Ca<sup>2+</sup> uncaging. After depolarizing from −70 to
                    −40 mV the mEPSC rate declined by 38%±17%

                    operating range of the HC in light versus darkness. The decline in mEPSC rate
                    with HC depolarization is consistent with negative feedback, which decreases
                    neurotransmitter release from photoreceptors. HEPES inhibits negative feedback
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Hirasawa1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Vessey1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Davenport1">[35]</xref> and after adding HEPES, HC depolarization decreased
                    the mEPSC rate by only 8%±12%, no longer statistically
                    significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g007">Figure 7H</xref>).
                    Taken together, these findings indicate that depolarization of the HC leads to a
                    decrease in neurotransmitter release from photoreceptors, whereas raising
                        Ca<sup>2+</sup> leads to an increase in neurotransmitter release.</p>
        <p>We also attempted to detect positive feedback by recording membrane current in an
                    individual cone while uncaging Ca<sup>2+</sup> in an individual HC.
                    Positive feedback should elicit a voltage-independent conductance in the cone,
                    as was elicited by AMPA applied on the entire flat-mounted retina (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g006">Figure 6</xref>). However,
                        Ca<sup>2+</sup> uncaging had no significant effect (unpublished data).
                    Each salamander cone is contacted by ∼12 HCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Pang1">[47]</xref>, so the magnitude of the
                    feedback effect on a single cone from manipulating a single HC should only be
                    1/12 of the total feedback effect, perhaps too small to detect.</p>

        <title>HCs Transmit a Positive Feedback Signal to Photoreceptors</title>
        <p>The findings presented in this article reveal a previously unknown positive
                    feedback synapse onto cone photoreceptors. Our results indicate that HCs are the
                    source of this positive feedback signal. HCs possess the type of glutamate
                    receptors that we implicate in positive feedback (AMPA receptors) and these
                    receptors are located on HC dendrites that invaginate the cone terminal adjacent
                    to sites of synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Selective laser ablation of cells in
                    the HC layer of the INL eliminates positive feedback. Retinal slice experiments
                    suggest that cells that project laterally for &gt;200 µm are required,
                    consistent with the cytoarchitecture of HCs. Finally, our mEPSC analysis
                    indicates that neurotransmitter release from photoreceptors can be evoked by
                    uncaging Ca<sup>2+</sup> within an individual HC, identifying HCs as the
                    source of positive feedback. This shows that a rise in Ca<sup>2+</sup> in
                    an HC is <italic>sufficient</italic> for triggering positive feedback to
                    photoreceptors, but we do not yet have the tools to confirm that a rise in
                        Ca<sup>2+</sup> in HCs is <italic>necessary</italic> for positive
                    feedback.</p>
        <p>Several special features of the synaptic connection between HCs and cones may
                    help explain why positive feedback has evaded notice over the past four decades.
                    First, positive feedback onto a cone cannot be evoked simply by depolarizing a
                    synaptically connected HC, the standard test for synaptic connectivity. Second,
                    positive feedback is compromised by making transverse slices of the retina, a
                    procedure that is a near-necessity for making electrophysiological recordings
                    between HCs and other neurons. Third, without a means for selectively
                    eliminating positive feedback, its effects could easily be misattributed to a
                    higher intrinsic gain of the synaptic release machinery in cones.</p>
        <p>The discovery of positive feedback helps explain a long-standing puzzle about
                    synaptic signaling in the outer retina. Kainate and other selective iGluR
                    agonists hyperpolarize On-bipolar cells in the intact retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Bloomfield1">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Shiells1">[49]</xref> but not in
                    retinal slices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-McGillem1">[50]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Euler1">[52]</xref>. On-bipolar cells in slices continue to exhibit a
                    robust response to glutamate, but this can be completely attributed to mGluRs
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-delaVilla1">[53]</xref>,
                    which are unaffected by kainate. Our results may help explain the indirect
                    action of iGluR agonists: They trigger HC-mediated positive feedback onto rods
                    and cones, increasing their release of glutamate, which leads to
                    hyperpolarization of the On-bipolar cell. An iGluR-elicited signal in amacrine
                    cells may be communicated to On-bipolar cells through GABA receptors, also
                    contributing to the hyperpolarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Hartveit1">[51]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Our results suggest that positive feedback applies not only to cones but also to
                    rods. Most of our optical studies utilized the all-cone retina from anoles, but
                    in retinas containing both rods and cones (including zebrafish, salamander, and
                    rabbit) we noticed no difference in the AMPA-elicited acceleration of
                    neurotransmitter release in rods and cone terminals interspersed in the OPL.
                    Rods and cones are electrically coupled through gap junctions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Raviola2">[54]</xref>, so it is
                    possible that AMPA-elicited enhancement of release from rods is an indirect
                    consequence of signals originating in cones. It is also possible that glutamate
                    released at photoreceptor synapses “spills over” to affect other
                    photoreceptor synapses, contributing to enhanced release from both rods and
                    cones. However, AMPA accelerates release from rod photoreceptors in the gecko
                    retina, which has no true cones. HC-mediated <italic>negative</italic> feedback
                    has recently been demonstrated to occur in rods as well as cones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Thoreson1">[5]</xref>, so it
                    seems likely that the positive feedback signal is also communicated to both
                    photoreceptors.</p>

        <title>Searching for the Mechanism of Positive Feedback</title>
        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g008">Figure 8A</xref> shows our proposed
                    outline of the positive feedback process. First, glutamate released from a cone
                    activates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPA receptors on an HC, leading to
                        Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. This results in an increase in cytoplamsic
                        Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Next, we propose that intracellular
                        Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the HC triggers the release of a retrograde
                    messenger that acts on the cone terminal. Finally, this messenger causes an
                    increase in cone terminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> that accelerates neurotransmitter
                    release.</p>

                            cone depolarized in darkness will release glutamate, activating AMPA
                            receptors (APMARs), causing depolarization and Ca<sup>2+</sup>
                            influx. The rise in Ca<sup>2+</sup> is restricted to the specific
                            dendrite that contacts the cone, and the resulting positive feedback is
                            localized to that cone. The depolarization spreads electrotonically
                            through the HC, resulting in negative feedback from all of the

        <p>The two most important unanswered questions are: (1) What is the identity of the
                    retrograde messenger? (2) What is the receptor for that messenger that leads to
                    a rise of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in cones? Our experiments rule out
                    many conventional neurotransmitters being the retrograde messenger. Positive
                    feedback persists after adding GABA, glycine, or dopamine to the retina, ruling
                    out these neurotransmitters. In fact, EM studies show that HC dendrites lack
                    accumulations of synaptic vesicles and plasma membrane specializations found at
                    active zones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Raviola1">[38]</xref>, making it unlikely that a conventionally secreted
                    neurotransmitter is involved.</p>
        <p>However, neurotransmitters can be released by means other than synaptic vesicle
                    exocytosis. Activation of plasma membrane transporters on HCs can lead to the
                    efflux of GABA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Schwartz1">[55]</xref> and protons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Jouhou1">[56]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Kreitzer1">[57]</xref>, but our experiments rule
                    out either of these being the positive feedback signal. Nitric oxide (NO)
                    diffuses across biological membranes and serves as a retrograde synaptic
                    messenger in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Hawkins1">[58]</xref>. HCs possess NO synthase (NOS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Blom1">[59]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Cao1">[60]</xref>, cones possess the NO effector

                    increase exocytosis from isolated cones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Rieke1">[64]</xref> and NOS or sGC inhibitors
                    decrease release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Savchenko1">[63]</xref>. These observations might seem to make NO a likely
                    candidate. However, we found that positive feedback persists after application
                    of an NO donor, inhibitors of NOS, or inhibitors of sGC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001057.s006">Figure

        <p>Phospholipid-derived molecules are another class of potential retrograde
                    messengers. Arachidonic acid and other polyunsaturated fatty acids are released

                    from the actions of the positive feedback transmitter. Endocannabinoids,
                    including anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), are also found in the
                    retina and there is evidence that they modulate voltage-gated conductances in
                    cones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Yazulla1">[68]</xref>.
                    We find that anandamide does not activate a voltage-independent conductance in

                        S6C</xref>), suggesting that it is not the positive feedback transmitter.
                    There are many other phospholipid-derived molecules that can serve as messengers
                    between cells. For now, the transmitter that mediates positive feedback from HCs
                    to cones is unknown, but hopefully, this mystery will be solved more quickly
                    than the mechanism of negative feedback.</p>
        <p>The retrograde messenger activates a voltage-independent conductance and
                    increases intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in cones, but we do not yet know
                    the channel(s) that are responsible for these events. Several types of
                        Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable non-selective cation channels are found in
                    photoreceptor terminals, including CNG channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Savchenko1">[63]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Rieke1">[64]</xref> and TRPC channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Szikra1">[69]</xref>. The
                    voltage-independent channel may be the conduit for Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry,
                    but we cannot exclude the possibility that activation of these channels is an
                    indirect consequence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation through some other type
                    of channel rather than being the cause of Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation. Our
                    results exclude several other possible routes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry.
                    Voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels can be excluded because AMPA
                    accelerates release in nicardipine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g006">Figure 6I</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from internal stores seems
                    unlikely because reagents that interfere with this process do not inhibit
                    AMPA-accelerated release (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001057.s006">Figure S6B</xref>).</p>

        <p>The cone synapse encodes information about light intensity by modulating its rate

                    However, the benefit of contrast enhancement comes at a cost: negative feedback
                    lowers the maximal release rate and therefore reduces the dynamic range of the
                    cone synapse. This compresses the neural representation of a visual image,
                    counteracting enhanced contrast sensitivity. By boosting neurotransmitter
                    release from cones, positive feedback may recoup the dynamic range lost to
                    negative feedback. The factors that prevent positive feedback from causing
                    runaway excitation remain to be determined.</p>
        <p>Our results indicate that positive feedback temporally overlaps with negative
                    feedback and might play a role in the neural representation of visual stimuli.
                    While the precise time course of positive feedback remains to be determined, the
                    rise in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in an HC peaks within 1 s of
                    glutamate application (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001057.s005">Figure S5C</xref>), and the acceleration of
                    photoreceptor transmitter release peaks within 100 ms of HC Ca<sup>2+</sup>
                    elevation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). These
                    values are over-estimates that are limited by the temporal resolution of our
                    recording methods. In comparison, negative feedback peaks within 100 ms of the
                    onset of light <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Baylor1">[3]</xref> and is maintained indefinitely with persistent
                    illumination.</p>
        <p>We propose that the signals that give rise to positive and negative feedback
                    spread differently through an HC, which may explain why the signals do not
                    simply cancel out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g008">Figure
                    8B</xref>). Our results suggest that positive feedback acts locally, occurring
                    only where HC dendrites receive direct excitatory input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g005">Figure 5F,G</xref>). Immunocytochemistry shows that
                    HCs express the calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin and CaBP-28K <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Rohrenbeck1">[70]</xref>, and
                    these proteins may limit the spread of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to individual HC
                    dendrites, making Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent positive feedback local. In
                    contrast, negative feedback is controlled by the HC voltage, not by
                        Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The voltage signal generated by synaptic current into
                    individual dendrites spreads electrotonically, not only within a single HC but
                    through the syncytium of HCs, distributing negative feedback over a large area
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Smith1">[71]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Hare1">[72]</xref>. Thus our
                    working hypothesis is that positive feedback is more spatially constrained than
                    negative feedback.</p>
        <p>It is perhaps counterintuitive, but if the two feedback signals were to spread
                    differently, positive feedback would amplify, rather than suppress, contrast
                    enhancement mediated by negative feedback. We explored the interplay between
                    these two processes by constructing a model (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) of how feedback might impact release from a linear array of
                    cone terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001057-g008">Figure 8B</xref>).
                    When a dark spot on a brighter background is projected on the retina, cones
                    within the center of the spot are depolarized, maintaining their rate of
                    glutamate release, while those in the surround are hyperpolarized, decreasing
                    release. In the absence of negative feedback, the spatial profile of release
                    from an array of cones mirrors the profile of the stimulus. Adding negative
                    feedback enhances the representation of contrast by opposing the intrinsic
                    response of cones. Release from terminals in the dark spot is decreased by
                    depolarized HCs, while release from terminals in the brighter surround is
                    increased by hyperpolarized HCs. Cone terminals at the light-dark edge receive
                    inputs from HCs straddling the border. Because negative feedback spreads through
                    HCs, cones near the edge will receive signals from both depolarized and
                    hyperpolarized HCs and their effects will cancel, unleashing the full ability of
                    light and dark to modulate cone release. If positive feedback were spatially
                    constrained, it would scale release in direct proportion to the local synaptic
                    output from individual cones. As a result, positive feedback could amplify cone
                    release without sacrificing the contrast enhancement provided by negative
                    feedback.</p>

                    (Warner Instruments) and perfused with solution at 1 ml/min. Drugs were bath

        <p>For Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator dye loading, retinas were bathed for 2 h in

        <title>Imaging</title>
        <p>Retinas were imaged with a Zeiss 510 upright confocal microscope equipped with a
                    MaiTai (Spectra Physics) mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser and a 20× or
                    40× water-immersion objective. The excitation wavelength was tuned to 860
                    nm (FM1-43), 800 nm (OGB-1), or 880 nm (X-Rhod-1). Laser intensity was
                    20–40 mW, averaged power. Images were acquired with Zeiss LSM software,
                    and ImageJ software (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij) was used to analyze the average
                    fluorescence of the OPL.</p>
        <p>FM1-43 fluorescence in the OPL of retinal flat-mounts was measured by taking
                    5–6 images in a Z-stack spaced at 2 µm so that the OPL fell entirely
                    within the Z-stack. Anole cone terminals are ∼6 µm in diameter, so in
                    each stack the brightest focal plane could be identified as containing the
                    center of the cone terminals, and average intensity was measured from this focal
                    plane. This allowed us to readjust our measurement at each time point to
                    compensate for movement of the sample. When the retina was not perfectly flat,
                    the image was divided into quadrants and the measurements were made from the
                    brightest image for each quadrant. The pixel dimension was 0.82×0.82
                    µm (256×256 pixels) and the dwell time per pixel was 3.2 µs
                    (493 ms per image).</p>
        <p>Fluorescence was normalized to 1.0 at the start of experiments. Dye release rates
                    were calculated from the fluorescence decrements between images in time series.
                    Statistical comparisons were performed using unpaired two-tailed Student's
                        <italic>t</italic> tests in Excel (Microsoft). In previous studies we
                    background subtracted OPL measurements with respect to the fluorescence of the
                    INL, which exhibits no light-dependent change in fluorescence over the recording
                    period of ∼20 min <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Choi1">[14]</xref>. However, in this study we could not be certain that
                    glutamate receptor agonists have no effect on FM1-43 fluorescence in the INL, so
                    no background subtraction was used. Consequently, the rate of the normalized
                    FM1-43 fluorescence decline is slower here than in previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Choi1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001057-Sheng1">[73]</xref>. Graphing

        <title>Ablation and Agonist-Uncaging</title>
        <p>To ablate cell layers in retinal slices, the Ti:sapphire laser power was
                    increased to maximal (∼2 W average output) and the laser was scanned in a
                    line 400–500 µm across the slice surface at the layer of the retina
                    chosen for ablation, at a speed of 500 µm/ms. The line scan was repeated 8
                    times, before the focus was moved in the z-direction. This was repeated at depth
                    intervals of 2 µm, to a final depth of 30 µm into the slice.</p>
        <p>For experiments involving NVOC-AMPA uncaging, light from a mercury lamp was
                    focused through the microscope objective onto the plane of the OPL. Light was
                    filtered through a Zeiss FS02 filter set
                    (EM<sub>max</sub> = 365 nm) and controlled by electronic
                    shutter. To uncage AMPA within a small spot, the microscope field stop was
                    closed, producing a spot of UV light with a Gaussian profile and a FWHM diameter
                    of 100 µm, determined by photobleaching of FM1-43 absorbed onto filter

        <p>For MNI-glutamate uncaging, the mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser was tuned to 720 nm
                    light (∼50 mW). After adding 2 mM MNI-glu to the bath solution, the laser
                    was scanned over a 2×2 µm section of the HC dendrite for &lt;100
                    µs. Calcium Orange dye was excited with a 543 nm HeNe laser, and images
                    were acquired at 1 s intervals using a Zeiss 510 upright confocal
