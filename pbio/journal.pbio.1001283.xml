        <p>Electrophysiological and behavioral experiments in mice reveal that a cGMP-dependent kinase amplifies neurotransmitter release from peripheral pain sensors, potentiates spinal synapses, and leads to exaggerated pain.</p>
      </abstract><abstract>
        <p>Synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) at spinal neurons directly communicating pain-specific inputs from the periphery to the brain has been proposed to serve as a trigger for pain hypersensitivity in pathological states. Previous studies have functionally implicated the NMDA receptor-NO pathway and the downstream second messenger, cGMP, in these processes. Because cGMP can broadly influence diverse ion-channels, kinases, and phosphodiesterases, pre- as well as post-synaptically, the precise identity of cGMP targets mediating spinal LTP, their mechanisms of action, and their locus in the spinal circuitry are still unclear. Here, we found that Protein Kinase G1 (PKG-I) localized presynaptically in nociceptor terminals plays an essential role in the expression of spinal LTP. Using the Cre-lox P system, we generated nociceptor-specific knockout mice lacking PKG-I specifically in presynaptic terminals of nociceptors in the spinal cord, but not in post-synaptic neurons or elsewhere (SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice). Patch clamp recordings showed that activity-induced LTP at identified synapses between nociceptors and spinal neurons projecting to the periaqueductal grey (PAG) was completely abolished in SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice, although basal synaptic transmission was not affected. Analyses of synaptic failure rates and paired-pulse ratios indicated a role for presynaptic PKG-I in regulating the probability of neurotransmitter release. Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor 1 and myosin light chain kinase were recruited as key phosphorylation targets of presynaptic PKG-I in nociceptive neurons. Finally, behavioural analyses in vivo showed marked defects in SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice in several models of activity-induced nociceptive hypersensitivity, and pharmacological studies identified a clear contribution of PKG-I expressed in spinal terminals of nociceptors. Our results thus indicate that presynaptic mechanisms involving an increase in release probability from nociceptors are operational in the expression of synaptic LTP on spinal-PAG projection neurons and that PKG-I localized in presynaptic nociceptor terminals plays an essential role in this process to regulate pain sensitivity.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Pain is an important physiological function that protects our body from harm. Pain-sensing neurons, called nociceptors, transduce harmful stimuli into electrical signals and transmit this information to the brain via the spinal cord. When nociceptors are persistently activated, such as after injury, the connections they make with neurons in the spinal cord are altered in a process called synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP). In this study, we examine the molecular and cellular mechanisms of LTP at synapses from nociceptors onto spinal neurons. We use multiple experimental approaches in mice, from genetic to behavioural, to show that this form of LTP involves presynaptic events that unfold in nociceptors when they are repetitively activated. In particular, an enzyme activated by the second messenger cGMP, referred to as Protein Kinase G-I, phosphorylates presynaptic proteins and increases the release of neurotransmitters from nociceptor endings in the spinal cord. When we genetically silence Protein Kinase G-I or block its activation in nociceptors, inflammatory pain is markedly reduced at the behavioural level. These results clarify basic mechanisms of pathological pain and pave the way for new therapeutic approaches.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Plasticity in peripheral nociceptors and their synapses with spinal neurons has been proposed as a cellular basis for the development and maintenance of pain hypersensitivity following peripheral inflammation or nerve injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Basbaum1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Woolf1">[3]</xref>. Activation of nociceptive nerve afferents at frequencies relevant to pathological pain states can trigger long-term potentiation (LTP) at spinal synapses between nociceptor terminals and spinal neurons projecting nociceptive information to the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Ikeda1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Ikeda2">[5]</xref>. Importantly, this form of synaptic plasticity can be evoked by asynchronous activation of nociceptors in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Ikeda2">[5]</xref>, occurs in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Klein1">[6]</xref>, and is functionally associated with a sensation of exaggerated pain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Ikeda2">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Klein1">[6]</xref>. Although there is evidence for a requirement of post-synaptic calcium-dependent mechanisms in the induction of LTP at this synapse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Ikeda2">[5]</xref>, the precise mechanisms underlying the expression of spinal LTP are not entirely clear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Sandkuhler2">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Synaptic LTP evoked by natural, asynchronous low-rate discharges in C-nociceptors on spino-PAG neurons was recently shown to constitute a very fitting correlate of spinal amplification phenomena underlying inflammatory pain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Ikeda2">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Sandkuhler2">[7]</xref>. This form of synaptic change has been reported to involve activation of NMDA receptors, NO release, and synthesis of cGMP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Ikeda2">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Sandkuhler2">[7]</xref>. However, which of the diverse targets of cGMP come into play at this synapse and how they mechanistically bring about long-lasting changes in the transfer of nociceptive information between the nociceptors and spinal neurons projecting to the brain is not understood so far. Furthermore, very little is known about exactly how neural circuits involved in pain processing are modulated by cGMP and which cellular and molecular processes underlie these changes.</p>
      <p>Studies on several different biological systems have shown that cGMP regulates multiple cellular targets, including diverse cGMP-gated ion channels, such as cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, the cGMP-dependent protein kinases, PKG-I/cGK-I and PKG-II/cGK-II, as well as diverse phosphodiesterases (PDEs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Hofmann1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Kaupp1">[9]</xref>. Nearly all of these molecular targets of cGMP are expressed in nociceptive pathways and may potentially contribute to the key role of cGMP in synaptic potentiation in the spinal cord. Amongst these targets, PKG-I has emerged as a key mediator of cGMP functions in smooth muscle and platelet function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Hofmann1">[8]</xref>. The α-isoform of PKG-I has been reported to be expressed very highly in the primary sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) over developmental <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Schmidt1">[10]</xref> and adult stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Qian1">[11]</xref>, and several regions in the brain and the spinal cord also express PKG-I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Feil1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Feil2">[13]</xref>. Pharmacological and genetic studies in global, constitutive mutant mice have linked PKG-I to the development of the nociceptive circuitry as well as to spinal mechanisms of hyperalgesia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Tegeder1">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Based upon this background, this study was designed with two goals in mind. First, it addressed the potential involvement of presynaptic mechanisms in the expression of synaptic potentiation on spinal projection neurons, which has not been explored or described previously. Second, it aimed to explore a potential role for PKG-I localized presynaptically in the spinal terminals of nociceptors in spinal potentiation and to clarify cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these processes. We reasoned that the use of a conditional, region-specific gene deletion strategy to specifically manipulate presynaptic mechanisms might constitute an unambiguous approach towards addressing the above questions. Our results show that spinal synaptic potentiation triggered by nociceptor activation is associated with a long-lasting change in the probability of neurotransmitter release from spinal terminals of nociceptors. Using viable, developmentally normal transgenic mice lacking the PKG-I specifically in nociceptors with preserved expression in spinal neurons, brain, and all other organs, we demonstrate here that PKG-I localised in nociceptor terminals constitutes a key mediator of synaptic LTP and that its activation is functionally associated with pain hypersensitivity in vivo.</p>

An anti-PKG-I antibody <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Schlossmann1">[18]</xref> yielded specific staining in wild-type dorsal root ganglia (DRG), but not in those from global PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Pfeifer1">[19]</xref>, thereby revealing Cre/loxP-mediated deletion of PKG-I in DRG of SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Quantitative size-frequency analysis revealed that a majority of DRG neurons expressing PKG-I in wild-type mice are small-diameter neurons, which show a near complete loss of PKG-I expression in SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g001">Figure 1B</xref>; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001).

            <p>(A) Immunoreactivity for an anti-PKG-I antibody was detected widely in DRG neurons of mice carrying floxed PKG-I alleles (PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup>) and was lost either selectively in SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice or entirely in global PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice.

        <p>We found that PKG-I expression is entirely unaltered in the brains of SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice (an example of expression in cerebellar purkinje neurons is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g001">Figure 1E</xref>, right panel), whereas global PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice demonstrated a complete loss of anti-PKG-I immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g001">Figure 1E</xref>, right panel). In the spinal cord of SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice, anti-PKG-I immunoreactivity was decreased selectively in the superficial dorsal laminae, which represent termination zones of the nociceptive afferents, as would be expected from SNS-Cre-mediated gene deletion in nociceptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g001">Figure 1E</xref>, left panel). In contrast, neurons in the spinal cord entirely maintained immunoreactivity for PKG-I and appeared particularly conspicuous (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g001">Figure 1E</xref>, left panel) due to the loss of PKG-I labelling in afferent terminals in SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice. Furthermore, anti-Cre immunohistochemistry as well as Western blot analysis with anti-PKG-I antibody confirmed that SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice show a DRG-specific loss of PKG-I while retaining expression in the spinal cord and brain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001283.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>In contrast to global PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice, which typically demonstrate lethality in the first few weeks of life, SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice were normal, fertile, and showed a normal life expectancy. In contrast to defects reported in global PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Schmidt1">[10]</xref>, SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice showed normal early targeting of TrkA-expressing primary afferents arising from the DRG (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g001">Figure 1F</xref>, upper panels) in the developing spinal dorsal horn at embryonic day 13 (E13). Unlike global PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Schmidt1">[10]</xref>, SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice did not show defects in T-branching of DiI-labelled primary afferents in the spinal cord over embryonic developmental stages (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g001">Figure 1F</xref>, lower panels). Similarly, central and peripheral patterning of peptidergic or non-peptidergic nociceptors was normal in adult SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup>mice, as revealed by immunostaining for substance P and binding to IB<sub>4</sub>, respectively, in the spinal dorsal horns and skin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001283.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). Because peptidergic mechanisms have been suggested to play an important role in spinal LTP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Ikeda2">[5]</xref>, we ascertained that SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice are not different from control mice with respect to the abundance of substance P in the spinal circuitry. Control and knockout mice exhibited the same prevalence of substance P-immunoreactive cells within DRG (33%±5% versus 29%±3%, respectively), which were not significantly different from each other (<italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05, Student's <italic>t</italic> test). Moreover, the level of substance P immunoreactivity was similar in the superficial spinal dorsal horn across genotypes (mean intensities in PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice and SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice were 50±3 and 51±3 arbitrary units, respectively). Importantly, confocal microscopy revealed normal density of synapses between substance P-containing nociceptive afferents and PSD-95-positive puncta (representing postsynaptic aspects of glutamatergic synapses) in the spinal dorsal horns of SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice as compared to PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (examples and quantification in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001283.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). Finally, we addressed the internalization of NK1 receptors on spinal lamina I neurons following peripheral nociceptive stimulation in vivo, which has been demonstrated to be a clear indicator of nociceptive activity-induced synaptic release of substance P <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Mantyh1">[20]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001283.s002">Figure S2C</xref>, application of a 52°C heat stimulus for 20 s to the plantar paw surface led to internalization of NK1 receptors in lamina I neurons of L3/L4 segments to a similar extent in SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> and PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (quantification in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001283.s002">Figure S2D</xref>). Unlike global PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Tegeder1">[14]</xref>, SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice showed a normal lamination of the spinal cord over early postnatal stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001283.s002">Figure S2E</xref>). Thus, the multiple developmental defects in the patterning of sensory afferents and spinal lamination that have been reported in global PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice were not observed in SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice.</p>

        <title>Loss of PKG-I in Presynaptic C-Fiber Terminals, But Not Postsynaptically in Spino-PAG Neurons, Precludes Expression of Spinal LTP without Altering Basal Transmission or Excitability</title>
        <p>To address activity-dependent plasticity at spinal synapses, we recorded C-fiber-evoked synaptic LTP on spinal lamina I neurons projecting to the periaqueductal grey (PAG), which were retrogradely labelled upon stereotactic injection of DiI in the PAG (the experimental scheme is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and an example of a labelled cell is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001283.s003">Figure S3A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Ikeda2">[5]</xref>. In spinal-PAG projection neurons of wild-type mice, a conditioning low frequency stimulation of 2 Hz for 2 min produced synaptic LTP of monosynaptic C-fiber evoked EPSCs by more than 200% at 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). LTP at these synapses was preserved in the presence of strychnine and gabazine, which block glycinergic and GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Similar results were obtained upon using another standard blocker of GABAergic neurotransmission, bicuculline, in combination with strychnine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001283.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). Hence, LTP does not manifest due to primary afferent depolarization mediated by presynaptic GABA receptors or disinhibition of the postsynaptic neuron. To test whether LTP requires a postsynaptic function of PKG-I, we dialyzed standard PKG-I inhibitors, such as the non-permeant peptide inhibitor RKRARKE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Glass1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Wexler1">[22]</xref> or KT5823 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Yang1">[23]</xref>, into spinal neurons via the patch pipette.

        <p>To assess the role of PKG-I localized presynaptically in spinal nociceptor terminals, we then analysed PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice and SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice. In spinal-PAG projection neurons of PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, a conditioning low frequency stimulation of 2 Hz for 2 min produced LTP with a magnitude of more than 200% at 30 min and more than 300% by 60 min (typical examples of time course and EPSC traces are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g002">Figure 2D,E</xref>). Prior to the conditioning stimulus, baseline values of C-fiber-evoked EPSCs stayed constant over the period of recording in both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g002">Figure 2D,E</xref>). In striking contrast to PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, the conditioning stimulus did not evoke LTP in spinal-PAG projection neurons in SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g002">Figure 2D,E</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g002">Figure 2F and 2G</xref> for quantitative summary at 30 min post-conditioning stimulus; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; at least 13 neurons from each genotype were tested).</p>
        <p>For a clear interpretation of these data, it is imperative to address how basal nociceptive transmission at these synapses is affected in SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice. Analysis of EPSC magnitude evoked by the first and the last pulse of the conditioning train revealed short-term depression of evoked EPSCs during the conditioning train, which was equivalent in PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice and SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g003">Figure 3A</xref>; <italic>p</italic> = 0.95), showing that the conditioning stimulus was equally effective in mice from both groups. Furthermore, basal C-fiber-evoked EPSCs were comparable between PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> and SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice. We also established detailed input-output curves representing the relationship between the intensity of dorsal root stimulation and evoked EPSCs in the absence of a conditioning stimulus and found no differences between PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> and SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g003">Figure 3B</xref>; <italic>p</italic> = 0.74). Furthermore, the intensity of dorsal root stimulation required to elicit an action potential in post-synaptic spinal-PAG projection neurons was identical in PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> and SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice (an example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). The intact nature of responsiveness in spinal-PAG projection neurons was demonstrated by similarities in their activation profiles upon current injection in SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice and their PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> littermates (an example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). In all of the above experiments, quantitative analyses revealed that resting membrane potential, action potential width, delay after stimulation artefact, action potential threshold, delay for generation of first action potential (latency to first AP), as well as amplitude of after hyperpolarisation (AHP) were similar in SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice and PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g003">Figure 3E</xref>; <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05 in all cases, Student's <italic>t</italic> test). Finally, as an additional indicator of the number of fibers activated during electrical stimulation, we recorded fiber volleys in input/output measurements. Recording C-fiber volleys in the L4 and L5 dorsal roots derived from PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> and SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice revealed typical responses, which increased in amplitude with increasing stimulus intensity (representative traces are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). The amplitudes of C-fiber volley responses were not significantly different between PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> and SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice (stimulus-response curves are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g003">Figure 3G</xref>; <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05; <italic>n</italic> = 16 per genotype), demonstrating directly that the number of fibers activated upon electrical stimulation was comparable between genotypes and could therefore not explain the failure to evoke synaptic potentiation in SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice. These comprehensive analyses show that a presynaptic loss of PKG-I was specifically linked to a failure of activity-dependent potentiation of transmission at synapses between nociceptors and spinal-PAG projection neurons, but not to modulation of basal synaptic transmission.</p>

        <title>Evidence for a Presynaptic Mechanism for Synaptic Potentiation on Spinal-PAG Projection Neurons and a Role for Presynaptic PKG-I</title>
        <p>Following our observation that a specific presynaptic alteration in PKG-I expression perturbed spinal LTP, we then addressed potential contributions of presynaptic mechanisms at synapses between nociceptors and spinal projection neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Sandkuhler2">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Ji1">[24]</xref>. By recording miniature EPSCs in spinal-PAG projection neurons of control mice, we observed that quantal content varies largely, which is expected since these spinal projection neurons receive multisynaptic inputs from primary afferents as well as spinal interneurons. Furthermore, inputs arising from spinal interneurons are not expected to change in SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice since the molecular perturbation is specific to nociceptor terminals. Thus, the net contribution of C-fibers to the population of mEPSCs is difficult to assess because it is unclear which fraction of mEPSCs can be attributed to C-fibers, which then makes detection of potentially small presynaptic changes highly unlikely when performing mini-analysis. To study synaptic events which could be clearly assigned to activation of presynaptic primary afferent fibers alone, we employed a protocol of minimal stimulation, setting the dorsal root stimulation parameters such that a synaptic failure rate of approximately 60% was achieved in recording solution containing 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>. The failure rate remained constant over a period of at least 30 min upon repetitive test stimulation in the absence of a conditioning stimulus (55.9%±3.9% pre- and 57.1%±8.1% at 30 min). However, upon application of the conditioning stimulus, minimal stimulation using the same parameters evoked a decrease in the frequency of synaptic failures within a few minutes in slices derived from PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, indicating a change in the probability of neurotransmitter release; decrease in synaptic failures was accompanied by a corresponding rise in the magnitude of C-fiber-evoked EPSCs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g004">Figure 4A</xref> for typical example and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g004">Figure 4C</xref> for quantitative summary of C-fiber-evoked EPSCs recorded every 15 s; <italic>n</italic> = 5; <italic>p</italic> = 0.04). In contrast, the rate of synaptic failures did not change significantly following conditioning stimulus in slices derived from SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g004">Figure 4B and 4C</xref>; <italic>n</italic> = 7; <italic>p</italic> = 0.68).

            <p>(A, B) Activation of C-nociceptors potentiates synaptic transmission by decreasing the rate of synaptic failures via activation of presynaptic PKG-I. Shown are typical examples of the frequency of synaptic failures (arrows) and synaptic successes (C-fiber-evoked EPSCs) evoked by minimal stimulation of dorsal roots prior to and after application of the conditioning stimulus in PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (A) and SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice (B). (C) Summary of average failure rates upon minimal stimulation of dorsal roots prior to and 30 min following the conditioning stimulus (<italic>n</italic> = 5 slices for PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice and 7 slices for SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice). (D–F) Analysis of paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and paired-pulse depression (PPD) of C-fiber-evoked EPSCs induced by pairs of stimuli at inter-stimulus interval of 110 ms in spino-PAG projection neurons from PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> and SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice. Traces of typical recordings showing PPF or PPD prior to (basal) and at 30 min following low-frequency conditioning stimulation of C-fibers (LFS) are shown in panel D. Paired-pulse ratios (PPR) prior to and at 30 min after conditioning stimulation are plotted in panel E (PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice) and panel F (SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice). Values of PPR above and below 1 prior to conditioning stimulation are represented as PPF (pink field) and PPD (blue field), respectively. Note that in PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, neurons showing low initial PPF show an increase in PPF after conditioning stimulation, whereas neurons showing an initial high PPF show a decrease in PPF following conditioning stimulation, which corresponds to an increase in probability of release. These changes are reduced or do not come about in SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice. All data are represented as mean ± S.E.M. * <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, ANOVA of random measures followed by post hoc Fisher's test.</p>

        <p>In analogy to studies on hippocampal circuits, although the above evidence for a decrease in failure rate is indicative of increased presynaptic release probability, it has also been linked to unsilencing of silent synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Voronin1">[25]</xref>. Therefore, to further consolidate presynaptic mechanisms, we focussed on the analysis of paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), which represents a short-lasting increase in the second evoked EPSP when it follows shortly after the first and is well accepted as an indication of presynaptic mechanisms of long-term potentiation in the hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Schulz1">[26]</xref>. In hippocampal CA1 neurons, PPF can increase as well as decrease in conjunction with LTP in a manner inversely proportional to the PPF prior to the conditioning stimulus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Schulz1">[26]</xref>. Indeed, we obtained similar results in recordings at spinal synapses between C-fibers and spinal-PAG projection neurons. In spinal slices derived from mice of both genotypes, we found evidence for PPF as well as paired-pulse depression (PPD) prior to the LTP-inducing conditioning stimulus (typical traces are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Whereas a majority of neurons derived from PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice demonstrated a clear change in PPF or PPD following conditioning stimulus, neurons derived from SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice did not (see examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). We then plotted the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) of the entire cohort of recorded neurons at 30 min after conditioning stimulation as a function of the basal PPR recorded prior to the conditioning stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g004">Figure 4E,F</xref>). This analysis revealed that neurons in PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice with larger basal values of PPR prior to the conditioning stimulus (indicated by filled round symbols in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g004">Figure 4E</xref>) consistently showed a decrease in PPR after the conditioning stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), which is indicative of an increase in the probability of release (P<sub>R</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). This drop in PPF following conditioning stimulation did not come about or was reduced in neurons from SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice (filled round symbols in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). A smaller cohort of synapses in PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice showed an increase in PPF after conditioning stimulation, but this was restricted to neurons with a low magnitude of PPF prior to the conditioning stimulus (i.e., a PPR of about 1.1–1.2, filled square symbols in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g004">Figure 4E</xref>) and a low expression of LTP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001283.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). Again, this change was not observed in the corresponding cohort of neurons in SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice (filled square symbols <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g004">in Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001283.s004">Figure S4B</xref>). Conversely, in PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup>mice, higher magnitudes of LTP (i.e., between 150% and 350%, indicated by black frame in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001283.s004">Figure S4A</xref>) were consistently associated with a decrease in PPR, which is indicative of an increase in release probability. Neither LTP nor consistent changes in PPR were observed in SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001283.s004">Figure S4B</xref>). In conclusion, the failure rate analysis and PPR analysis strongly support the inference that the expression of LTP at spino-PAG synapses comes about via presynaptic mechanisms involving an increase in release probability via PKG-I.</p>

        <title>Signalling Targets of PKG-I in Nociceptors, Their Activation upon Nociceptive Stimulation, and Their Role in Spinal Plasticity</title>
        <p>In an effort to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms, we then addressed potential substrates for the kinase activity of PKG-I in nociceptors. In particular, we reviewed known substrates of PKG-I in other biological systems and focussed on those for which we hypothesized a role in synaptic transmission. We first set up an assay system for testing involvement of PKG-I substrates in the DRG selectively upon persistent nociceptive stimulation in vivo, using Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), a classical target of PKG-I, as an indicator of PKG-I activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Hofmann1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Aszodi1">[27]</xref>. Lysates of L4-L5 DRGs from naïve PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> and SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice showed comparable levels of VASP expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001283.s005">Figure S5A</xref>, basal). Within minutes after persistent nociceptive stimulation via injection of formalin in the hindpaw, L4-L5 DRGs from PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice showed a striking phosphorylation of VASP at Serine 239 (typical examples in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001283.s005">Figure S5A</xref> and summary in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001283.s005">Figure S5B</xref>,C; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001283.s007">Text S1</xref> for details; <italic>p</italic> = 0.03 as compared to basal). This was markedly reduced in formalin-injected SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001283.s005">Figure S5A</xref>,B; <italic>p</italic> = 0.18 as compared to basal SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice and 0.03 as compared to formalin-injected PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice). These results show that persistent activation of nociceptors leads to rapid signalling via PKG-I in DRG neurons in vivo, which is lost in SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice, as expected.</p>
        <p>Using this assay system, we then addressed another key target of PKG-I, which has been mainly studied so far mechanistically in smooth muscle cells. Dephosphorylation of myosin light chains (MLC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Surks1">[28]</xref> via PKG-I-dependent phosphorylation and activation of myosin light chain phosphatase in smooth muscle cells is a decisive mechanism underlying NO-mediated vasodilation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Hofmann1">[8]</xref>. Following formalin injection in the paw, we observed a strong phosphorylation of MLC in L4-L5 DRGs from PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, which was found to be lacking in formalin-treated SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>). These differences did not arise due to differences in expression levels of MLC between SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice and PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g005">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001283.s005">Figure S5C</xref>). This finding was unexpected because it suggests a role for PKG-I in increasing MLC phosphorylation in DRG neurons, which is contrary to the classical role ascribed to PKG-I in MLC dephosphorylation. We reasoned that if our findings hold true, synthesis of cGMP ought to be a critical intermediate step in activity-dependent MLC phosphorylation in DRG neurons. Indeed, in mice pre-treated with an inhibitor of the soluble guanylyl cyclase, ODQ, and a pan-inhibitor of membrane-bound guanylyl cyclases, LY83583, via intrathecal application, formalin-induced MLC phosphorylation in L4-L5 DRGs was strongly reduced (see examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g005">Figure 5C</xref>; quantitative summary from three experiments is given below the Western blot). Immunohistochemistry revealed that nociceptor activation-induced increase in MLC phosphorylation occurred in the spinal termination zone of nociceptors (lamina I and II) as well as in spinal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g005">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>

        <p>Interestingly, synaptic potentiation induced by a conditioning stimulus on spinal-PAG projection neurons was abolished in the presence of ML-7, an inhibitor of MLCK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g005">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g005">Figure 5F</xref>; <italic>p</italic> = 0.004 as compared to vehicle-treated control slices).

Thus, the PKG-I target, pMLC, is functionally linked to potentiation of synaptic transmission in nociceptive laminae.</p>
        <p>Ikeda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Ikeda2">[5]</xref> have reported that inhibition of IP<sub>3</sub>R activation blocks conditioning stimulus-induced synaptic potentiation at synapses between nociceptors and spinal-PAG projection neurons. This is particularly interesting because IP<sub>3</sub>R1 contains a PKG-I-recognition motif at serine 1755 and has been reported to be phosphorylated by PKG-I in vitro, putatively leading to gain of function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Komalavilas1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Wagner1">[30]</xref>.

        <p>PKG-I-mediated phosphorylation of serine 1755 in IP<sub>3</sub>R1 has been suggested to positively modulate IP<sub>3</sub>R1 activity in heterologous test systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Wagner1">[30]</xref>. We observed that this function of PKG-I indeed plays an important role in modulating calcium release from intracellular stores in nociceptive neurons of the DRG. We performed Fura-2-based calcium imaging on dissociated DRG neurons derived from PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> and SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice using Fluro488-conjugated Isolectin B<sub>4</sub> (IB<sub>4</sub>-Fluro488) for live identification of small-diameter nociceptive neurons (neurons dually labelled with Fura-2 and IB4-Fluor488 are indicated by arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). The baseline values of the Fura2 ratios (F340/F380) were not significantly different between control mice (1.049±0.010) and SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice (1.040±0.008) (<italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05; Student's <italic>t</italic> test). Stimulation of calcium release via activation of G<sub>q/11</sub>-phospholipase C-IP<sub>3</sub>R1 pathway by addition of ligands, such as bradykinin (BK) and the P2Y-receptor ligand, UTP, led to typical increases in the ratio of Fura-2 fluorescence at 340/380 nm in neurons from PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, which were markedly reduced in neurons from SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g006">Figure 6D</xref> for typical examples and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g006">Figure 6E</xref> for quantitative summary; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001 with respect to BK and UTP). In contrast, Fura2-labelled neurons with large-diameter somata, which were IB4-negative, did not show differences in calcium responses between PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice and SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice (an example is indicated by arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g006">Figure 6C</xref> and quantitative summary is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). In contrast, rapid calcium influx caused by KCl-induced depolarisation or capsaicin-evoked influx of calcium via TRPV channels was comparable in DRG neurons derived from SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice and PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g006">Figure 6D,E</xref>; <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05), showing thereby that a loss of PKG-I in nociceptive neurons is specifically linked to defects in IP<sub>3</sub>R-mediated calcium release from intracellular stores.</p>
        <p>Taken together, these biochemical and functional experiments suggest that following persistent nociceptive stimulation, PKG-I mediates potentiation of IP<sub>3</sub>R1 activity and MLC phosphorylation in sensory neurons, which is functionally linked to synaptic LTP at synapses between C-nociceptors and spinal-PAG projection neurons.</p>

        <p>In the context of studying disease-induced pain hypersensitivity, we first focussed on a model of inflammatory pain which is associated with primary hyperalgesia in the inflamed area and ongoing nociceptive inputs from the periphery throughout the time of testing, namely unilateral hindpaw inflammation induced by injection of Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Gangadharan1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Hartmann1">[33]</xref>. CFA injection produced similar levels of edema in SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> and PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001283.s006">Figure S6C</xref>) and hypersensitivity to graded von Frey mechanical stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g007">Figure 7C,D</xref>) or to plantar heat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g007">Figure 7E</xref>) applied to the ipsilateral paw was assessed at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 96 h thereafter. Following inflammation, PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice demonstrated the characteristic leftward and upward shift in the stimulus-response curve over basal curves reflecting mechanical hypersensitivity (black squares in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). In contrast, SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice demonstrated a less marked deviation from baseline behaviour upon CFA-induced inflammation (red squares in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Furthermore, the relative drop in response thresholds to von Frey hairs (defined here as minimum force required to elicit 40% response frequency) in the inflamed state over basal (pre-CFA) state occurred to a significantly lesser extent in SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice as compared to PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (left panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g007">Figure 7D</xref>; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 at all time points tested). Finally, SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice showed a significantly lower magnitude of thermal hyperalgesia than PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice at 6 h after CFA and did not show hyperalgesia at all from 12 h onwards after CFA injection, whereas PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice continued to show thermal hyperalgesia all the way up to the latest time point tested, namely 96 h following CFA injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g007">Figure 7E</xref>; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01 between PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> and SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice at all time points tested). We infer from the above that the development of primary hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia following somatic inflammation is impaired by a loss of PKG-I in nociceptors.</p>
        <p>Although perturbation of spinal LTP may have contributed to the above phenotype in SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice, it is conceivable that a peripheral role for PKG-I in nociceptors may at least partially account for changes in primary hyperalgesia. To address functional changes in nociceptor sensitivity in the inflamed tissue, we utilised the skin-nerve preparation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Wetzel1">[34]</xref> to study the electrophysiological properties of identified polymodal C-fibres and Aδ-mechanoceptors (AM) in the saphenous nerve. The excitability of mechanoreceptive C-fibers and AM-fibers showed a small, but significant, increase following paw inflammation in PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g007">Figure 7F</xref> for typical examples), but not in SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g007">Figure 7F</xref>). These data indicate defects in the development of peripheral sensitization in nociceptors of SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice, which could contribute to a reduction in primary hyperalgesia; however, they are unlikely to account for the marked defects in mechanical allodynia observed following inflammation in SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice.</p>

        <title>Models of Subacute and Chronic Central Hypersensitivity, Which Are Independent of Ongoing Input from Peripheral Nociceptors</title>
        <p>To explore central contributions, we utilised two models of aberrant pain which are triggered initially by peripheral inputs but do not require ongoing nociceptor activity in the periphery for maintenance. For example, capsaicin injection in the skin activates C-fibers and evokes hyperalgesia in the area of the flare (primary hyperalegsia) as well as outside of the flare (secondary hyperalgesia). In PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, we observed that injection of capsaicin in the skin of the lower thigh produced a marked allodynia at the hindpaw plantar surface, which was clearly excluded from the area capsaicin-induced flare (see shift in von Frey response frequency in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g008">Figure 8A</xref>; black symbols). SNS-PGK-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice showed markedly reduced secondary hypersensitivity with capsaicin as compared to PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (red symbols in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). Moreover, a capsaicin-induced drop in mechanical threshold (allodynia) was markedly reduced in SNS-PGK-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice as compared to PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). It is well accepted that capsaicin-induced secondary mechanical hypersensitivity reflects C-fiber-evoked central amplification processes and can last for several hours, long after nociceptor responses to capsaicin have ceased owing to desensitisation of TRP channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Meyer1">[35]</xref>. Nevertheless, to rule out a potential contribution of ongoing peripheral inputs to the above-described phenotypic differences, we performed experiments in which nerve conduction was blocked with lidocaine in the peripheral dermatome in which capsaicin was injected in wild-type mice. As expected, lidocaine-induced nerve blockade prior to capsaicin injection blocked the induction of capsaicin-induced mechanical hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g008">Figure 8C</xref>); in contrast, when lidocaine was injected 15 min after capsaicin, mechanical hypersensitivity developed normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g008">Figure 8C</xref>), indicating that beyond the initial trigger, capsaicin-induced mechanical hypersensitivity is independent of ongoing input from peripheral nociceptors. In further experiments, we addressed the peripheral and central contributions of PKG-I. Pharmacological inhibition of PKG-I with KT5823 injected prior to injection of capsaicin in the same dermatome in wild-type mice did not block the development of capsaicin-induced mechanical hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g008">Figure 8D</xref>); in contrast, when KT5823 was injected intrathecally prior to peripheral capsaicin injection, the induction of mechanical hypersensitivity was markedly inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g008">Figure 8E</xref>), indicating a role for central PKG-I, but not peripherally expressed PKG-I. To further delineate the origin of the central (spinal) locus of PKG-I function, we undertook similar experiments in PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice and SNS-PGK-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice. Interestingly, intrathecally administered PKG-I inhibitor blocked the development of capsaicin-induced mechanical hypersensitivity in PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice and did not lower mechanical sensitivity any further in SNS-PGK-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g008">Figure 8F</xref>), demonstrating thereby the presynaptic locus of its action.</p>

        <p>In the muscle pain model by Sluka and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Sluka1">[36]</xref>, two consecutive injections of dilute acidic saline in the flank muscle lead to secondary mechanical hypersensitivity in the ipsilateral and contralateral paws, which lasts for several weeks. The initial peripheral insult (i.e., flank muscle) is spatially distinct from the area of application of nociceptive stimuli (paw surface), ruling out a contribution of peripheral paw sensitization to the behavioural phenotype. Secondly, it has been shown in details previously that the secondary hyperalgesia in the paw lasts for several months after muscle injection, is not associated with any persistent inflammation or injury to the muscle tissue, is independent of peripheral inputs, and is thus central in origin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Sluka1">[36]</xref>. Upon testing at 24 h after the induction of muscle pain, PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice demonstrated a pronounced leftward and upward shift in the stimulus-response curve to von Frey hairs applied to the plantar paw surface (black squares in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g009">Figure 9A</xref>, middle panel), which was still evident 3 wk later in the ipsilateral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g009">Figure 9A</xref>, right panel); this changes come about in the paw ipsilateral to the injected flank muscle (upper panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g009">Figure 9A</xref>) as well as in the contralateral paw (lower panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g009">Figure 9A</xref>).

        <title>Signalling Pathways Upstream of PKG-I Activation in Spinal Nociceptive Circuits</title>
        <p>Finally, we asked whether PKG-I expressed in nociceptors constitutes an important target of the NMDA-NOS-cGMP pathway. Consistent with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Kolhekar1">[37]</xref>, intrathecally administered NMDA produced a rapid facilitation of the paw withdrawal reflex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g010">Figure 10A</xref>). Importantly, in striking contrast to PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (black symbols), SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice completely failed to develop hyperalgesia following intrathecal NMDA delivery (red symbols, upper panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g010">Figure 10A</xref>).

        <p>Because soluble guanylyl cyclases (sGC) represent a key molecular link between NO and activation of PKG-I, the above results imply that NO activates sGC in spinal presynaptic terminals of nociceptors. While some studies report a lack of sGC expression in DRG neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Schmidtko1">[38]</xref>, others reported expression in a population of small diameter DRG neurons and in primary afferents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Maihofner1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Ruscheweyh1">[40]</xref>. Here, we carried out mRNA in situ hybridisation using riboprobes recognising the beta subunit of sGC on mouse DRG sections and observed distinct, specific signals over the soma of several large and small-diameter DRG neurons (arrowheads and arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g010">Figure 10C</xref>, respectively). Furthermore, the satellite cells surrounding DRG neurons showed dense signals (red arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g010">Figure 10C</xref>). Sense control probes did not yield any appreciable signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g010">Figure 10C</xref>). These results indicate that sGC mRNA is expressed in sensory neurons of the DRG.</p>
        <p>In addition to sGC enzymes, which are directly activated upon NO, the membrane-bound guanylyl cyclases (mGC; Npr family) also contribute to cGMP production in some organs (e.g., in the cardiovascular system) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Potter1">[41]</xref>. Stimulated by recent reports on expression of mGCs in DRG neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Schmidt2">[42]</xref>, we administered a cocktail of natriuretic peptides (ANP, BNP, and CNP) intrathecally and observed marked hyperalgesia within 15 min after delivery, which lasted for about 45–50 min in wild-type mice (unpublished data) and PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g010">Figure 10D</xref>).

These results suggest that the NMDA-NOS-soluble guanylyl cyclase-cGMP pathway as well as the natriuretic peptide-mGC-cGMP pathways converge upon PKG-I expressed in spinal terminals of nociceptors to modulate nociceptive processing in the spinal cord.</p>

        <p>Finally, we undertook experiments to test whether PKG-I expression alone or some downstream factor perturbed by an early loss of PKG-I is responsible for the deficits in pain hypersensitivity in SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice. We constructed chimeric Adeno-associated virions of the serotypes AAV1 and AAV2 expressing an C-terminally GFP-tagged version of the murine PKG-I cDNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Browning1">[43]</xref>.

Upon peripheral injection of capsaicin, PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice expressing GFP-tagged PKG-I showed a small increase in mechanical hypersensitivity than PKG-I<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice expressing GFP, which was only statistically significant at some intensities of mechanical stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001283-g011">Figure 11C</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In contrast to the intensively studied forms of LTP in the hippocampus, very few studies have addressed cellular and molecular mechanisms of LTP at spinal synapses regulating the flow of nociceptive information from the periphery towards the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Sandkuhler2">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Ji1">[24]</xref>. Here we observed that nociceptive activity-driven LTP at synapses between nociceptive terminals and spinal neurons projecting nociceptive inputs to the PAG requires presynaptic mechanisms for its full expression. Furthermore, our results indicate that this function is mediated by cGMP acting via PKG-I. We base our inferences on three main observations: (1) A specific loss of PKG-I in presynaptic, but not post-synaptic, compartments of this synapse abolished C-fiber-evoked LTP without altering basal neurotransmission at this synapse; (2) LTP was temporally accompanied by a decrease in the rate of synaptic failures in a presynaptic-PKG-I-dependent manner; and (3) LTP was associated with a change in the PPR, which did not take place when PKG-I was deleted presynaptically in nociceptor terminals. Importantly, higher magnitudes of LTP were consistently associated with a decrease in PPF, and thereby with an increase in release probability.</p>
      <p>Previous studies have shown that the NMDA receptor-NO-cGMP pathway is important in the induction of spinal LTP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Ikeda1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Ikeda2">[5]</xref>, and it has been assumed that this pathway comes into play in the post-synaptic compartment. However, all of the above signal transducers are also expressed presynaptically in afferent terminals in the spinal dorsal horn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Engelman1">[44]</xref>. Thus, pre- and post-synaptic contributions to spinal LTP have not been worked out so far. There is evidence for a requirement for post-synaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> change for the induction of the LTP (i.e., in experiments with BAPTA in recording pipette; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Ikeda2">[5]</xref>). Taken together with our results, this suggests that a calcium-dependent postsynaptic mechanism may be required for the <italic>induction</italic> of LTP (e.g., via NMDA receptor-dependent generation of NO); in contrast, a presynaptic change involving cGMP- and PKG-I-dependent increase in neurotransmitter release may mediate the <italic>expression</italic> of LTP at synapses between nociceptors and spinal-PAG projection neurons.</p>
      <p>Mechanistically, this may come about via involvement of multiple phosphorylation targets of PKG-I. While some targets have been identified in heterologous systems, very little is known about the nature and functional role of PKG-I targets in vivo. Here, we identified and validated two primary targets in DRG neurons, namely the IP<sub>3</sub>R1 and MLC, and observed that PKG-I modulates intracellular calcium release as well as MLC phosphorylation differently in DRG neurons as compared to other biological systems, such as the smooth muscle. For example, in some biological systems, PKG-I has been reported to negatively modulate calcium signals via its interaction with IRAG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Schlossmann1">[18]</xref>. However, IRAG interacts selectively with the beta-isoform of PKG-I, which is barely expressed in the DRG, but not with PKG-I-alpha, the predominant form found in DRG neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Schmidt1">[10]</xref>. Furthermore, our observations that PKG-I potentiates calcium release induced by typical mediators of nociceptive sensitization, such as bradykinin, in identified nociceptive neurons and that repetitive activation of nociceptors in vivo leads to PKG-I-mediated phosphorylation of IP<sub>3</sub>R1 at serine 1755, a site associated with positive functional modulation, implicate PKG-I as a positive modulator of calcium signalling in nociceptive neurons. In light of electrophysiological analyses reported here, this raises the possibility that calcium released from IP<sub>3</sub>R1-gated stores may participate in modulating presynaptic function. Although a few studies at hippocampal synapses have proposed an involvement of calcium stores in modulation of presynaptic release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Emptage1">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Zucker1">[46]</xref>, underlying cellular mechanisms are not known. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> of this study suggest that activation of presynaptic PKG-I may constitute the molecular link between synaptic activity and the elevation of resting levels of calcium in presynaptic terminals, thereby potentiating synaptic transmission via an increase in release probability. Furthermore, we observed that MLC was phosphorylated in a nociceptive activity-dependent manner and that PKG-I is required for MLC phosphorylation in the DRG. Although our electrophysiological data implicate phosphorylated MLC in LTP at spinal synapses, not much can be inferred about downstream mechanisms at this stage. At central synapses, MLC phosphorylation was initially implicated in vesicle transport and in regulation of vesicular pools <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Ryan1">[47]</xref>; however, these inferences could not be corroborated in detailed subsequent analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Tokuoka1">[48]</xref>. Taken together, more detailed analyses overcoming current technical hindrances in studying mobilization of vesicular pools in the complex circuitry of the DRG and spinal dorsal horn will be required to understand mechanisms underlying PKG-I-mediated modulation of release probability at this synapse.</p>
      <p>The possibility of functionally linking synaptic changes described here to changes in nociceptive behaviour simultaneously represents a good opportunity and a major challenge. As the first parameter to test this relationship, we focused on the phase II responses in the intraplantar formalin test, which has been attributed to spinal nociceptive sensitization triggered by an initial barrage of C-fiber inputs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Tjolsen1">[31]</xref>. Indeed, we observed that presynaptic loss of PKG-I as well as functional perturbation of MLCK and IP<sub>3</sub>R, its substrates involved in LTP, inhibited phase II behavioural responses. However, a contribution of central mechanisms could not be inferred from the formalin data due to several reasons: Although MLCK/IP<sub>3</sub>R inhibitors were administered spinally, the genetically induced loss of PKG-I in SNS mice occurred throughout the nociceptor, including peripheral terminals. Moreover, there is still some ongoing activation of peripheral nociceptors in the phase II of the formalin response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Tjolsen1">[31]</xref>. Indeed, our electrophysiological analyses in the CFA inflammatory pain model suggested that peripheral PKG-I may contribute to primary hyperalgesia.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we focused on pain models in which nociceptive hypersensitivity is triggered by peripheral nociceptors, but maintained via central mechanisms that outlast and are independent of peripheral inputs. One of these is the chronic muscle pain model in which injections of dilute acidic saline in the gastronemius muscle evokes a long-lasting secondary mechanical hyperalgesia in the ipsilateral and contralateral paws, which lasts for several weeks, is unrelated to muscle damage and is not maintained by continued primary afferent input from the site of injury, as shown by experiments involving dorsal rhizotomy and lidocaine injections in the muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Sluka1">[36]</xref>. Similarly, we addressed capsaicin-induced secondary mechanical hyperalgesia outside of the primary flare, which albeit triggered by C-fiber inputs, is maintained via mechanisms of central origin as indicated by previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Meyer1">[35]</xref> and our analyses. In both models, we found marked defects in central hypersensitivity in SNS-PKG-I<sup>−/−</sup> mice. Our results indicated that capsaicin-evoked mechanical hypersensitivity is neither dependent on peripheral PKG-I function nor does it require ongoing peripheral nociceptor sensitisation. Moreover, they revealed that PKG-I expressed in central terminals of nociceptors plays a decisive role in the induction of mechanical hypersensitivity after persistent C-fiber stimulation via capsaicin. Finally, reinstating PKG-I expression in the DRG in adult SNS-PKG mice fully restored capsaicin-evoked mechanical hypersensitivity, indicating that PKG-I directly, and not some factor affected by a genetic loss of PKG-I, is a functional determinant of C-fiber-evoked mechanical hypersensitivity.</p>
      <p>In summary, this study shows that PKG-I expressed in nociceptors terminals is the principal target of cGMP at nociceptive synapses. Furthermore, it suggests that PKG-I-mediated presynaptic facilitation and LTP in spinal projection neurons is functionally involved in activity-dependent centrally mediated nociceptive hypersensitivity.</p>

        <title>Spinal Cord Slice Preparation and Patch-Clamp Recordings</title>
        <p>Mice (14–18 d old) were anesthetized with a mixture of Dormitor, Dormicum, and Fentanyl, and stereotactic injections of DiI into the PAG were carried out (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001283.s007">Text S1</xref> for details). After 2 to 3 d, transverse 350–450 µm thick spinal cord slices with dorsal roots attached were obtained and whole cell patch clamp recordings of identified DiI-positive neurons were performed as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001283.s007">Text S1</xref>. Test pulses of 0.1 ms with intensity of 3 mA were given at 30 s intervals to the dorsal root via a suction electrode. For studying the site of expression of synaptic potentiation, we used minimal stimulation in conditions of low release probability (in mM: NaCl 127; KCl, 1.8; KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2; Ca<sup>2+</sup> 1.0; Mg<sup>2+</sup>, 5; NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 26; glucose, 15; oxygenated with 95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>; pH 7.4). Dorsal root was stimulated at intensity of threshold to evoke EPSCs on DiI-labelled spino-PAG projection neuron. Under these conditions, the failure rate was 60.9%±6.3% (<italic>n</italic> = 10). To induce synaptic potentiation, low frequency stimulation (conditioning stimulus, 2 Hz for 2 min) was applied to dorsal root as a conditioning stimulus with the same intensity as the test stimulus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Ikeda2">[5]</xref>. The recording mode during conditioning stimulation was the same as that before and after conditioning stimulation. Neurons are voltage clamped at −70 mV. Because a suction electrode was utilized to stimulate the whole root, a suprathreshold stimulus was required to fully recruit C-fibers in the root <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001283-Ikeda2">[5]</xref>. Synaptic strength was quantified by assessing the peak amplitudes of EPSCs. The mean amplitude of 4–5 EPSCs evoked by test stimuli prior to conditioning stimulation served as a control. Significant changes from control were assessed by measuring the peak amplitudes of five consecutive EPSCs every 5 min after conditioning stimulation. Additional details are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001283.s007">Text S1</xref>.

Paired-pulse ratio (facilitation or depression) of C-fiber-evoked EPSC was calculated as the amplitude of the second C-eEPSC divided by that of the first C-eEPSC in a pair. In a subset of experiments, PKG-I inhibitors such as KT5823 (10 µM) or RKRARKE (250 µM) were infused post-synaptically via the patch pipette.</p>
