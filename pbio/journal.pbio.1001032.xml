        <p>Dynamic balance of excitation and inhibition is crucial for network stability and cortical processing, but it is unclear how this balance is achieved at different membrane potentials (<italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>) of cortical neurons, as found during persistent activity or slow <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> oscillation. Here we report that a <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>-dependent modulation of recurrent inhibition between pyramidal cells (PCs) contributes to the excitation-inhibition balance. Whole-cell recording from paired layer-5 PCs in rat somatosensory cortical slices revealed that both the slow and the fast disynaptic IPSPs, presumably mediated by low-threshold spiking and fast spiking interneurons, respectively, were modulated by changes in presynaptic <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>. Somatic depolarization (&gt;5 mV) of the presynaptic PC substantially increased the amplitude and shortened the onset latency of the slow disynaptic IPSPs in neighboring PCs, leading to a narrowed time window for EPSP integration. A similar increase in the amplitude of the fast disynaptic IPSPs in response to presynaptic depolarization was also observed. Further paired recording from PCs and interneurons revealed that PC depolarization increases EPSP amplitude and thus elevates interneuronal firing and inhibition of neighboring PCs, a reflection of the analog mode of excitatory synaptic transmission between PCs and interneurons. Together, these results revealed an immediate <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>-dependent modulation of cortical inhibition, a key strategy through which the cortex dynamically maintains the balance of excitation and inhibition at different states of cortical activity.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Proper functioning of the neocortex requires a balance between excitation and inhibition. This balance can be achieved through the operation of cortical microcircuits interweaved by excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Since the membrane potentials (<italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>) of cortical neurons fluctuate at different levels during cortical activities, it is important to know how the balance of excitation and inhibition is dynamically maintained at different <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>. Recurrent inhibition between excitatory pyramidal cells is mediated by two distinct types of inhibitory interneurons. Here, we show that the amount of recurrent inhibition depends on the <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> levels of presynaptic pyramidal cells. Modest depolarization of a pyramidal cell substantially increases, and sometimes turns on, disynaptic inhibition on its neighboring pyramidal cells. We find that this effect is due to an increase in the strength of synaptic connections from the pyramidal cell to inhibitory interneurons and a consequent elevation of interneuronal firing. The depolarization-induced increase in synaptic strength from the pyramidal cell therefore reflects “analog-mode” signaling in cortical excitatory synapses. We thus reveal a profound impact of analog-mode signaling on the operation of cortical microcircuits and provide a new mechanism for dynamic control of the balance of cortical excitation and inhibition.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The excitatory and inhibitory inputs received by cortical neurons are normally under dynamic balance during cortical functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Haider1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Fujisawa1">[7]</xref>. The interaction among these inputs, together with intrinsic membrane properties of cortical neurons, often results in shifts of membrane potential (<italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>) between different states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Gentet1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Steriade2">[11]</xref>, which could regulate neuronal responsiveness to synaptic and sensory inputs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Haider1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Anderson1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Timofeev1">[17]</xref>. However, it is unclear how the balance of excitation and inhibition is achieved when cortical neurons are at different <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> levels. During global membrane oscillations involving a large number of cortical neurons, excitation and inhibition may be proportionally altered by the <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> shift, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown, in view of diversity of connectivity and functions of local inhibitory interneurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Conde1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Markram1">[19]</xref>. In the case of persistent activities associated with some behaviorally relevant conditions, e.g., during working memory, a subpopulation of neurons undergoes changes in the <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Funahashi1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Wang1">[24]</xref>. Microcircuits involving these active neurons also require dynamic control of their excitation-inhibition balance. In this study, we investigated how <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> changes of a cortical neuron may modulate the efficacy of recurrent inhibition within the microcircuit.</p>
      <p>It has been shown recently that cortical excitatory neurons communicate not only through the generation of all-or-none action potentials (APs, digital mode) but also through a presynaptic <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>-dependent modulation of transmitter release (analog mode) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Alle1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Shu3">[26]</xref>. It remains unknown to what extent the analog-mode communication influences the operation of local circuitry and has a functional role in the cortex. Considering that interneurons within the microcircuit are driven by excitatory neurons, leading to recurrent inhibition, we hypothesized that the amount of recurrent inhibition might be subjected to modulation in a manner that depends on the level of depolarization of the excitatory neuron. The <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> changes in the presynaptic excitatory neuron may modulate the size of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in interneurons, leading to changes in their AP firing, which in turn alter the efficacy of their inhibition on neighboring neurons.</p>
      <p>Cortical inhibitory interneurons show a huge diversity in their biochemical and physiological properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Conde1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Markram1">[19]</xref>. Two distinct subtypes of interneurons, low-threshold spiking (LTS) neuron and fast spiking (FS) neuron, mediate the slow and the fast recurrent inhibition, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Kapfer1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Silberberg2">[29]</xref>. The LTS neuron receives EPSPs that show facilitation in response to a train of high-frequency stimuli of the presynaptic PC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Kozloski1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Wang2">[32]</xref>, generating APs with a long onset latency and evoking late-onset (slow) disynaptic IPSPs in its neighboring PCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Kapfer1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Silberberg2">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Berger1">[33]</xref>. The FS neuron (and some other inhibitory interneurons) receives EPSPs that show depression during high-frequency presynaptic stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Markram2">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Thomson1">[34]</xref>. However, the high release probability of PC-FS synapses often allows discharges of the FS neuron in response to single APs in the PC, leading to time-locked early onset (fast) IPSPs in neighboring PCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Silberberg2">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Pouille1">[35]</xref>. In this study, we sought to examine whether the slow and the fast recurrent inhibition meditated by these two distinct microcircuits (PC-LTS-PC and PC-FS-PC) were subjected to modulation in response to <italic>V<sub>m</sub></italic> changes of the presynaptic PC.</p>
      <p>We performed paired whole-cell recording (PC-PC, PC-LTS, and PC-FS) in rat somatosensory cortical slices and found that both the slow and the fast recurrent inhibition were indeed modulated by the presynaptic somatic <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> changes, and this modulation resulted from analog-mode signaling in excitatory synapses between PCs and interneurons. These results show an important role of analog communication in controlling the operation of cortical microcircuits and provide new insights into the cellular mechanisms underlying dynamic balance of cortical excitation and inhibition.</p>

        <title><italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>-Dependent Modulation of Slow Recurrent Inhibition</title>
        <p>We performed paired whole-cell recording from nearby layer-5 pyramidal cells (PCs, &lt;100 µm apart) in acutely isolated rat somatosensory cortical slices. In response to stimulation of the PC with a burst of APs (70∼200 Hz), disynaptic IPSPs were observed in 19% of the pairs successfully tested (207/1,087 pairs), with 2% (23/1,087) exhibiting reciprocal IPSPs (see Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001032-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Consistent with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Kapfer1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Silberberg2">[29]</xref>, these IPSPs had a peak amplitude of 1.3±0.1 mV (s.e.m., <italic>n</italic> = 38 PC-PC pairs) and a long but rather precise onset latency (111±4 ms) following PC stimulation (15 APs at 100 Hz). The IPSPs were detected only when the presynaptic PC fired at a frequency higher than 50 Hz. Bath application of either CNQX (10 µM) or picrotoxin (50 µM) completely abolished these IPSPs (<italic>n</italic> = 8/8 PC pairs), consistent with the involvement of both excitatory and inhibitory transmission in these disynaptic responses. In our PC-PC paired recordings, a single AP or a burst of APs in one PC could evoke monosynaptic EPSPs but never triggered firing in postsynaptic PCs, suggesting no polysynaptic events involved in generating the disynaptic IPSPs.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>To examine the <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>-dependence of this slow (late-onset) recurrent inhibition, we manipulated <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> by injecting repetitive step-depolarizing currents (duration ∼45 s, at 90 s intervals) to induce subthreshold depolarization in the presynaptic PC. The magnitudes of disynaptic IPSPs were measured by applying trains of current pulses (duration: 1 ms) to evoke AP bursts (15 APs at 100 Hz) in the presynaptic PC at the resting and depolarized <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001032-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>). In the majority of PC-PC pairs tested with this protocol (<italic>n</italic> = 38 pairs), we found that step presynaptic depolarization from a resting <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> (−64.6±0.6 mV) to a level near the firing threshold (−47.2±0.6 mV) significantly increased the average amplitude (<italic>n</italic> = 25/38 PC pairs tested, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) and integrated voltage area (mV×s, <italic>n</italic> = 28/38, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) of the disynaptic IPSPs and decreased the average onset latency and jitter (<italic>n</italic> = 23/38, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). Cumulative frequency distribution of the average amplitude (or total voltage area, unpublished data) showed a highly significant difference between the two <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> levels (<italic>n</italic> = 38 pairs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001032-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). In these experiments, we noted that the extent of modulation of these IPSPs varied greatly from pair to pair. Comparison of the IPSP amplitude (or total voltage area) and onset latency at two different <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> levels of the same pairs also showed highly significant differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001032-g001">Figure 1D and 1E</xref>, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, <italic>t</italic> test). Interestingly, the percentage increase in the peak amplitude (or total voltage area) of IPSPs found at the depolarized <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> levels decreased with increasing average peak amplitude. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001032-g001">Figure 1F</xref>, the data could be well fitted by a hyperbolic function (y = 100%+0.67/x), which predicts a linear relationship between the IPSP amplitudes at depolarized <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> and those at resting <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> (y = x+0.53, with the slope fixed at 1, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001032.s001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>). In 12 PC-PC pairs, we varied the time difference between the depolarization onset and the first AP burst during the depolarization in order to examine the time course of the facilitation and found that the IPSP amplitudes progressively increase after depolarization with a time course τ of 3.5 s (single exponential fit, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001032-g001">Figure 1G</xref>), consistent with the slow component of the EPSP facilitation induced by presynaptic depolarization found in monosynaptically connected PC pairs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Shu3">[26]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Further analysis revealed that the disynaptic IPSP facilitation could be attributed in part to a decrease in its failure rate. In 33/35 PC pairs tested, IPSP failures occurred at both depolarized (by 18.0±0.8 mV) and resting presynaptic <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>, but the average failure rate was lower under depolarized <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> (0.08±0.02) than that at resting <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> (0.25±0.03). Among all experiments (<italic>n</italic> = 123 PC pairs), nine showed complete failure of disynaptic IPSPs at resting <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> but detectable IPSPs at depolarized <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001032-g002">Figure 2A–C</xref>), suggesting that such modulation could not only change but also turn on recurrent inhibition. This abrupt appearance of disynaptic IPSPs and the shortened onset latency associated with presynaptic depolarization may narrow the time window of the integration of EPSPs. Indeed, in PC connections that had both monosynaptic EPSPs and disynaptic IPSPs, the EPSP summation time was shorter at depolarized <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> in comparison with that at resting <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> (136±9 ms versus 175±13 ms, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, <italic>n</italic> = 11, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001032-g002">Figure 2D–G</xref>).</p>

        <title><italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>-Dependent Modulation of Fast Recurrent Inhibition</title>
        <p>To investigate whether the fast disynaptic inhibition mediated by interneurons that receive depressing excitatory inputs is also <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>-dependent, we analyzed the PC-PC pairs that exhibited fast (early onset) IPSPs in response to a single presynaptic AP. Consistent with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Kapfer1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Silberberg2">[29]</xref>, we found that the probability of success in detecting fast disynaptic IPSPs was very low. Only 7/1,103 PC-PC pairs tested bi-directionally exhibited fast disynaptic IPSPs, and three out of these seven pairs showed <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>-dependent modulation. Presynaptic depolarization of ∼18 mV from the resting <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> (−63 mV) substantially reduced the failure rate of evoking IPSPs in these three pairs (from 0.78 to 0.67, 0.85 to 0.78, and 0.63 to 0.36, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001032-g006">Figure 6A–B</xref>). This reduced failure rate is consistent with our hypothesis that the depolarized <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> in the PC elevated the EPSP amplitude and increased the spiking probability of the FS cell. When the average amplitude of IPSPs (failure excluded) evoked by single APs was measured, we found that it was unchanged in the first two pairs (from 1.42±0.05 to 1.44±0.04 mV, <italic>p</italic> = 0.4; from 2.0±0.1 to 2.1±0.1 mV, <italic>p</italic> = 0.2). This supports the notion that disynaptic modulation was mainly due to changes in the firing probability of the interneurons. However, we found surprisingly that the average IPSP amplitude observed in the third pair was significantly increased from 0.62±0.02 to 0.75±0.02 mV (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) even with failure excluded. Given the low probability of observing fast disynaptic IPSPs (<italic>n</italic> = 7/1,103 PC-PC pairs), the recruitment of two interneurons in this case is unlikely. However, it is possible that triggering of two APs (instead of one) in the interneuron during presynaptic depolarization could account for the remaining increase in IPSP amplitude after failure exclusion. The precise mechanism for these observations remains to be further examined.</p>

The lower probability of finding <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> modulation in LTS-PC pairs than in FS-PC pairs may result from the differences in the location of the inhibitory synapses.

In six PC-LTS pairs, depolarization of ∼20 mV in the PC caused a significant increase in the peak amplitude (126.9%±6.2% of the control, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) and the integrated area (132.3%±7.0%, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) of the summated EPSPs evoked by 15 APs at 100 Hz, and this increase was blocked in the presence of α-DTX (peak amplitude, 95.0%±3.5%; voltage area, 100.0%±3.4%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001032-g008">Figure 8A–B</xref>). In PC-PC pairs, we found that α-DTX application significantly increased the amplitude and integrated area of the disynaptic IPSP to 187%±14% (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) and 211%±24% (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01), respectively, and shortened the onset latency to 86.1%±8.1% (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, <italic>n</italic> = 6). These effects suggest that D-current inhibition is sufficient to facilitate disynaptic IPSPs. Furthermore, after α-DTX application, 20 mV depolarization of the presynaptic PC had no significant additional facilitation in the amplitude (89.7%±7.1%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.31), total integrated area (73.7%±6.9%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.9), and onset latency (99.2%±3.4%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.46, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001032-g008">Figure 8C–D</xref>) of disynaptic IPSPs, indicating that the effect of α-DTX had occluded that of <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> changes. Similar results were obtained with the application of a low concentration of 4-AP (50 µM, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001032.s005">Figure S5</xref>). These results support the hypothesis that inhibition of axonal D-current in the presynaptic PC mediates the <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>-dependent modulation of recurrent inhibition.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we show that the magnitude of recurrent inhibition of PCs depends on their <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> levels; this <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>-dependent modulation occurs in both LTS and FS cell-mediated disynaptic recurrent connections. We provide the first evidence showing that presynaptic <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>-dependent analog communication occurs at excitatory synapses between PCs and interneurons and mediates the <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>-dependent modulation of recurrent inhibition. For slow disynaptic IPSPs, depolarization in presynaptic PCs increases the amplitude of AP burst-induced summated responses in postsynaptic LTS neurons, thus increasing the number and decreasing the latency of their AP discharges, which in turn enhance the amplitude and reduce the onset latency and jitter of slow IPSPs in neighboring PCs. Similarly, modest depolarization in PCs enhanced single AP-induced fast disynaptic IPSPs in neighboring PCs presumably due to a <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>-dependent increase in the size of EPSPs in FS neurons. Together, these results reveal that PC <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>-dependent modulation of cortical inhibition is a key strategy through which the cortex efficiently and dynamically maintains the excitation-inhibition balance, a condition critical for cortical information processing.</p>

        <title>Mechanisms for <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>-Dependent Modulation of Inhibition</title>
        <p>Recent studies have discovered that the PC-LTS-PC microcircuit mediates the slow (late-onset) recurrent inhibition in somatosensory and other cortices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Kapfer1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Silberberg2">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Berger2">[39]</xref>. The somatostatin-positive LTS interneuron is the key player in this microcircuit. It receives EPSPs that show facilitation in response to a train of presynaptic stimuli that may initiate firing of APs, which in turn evoke IPSPs in its postsynaptic PCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Kapfer1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Silberberg2">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Berger1">[33]</xref>. Generation of these disynaptic IPSPs depends on the number and frequency of APs in PCs. Our results show that the presynaptic <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> is also a powerful determinant for controlling the strength and timing of disynaptic IPSPs—a few mV depolarization (&gt;5 mV) can cause substantial IPSP facilitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001032-g003">Figure 3</xref>). More importantly, stronger depolarization could not only modulate the amplitude of existing disynaptic IPSPs but also turn on silent recurrent connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001032-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Further analysis showed a close relationship between the magnitude of IPSP facilitation and the extent of presynaptic depolarization in PCs, consistent with the requirement of excitation-inhibition balance during elevated network activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Haider1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Shu1">[3]</xref>. The abrupt occurrence and the facilitation of disynaptic IPSPs may result from the increases in the spiking probability or the number of APs in LTS interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001032-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001032-g005">5</xref>). Since the inhibitory synaptic strength at synapses between the newly recruited LTS interneurons and the postsynaptic PC should not depend on the amplitude of existing IPSPs, we expect that the net increase does not depend on the baseline IPSP amplitude. This was supported by the finding that the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001032-g001">Figure 1F</xref> were well fitted by a hyperbolic function, which predicts a linear function between IPSP amplitudes at depolarized <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> and those at resting <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001032.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>The PC-FS-PC microcircuit is a potential candidate mediating the fast (early-onset) recurrent inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Kapfer1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Silberberg2">[29]</xref>. In contrast to LTS cells, FS neurons receive EPSPs that show depression in response to presynaptic high-frequency APs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Markram2">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Thomson1">[34]</xref>. A single presynaptic AP can trigger the FS neuron to discharge once and subsequently evoke a unitary IPSP at neighboring PCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Silberberg1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Silberberg2">[29]</xref>. Consistent with the findings reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Kapfer1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Silberberg2">[29]</xref>, we observed fast disynaptic IPSPs in PC pairs at a very low frequency. In the PC pairs that showed depolarization-induced facilitation, we found that the facilitation resulted mainly from a reduced IPSP failure rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001032-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), consistent with an increased EPSP amplitude and spiking probability of FS neurons. Thus, the same mechanism underlies <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>-dependent modulation of disynaptic IPSPs in both types of microcircuits.</p>
        <p>Consistent with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Alle1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Shu3">[26]</xref>, our results showed that <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> changes in presynaptic PC modulated the sizes of EPSPs in both the LTS and the FS interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001032-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001032-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The underlying mechanism may depend on unique intrinsic properties of axonal ion channel subtypes. Recently, a low-threshold, slowly inactivating K<sup>+</sup> current (known as D-current <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Storm1">[36]</xref>, mediated by K<sub>v</sub>1 alpha subunits) was recorded at the PC axons and was shown to selectively control the duration of axonal APs (instead of somatic APs) and the depolarization-induced facilitation of EPSPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Kole1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Shu4">[38]</xref>. Consistently, our results demonstrated that the inhibition of K<sub>v</sub>1 channels was by itself sufficient to increase the size of summated EPSPs in PC-LTS and of disynaptic IPSPs in PC-PC pairs. Furthermore, it also occluded the effects of <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> at PC-LTS synapses and disynaptic transmission between PCs. Depolarization in the presynaptic cell could prolong axonal APs as well as activate presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, thereby enhancing synaptic transmission by increasing the presynaptic background Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and/or AP-triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Awatramani1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Christie1">[42]</xref>. Indeed, high concentrations of EGTA could drastically reduce the success rate of EPSP facilitation induced by presynaptic somatic-depolarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Shu3">[26]</xref> (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Alle1">[25]</xref>), suggesting that background Ca<sup>2+</sup> may also contribute to the modulation of disynaptic IPSP. Inhibitory interneurons contain many kinds of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins, such as parvalbumin, calretinin, and calbindin; they could function as Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer and thus may prevent the <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>-dependent modulation of inhibitory transmission. Indeed, our results showed that the percentages of inhibitory connections (including FS-PC and LTS-PC pairs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001032-g007">Figure 7</xref>) showing <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> modulation are far less than those of excitatory connections (including PC-PC and PC-interneuron pairs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001032-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001032-g007">7</xref>). Whether the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins may be responsible for regulating analog-mode signaling at inhibitory synapses remains to be further examined.</p>
        <p>Subthreshold <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> changes in the soma spread down the axon with a length constant of 400–800 µm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Alle1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Shu3">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Kole1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Scott1">[43]</xref>. Over 150 putative synaptic boutons are distributed at axon collaterals within 500 µm of the cell body of layer-5 PCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Shu3">[26]</xref>. Boutons in remote axon terminals may not be affected by somatic <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> changes. This may explain why not all recurrent inhibitory connections were subjected to the <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>-dependent modulation and why the percentages of LTS-PC pairs showing <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> modulation are smaller than those of FS-PC pairs. In comparison with FS cells that target the perisomatic region of their neighboring PCs, LTS cells in layer 5 send their axons to superficial layers and innervate distal apical dendrites of nearby PCs. Therefore, <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> modulation should be weaker in LTS-PC than in FS-PC synapses. Whether such modulation is indeed spatially confined to local circuits within the range of axonal spread of somatic depolarization, or alternatively only specific cortical microcircuits are modulated, remains to be further determined.</p>

        <title>Physiological Significance</title>
        <p>The <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>-dependent modulation of recurrent inhibition described here may serve several distinct functions. First, it may contribute to maintaining a dynamic excitation-inhibition balance at different cortical activity states appropriate for diverse behavioral conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Gentet1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Steriade1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Steriade2">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Cowan1">[44]</xref>. For example, when <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> depolarizes during an active but relatively stable cortical state, e.g., the “Up” state, the inhibitory conductances due to recurrent connections increase to match the elevated excitatory conductances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Haider1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Shu1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Monier1">[4]</xref>. A recent work revealed that excitation-inhibition balance is also instantaneously controlled with a millisecond precision during spontaneous and sensory-evoked activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Okun1">[2]</xref> and disruption of this balance causes dysfunction of the network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Shu1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-SanchezVives1">[9]</xref>, leading to various disorders such as epileptic seizures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Cobos1">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Marco1">[46]</xref> and schizophrenia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Lewis1">[47]</xref>. Second, the <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>-dependent modulation of recurrent inhibition may also contribute to rapid transitions between “Up” and “Down” states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Haider1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Shu1">[3]</xref> that are important for gain modulation of synaptic and sensory inputs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Haider1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Anderson1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Chance1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Shu2">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Timofeev1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-McCormick1">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Buonomano1">[49]</xref>. For example, transient excitation-inhibition imbalance caused by abrupt changes in <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>-dependent recurrent inhibition, e.g., unsilencing of recurrent connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001032-g002">Figure 2A–C</xref>) induced by <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> fluctuation at the depolarized <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> levels, could cause a switch from “Up” to “Down” state. Third, the shortening of IPSP latency associated with <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>-dependent facilitation of recurrent inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001032-g002">Figure 2D–G</xref>) may regulate the time window of integration of excitatory inputs, therefore providing a mechanism for <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>-dependent feedback control of the timing of spike initiation in PCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Higley1">[50]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001032-Gabernet1">[52]</xref>.</p>
        <p>To conclude, we have shown that both slow and fast recurrent inhibition is susceptible to modulation by the <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> changes of PCs.

The brain was quickly dissected out and immersed in an ice-cold oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) slicing solution in which the NaCl was substituted with sucrose (213 mM) and dextrose was reduced to 10 mM. We cut parasagittal slices (350 µm) of somatosensory cortex in this solution with a Leica microtome (VT-1000S) and immediately transferred to an incubation beaker filled with aerated normal artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM): NaCl 126, KCl 2.5, MgSO<sub>4</sub> 2, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 26, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.25, and dextrose 25 (315∼325 mOsm, pH 7.3).

        <title>Electrophysiological Recordings</title>
        <p>We obtained dual whole-cell recordings from layer-5 PCs and inhibitory interneurons (LTS and FS neurons) using Multiclamp 700B amplifiers (Molecular Devices). Patch pipettes were prepared with a P-97 microelectrode puller (Sutter Instruments) and filled with an internal solution containing (in mM) KGluconate 140, KCl 3, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 2, Na<sub>2</sub>ATP 2, BAPTA 0.025, and HEPES 10 (pH 7.2 with KOH, 280∼290 mOsm). Patch electrodes had an impedance of 3–6 MΩ. For tracing and labeling the recorded neurons, we added Alexa Fluo 488 (100 µM) and biocytin (0.2%) to the pipette solution. We identified the recorded layer-5 neurons through their unique somatic and dendritic morphology under the DIC and fluorescent microscope and their distinct firing patterns. The total time the cell was exposed to fluorescence was kept to less than 10 s to minimize cell damage. The PCs could be easily distinguished from interneurons because of their thick apical dendrite and large pyramid-shaped somata. The FS neurons were identified through their non-adapting and fast-spiking (300–500 Hz in response to current stimulation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001032-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001032.s002">Figure S2</xref>) firing properties and their “noisy” resting <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> constantly bombarded with large-amplitude EPSPs. The LTS neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001032-g004">Figure 4</xref>) were classified through their low-threshold regular firing patterns with initial accelerating then decelerating discharges in response to step current injection (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001032.s002">Figure S2</xref>). After electrophysiological recording, the neurons were further identified using DAB-staining. The intrinsic properties of individual neurons and the properties of synaptic connections between PCs and FS and LTS neurons (&lt;100 µm apart) were examined as soon as a dual or triple recording was achieved. We injected negative (−0.1∼−0.5 nA) and positive current pulses (0.1∼1.5 nA, 500 ms) to examine the input resistance and firing patterns of each neuron. To test for synaptic connections, we injected 1-ms current pulses (10∼20 pulses) at a frequency of 20∼200 Hz to each PC to evoke a train of APs every 15 s while monitoring the <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> changes in other PCs or interneurons. Unless otherwise stated, for data analysis and figures, we normally evoked a train of 15 APs at 100 Hz through current injection in the presynaptic PC. In most experiments, Cl<sup>−</sup> concentration in the recording pipette was 7 mM, and the calculated reversal potential for Cl<sup>−</sup> was −74 mV. Disynaptic IPSPs recorded between PCs with this pipette solution were hyperpolarizing potentials at a depolarized postsynaptic <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> (normally depolarized from resting to ∼−46 mV with DC current injection). We injected constant DC current to evoke intermittent depolarizing and hyperpolarizing <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> levels (∼10–20 mV, ∼45 s each) in the presynaptic PC while keeping the postsynaptic <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> constant. In the recordings examining the monosynaptic connections between PC and FS neurons, we used a high concentration of Cl<sup>−</sup> (75 mM) in the pipette solution. To test for the presynaptic <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>-dependent modulation of monosynaptic EPSPs in PC-FS pairs and fast disynaptic IPSPs in PC pairs, we only injected brief pulses to presynaptic PC to evoke single APs at 1 Hz on top of the intermittent depolarizations and hyperpolarizations. In most of our recordings, synaptic responses were stable and could be recorded up to 1–2 h after obtaining whole-cell recordings without any apparent rundown. Data were discarded if the evoked IPSPs and EPSPs showed significant rundown, as shown by a statistically significant change in the amplitude of the IPSP or EPSP between the first and last third of the interspersed control periods (when the presynaptic PC was at resting <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>). The <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> values were not corrected for the liquid junction potential (15 mV).</p>
        <p>During the whole period of recording, access resistance was monitored frequently; recordings with access resistance higher than 25 MΩ were discarded. Bridge balance and capacitance neutralization were carefully adjusted before and after every experimental protocol. We collected the electrophysiological data using a Micro 1401 digitizer and Spike 2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK). After a recording was completed, the slice was transferred to 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer for subsequent immunostaining and visualization.</p>

        <title>Data Analysis</title>
        <p>We performed all computations using Spike 2 and MATLAB (MathWorks, Bethesda, MD). The significance of differences between the cumulative frequency distributions was determined by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test using original disynaptic IPSPs. We used Student's <italic>t</italic> test to test the significance of differences in peak amplitude, integrated voltage area, and onset latency between resting and depolarized presynaptic <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> in individual pairs. Values were presented as mean ± standard error in the figures as well as in the main text.</p>
        <p>For disynaptic IPSPs, the peak amplitude was the difference between the peak value and the average baseline <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> (2 s prior to the stimuli onset), whereas the integral voltage area was the curve area underlying the responses. The onset latency was the time difference between the response onset and the beginning of presynaptic stimulation. For comparison of these values at different <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>, we normalized the values to those obtained at the baseline <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> for each pair and then performed the statistical tests. To identify the EPSP failures in PC-LTS pairs, we first averaged the EPSPs evoked by presynaptic AP trains and selected an EPSP template from the average trace, then performed a correlation test between the voltage trace after each AP and the template EPSP. A failure was identified if the correlation coefficient was lower than 0.8. Considering that the first five EPSPs during the train had a high failure rate and most of them showed significant differences in the failure rates at different <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001032-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), we therefore chose the 6<sup>th</sup> EPSP amplitude (measured from the baseline before the train, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001032.s003">Figure S3</xref>) as a reference for normalization. The peak amplitude of each EPSP during the train was normalized to the 6<sup>th</sup> EPSP for each PC-LTS pair and then averaged for group data presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001032-g004">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001032.s003">Figure S3</xref>). For the monosynaptic connections from PC to FS neurons (or from interneurons to PCs), we calculated the average EPSP (or IPSP) and determined the time of the peak. The amplitude of each evoked EPSP (or IPSP) on single trials was taken as the difference between the postsynaptic <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> at the peak time of the average EPSP (or IPSP) after the AP and the <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> before onset of the current pulse evoking the AP. We measured the baseline activity as the difference in <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> over the same time delay, but without a presynaptic AP. The rise time of the monosynaptic IPSP was measured as the time from 20% to 80% of the peak amplitude, and the decay time constant was obtained through a single exponential fit to the decay phase.</p>
