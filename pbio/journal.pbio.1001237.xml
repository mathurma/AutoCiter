        <p>Comparative metabolomics reveals a modular library of small molecule signals that function as aggregation pheromones in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p>
      </abstract><abstract>
        <p>The nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> is an important model for the study of social behaviors. Recent investigations have shown that a family of small molecule signals, the ascarosides, controls population density sensing and mating behavior. However, despite extensive studies of <italic>C. elegans</italic> aggregation behaviors, no intraspecific signals promoting attraction or aggregation of wild-type hermaphrodites have been identified. Using comparative metabolomics, we show that the known ascarosides are accompanied by a series of derivatives featuring a tryptophan-derived indole moiety. Behavioral assays demonstrate that these indole ascarosides serve as potent intraspecific attraction and aggregation signals for hermaphrodites, in contrast to ascarosides lacking the indole group, which are repulsive. Hermaphrodite attraction to indole ascarosides depends on the ASK amphid sensory neurons. Downstream of the ASK sensory neuron, the interneuron AIA is required for mediating attraction to indole ascarosides instead of the RMG interneurons, which previous studies have shown to integrate attraction and aggregation signals from ASK and other sensory neurons. The role of the RMG interneuron in mediating aggregation and attraction is thought to depend on the neuropeptide Y-like receptor NPR-1, because solitary and social <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains are distinguished by different <italic>npr-1</italic> variants. We show that indole ascarosides promote attraction and aggregation in both solitary and social <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains. The identification of indole ascarosides as aggregation signals reveals unexpected complexity of social signaling in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, which appears to be based on a modular library of ascarosides integrating building blocks derived from lipid β-oxidation and amino-acid metabolism. Variation of modules results in strongly altered signaling content, as addition of a tryptophan-derived indole unit to repellent ascarosides produces strongly attractive indole ascarosides. Our findings show that the library of ascarosides represents a highly developed chemical language integrating different neurophysiological pathways to mediate social communication in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Chemical signaling is an ancient form of inter-organismal communication. The nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> exhibits a wide range of social behaviors, including mutual attraction and aggregation, and has served as a useful model towards investigating the signaling pathways that regulate these behaviors. Recent investigations showed that other <italic>C. elegans</italic> behaviors, like population density sensing and mating, are regulated by small molecule signals called ascarosides. However, it remained unclear whether <italic>C. elegans</italic> uses small molecules to promote intraspecific attraction and aggregation, despite the presence of extensive neural circuitry regulating these behaviors. In this study, we show that <italic>C. elegans</italic> uses a specifically modified variant of the ascarosides including an indole unit as a highly potent aggregation pheromone. These indole ascarosides integrate input from two major metabolic pathways, amino acid catabolism and lipid beta-oxidation, suggesting that <italic>C. elegans</italic> communicates metabolic status via a modular code of small-molecule signals. Our study thus provides evidence for use of a multilayered chemical language for inter-organismal signaling by a model organism. Understanding of chemical signaling in nematodes may aid the development of new treatment approaches for parasitic nematodes, which remain among the most prevalent human disease agents.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Communication among individuals of a species relies on a number of different sensory inputs including chemical, mechanical, auditory, or visual cues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Wilson1">[1]</xref>. Chemical signaling is perhaps the most ancient form of interorganismal communication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Wilson1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Wyatt1">[2]</xref>, and analysis of the chemical signals and the behaviors they mediate is of great significance for understanding the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of intra- and inter-specific interactions. The free-living nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> is used extensively as a model system for social behaviors such as foraging, population density sensing, mating, and aggregation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbook.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.wormbook.org</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-deBono1">[3]</xref>). Recent investigations have shown that a family of small molecules, the ascarosides, play important roles as chemical signals regulating several different aspects of <italic>C. elegans</italic> behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Butcher1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Yamada1">[8]</xref>. The ascarosides ascr#1, ascr#2, and ascr#3 were originally identified as major components of the dauer pheromone, a population-density signal that promotes entry into an alternate larval stage, the non-feeding and highly persistent dauer stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Butcher1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Srinivasan1">[7]</xref>. Additional work showed that at concentrations far below those required for dauer formation, synergistic mixtures of ascarosides act as strong male-specific attractants, and that male attraction to ascarosides requires the amphid sensory neurons ASK and the cephalic sensory neurons CEM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Pungaliya1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Srinivasan1">[7]</xref>. Wild-type (N2) hermaphrodites do not respond to low concentrations of ascarosides and show repulsion at dauer-inducing concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Butcher1">[4]</xref>. However, a recent study showed that mutation of the neuropeptide-Y receptor homolog NPR-1 strongly affects hermaphrodite response to ascarosides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Macosko1">[9]</xref>. The strong loss-of-function mutant <italic>npr-1(ad609)</italic> showed attraction or reduced repulsion to specific combinations of ascarosides, in contrast to wild type (N2) worms that express a high-activity variant of NPR-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-deBono2">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Rogers1">[11]</xref>. The interneuron RMG, the central site of action of NPR-1, is proposed to serve as a central hub computing aggregation and attraction signals originating from several different sensory neurons, including the ascaroside-sensing ASK neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Macosko1">[9]</xref>.</p>

      <p>These findings suggested that mutual attraction and aggregation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are mediated primarily by signaling via NPR-1, and that strains carrying the high-activity form of NPR-1 including wild-type (N2) hermaphrodites may not rely on small molecule signaling to promote aggregation. Nonetheless, wild-type (N2) hermaphrodites also display aggregation behaviors, for example, in response to environmental cues such as limited food availability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Rogers2">[12]</xref> or perturbations of transforming growth factor–β (TGF–β) signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Chang1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Thomas1">[15]</xref>. Given the existence of small molecules that serve as social cues for population density sensing and mate-finding, and the complicated neural circuitry implicated in aggregation behavior, we hypothesized that structurally distinct small molecules might exist that serve as aggregation signals in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Here we show that <italic>C. elegans</italic> aggregation behavior is regulated by a dedicated set of highly potent signaling molecules, the indole ascarosides, which form part of a modular chemical language that elicits structure-specific behaviors via several distinct neurophysiological pathways. Our findings provide evidence for multi-layered social signaling in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p>

        <title>Identification of the Indole Ascaroside icas#3 Via Comparative Metabolomics</title>
        <p>All currently known small-molecule pheromones in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are derived from peroxisomal β-oxidation of long-chained fatty acids via DAF-22, a protein with strong homology to human sterol carrier protein SCPx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Pungaliya1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Butcher2">[16]</xref>. We hypothesized that putative aggregation pheromones may be derived from the same pathway, suggesting that <italic>daf-22</italic> mutants would not produce them. In this case, a spectroscopic comparison of the wild-type metabolome with that obtained from <italic>daf-22</italic> mutant worms should reveal candidate compounds for attraction or aggregation signals.</p>
        <p>In a previous study, we had used an NMR spectroscopy-based technique termed Differential Analysis of NMR spectra (“DANS”) to compare the wild-type metabolome with that of <italic>daf-22</italic> mutant worms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Pungaliya1">[6]</xref>. This comparison had led to identification of ascr#6–8, of which ascr#8 is a major component of the male-attracting signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Pungaliya1">[6]</xref>. Based on NMR spectra with improved signal-to-noise ratio, we conducted a more detailed comparison of wild type and <italic>daf-22</italic>-mutant metabolomes, which revealed several indole-containing compounds in the wild-type metabolome that were not produced by <italic>daf-22</italic> worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g001">Figure 1B,C</xref>). The established role of DAF-22 in pheromone biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Pungaliya1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Butcher2">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Golden1">[17]</xref> suggested that these indole derivatives may represent a previously unrecognized family of signaling molecules.</p>
        <p>To clarify the structures and biological roles of the <italic>daf-22</italic>-dependent indole derivatives, we pursued their complete identification via NMR spectroscopy-guided fractionation of the wild-type metabolome. Reverse-phase chromatography produced eight metabolite fractions, which were analyzed by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. The NMR spectra revealed the presence of <italic>daf-22</italic>-dependent indole-derivatives in two fractions, which were selected for additional NMR-spectroscopic and mass spectrometric studies. These analyses indicated that the most abundant <italic>daf-22</italic>-dependent indole derivative consists of an indole carboxy unit linked to ascarylose bearing a 9-carbon unsaturated side-chain identical to that found in the known ascr#3 (see Supporting Information for NMR and MS data) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Srinivasan1">[7]</xref>.

        <title>Icas#3 Is Part of a Larger Family of Tryptophan-Derived Small Molecules</title>
        <p>Next we asked whether some of the other <italic>daf-22</italic>-dependent indole compounds we had detected by DANS also represent indole ascarosides. For this purpose, we employed a mass spectrometric (MS) approach, because analysis of the mass spectra of icas#3 had revealed a characteristic MS fragmentation pattern (loss of the indole-3-carboxy moiety, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001237.s003">Figure S1</xref>) that enabled a screen for related compounds. MS screening for compounds with similar fragmentation profiles indicated that icas#3 is a member of a larger series of indole ascarosides featuring side chains with five to nine carbons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g001">Figure 1D,E</xref>). The most abundant components of this family of indole ascarosides are icas#3, icas#9, and icas#10, which are accompanied by smaller amounts of icas#1 and icas#7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). All of these compounds represent new metabolites, except for icas#9, which recently has been reported to possess moderate dauer-inducing activity and is unique among known dauer pheromones in producing a bell-shaped response curve <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Butcher3">[18]</xref>. We also detected two new non-indole ascarosides: ascr#9, which features a saturated 5-carbon side chain, and ascr#10, which features a saturated 9-carbon side chain, thus representing the saturated analog of the known ascr#3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g001">Figure 1F</xref>).</p>
        <p>The MS analyses further revealed that the indole ascarosides' quantitative distribution is distinctly different from that of the corresponding non-indole ascarosides, suggesting that incorporation of the indole unit is strongly regulated. Notably, the most abundant indole ascaroside, icas#3, is accompanied by 10–40-fold larger amounts of the corresponding non-indole ascaroside, ascr#3, whereas icas#9 is more abundant than the corresponding ascr#9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). To determine the biosynthetic origin of the indole ascarosides and to exclude the possibility that they are produced by the <italic>E. coli</italic> food source, we established axenic (bacteria-free) in vitro cultures of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (N2) using the chemically defined CeMM medium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Lu1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Nass1">[20]</xref>. HPLC-MS analysis of the axenic cultures revealed the presence of icas#1, icas#3, icas#9, and icas#10, thus indicating that indole ascarosides are produced by <italic>C. elegans</italic> without participation of dietary bacteria. Use of a 1∶1 mixture of L-[2,4,5,6,7-D<sub>5</sub>]-tryptophan and L-tryptophan in the axenic medium resulted in production of [D<sub>5</sub>]-icas#1, [D<sub>5</sub>]-icas#3, [D<sub>5</sub>]-icas#9, and [D<sub>5</sub>]-icas#10, along with equivalent amounts of the unlabelled compounds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001237.s004">Figure S2</xref>). In conclusion, our biochemical studies established the tryptophan origin of the indole-3-carboxy moiety in the indole ascarosides and indicate that these compounds are products of a strongly regulated biosynthetic pathway.</p>

        <title>Indole Ascarosides Strongly Attract Hermaphrodites</title>
        <p>The addition of an indole-3-carboxy moiety to the ascarosides represents a significant structural change, and we hypothesized that this chemical difference may indicate signaling functions for these compounds distinct from those of their non-indole cognates. Using synthetic samples (see Supporting Information), we tested three indole ascarosides of varying side-chain lengths, icas#1, icas#3, and icas#9, in the spot attraction assay we had used previously to demonstrate social functions of small molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Pungaliya1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Srinivasan1">[7]</xref>.

Testing the most abundant indole ascaroside, icas#3, over a broader range of concentrations, we observed that at low concentrations icas#3 was strongly attractive to hermaphrodites, whereas males were no longer attracted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001237.s008">Movies S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001237.s009">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001237.s010">S3</xref>). Similarly, hermaphrodites, but not males, are strongly attracted to low concentrations of icas#9 (). We further investigated hermaphrodite attraction to icas#3 using a quadrant chemotaxis bioassay as described previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Macosko1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Wicks1">[21]</xref>.

Our results show that simply by attaching an indole-3-carboxy group to the 4-position of the ascarylose, the strongly male-attracting ascr#3 is converted into a signal that primarily attracts hermaphrodites. The difference in the amounts at which ascr#3 and icas#3 are produced by the worms corresponds to their relative potency: the male-attracting ascr#3, which is of much lower potency than icas#3, is produced in much higher concentrations than the highly potent hermaphrodite attractant icas#3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g001">Figure 1G</xref>).</p>

        <title>Femtomolar Concentrations of Indole Ascarosides Promote <italic>C. elegans</italic> Aggregation</title>
        <p>We next tested how a constant background concentration of indole ascarosides affects hermaphrodite behavior. We measured aggregation of solitary N2 worms and several social strains (including the social wild-type strain CB4856 and two <italic>npr-1</italic> loss-of-function mutants) in response to icas#3 using two different conditions: “high worm density,” with 120 worms per 5 cm plate, and “low worm density,” with 20 worms per 5 cm plate. At low worm density, we observed a very strong increase in aggregation at concentrations as low as 10 fM (femtomolar) icas#3 for both solitary and social hermaphrodites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g004">Figure 4A, 4E</xref>). Aggregation of N2 hermaphrodites increased as much as 4-fold at 1 pM icas#3, with higher icas#3 concentrations producing less aggregation. Similarly, the naturally occurring social strain CB4856 displayed a bell-shaped response curve with maximal aggregation at 1 pM of icas#3 and lower aggregation not significantly different from control at 1 nM of icas#3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, icas#3 increased aggregation of <italic>npr-1(ad609)</italic> hermaphrodites over the entire tested concentration range, without a drop-off at higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). At high worm density, we observed up to a 3-fold increase in aggregation of N2 hermaphrodites on icas#3 plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g004">Figure 4B,F</xref>), whereas hermaphrodites from all three tested social strains showed nearly complete aggregation even in the absence of icas#3, which precluded detection of any additional aggregation-promoting effect of icas#3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). These results show that icas#3 increases hermaphrodite aggregation even in the absence of a concentration gradient of this compound, and that solitary and social strains are similarly affected. Similarly, the second-most abundant indole ascaroside, icas#9, increased aggregation of both solitary and social hermaphrodites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001237.s006">Figure S4A</xref>).

        <p>These results show that indole ascarosides promote aggregation behavior even in the absence of a concentration gradient, suggesting that sensing of icas#3 and icas#9 affects response to other aggregation-promoting (chemical or other) signals or conditions. For example, secretion of additional indole ascarosides by the worms on plates containing exogenous icas#3 could contribute to the observed increase in aggregation. To investigate this possibility, we tested <italic>daf-22</italic> hermaphrodites in the aggregation assay. <italic>daf-22</italic> hermaphrodites do not produce indole ascarosides but respond to icas#3 in both the spot attraction and quadrant chemotaxis assay as strongly as N2 worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g003">Figures 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001237.s005">S3C</xref>).

        <p>The amphid single-ciliated sensory neurons type K (ASK) play an important role in mediating <italic>C. elegans</italic> behaviors, and previous work has shown that the ASK neurons are required for behavioral responses of males and hermaphrodites to non-indole ascarosides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Srinivasan1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Macosko1">[9]</xref>. ASK sensory neurons are connected via anatomical gap-junctions to the RMG interneuron, which has been shown to act as a central hub regulating aggregation and related behaviors based on input from ASK and other sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Macosko1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-White1">[26]</xref>. To investigate the neural circuitry required for icas#3-mediated hermaphrodite attraction and aggregation, we first tested whether the ASK neurons are required for these behaviors. For this purpose, we used worms lacking the ASK neurons due to cell-specific expression of mammalian caspase in the developing neurons (Tokumitsu Wakabayashi, Iwate University Japan, personal communication). We found that ablation of ASK sensory neurons resulted in a near complete loss of attraction to icas#3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). In contrast, ablation of the ASI neurons, which like the ASK neurons partake in dauer pheromone sensing, had no significant effect on icas#3 mediated attraction in hermaphrodites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Further, ablation of both ASI and ASK neurons did not result in a more significant loss of attraction compared to ASK ablations alone, suggesting that the ASK sensory neurons are required for sensing icas#3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Next we tested whether the ASK neurons are required for icas#3 mediated aggregation. We found that hermaphrodites lacking the ASK neurons do not aggregate in response to icas#3 at any of the tested concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).

        <p>Next we tested whether the RMG interneuron is required for icas#3-mediated behaviors. We identified the cell position of the RMG interneuron in wild-type worms using DIC microscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Sulston1">[27]</xref> and in a transgenic strain expressing <italic>ncs-1::gfp</italic> (a gift from the Bargmann Lab). This transgene expresses GFP in the RMG interneuron and a few other sensory neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Macosko1">[9]</xref>. We found that ablation of the RMG interneuron in both wild-type and <italic>ncs-1::gfp</italic> worms did not affect icas#3-response in the spot attraction assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). These results indicate that the RMG interneuron is not required for transduction of icas#3-derived attraction signals from the ASK sensory neurons, in contrast to the behavioral effects of non-indole ascarosides, which require both the ASK sensory neurons and the RMG interneuron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Macosko1">[9]</xref>. Given this observation, we sought to understand which interneuron downstream of ASK is required for response to icas#3. According to the wiring diagram of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the primary synaptic output of the ASK neuron is the AIA interneuron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-White1">[26]</xref>. To test whether this neuron is required for sensing icas#3, we used a transgenic line expressing a hyperactive form of MEC-4 in the AIA interneuron (a kind gift from the Ishihara lab, Japan) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Shinkai1">[28]</xref>. Expression of MEC-4, a DEG/ENaC sodium channel, causes neuronal toxicity in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, thereby resulting in the loss of the AIA neuron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Harbinder1">[29]</xref>. These AIA-deficient worms did not show any attraction to icas#3, suggesting that the AIA interneurons are required for icas#3 response. Hence the neural circuitry required for attraction to icas#3 is different from that of the non-indole ascarosides.</p>
        <p>Since behavioral assays showed that the ASK and AIA neurons participate in sensing icas#3, we asked whether icas#3 elicits calcium flux in these neurons. To measure Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux, we used transgenic lines expressing the genetically encoded calcium sensors (GCaMP) in these neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Macosko1">[9]</xref>. We used the “Olfactory chip” to restrain the worms and applied ON and OFF steps of icas#3 while imaging from these neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Chronis1">[30]</xref>. We were not able to detect Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in ASK neurons even when applying a wide range of concentration ranging from 1 pM to 1 µM. We then monitored calcium responses in the AIA interneuron, which is the primary synaptic target of the ASK neuron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-White1">[26]</xref>. We found that icas#3 elicited significantly increased G-CaMP fluorescence in the AIA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g005">Figure 5D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001237.s011">Movie S4</xref>), similar to the results reported by Macosko et al. for stimulation of AIA interneurons with a mixture of three non-indole ascarosides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Macosko1">[9]</xref>. These results show that the ASK sensory neurons are required for icas response and that this response is transduced via the AIA interneuron.</p>

To investigate whether addition of ascr#3 would affect icas#3-mediated attraction of hermaphrodites, we tested mixtures containing these two compounds in a near-physiological ratio of 12∶1 (ascr#3∶icas#3) in a modified spot attraction assay, in which we scored N2 hermaphrodite attraction to three concentric zones A–C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). We found that at the lower of the two concentrations tested (120 fmol ascr#3 and 10 fmol icas#3), the presence of ascr#3 did not interfere with icas#3-mediated attraction, whereas higher concentrations of ascr#3 resulted in strong repulsion, even in the presence of proportionally increased icas#3 concentrations (12 pmol ascr#3 and 1 pmol icas#3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Following retreat from the outer edge of zone A, many worms remained “trapped” in a circular zone B surrounding central zone A, repulsed by the high concentration of icas#3/ascr#3-blend inside zone A, but attracted by the lower concentrations of the icas#3/ascr#3 blend that diffused into zone B (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001237.s012">Movie S5</xref> for a visual record of this behavior). These results show that at high concentrations of physiological icas#3/ascr#3 mixtures the repulsive effect of ascr#3 prevails, whereas at lower concentrations attraction by icas#3 dominates.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Indole ascarosides are the first <italic>C. elegans</italic> pheromones that strongly attract wild-type hermaphrodites and promote aggregation. The indole ascarosides fit the broad definition of aggregation pheromones in that they attract and/or arrest conspecifics to the region of release irrespective of sex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Wilson1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Shorey1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Wertheim1">[32]</xref>. In promoting these behaviors, the indole ascarosides are active at such low (femtomolar) concentrations that the worm's behavioral response must result from sensing of only a few molecules. For example, at an icas#3 concentration of 10 fM there are only about 20 icas#3 molecules contained in a cylinder corresponding to length and diameter of an adult hermaphrodite. Given their high specific activity, it is not surprising that indole ascarosides (icas') are of much lower abundance than non-indole ascarosides (ascr's).</p>
      <p>The indole ascarosides' strongly attractive properties suggest that these compounds serve to attract conspecifics to desirable environments such as food sources. However, the results from our competition experiments indicate that attraction of hermaphrodites by icas#3 can be counteracted by high concentrations of ascr#3, which are repulsive to hermaphrodites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Srinivasan1">[7]</xref>. The competition experiments further showed that at low concentrations of a physiological blend of icas#3 and ascr#3, the attractive properties of icas#3 dominate, whereas at high concentrations of the same blend the repulsion by ascr#3 becomes dominant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, Movie S5). These findings suggest that under dauer-inducing conditions with high population density, the associated high concentrations of ascr#3 promote dispersal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Srinivasan1">[7]</xref>, whereas low population density and correspondingly lower concentrations of ascr#3 result in attraction mediated by icas#3. Therefore, icas' and ascr's could represent opposing stimuli regulating population density and level of aggregation. In turn, population density, food availability, and other environmental factors may affect relative rates of the biosyntheses of ascr's and icas' as part of a regulatory circuit.</p>
      <p>Indole ascarosides affect aggregation behavior even in the absence of a concentration gradient: very low background concentrations (fM-pM) of icas#3 and icas#9 strongly increase the propensity of hermaphrodites (and males) to aggregate. This finding suggests that sensing of icas#3 and icas#9 increases susceptibility for aggregation-promoting (chemical or other) signals or conditions, for example additional quantities of icas' secreted by the worms on the plate.</p>
      <p>Aggregation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is known to depend on a diverse set of genetic factors and environmental conditions, including food availability and oxygen concentration, suggesting the existence of neuronal circuitry that integrates inputs from different sources <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-deBono2">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Cheung1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Gray1">[36]</xref>. Aggregation and attraction signals originating from several different sensory neurons, including the oxygen-sensing URX-neurons and the ascr-sensing ASK neurons, have recently been shown to converge on the RMG interneuron, which is proposed to act as a central hub coordinating these behaviors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Macosko1">[9]</xref>. The RMG interneuron is the central site of action of the neuropeptide-Y receptor homolog NPR-1, which distinguishes solitary strains (high NPR-1 activity) from social strains (low NPR-1 activity) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-deBono2">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Rogers1">[11]</xref>. In social <italic>npr-1(lf)</italic> mutant hermaphrodites, oxygen-sensing URX neurons promote aggregation at the edges of the bacterial lawn, whereas solitary N2 hermaphrodites do not respond to oxygen gradients. Similarly, repulsion by ascr's depends on NPR-1, as solitary hermaphrodites are repelled by ascr's, whereas social <italic>npr-1(lf)</italic> hermaphrodites display either greatly diminished repulsion or weak attraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Macosko1">[9]</xref>. In contrast, we show that icas#3 promotes hermaphrodite attraction and aggregation in both social and solitary strains. Icas#3 attracts solitary N2 as well as social <italic>npr-1(lf)</italic> hermaphrodites and increases hermaphrodite aggregation in the solitary strain N2, the social wild-type strains RC301 and CB4856 (Hawaii) carrying a low-activity variant of NPR-1, and the two tested <italic>npr-1</italic> null alleles. The finding that icas#3-mediated attraction and aggregation is not reduced by high NPR-1 activity suggests that these icas#3-mediated behaviors rely on signaling pathways distinct from those controlling aggregation responses to other types of stimuli, for example low oxygen levels. This hypothesis is supported by our observation that hermaphrodites lacking the RMG interneuron, which coordinates other aggregation responses via NPR-1, are still attracted to icas#3. Furthermore, icas#3-mediated aggregation differs from NPR-1-dependent aggregation behavior in that aggregation of worms on icas#3 plates is more dynamic and not restricted to the edge of the bacterial lawn where oxygen is limited <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001237.s001">(Animations S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001237.s002">S2</xref>). Worm velocity is not significantly reduced at the icas#3 concentrations that induce maximal aggregation (1–10 pM, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001237.s006">Figure S4D</xref>), and icas#3-mediated aggregation is associated with less clumping (average clump size 3-5 worms) than found for aggregating NPR-1 mutant worms (average clump size 6–16 worms) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Rogers2">[12]</xref>. These observations show that icas#3-mediated aggregation is phenotypically distinct from aggregation behaviors controlled by NPR-1 and the RMG interneuron.</p>
      <p>Icas#3-mediated attraction and aggregation depend on the ASK neurons, similar to hermaphrodite repulsion and male attraction by ascr's <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Srinivasan1">[7]</xref>, confirming the central role of this pair of sensory neurons for perception of different types of pheromones in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g005">Figure 5</xref>). We further show that icas#3 responses are dependent on the AIA interneurons and do not require the RMG interneuron. Therefore, it appears that the sensory neuron ASK participates in perception of two different types of pheromones, ascr's and icas', and that these signals are transduced via two different neurophysiological pathways, as part of a complex neural and genetic circuitry integrating a structurally diverse array of pheromone signals.</p>
      <p>Calcium transients have been recorded from amphid sensory neurons in response to non-indole ascarosides; however, the reported changes in G-CaMP fluorescence were relatively small (on the order of about 20%) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Macosko1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Kim1">[37]</xref>. Recently, it was reported that the non-indole ascaroside ascr#5 does not elicit calcium transients in the ASI sensory neurons, although the ASI neurons function as sensors of ascr#5 and express the ascr#5-receptors <italic>srg-36</italic> and <italic>srg-37</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-McGrath1">[38]</xref>. Similarly, we were unable to detect significant Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in the ASK neurons in response to a wide range of concentrations of icas#3 (unpublished data). It is possible that any icas#3-elicited Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in this neuron are even weaker than those of non-indole ascarosides, as icas#3 is active at extremely low concentrations (femtomolar to low picomolar). Additionally, we cannot rule out involvement of additional neurons in icas#3 signaling, given that the ASK neurons are postsynaptic to a number of other sensory neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-White1">[26]</xref>. Notably, icas#3 elicited significant changes in G-CaMP fluorescence in the AIA interneurons, which are the primary postsynaptic targets of the ASK sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g005">Figure 5D,E</xref>, Movie S4).</p>
      <p>The identification of indole ascarosides as aggregation signals reveals unexpected complexity of social signaling in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Our results indicate that ascarylose-derived small molecules (icas' and ascr's) serve at least three distinct functions in <italic>C. elegans</italic>: dauer induction, male attraction, and hermaphrodite social signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Previous studies have shown that ascr's often have more than one function; ascr#3, for example, plays significant roles for both dauer signaling and male attraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Butcher1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Srinivasan1">[7]</xref>. Our study demonstrates that specific structural variants of ascarylose-derived small molecules are associated with specific functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). We show that addition of an indole carboxy group to ascr's changes the signaling properties such that the indole-modified compounds can have signaling effects very different from those of the unmodified compounds: icas#3 strongly attracts hermaphrodites and promotes aggregation, whereas ascr#3 repulses hermaphrodites and attracts males. In addition to structural variation, distinct signaling functions are associated with different concentration windows: whereas for dauer formation, high nanomolar concentrations of ascr's are required, low nanomolar to high picomolar concentrations of ascr's promote male attraction, and picomolar to femtomolar concentrations of icas' promote hermaphrodite attraction and aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>
      <p>Social signaling in <italic>C. elegans</italic> thus appears to be based on a modular language of small molecules, derived from combinatorial assembly of several structurally distinct building blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Different combinations of these building blocks serve different, occasionally overlapping signaling functions. Our results for the relative abundances of ascr's and icas' with identical side chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g001">Figure 1G</xref>) indicate that integration of the different building blocks is carefully controlled. Biochemically, the building blocks are derived from three basic metabolic pathways: carbohydrate metabolism, peroxisomal fatty-acid β-oxidation, and amino acid metabolism. These structural observations raise the possibility that social signaling via small molecules transduces input from the overall metabolic state of the organism. Food availability and nutrient content in conjunction with other environmental factors may control ascr and icas biosynthesis pathways to generate specific pheromone blends that differentially regulate aggregation, mate attraction, and developmental timing. The expansive vocabulary of a modular chemical language would make it possible for different nematodes to signal conspecifically as well as interspecifically, but it is not known whether nematode species other than <italic>C. elegans</italic> rely on ascarylose-based small molecules for chemical communication. However, lipid-derived glycosides of ascarylose have been identified from several other nematode species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Bartley1">[39]</xref>, suggesting that many nematodes have the ability to produce ascr- or icas-like compounds.</p>
      <p>The identification of indole ascarosides as attraction and aggregation signals demonstrates that <italic>C. elegans</italic> aggregation behavior depends on dedicated chemical signals produced by conspecifics and not just shared preference for specific environmental conditions. <italic>C. elegans</italic> social signaling thus appears to be significantly more highly evolved than previously suspected.</p>

        <p>Axenic in vitro cultures of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (N2, Bristol) were established as described by Nass &amp; Hamza <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Nass1">[20]</xref>, using the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Maintenance Medium (CeMM, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Lu1">[19]</xref>) with cholesterol (5 mg/l) instead of sitosterol and nucleoside-5-phosphates. After 21 d the cultures were centrifuged and the supernatant media and worm pellet were lyophilized separately. The lyophilized worm pellets (1.2–2.0 mg) were extracted with 2 ml methanol, filtered, and concentrated <italic>in vacuo</italic>. The lyophilized worm media were extracted with ethyl acetate–methanol (95∶5, 100 mL 2 times), filtered, and concentrated <italic>in vacuo</italic>. Residues were taken up in 150 µl methanol and investigated by HPLC-ESI-MS. For the application experiment 50 ml CeMM medium was supplemented with 9.2 mg L-[2,4,5,6,7-D<sub>5</sub>]-tryptophan (from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories).</p>

For the competition experiments we used 120 nM ascr#3 and 10 nM icas#3 (Condition 1), or 12 µM ascr#3 and 1 µM icas#3 (Condition 2) in water containing 10% ethanol. Aliquots were stored at −20°C in 20 µL tubes. 10% ethanol in water was used as control.</p>

        <title>Quadrant Chemotaxis Assays</title>
        <p>Chemotaxis to both non-indole and indole ascarosides was assessed on 10 cm four-quadrant Petri plates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Wicks1">[21]</xref>. Each quadrant was separated from adjacent ones by plastic spacers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Pairs of opposite quadrants were filled with nematode growth medium (NGM) agar containing either indole ascarosides or non-indole ascarosides at different concentrations. Animals were washed gently in a S-basal buffer and placed in the center of a four-quadrant plate with ascarosides in alternating quadrants, and scored after 15 min and 30 min. A chemotaxis index was calculated as (the number of animals on ascaroside quadrants minus the number of animals on buffer quadrants)/(total number of animals).</p>

        <title>Aggregation Assays</title>
        <p>We measured aggregation behavior of worms using assays described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-deBono2">[10]</xref>. Aggregation assays were conducted on standard NGM plates. Plates containing indole ascarosides were made by adding the indole ascaroside stock solution to the NGM media before they were poured onto the plates. These plates were dried at room temperature for 2–3 d. Control plates were treated similarly except that instead of icas solutions ethanol solutions were added to the plates, corresponding to the amount of ethanol introduced via the icas solutions. Final ethanol concentrations of the plates were below 0.1% for all conditions. After drying, both control plates and plates containing indole ascarosides were seeded with 150 µl of an overnight culture of <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 using a micropipette and allowed to dry for 2 d at room temperature. For “low worm density” experiments, we placed 20 worms onto the lawn and left them at 20°C for 3 h. For “high worm density” experiments we placed approximately 120 worms onto the bacterial lawn and left them at 20°C for 3 h. Aggregation behavior was quantified as the number of animals that were in touch with two or more animals at &gt;50% of their body length.</p>

        <title>Calcium Imaging and Analysis</title>
        <p>For calcium imaging we used transgenic lines that express the genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor in ASK (<italic>kyEx2866</italic>) and AIA (<italic>kyEx2916</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Macosko1">[9]</xref>. Young adults or adult worms were inserted into an “Olfactory chip” microfluidic device. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001237-Chronis1">[30]</xref>. Dilutions of icas#3 were done with S-basal buffer (with no cholesterol). As stock solutions of icas#3 contained small amounts of ethanol, equivalent amounts of ethanol were added to the S-basal control flow. Imaging was done using an inverted Zeiss microscope equipped with an Andor camera. Exposure time for image acquisition was 300 ms. Before imaging the ASK neuron, the worm was exposed to blue light for 3 min since ASK responds to the blue light itself. This step is necessary so that the neuron adapts to the blue light that is used for Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements. The movies were analyzed using custom-made Matlab scripts. For calculating the average change in fluorescence upon exposure to either buffer or icas#3, we chose the first peak of fluorescence immediately after exposure to buffer or icas#3. The value for this maximum was then subtracted from the mean fluorescence during the 5 s before the delivery of icas#3/buffer (corresponding to the region between 5 s to 10 s in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001237-g005">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>
