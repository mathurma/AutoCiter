        <p>Neurotrophins are key regulators of neuronal survival and differentiation during development. Activation of their cognate receptors, Trk receptors, a family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), is pivotal for mediating the downstream functions of neurotrophins. Recent studies reveal that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), a serine/threonine kinase, may modulate RTK signaling through phosphorylation of the receptor. Given the abundant expression of both Cdk5 and Trk receptors in the nervous system, and their mutual involvement in the regulation of neuronal architecture and synaptic functions, it is of interest to investigate if Cdk5 may also modulate Trk signaling. In the current study, we report the identification of TrkB as a Cdk5 substrate. Cdk5 phosphorylates TrkB at Ser478 at the intracellular juxtamembrane region of TrkB. Interestingly, attenuation of Cdk5 activity or overexpression of a TrkB mutant lacking the Cdk5 phosphorylation site essentially abolishes brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)–triggered dendritic growth in primary hippocampal neurons. In addition, we found that Cdk5 is involved in BDNF-induced activation of Rho GTPase Cdc42, which is essential for BDNF-triggered dendritic growth. Our observations therefore reveal an unanticipated role of Cdk5 in TrkB-mediated regulation of dendritic growth through modulation of BDNF-induced Cdc42 activation.</p>

          <p>Accurate transmission of information in the nervous system requires the precise formation of contact points between neurons. Regulation of these contact sites involves fine tuning the number and branching of dendritic processes on neurons. Throughout development, several secreted factors act to regulate dendrite number and branching. One important family of these factors is neurotrophins, which are indispensable for the survival and development of neurons. For example, stimulation of hippocampal neurons with one neurotrophin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), increases the number of dendrites directly extending from the cell body. Here, we report that BDNF-stimulated dendritic growth requires phosphorylation of the BDNF receptor, TrkB, by a kinase known as cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5). Inhibiting phosphorylation of TrkB by Cdk5 essentially abolishes the induction of dendrites by BDNF. Our observations reveal that Cdk5 serves as a regulator of neurotrophin function. Since Cdk5 and neurotrophins both play essential roles in neuronal development, our findings suggest that the interplay between Cdk5 and TrkB may also be implicated in the regulation of other biological processes during development.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Neurotrophins are indispensable for multiple aspects of neuronal development, such as the maintenance of neuronal survival, regulation of neuronal architecture, and synaptic plasticity. Members of the neurotrophins include the prototypic member nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin (NT)–3, and NT-4/5. Downstream responses of neurotrophins are transduced by a family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) known as Trks, and also the low-affinity neurotrophin receptor p75. Although all neurotrophins bind p75, they associate with different Trk receptors with rather remarkable selectivity. NGF interacts selectively with TrkA, while BDNF and NT-4/5 bind preferentially to TrkB. NT-3, on the other hand, associates with TrkC with high affinity, although it also binds TrkA and TrkB with low affinity. Similar to other RTKs, activation of Trks leads to dimerization and autophosphorylation of the receptors, followed by the recruitment and initiation of a myriad of signaling pathways including the Ras/MAPK, PI3K, and PLCγ pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b002">2</xref>].</p>
      <p>Interestingly, recent studies have demonstrated that activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), a serine/threonine kinase, is required for the downstream actions of a RTK, ErbB. Cdk5 was found to phosphorylate ErbB2/3, a phosphorylation that is essential for the activation of the receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b004">4</xref>]. Cdk5 is a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase family, but it is unique in several aspects. First of all, it is activated by the neural-specific non-cyclin activators p35 and p39. Secondly, Cdk5 is not involved in the regulation of cell cycle control, but is implicated in neuronal migration, synapse functions/maintenance, and neuronal survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b006">6</xref>]. The importance of Cdk5 in neuronal development and migration is underscored by the aberrant phenotypes exhibited by mice lacking Cdk5 and its activators. Cdk5 knockout mice and p35/p39 double knockout mice both exhibit perinatal death with severe cortical lamination defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b008">8</xref>]. Furthermore, swollen soma and nuclear margination is evident in Cdk5-deficient neurons, implicating Cdk5 as an essential regulator of neuronal survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b007">7</xref>]. Interestingly, truncation of the Cdk5 activator p35 into p25 has also been associated with prolonged Cdk5 activation in a number of neurodegenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b009">9</xref>], thus revealing that precise regulation of Cdk5 activity is essential for maintenance of neuronal survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b010">10</xref>]. Furthermore, an increasing number of studies are pointing to an essential role of Cdk5 at the synapse, where it is not only involved in the formation and maintenance of synapses, but is also indispensable for the regulation of synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b005">5</xref>]. While the mechanisms by which Cdk5 regulates such diverse functions remain to be unraveled, the identification of ErbB receptors as Cdk5 substrates suggests that Cdk5 may exert its biological effects by modulating signaling pathways downstream of RTK activation. This piece of evidence, together with the abundant expression of Cdk5 and Trk receptors in the nervous system and their shared implication in a number of biological functions, prompted us to further examine if Cdk5 also regulates the signaling of Trk receptors.</p>
      <p>In the current study, we report the identification of TrkB as a substrate of Cdk5. More importantly, we found that Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of TrkB is essential for BDNF-induced dendritic growth through the modulation of Cdc42 activity. Our findings provide evidence for a crosstalk between the Cdk5 and neurotrophin signaling pathways, and lend further support to the idea that Cdk5 is a modulator of RTK signaling.</p>

        <title>TrkB Interacted with p35 and Cdk5</title>
        <p>Given the increasing evidence implicating Cdk5 in the modulation of RTK signaling, we sought to examine if Cdk5 may also play a role in Trk signaling. Literature search revealed that TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC all contain serine- or threonine-directed proline residues at the intracellular juxtamembrane region of the receptors, but only TrkB and TrkC contain Cdk5 consensus sites S/TPXK/H/R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050063-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). To explore the potential interplay between Trk receptors and Cdk5, we first examined if Trk receptors associated with Cdk5 or p35. TrkA, TrkB, or TrkC was overexpressed together with Cdk5 or p35 in COS7 cells, and immunoprecipitation was performed with Cdk5, p35, or pan-Trk antibody. Interestingly, all three Trk receptors were observed to associate with Cdk5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050063-g001">Figure 1</xref>B) and p35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050063-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), while no association was observed when immunoprecipitation was performed with IgG control. Since both TrkB and its ligand BDNF are abundantly expressed in the brain throughout development, we next proceeded to verify the interaction between TrkB and Cdk5/p35 in postnatal brains. We found that TrkB associated with both p35 and Cdk5 in postnatal day 7 (P7) rat brain lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050063-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). Furthermore, Flag-tagged Cdk5 pulled down TrkB from the membrane fraction of adult brain lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050063-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). These observations collectively suggest that TrkB interacted with Cdk5/p35 in both postnatal and adult brains. Since both p35 and Cdk5 are present in brain lysates and likely exist as a complex, the observed interaction between TrkB and Cdk5/p35 did not provide specific information on whether TrkB associated specifically with Cdk5 or p35. To delineate between these two possibilities, the interaction between TrkB, p35, and Cdk5 was examined in p35<sup>+/+</sup> and p35<sup>−/−</sup> brain lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050063-g001">Figure 1</xref>F). Interestingly, we found that in the absence of p35, the association between Cdk5 and TrkB was essentially abolished, indicating that p35 was required for the association between Cdk5 and TrkB in vivo.</p>

        <title>Cdk5 Phosphorylated TrkB at Ser478</title>
        <p>We next proceeded to examine if Trk receptors, TrkB in particular, served as Cdk5 substrates using in vitro kinase assay. TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC were overexpressed in COS7 cells and immunoprecipitated by pan-Trk antibody. Incubation with Cdk5/p25 revealed that TrkB and TrkC, but not TrkA, were phosphorylated by Cdk5/p25 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050063-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). This is in agreement with the lack of Cdk5 consensus sites in TrkA, and points to the possibility that Cdk5 may phosphorylate TrkB and TrkC at the Cdk5 consensus sites at the juxtamembrane region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050063-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). To examine this possibility, a GST fusion protein containing only the juxtamembrane region of TrkB was prepared. In vitro kinase assay verified that Cdk5/p35 phosphorylated TrkB at the juxtamembrane region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050063-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). It has previously been proposed that p25 and p35 may confer different substrate specificities. Results from our in vitro kinase assay suggested that Cdk5 phosphorylated TrkB regardless of whether it was activated by p25 or p35, although further studies will be required to delineate the relative contributions of p25 and p35 to endogenous phosphorylation of TrkB by Cdk5.</p>

            <p>(B) GST-TrkB-juxtamembrane fusion protein was incubated with increasing amount of Cdk5/p35 and subjected to an in vitro kinase assay. Histone H1 served as control to verify the activity of the Cdk5 kinase. The TrkB-juxtamembrane region was phosphorylated by Cdk5/p35 in a dose-dependent manner.</p>
            <p>(C) Purified WT GST-TrkB-juxtamembrane fusion protein and mutants (M1, M2, and DM) were incubated with Cdk5/p25 in an in vitro kinase assay. While WT and M2 were strongly phosphorylated by Cdk5/p25, phosphorylation of M1 and DM were markedly attenuated. Quality of the purified GST and GST-fusion proteins used in the GST pull-down assay was verified by Coomassie blue staining.</p>
            <p>(D) Characterization of p-Ser TrkB antibody raised against phosphorylated Ser478 of TrkB. TrkB was overexpressed with or without p35/Cdk5 in HEK293T cells.

In the absence of Cdk5/p35, Ser478-phosphorylated TrkB (p-Ser TrkB) was not detected. Overexpression of Cdk5/p35 resulted in phosphorylation of TrkB WT at Ser478, but phosphorylation at Ser478 was essentially abolished when TrkB M1 and DM were overexpressed.

        <p>We were next interested in identifying the Cdk5 phosphorylation site(s) on TrkB. Three TrkB-juxtamembrane region mutants were generated: TrkB M1, where Ser478 was mutated to alanine; TrkB M2, where Thr489 was mutated to alanine; and TrkB DM, where both Ser478 and Thr489 were mutated to alanine. Interestingly, phosphorylation of the TrkB-juxtamembrane region was almost completely abolished when Cdk5/p25 was incubated with TrkB M1 or TrkB DM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050063-g002">Figure 2</xref>C), thus revealing that Ser478 was required for Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of the TrkB-juxtamembrane region. We further verified the importance of this site for Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of TrkB by generating a phospho-specific TrkB antibody against Ser478. Preincubation of the antibody with blocking peptide prevented detection of Ser478-phosphorylated TrkB, indicating that the antibody was sufficiently specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050063-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). Full-length TrkB mutants lacking the potential Cdk5 phosphorylation sites were overexpressed with or without Cdk5/p35 in HEK293T cells. Interestingly, Ser478-phosphorylated TrkB was not observed in the absence of Cdk5/p35, indicating that Cdk5 was essential for the phosphorylation of TrkB at Ser478 in HEK293T cells. More importantly, when TrkB mutants lacking Ser478 were expressed (TrkB M1 and TrkB DM), phosphorylation of TrkB at Ser478 was essentially abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050063-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). Taken together, our observations indicate that Cdk5 phosphorylated TrkB at Ser478 at the juxtamembrane region of TrkB.</p>

        <p>To further examine if Cdk5 is essential for phosphorylation of TrkB at Ser478 in vivo, we examined the effect of inhibiting Cdk5 activity on phospho-Ser478 (p-Ser478) TrkB levels in cortical neurons. We found that at basal level, TrkB was weakly phosphorylated at Ser478. Interestingly, stimulation with BDNF led to a marked increase in p-Ser478 TrkB levels, indicating that phosphorylation of TrkB at Ser478 was at least in part ligand dependent. Remarkably, treatment with Cdk5 selective inhibitor roscovitine (Ros) almost abrogated the BDNF-triggered increase in p-Ser478 TrkB levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050063-g003">Figure 3</xref>A), suggesting that Cdk5 was involved in the BDNF-stimulated component of TrkB Ser478 phosphorylation. To further establish the involvement of Cdk5 in Ser478 phosphorylation of TrkB in vivo, the levels of p-Ser478 TrkB in <italic>cdk5</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>cdk5</italic><sup>−/−</sup> brain lysates were examined.

Similarly, cortical neurons prepared from Cdk5<sup>−/−</sup> brains exhibited undetectable levels of p-Ser478 TrkB. In addition, BDNF stimulation failed to trigger an increase in p-Ser478 TrkB levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050063-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). These observations strongly suggest that Cdk5 is essential for phosphorylation of TrkB at Ser478 in vivo, and that BDNF-stimulated increase in Ser478 phosphorylation of TrkB requires Cdk5 activity.</p>

        <title>BDNF Treatment Enhanced Cdk5 Activity</title>
        <p>Since BDNF stimulation was observed to increase Ser478 phosphorylation of TrkB, and Cdk5 was required for phosphorylating TrkB at Ser478, we were interested to examine if BDNF stimulation affects Cdk5 activity. BDNF has previously been observed to increase Cdk5 activity after 3 d of BDNF stimulation in cortical neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b011">11</xref>]. In agreement with this observation, we found that BDNF treatment led to an increase in Cdk5 activity within 15 min of BDNF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050063-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). More importantly, addition of Trk inhibitor K252a essentially abolished BDNF-triggered increase in Cdk5 activity, indicating that the increase in Cdk5 activity was dependent on TrkB activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050063-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). It has previously been demonstrated that Cdk5 activity is enhanced by phosphorylation at Tyr15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b012">12</xref>]. Given the activation of tyrosine kinase activity of TrkB upon ligand stimulation, we were interested to investigate if BDNF treatment leads to phosphorylation of Cdk5 at Tyr15, thereby enhancing its activity. We found that BDNF stimulation enhanced association between Cdk5 and TrkB in cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050063-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). More importantly, in vitro kinase assay using purified TrkB and Cdk5 revealed that TrkB phosphorylated Cdk5 at Tyr15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050063-g004">Figure 4</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050063-g004">4</xref>E).

        <title>Ser478 Phosphorylation of TrkB Was Required for BDNF-Stimulated Dendritic Growth</title>
        <p>Given the neural-specific nature of Cdk5, its abundant expression throughout development, and its essential role in the phosphorylation of TrkB at Ser478, we were interested in examining the biological significance of this phosphorylation on the downstream functions of BDNF/TrkB signaling. As a first step, we examined if Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of TrkB affects TrkB activation and downstream signaling cascades. Interestingly, we found that inhibition of Cdk5 activity by Cdk5 selective inhibitor Ros only marginally affected tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkB and initiation of downstream signaling pathways including phosphorylation of Erk1/2, Akt, and CREB (data not shown). Indeed, BDNF-stimulated increase in TrkB tyrosine phosphorylation was weakly affected in <italic>cdk5</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050063-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). Furthermore, activation of Akt and Erk1/2 following BDNF stimulation was also comparable in <italic>cdk5</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>cdk5</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cortical neurons (data not shown). Our observations thus revealed that Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of TrkB did not significantly affect activation of the receptor, nor its initiation and recruitment of downstream signaling pathways.</p>
        <p>Although Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of TrkB had negligible effect on the downstream signaling of TrkB, it cannot be ruled out that Ser478 phosphorylation of TrkB is essential for the downstream functions of BDNF/TrkB signaling. We thus sought to examine if Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of TrkB affects its downstream functions. BDNF has been observed to stimulate dendrite growth and development in hippocampal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b014">14</xref>]. In accordance with earlier observations, BDNF treatment led to a marked increase in the number of primary dendrites in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050063-g005">Figure 5</xref>A), although the length and branching of dendrites were not affected (data not shown). Interestingly, treatment with Cdk5 selective inhibitor Ros almost completely abolished the BDNF-stimulated dendritic growth, without affecting the basal number of dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050063-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). Furthermore, overexpression of dominant negative (DN) Cdk5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050063-g005">Figure 5</xref>B) and transfection with Cdk5 short interfering RNA (siRNA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050063-g005">Figure 5</xref>C) both abrogated BDNF-induced increase in primary dendrites. More importantly, BDNF similarly failed to induce an increase in primary dendrites in <italic>cdk5</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050063-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). These observations collectively reveal that Cdk5 activity was required for BDNF-induced increase in primary dendrites in hippocampal neurons. To verify the importance of Ser478 phosphorylation of TrkB in BDNF-triggered dendritic growth, TrkB wild-type (WT) or TrkB M1 was overexpressed in hippocampal neurons.

        <p>Rho GTPases, including RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, are key regulators of actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Since BDNF stimulation has been observed to activate Rac1 and Cdc42 in neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b015">15</xref>], we were interested to delineate if Rho GTPases contribute to BDNF-stimulated dendritic growth.

We found that while overexpression of WT and DN Rac1 increased the basal number of dendrites in the absence of BDNF treatment, overexpression of both forms of Rac1 abolished BDNF-stimulated dendritic growth. On the other hand, while overexpression of DN RhoA slightly enhanced primary dendrites irrespective of BDNF stimulation, overexpression of both WT and DN forms of RhoA inhibited BDNF-stimulated dendritic growth. Remarkably, in contrast to the inhibition of BDNF-stimulated dendritic growth in cells overexpressing WT Rac1 and RhoA, BDNF stimulation of hippocampal neurons overexpressing WT Cdc42 resulted in an increase in primary dendrites, which was nearly abolished by overexpression of DN Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050063-g006">Figure 6</xref>A).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the current study, we report the identification of TrkB as a novel Cdk5 substrate by providing evidence that Cdk5 phosphorylates TrkB at Ser478, located at the intracellular juxtamembrane region of the receptor. The near absence of Ser478-phosphorylated TrkB in <italic>cdk5</italic><sup>−/−</sup> brain underscores the importance of Cdk5 in this phosphorylation in vivo. More importantly, we found that Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of TrkB is required for BDNF-stimulated increase in primary dendrites. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Cdk5 activity is involved in BDNF-induced increase in Cdc42 activity, which underlies BDNF-induced dendritic growth in hippocampal neurons. Overexpression of CA Cdc42 restored BDNF-stimulated increase in primary dendrites in <italic>cdk5</italic><sup>−/−</sup> neurons, lending further support that Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of TrkB at Ser478 is essential for BDNF-induced Cdc42 activation and increase in primary dendrites. Our findings therefore reveal an unanticipated role of Cdk5 in mediating downstream functions of Trk signaling.</p>
      <p>Activation of Rho GTPases has been implicated in a number of functions downstream of neurotrophin stimulation. For example, a recent study reported that synaptic maturation involves BDNF-stimulated increase in Cdc42 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b016">16</xref>]. In addition, activation of Cdc42 is involved in the regulation of retinal growth cone filopodia by BDNF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b017">17</xref>]. Activation of Rac1 following neurotrophin stimulation has also been observed to mediate neuronal migration triggered by neurotrophin treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b018">18</xref>]. Our observation that BDNF-stimulated increase in Cdc42 activity contributes to the increase in primary dendrites corroborates these studies. It is interesting to note that overexpression of WT and DN Rac1 and RhoA also inhibited BDNF-induced increase in primary dendrites. While it is rather intriguing to observe similar actions by the WT and DN forms of these two Rho GTPases, our observation nonetheless suggests that Rac1 and RhoA may also play a role in BDNF-stimulated dendritic growth. Further studies will be required to delineate their involvements in BDNF-dependent regulation of dendritic development.</p>
      <p>Although different Rho GTPases have been identified as essential downstream mediators of neurotrophin functions, much less is known about the mechanisms by which neurotrophin treatment results in Rho GTPase activation, and how this process is regulated. The activity of Rho GTPases is controlled by a number of factors. Conversion from the GDP-bound, inactive state to the GTP-bound, active state is facilitated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). The activated Rho GTPases then translocate to the plasma membrane, where they activate other downstream effectors such as PAK1 to modulate actin dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b019">19</xref>]. Indeed, neurotrophins have recently been observed to induce Rho GTPase activity through recruitment of a number of GEFs. TrkA was demonstrated to bind to Kalirin, an association that is essential for NGF-induced Rac1 activation and neurite outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b020">20</xref>]. Furthermore, NGF treatment induces plasma membrane translocation of the GEFs Vav2 and Vav3, an event that is required for activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 and the induction of neurite outgrowth following NGF treatment in PC12 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b021">21</xref>]. NGF also stimulates activation of the Rac-specific GEF p-Rex1 in PC12 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b018">18</xref>]. Two recent studies reveal that neurotrophin stimulation in Schwann cells also leads to Rho GTPase activation through activation of GEFs. TrkC activation results in activation of the Cdc42-specific GEF Dbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b022">22</xref>] and Rac-specific GEF Tiam1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b023">23</xref>], both of which are required for NT-3-stimulated Schwann cell migration. Finally, TrkB was also recently demonstrated to bind and phosphorylate Tiam1 to mediate a BDNF-triggered change in cell shape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b024">24</xref>].</p>
      <p>On the other hand, recent studies accentuate the importance of membrane recruitment of Rho GTPase to lipid rafts for the function of these Rho GTPases. Lipid rafts are microdomains in plasma membrane rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids. Targeting of activated Rac1 to lipid rafts is required for activation of downstream effector Pak1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b025">25</xref>]. More importantly, neurotrophin-triggered Rac1 activation and morphological changes in hippocampal neurons have also been observed to require localization of Rac1 to lipid rafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b026">26</xref>]. Finally, BDNF has also been observed to increase Cdc42 activity in cerebellar granule neurons through enhancing calcium influx following the activation of PLCγ and PI3K pathways, a series of events that are essential for BDNF-mediated growth cone turning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b027">27</xref>]. While a number of mechanisms have been postulated to underlie neurotrophin-mediated activation of Rho GTPases, it appears that the mechanisms implicated may vary with different downstream functions of Trk activation and the GEF involved.</p>
      <p>In the current study, we demonstrated that Ser478 phosphorylation of TrkB by Cdk5 is essential for the Cdc42-dependent increase in primary dendrites triggered by BDNF, thus adding a new regulatory component to the mechanisms involved in Rho GTPase activation by neurotrophin. Although the precise downstream pathways by which this phosphorylation affects Cdc42 activation remains to be determined, our observations provide some interesting insights. First of all, while inhibition of Cdk5-mediated TrkB phosphorylation at Ser478 essentially abolished BDNF-induced increase in primary dendrites, it was surprising to observe that Cdk5 activity had a negligible effect on TrkB activation and initiation of downstream signaling pathways. This suggests that Cdk5 activity probably did not affect BDNF-dependent activation of Cdc42 and the induction of primary dendrites through modulating activation of downstream signaling. This is unexpected because BDNF-stimulated increase in primary dendrites was previously observed to depend on PI3K/Akt pathways in cortical neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b028">28</xref>]. Nonetheless, accumulating evidence reveals that the location at which Trk receptors are activated may play a pivotal role in determining the precise downstream significance of Trk activation. For example, BDNF-induced increase in primary dendrites was recently demonstrated to involve TrkB activation in the lipid rafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b013">13</xref>]. In addition, retrograde transport of activated Trk receptors as signaling endosomes is emerging as a key regulator of neuronal survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b029">29</xref>]. Since we examined changes in TrkB downstream signaling cascades only in total lysates, it remains possible that Cdk5 activity may specifically affect TrkB signaling only at certain subcellular/plasma membrane compartments.</p>
      <p>Secondly, overexpression of CA Cdc42 restored BDNF-induced dendritic growth in <italic>cdk5</italic><sup>−/−</sup> neurons and in neurons overexpressing TrkB M1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050063-g006">Figure 6</xref>), suggesting that maintenance of Cdc42 activation was sufficient to overcome the lack of BDNF-stimulated dendritic growth when Cdk5-mediated TrkB phosphorylation was absent. It thus appears that Cdk5 may impair BDNF-induced Cdc42 activation by affecting activation of the Rho GTPase. On the other hand, it should also be noted that overexpression of both the DN and CA forms of Cdc42 had a negligible effect on the basal number of primary dendrites in both <italic>cdk5</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>cdk5</italic><sup>−/−</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050063-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Our observation is in agreement with an earlier study demonstrating that overexpression of DN or CA Cdc42 had no effect on the number of primary dendrites in chick spinal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b030">30</xref>]. In addition, it is consistent with the observation that modulation of Cdk5 activity or overexpression of TrkB M1 affected only BDNF-induced dendritic growth, without affecting the basal number of dendrites. Nonetheless, the inability of CA Cdc42 to mimic BDNF in the induction of primary dendrites suggests that activation of Cdc42 per se was insufficient to trigger dendritic growth in the absence of BDNF, and that additional, BDNF-dependent event(s) are required for the induction of dendritic growth by BDNF. Although the precise pathways implicated remain to be identified, it is tempting, in light of the emerging importance of lipid rafts in the activation of Rho GTPase, to speculate that BDNF may be required to stimulate translocation of activated Cdc42 to lipid rafts. In support of this hypothesis, it was observed that activation of Rac1 depends on the translocation of the activated Rho GTPase to lipid rafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b026">26</xref>]. In addition, in the absence of cholesterol, CA Rac1 failed to translocate to plasma membrane in fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b025">25</xref>]. More importantly, depletion of cholesterol similarly abolished BDNF-induced increase in primary dendrites in hippocampal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b013">13</xref>]. These observations collectively suggest that the inability of CA Cdc42 to increase dendritic growth in the absence of BDNF treatment may be related to the lack of CA Cdc42 translocation to lipid rafts, which may potentially be induced by BDNF treatment. A thorough investigation of the importance of lipid rafts in Cdc42 activation and primary dendrite induction by BDNF will shed light on the mechanisms by which BDNF-triggered dendritic growth is regulated.</p>
      <p>Given the near absence of Ser478-phosphorylated TrkB in <italic>cdk5</italic><sup>−/−</sup> brain, we believe that Cdk5 functions as the predominant kinase for this phosphorylation in vivo. Nonetheless, it was interesting to note that prior to BDNF stimulation, a basal level of Ser478-phosphorylated TrkB was detected in cortical neurons that was not inhibited by pretreatment with the Cdk5 inhibitor Ros. This may suggest that other serine kinases are present to phosphorylate TrkB at Ser478 in the absence of BDNF stimulation. Nonetheless, given the marked inhibition of BDNF-stimulated increase in TrkB phosphorylation by Ros, we believe that Cdk5 is essential for the BDNF-dependent component of TrkB phosphorylation at Ser478.</p>
      <p>Given the abundant expression of Cdk5 and TrkB in neurons throughout development, and their respective concentration at the synapse, it would be interesting to examine if Cdk5 activity is also involved in other downstream functions of TrkB signaling, such as the regulation of neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity. Preliminary findings from our laboratory reveal that Cdk5 activity is also required for BDNF-stimulated neuronal survival in cortical neurons (unpublished data). In addition, the juxtamembrane region of Trk receptors has been associated with the regulation of Trk receptor internalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b031">31</xref>] and degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050063-b032">32</xref>]. Further investigation of whether this phosphorylation also affects the internalization and degradation of the receptor would provide further insights into the biological significance of this phosphorylation. In addition, since Cdk5 was observed to associate with TrkA without phosphorylating the receptor, further delineation of the consequences of this interaction would be essential for thoroughly understanding the crosstalk between Trk receptors and Cdk5. A preliminary study revealed that, similar to TrkB, TrkA phosphorylates Cdk5 at Tyr15 (unpublished data). The differential interaction of TrkA and TrkB with Cdk5, together with the differential localization of TrkA and TrkB in different neuronal populations, may provide a novel mechanism by which Cdk5 can regulate the signaling of different neuronal populations. In conclusion, our findings have provided evidence for a regulatory role of Cdk5 in Trk-induced dendritic growth, and lend support for an emerging role of Cdk5 as a regulator of RTK signaling. Given the importance of neurotrophin/Trk signaling in almost all aspects of neuronal development and function, our findings will likely have far-reaching implications for further elucidating the signaling mechanisms involved in the regulation of neuronal survival, synapse formation, and synaptic plasticity.</p>
