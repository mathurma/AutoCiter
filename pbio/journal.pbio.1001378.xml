      </abstract><abstract>
        <p>Successful execution of the meiotic program depends on the timely establishment and removal of sister chromatid cohesion. LAB-1 has been proposed to act in the latter by preventing the premature removal of the meiosis-specific cohesin REC-8 at metaphase I in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, yet the mechanism and scope of LAB-1 function remained unknown. Here we identify an unexpected earlier role for LAB-1 in promoting the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion in prophase I. LAB-1 and REC-8 are both required for the chromosomal association of the cohesin complex subunit SMC-3. Depletion of <italic>lab-1</italic> results in partial loss of sister chromatid cohesion in <italic>rec-8</italic> and <italic>coh-4 coh-3</italic> mutants and further enhanced chromatid dissociation in worms where all three kleisins are mutated. Moreover, <italic>lab-1</italic> depletion results in increased Aurora B kinase (AIR-2) signals in early prophase I nuclei, coupled with a parallel decrease in signals for the PP1 homolog, GSP-2. Finally, LAB-1 directly interacts with GSP-1 and GSP-2. We propose that LAB-1 targets the PP1 homologs to the chromatin at the onset of meiosis I, thereby antagonizing AIR-2 and cooperating with the cohesin complex to promote sister chromatid association and normal progression of the meiotic program.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>A critical step for achieving successful cell division is the regulation of how the cohesin complexes that bind sister chromatids are initially deposited, then maintained, and finally removed to allow the chromatids to separate into daughter cells. This is particularly challenging during meiosis, when the sister chromatids must remain partially connected to each other through the first division. In organisms that have a single focal centromere on each chromosome, such as mammals and flies, cohesin is protected through the first meiotic division by the protein Shugoshin, which binds the PP2A phosphatase. PP2A counteracts phosphorylation by the Aurora B kinase; if certain cohesins are phosphorylated by Aurora B they become targeted for removal, which allows the chromatids to separate. In the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the chromosomes lack a localized centromere and the predicted Shugoshin homolog is not required for protection of cohesins; instead, this function is executed in metaphase of the first meiotic division by the protein LAB-1. But it is not completely understood what leads to the deposition of cohesin prior to entry into meiosis and to its maintenance throughout early meiosis I. In this study, we show that LAB-1 is also required for the loading and maintenance of the cohesin complex. LAB-1 ensures that the chromatids are not separated prematurely, and thus enables the proper progression of events through prophase I of meiosis. We propose that LAB-1 may act at the onset of meiosis in a manner akin to Shugoshin, by recruiting the PP1 phosphatase to counteract Aurora B kinase, thereby ensuring sister chromatid cohesion.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Timely establishment and subsequent removal of Sister Chromatid Cohesion (SCC) between sister chromatids is necessary to facilitate faithful segregation of chromosomes in mitosis and meiosis. Failure to correctly segregate chromosomes in either mitosis or meiosis has been associated with tumorigenesis, miscarriages, and congenital defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Hassold1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Kops1">[2]</xref>. Premature loss of SCC prevents the correct bipolar attachment of sister kinetochores to the mitotic spindle, whereas a delay in removing SCC may prevent segregation and therefore result in mitotic arrest and aneuploidy (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Nasmyth1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Uhlmann1">[4]</xref>). During meiosis, the control of SCC establishment and removal is even more intricate, and many meiotic processes fail when SCC is compromised. In this specialized cell division program, one cycle of chromosome replication is followed by two consecutive rounds of chromosome segregation, thus reducing the chromosome number by half to produce haploid sperm and oocytes. At the onset of meiosis I, homologous chromosomes pair and undergo synapsis mediated by the formation of a proteinaceous scaffold called the synaptonemal complex (SC). When the SC disassembles, homologs remain attached to each other through chiasmata as a result of earlier crossover recombination events underpinned by flanking SCC. A tight regulation of the establishment of SCC is required for the normal progression of these meiotic events. However, while studies from a number of organisms have revealed key insights into the regulation of SCC removal, far less is known about how the establishment of SCC is regulated.</p>
      <p>Cohesin is a highly conserved multisubunit complex that establishes SCC by binding the newly formed chromatid as it is synthesized. The four core subunits of cohesin are the structural maintenance of chromosomes proteins Smc1 and Smc3, the Scc1/Rad21 kleisin, and the accessory protein Scc3 (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Barbero1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Onn1">[6]</xref>). During meiosis in monocentric organisms such as flies, vertebrates, and yeast, dissolution of chromosome cohesion occurs in a stepwise manner and involves phosphorylation and degradation of Rec8, a meiosis-specific Scc1 paralog. First, cohesin is removed at the chromosome arms during meiosis I, but actively maintained at the pericentromeric regions until anaphase II segregation when the remaining cohesin subset is degraded <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Clyne1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Watanabe1">[9]</xref>. At the end of meiosis I, members of the Shugoshin protein family prevent cohesin removal from the centromeres by recruiting protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which counteracts the phosphorylation of Rec8 by Aurora B Kinase, thereby sparing cohesin from separase-mediated degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Hamant1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Watanabe2">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the holocentric homolog pairs undergo a single crossover event located at the terminal thirds of chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Barnes1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Meneely1">[21]</xref>. Upon chromosome condensation, this off-center crossover leads to the characteristic cruciform shape of the bivalents, which display long and short arms that play an important role for correct alignment on the metaphase I plate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Maddox1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Nabeshima1">[23]</xref>. As in monocentric organisms, cohesin is also removed in a two-step process in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. While REC-8 is lost on the short arm in meiosis I, REC-8 is preserved on the long arm past homolog segregation. This process coincides with the differential loading of the Aurora B Kinase homolog AIR-2, which during diakinesis is observed exclusively on the short arms where it is proposed to phosphorylate REC-8, thus licensing its cleavage by Separase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Kaitna1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Rogers1">[25]</xref>. Recently, two other kleisin homologs, COH-3 and COH-4, were found to also play a part in SCC during <italic>C. elegans</italic> meiosis, but their specific roles and localization are still unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Severson1">[26]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In both mammals and fission yeast two Shugoshin paralogs function in cohesin protection as well as in the spindle assembly checkpoint <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Kitajima2">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Watanabe2">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Kawashima1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Sakuno1">[29]</xref>, yet it was suggested that the latter is the ancestral role of Shugoshin, and that the protection of sister chromatid cohesion evolved as its consequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Kawashima1">[27]</xref>. So far only a single sequence-predicted Shugoshin homolog was identified in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, SGO-1, but neither AIR-2 localization nor sister chromatid association are compromised during meiosis I in <italic>sgo-1</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Rabitsch1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-deCarvalho1">[30]</xref>. Instead, our studies suggested that the worm-specific LAB-1 (Long Arms of the Bivalent) protein participates in protecting REC-8 at the long arms during the metaphase I to anaphase I transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-deCarvalho1">[30]</xref>. LAB-1 progressively forms continuous tracks throughout the full length of chromosomes starting at the onset of meiosis and co-localizes with the synaptonemal complex at pachytene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-deCarvalho1">[30]</xref>. During chromosome remodeling, LAB-1 becomes restricted to the long arms of the bivalents and, like Shugoshin in monocentric species, is finally removed from chromosomes in early anaphase I. <italic>lab-1</italic> hypomorphic mutants show a spreading of AIR-2 signals to both arms of the bivalents, similar to mutants of the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) homolog <italic>gsp-2</italic>. These results are consistent with a model in which LAB-1 impacts sister chromatid cohesion in late meiosis I by regulating cohesin phosphorylation. Based on these and other observations, as well as the lack of evidence for a direct role of Shugoshin in protecting meiotic cohesin in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we have speculated that due to the holocentric nature of <italic>C. elegans</italic> chromosomes, Shugoshin maintained its roles in the spindle attachment checkpoint, but LAB-1 evolved as part of a process to protect cohesin during meiosis in this organism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-deCarvalho1">[30]</xref>. However, both how and when PP1 function is directed and regulated remained open questions.</p>
      <p>Here we describe an earlier and distinct role for LAB-1 in the establishment of SCC via PP1 regulation. Moreover, we demonstrate how failing to properly establish SCC influences various downstream meiotic events. Depletion of <italic>lab-1</italic> by RNAi reduces SCC and consequently impairs homolog pairing, alters the progression of meiotic recombination, and results in an increase in recombination intermediates (MSH-5 and ZHP-3 foci). We found that LAB-1, together with REC-8, is required for proper loading of SMC-3 and consequently for proper SC polymerization, which requires normal axis morphogenesis. While the different cohesin members and LAB-1 show some degree of interdependence with respect to either their initial localization or the subsequent maintenance of their localization on chromosomes, LAB-1 can promote partial SCC even in the absence of all three SCC-1 meiotic paralogs. Finally, underscoring a role in the regulation of phosphorylation, LAB-1 directly interacts with GSP-1 and its paralog GSP-2. Moreover, depletion of <italic>lab-1</italic> results in reduced GSP-2 and increased AIR-2 signals in early meiotic nuclei. We propose that LAB-1 specifically targets PP1 to chromosomes in early meiotic stages to antagonize AIR-2 phosphorylation and to promote sister chromatid cohesion, thus supporting the normal progression of downstream meiotic events.</p>

        <title>LAB-1 Depletion Reduces Pairing and Sister Chromatid Cohesion</title>
        <p>Our analysis of <italic>lab-1(RNAi)</italic> worms revealed the presence of &gt;12 DAPI-stained bodies in 1.1% (<italic>n</italic> = 88) of oocytes at diakinesis, compared to the six DAPI-stained bodies corresponding to the six pairs of attached homologous chromosomes observed in wild type or the 7 to 12 univalents indicative of lack of chiasmata, suggesting instead a defect in sister chromatid cohesion (this study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-deCarvalho1">[30]</xref>). To determine whether this defect results from a role for <italic>lab-1</italic> in early meiosis, we examined the effects of <italic>lab-1</italic> depletion on the various processes that take place earlier during prophase I (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001378.s001">Figure S1</xref>). We first examined homologous chromosome pairing, a process that occurs upon entry into meiosis in most organisms (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Colaiacovo1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Zickler1">[34]</xref>). To follow the progression of pairing in the germline, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with probes labeling the pairing center end of chromosome I. FISH signals either ≤0.75 µM or &gt;0.75 µM apart represent paired and unpaired homologs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001378-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In control gonads, homologous chromosomes are unpaired prior to meiotic entry and therefore only a few nuclei (<italic>n</italic> = 17/81) show a single FISH signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001378-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>, zones 1 and 2). Upon entry into meiotic prophase I (transition zone, which corresponds to the leptotene and zygotene stages; zone 3), the frequency of nuclei carrying a single focus increases (<italic>n</italic> = 52/72), and by pachytene, pairing is completed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001378-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, zones 4–7). In contrast, in <italic>lab-1</italic>-depleted gonads, pairing levels were reduced. Only 52% (<italic>n</italic> = 44/84) of nuclei in the transition zone carried paired homologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001378-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, zones 3), and this was further decreased until only 24% (<italic>n</italic> = 9/37) of nuclei were observed with paired homologs at late pachytene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001378-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, zone 7, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, by the two-sided Fisher's Exact Test, 95% C.I.). Using a probe targeting the X chromosome pairing center revealed similar, albeit milder, results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001378-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Although the reason for a stronger impairment of pairing on the autosomes compared to the X chromosome remains unclear, this has also been observed in other meiotic mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-MartinezPerez1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Smolikov2">[37]</xref>. Thus, depleting <italic>lab-1</italic> reduces homolog pairing, suggesting a previously unknown function for LAB-1 during prophase I.</p>

        <p>In 20% (14/69) of premeiotic nuclei from <italic>lab-1</italic>-depleted gonads, we also noticed the presence of three or four FISH signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001378-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), consistent with a defect in sister chromatid association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001378-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).

Surprisingly, we observed a mean of 9.2 foci per nucleus in <italic>lab-1(RNAi)</italic> pachytene nuclei (<italic>n</italic> = 63, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001 by the two-tailed Mann-Whitney test, 95% C.I), and 4/63 had &gt;12 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001378-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). To verify that these foci represent recombination events, we immunostained both control and <italic>lab-1(RNAi)</italic> gonads with an antibody that recognizes MSH-5, a conserved meiosis-specific protein required for crossover formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Higgins1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Snowden1">[45]</xref>. We found that the pattern of distribution of MSH-5 foci was almost identical to that of ZHP-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001378-g002">Figure 2F</xref>).

Utilizing a similar cytological approach to that in Rosu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Rosu1">[46]</xref> we did not observe any bivalents with two or more chiasmata in diakinesis oocytes from <italic>lab-1</italic>-depleted gonads (<italic>n</italic> = 0/88; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001378.s005">Figure S5</xref>).

        <title>LAB-1 Localization Depends on the Cohesin Complex</title>

        <p>We also examined whether meiosis-specific cohesin subunits were required for LAB-1 localization.

LAB-1 chromosomal localization was delayed in <italic>rec-8(ok978)</italic>, but improved as nuclei proceeded through pachytene, and by late pachytene a mixture of both long and discontinuous tracks of LAB-1 were present throughout chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001378-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, LAB-1 signals were no longer associated with chromosomes in 40% (<italic>n</italic> = 15/37) of −1 oocytes at diakinesis, and instead were distributed diffusely throughout the nuclei of <italic>rec-8</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001378-g003">Figure 3</xref>). This is reminiscent of the early loss of chromosome-associated REC-8 signal observed in the <italic>lab-1</italic> hypomorphs on metaphase I, suggesting some degree of interdependence between these proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-deCarvalho1">[30]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In <italic>coh-4(tm1857) coh-3(gk112)</italic> double mutants, LAB-1 associated with the chromosomes at early pachytene, but failed to form tracks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001378-g003">Figure 3</xref>).

This effect on LAB-1 localization was specific to members of the cohesin family, as we found no change in LAB-1 localization in mutants for either <italic>smc-5</italic>, which is a structural maintenance of chromosomes family member, but not part of the cohesin complex, or <italic>hcp-6</italic>, a gene encoding a member of the condensin II complex, which is structurally similar to cohesin (unpublished data) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Chan1">[50]</xref>.

Prevalent among these were the axial element proteins HIM-3 (56.4%), HTP-1 (43.2% coverage), HTP-2 (38.9% coverage), and HTP-3 (15.8% coverage).

Importantly, HTP-1 is the only other known long arm-specific protein in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and HTP-3 was shown to be critical for meiotic sister chromatid cohesion, as multiple cohesin members fail to load onto chromosomes in <italic>htp-3(y428)</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Severson1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Goodyer1">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-MartinezPerez3">[54]</xref>.</p>
        <p>To assess the functional relevance of this set of interactions we examined the interdependency between the localization of LAB-1 and the HTP proteins.

        <p>If LAB-1 and REC-8 cooperate in SMC-3 loading during meiosis, then lack of both should increase the premature loss of sister chromatid cohesion detected at diakinesis. Indeed, the number of diakinesis oocytes carrying 13–24 DAPI stained bodies is significantly increased in <italic>lab-1(RNAi); rec-8</italic> gonads compared with either <italic>lab-1(RNAi)</italic> or <italic>rec-8</italic> (48%, 1%, and 7%, <italic>n</italic> = 46, 88, and 28, respectively).

This could be explained by either residual LAB-1 that was not depleted or by other factors that contribute to sister chromatid cohesion independently. To examine whether the other two meiotic kleisins contribute to sister chromatid cohesion in parallel with <italic>lab-1</italic>, we looked at the effects of <italic>lab-1</italic> depletion on <italic>coh-4 coh-3</italic> double mutants. 7–12 DAPI stained bodies are observed in the diakinesis oocytes of <italic>coh-4 coh-3</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001378-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Severson1">[26]</xref>), suggesting that sister chromatids are still held together.

        <p>A highly degenerate motif [(R/K) (V/I) X (F/W)] has been previously associated with the binding, localization, and function of PP1 phosphatases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Egloff1">[57]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Zhao1">[59]</xref>. To test if the putative PP1 binding motif present in LAB-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-deCarvalho1">[30]</xref> is required for the in vitro interaction detected between LAB-1 and the PP1 homologs, we used purified LAB-1 protein either lacking the motif (ΔPP1) or carrying two alanine substitutions in this motif (KAIA). GSP-1 and GSP-2 proteins transferred to membranes were still able to bind both mutant LAB-1 proteins, and reciprocally, membrane-bound mutant LAB-1 proteins could bind GSP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001378-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Thus, the putative PP1 binding motif is probably not necessary for LAB-1 binding to GSP-1 and GSP-2.</p>
        <p>To verify the interaction between LAB-1 and the PP1 homologs we utilized the yeast two-hybrid system. Full-length GSP-1 fused to the activation domain of GAL4 interacted with LAB-1 as well as with the LAB-1 PP1 mutants fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001378-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Interestingly, GSP-2 could only weakly interact with the LAB-1 PP1 mutants but not with wild type LAB-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001378-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). It is possible that LAB-1 binding to GSP-2 is masked in yeast cells by the host's endogenous PP1 homologs, and only when these unrelated interactions are removed, LAB-1 and GSP-2 interaction can be detected. Taken together, these results support a direct interaction between LAB-1 and the PP1 homologs.</p>

        <title>LAB-1 Is Required for Sister Chromatid Cohesion</title>
        <p>The dynamic nature of chromosome interactions during the cell cycle requires the ability to establish, mobilize, and remove SCC. Since the discovery of the core components of the cohesin complex, a growing number of proteins have been found to take part in all aspects of cohesin function: proteins involved in loading cohesin, maintaining its binding, and removing it from chromosomes. The importance of SCC is highlighted in meiosis, due to the intricacy and complexity of this process. During prophase I, homologous chromosomes pair, synapse, undergo programmed meiotic DSBs and recombine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Gerton1">[32]</xref>. Thus, while a small reduction in chromatid cohesion may still provide for normal mitotic segregation, it would be unable to support the structural requirements for the meiotic processes to proceed. For example, in the yeast <italic>smc3-42</italic> temperature-sensitive mutant, both SC and crossover formation are perturbed and cells fail to undergo any meiotic division, even in the mitotic permissive temperature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Klein1">[61]</xref>. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, lack or depletion of either cohesin members or their interactors have also been shown to alter pairing, synapsis, DSBR, and accurate chromosome segregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Severson1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Chan2">[55]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Mito1">[62]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Wang1">[64]</xref>. Another level of cohesin control must be employed in meiosis due to the requirement for protection of cohesin at specific chromosomal regions, namely at centromeres in the case of monocentric organisms and along the long arms of the bivalents in the case of the holocentric <italic>C. elegans</italic> chromosomes. Along the long arms, cohesin must be preserved during the first meiotic division, while in all other parts of the chromosomes it must be removed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Onn1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Sakuno1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Rivera1">[65]</xref>. Without this protection, faithful chromatid segregation cannot take place during the second meiotic division. It is therefore not surprising that various different components are involved in regulating SCC. However, how these proteins modulate the way SCC is either enforced or relieved, and how these two processes are coordinated, is not completely understood.</p>
        <p>Most of the factors implicated in SCC depend on the cohesin complex, yet some reports have also suggested cohesin-independent pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Lam1">[66]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Suter1">[68]</xref>. Although LAB-1 can maintain some degree of SCC even in the absence of the meiotic kleisins, most of our data support a cohesin-dependent mechanism. Here we show that LAB-1 and different cohesin members are partially interdependent in their localization throughout prophase I and at metaphase I. The cooperation between LAB-1 and cohesin to ensure SCC can be observed cytologically through the number of DAPI-stained bodies at diakinesis when meiotic kleisins are mutated. Mutations in either <italic>rec</italic>-8 or <italic>coh-4 coh</italic>-3 do not result in precocious sister separation in most nuclei, yet depletion of <italic>lab-1</italic> in those mutants significantly increases the frequency of unbound sister chromatids at diakinesis. These results are consistent with LAB-1 acting to maintain cohesion in cooperation with the cohesin complex. Yet it is possible that LAB-1 can promote SCC in a pathway that does not require the meiotic kleisins, since we observed a significant increase in sister chromatid separation when we depleted <italic>lab-1</italic> in the <italic>rec-8</italic>, <italic>coh-3</italic>, and <italic>coh-4</italic> triple mutant. The factors taking part in this pathway remain to be uncovered. Interestingly, our preliminary analysis did not reveal increased loss of sister chromatid cohesion following <italic>lab-1</italic> depletion in either <italic>scc-1</italic> or <italic>smc-3</italic> depleted backgrounds (Y.B.T. and M.P.C. unpublished results). However, the lack of fully separated chromatids in the <italic>rec-8; coh-4 coh-3</italic> triple mutant could be due to mechanisms involving yet other kleisins and/or the formation of tangles between sister chromatids.</p>
        <p>Yan and colleagues have recently reported the finding of sisters on the loose (SOLO), a protein that together with stromalin on meiosis (snm) is required for centromere cohesion and SMC1 localization during Drosophila male meiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Yan1">[69]</xref>. We suggest that LAB-1 plays a similar role, in that it is required to both appropriately load and maintain the cohesin complexes on specific chromosomal subdomains during pre-meiotic S phase and prophase I, respectively, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, thereby enabling the meiotic program. In this context (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001378.s011">Figure S11</xref>), LAB-1 acts to properly load and maintain the association of cohesin complexes along the chromosome axes. Therefore, the meiotic defects observed in <italic>lab-1(RNAi)</italic> gonads are diagnostic of problems in SCC. First, lack of LAB-1 perturbs homolog paring. In this state, interhomolog repair is impaired, DSBR progression is altered and many nuclei undergo apoptosis. Second, nuclei that are not eliminated by apoptosis contain univalents as well as single chromatids at diakinesis. Finally, in the bivalents where SCC is not lost in early prophase I, reduced LAB-1 on the long arm is ultimately insufficient to prevent unchecked AIR-2 loading on all chromosome axes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-deCarvalho1">[30]</xref>. Upon metaphase I entry, REC-8 removal occurs at both short and long arms and accurate homolog segregation fails (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001378.s011">Figure S11</xref>).</p>
        <p>How does LAB-1 affect SCC? Our finding that LAB-1 and HTP-3 are present in the same complex raises the possibility that LAB-1 acts to maintain SCC via HTP-3-mediated control of cohesin loading <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Severson1">[26]</xref>. Alternatively, HTP-3 may target LAB-1 either directly or indirectly to chromosome axes, and LAB-1 in turn recruits other factors that maintain SCC. The presence of other axial element proteins in LAB-1 immunoprecipitates as well as our finding that LAB-1 directly interacts with the PP1 homologs lead us to favor the latter.</p>
        <p>We found that in the yeast two-hybrid system GSP-2 could only weakly interact with the LAB-1 protein carrying mutations in the putative PP1 binding motif, leading us to hypothesize that GSP-2 is a weaker binding partner of LAB-1 than GSP-1. Weak or transient binding is probably the reason why we did not detect GSP-1 and GSP-2 in our LAB-1 IPs, which were done using stringent conditions. Nevertheless, <italic>lab-1</italic> depletion affected the localization of GSP-2, suggesting that LAB-1 indeed targets GSP-2 to early meiotic nuclei.</p>

        <title>Early Versus Late Roles for LAB-1 During Meiosis I</title>
        <p>LAB-1 localization in the germline is highly dynamic. We propose that at the onset of meiosis, the chromosomal association of LAB-1 opposes cohesin-removing proteins whose levels gradually increase during pachytene. Indeed, AIR-2 signal is only first observed in late pachytene in wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Nabeshima1">[23]</xref>, whereas it accumulates in transition zone nuclei following <italic>lab-1</italic> depletion (this work). Given that AIR-2 promotes cohesin removal during mitotic prophase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Kaitna1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Han1">[70]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Losada1">[74]</xref>, we suggest that a role for LAB-1 is to restrict AIR-2's ability to remove cohesin during early meiosis. According to this model, the system that protects cohesin during metaphase I, and involves LAB-1 antagonizing AIR-2 probably via the PP1s along the long arms of the bivalents, also operates throughout the early stages of meiosis to maintain SCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001378-g007">Figure 7</xref>). This may be achieved by targeting the PP1s to chromosome axes and restricting AIR-2. In late prophase I, LAB-1 is lost from part of the chromosomes, permitting the removal of cohesin at these subdomains.</p>

            <title>LAB-1 utilizes a similar mechanism to protect SCC during two different meiotic stages.</title>
            <p>In wild type, LAB-1 starts associating with the chromosomes at the entry into meiosis and transiently targets GSP-2 to the chromosomes. This targeting antagonizes AIR-2 and maintains SCC. During diakinesis, LAB-1 localizes to the long arms, where it specifically antagonizes AIR-2 and protects REC-8 from premature removal. When <italic>lab-1</italic> is depleted, AIR-2 associates with the chromosomes as early as transition zone, and SCC is perturbed. The weakened SCC prevents successful binding of homologs and many reach diakinesis as either univalents or detached chromatids.</p>

        <p>In this article we show that LAB-1 plays an important role in protecting sister chromatid cohesion by localizing a phosphatase (PP1 by LAB-1 instead of PP2A by Shugoshin) and antagonizing Aurora B phosphorylation activity. Thus, our studies have revealed key conserved principles that guide proper regulation of meiotic sister chromatid cohesion. The use of PP1 to maintain and protect cohesin, while possibly the result of a necessary co-evolution with the holocentric nature of <italic>C. elegans</italic> chromosomes, may also be required for monocentric organisms. Similar to LAB-1, Sgo2 was found to maintain cohesion in mouse bivalents during late prophase I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Lee2">[75]</xref>. This raises the possibility that Shugoshin proteins in other metazoans may also play a role earlier in meiosis in establishing and/or maintaining sister chromatid cohesion. In support of this possibility, it was recently shown that PP2A has early meiotic roles, in addition to its role of protecting centromeric cohesin during metaphase I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001378-Nolt1">[76]</xref>. Therefore, the use of mouse meiotic conditional alleles may aid in assessing the effect of these proteins in early prophase I.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, we have shown that LAB-1 has an earlier role in regulating the establishment and maintenance of SCC. Thus, LAB-1 emerges as a central protein in the regulation of SCC, exerting this role from the start of prophase I through homolog segregation at the metaphase I to anaphase I transition.</p>

Values were normalized by dividing the fluorescence intensity level detected in a rectangular area encompassing each nucleus with the intensity level detected within the same size area of the adjacent cytoplasm.</p>

        <title>Far-Western and Yeast Two-Hybrid Assays</title>
        <p>For far-westerns, 0.8 µg (as determined by Micro BCA protein assay kit, Pierce Biotechnology Rockford, IL) of each protein were resolved on 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were stained with Ponceau S and then washed with PBS. The membranes were then blocked for 1 h in PBSTBM (PBS containing 1% Tween 20, 5% dry milk, and 1% BSA), and incubated overnight with 2 µg/ml of the appropriate binding protein diluted in PBSTBM at 4°C. After four washes with PBSTBM, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at RT with primary antibody diluted 1∶100,000 in PBSTMB for 1 h, washed four times with PBST, and incubated for 1 h with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted 1∶10,000 in PBST. Incubation with an N-terminus HIM-18 antibody was used as a negative control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001378.s012">Figure S12</xref>).</p>

          <p>Depletion of <italic>lab-1</italic> SCC reduction manifests as meiotic defects. We propose that LAB-1 assists in cohesin loading in the pre-meiotic region, and maintenance of the complex during early prophase I, whereas it protects REC-8 from premature removal at the long arms of the bivalents at metaphase I. When <italic>lab-1</italic> is depleted, cohesin is not loaded correctly, potentially creating localized regions with either a lack or reduction of cohesin. The partial dissociation of sister chromatids reduces homologous pairing and impairs the repair of DSBs via interhomolog recombination, possibly due to the lack of a stable homologous template in close proximity. This results in either apoptosis or the use of alternative modes of meiotic DSB repair, such as intersister-based repair. Upon remodeling, the lack of both SCC and interhomolog crossovers leads to the formation of both univalents and single chromatids. Lack of LAB-1 in metaphase I results in the premature removal of REC-8 from the long arms and increased errors in chromosome segregation.</p>
