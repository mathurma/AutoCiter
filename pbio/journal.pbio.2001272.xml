<abstract>
<p>The degradation of small RNAs in plants and animals is associated with small RNA 3′ truncation and 3′ uridylation and thus relies on exonucleases and nucleotidyl transferases. ARGONAUTE (AGO) proteins associate with small RNAs in vivo and are essential for not only the activities but also the stability of small RNAs. AGO1 is the microRNA (miRNA) effector in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and its closest homolog, AGO10, maintains stem cell homeostasis in meristems by sequestration of miR165/6, a conserved miRNA acting through AGO1. Here, we show that SMALL RNA DEGRADING NUCLEASES (SDNs) initiate miRNA degradation by acting on AGO1-bound miRNAs to cause their 3′ truncation, and the truncated species are uridylated and degraded. We report that AGO10 reduces miR165/6 accumulation by enhancing its degradation by SDN1 and SDN2 in vivo. In vitro, AGO10-bound miR165/6 is more susceptible to SDN1-mediated 3′ truncation than AGO1-bound miR165/6. Thus, AGO10 promotes the degradation of miR165/6, which is contrary to the stabilizing effect of AGO1. Our work identifies a class of exonucleases responsible for miRNA 3′ truncation in vivo and uncovers a mechanism of specificity determination in miRNA turnover. This work, together with previous studies on AGO10, suggests that spatially regulated miRNA degradation underlies stem cell maintenance in plants.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 21–24 nucleotide regulatory RNAs that impact nearly all biological processes in plants and animals. The abundance of miRNAs is determined by their biogenesis and degradation. miRNA degradation is associated with trimming and tailing of their 3′ ends. The relationship between 3′ trimming and 3′ tailing as well as the enzyme(s) responsible for 3′ trimming was unknown in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Mechanisms that protect miRNAs from degradation include 3′ terminal methylation and association with ARGONAUTE (AGO) proteins. In this study, we show that two members of the SMALL RNA DEGRADING NUCLEASE (SDN) family, SDN1 and SDN2, are partly responsible for the miRNA 3′ trimming activities in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. We further elucidate the relationship between 3′ trimming and 3′ tailing—miRNAs are first trimmed by SDNs, and the 3′ trimmed-and-unmethylated miRNAs are tailed by the nucleotidyl transferase HESO1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SDN1 is able to act on AGO1-bound and methylated miRNAs. We also reveal a special function of AGO10, which has the highest affinity for miR165/6 in vivo. We show that AGO10-bound miR165/6 is more susceptible to SDN-mediated degradation than AGO1-bound miR165/6. This study provides a general molecular framework for miRNA degradation and an example of specificity determination in miRNA degradation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Arabidopsis ARGONAUTE10</italic> (<italic>AGO10</italic>), also known as <italic>ZWILLE</italic> (<italic>ZLL</italic>) or <italic>PINHEAD</italic> (<italic>PNH</italic>), maintains stem cell homeostasis in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) and floral meristems through repression of miR165/6 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref005">5</xref>]. The conserved miR165/6 family acts through <italic>AGO1</italic> to downregulate the type III homeodomain-leucine zipper genes that are critical for stem cell maintenance, leaf polarity, and vasculature development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref010">10</xref>]. <italic>AGO10</italic> is expressed in the adaxial side of organ primordia and in the provasculature underneath the SAM to maintain stem cells in the SAM in a non-cell autonomous manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref011">11</xref>], whereas miR165/6 is restricted to the abaxial side of organ primordia and excluded from the SAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref007">7</xref>]. As AGO10 binds miR165/6 with higher affinity than AGO1, it was hypothesized that AGO10, which accumulates in a highly restricted manner in the plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref011">11</xref>], sequesters miR165/6 to prevent it from repressing its target genes through the ubiquitously present AGO1 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>AGO10</italic> has also been implicated in repressing the accumulation of miR165/6. In multiple <italic>ago10</italic> loss-of-function mutants, the levels of miR165/6 are moderately increased (to 1.5–2-fold of wild-type levels), as determined by northern blotting with whole seedlings or inflorescences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref005">5</xref>]. Given that <italic>AGO10</italic>-expressing cells constitute only a tiny portion of the tissues used in these studies, the small increase is likely an underestimate for the ability of <italic>AGO10</italic> to repress miR165/6 accumulation. In fact, in situ hybridization revealed that miR165/6, which is normally excluded from the SAM, accumulates in the SAM in <italic>ago10</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref002">2</xref>], suggesting that AGO10 not only sequesters miR165/6 but also represses its accumulation. The impact of AGO10 on miR165/6 contrasts the positive effects of AGO1 on the accumulation of microRNAs (miRNAs), including miR165/6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref013">13</xref>]. The mechanism by which AGO10 reduces the levels of miR165/166 is currently unknown.</p>
<p>The steady-state levels of miRNAs are determined by the balance between biogenesis and degradation. miRNA biogenesis is a multistep process. After the transcription of <italic>MIR</italic> genes into pri-miRNAs, DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1) processes pri-miRNAs into pre-miRNAs and pre-miRNAs into the miRNA/miRNA* duplexes. The duplexes are methylated by HEN1, and the miRNA strand is loaded into AGO1, the major miRNA effector, to form the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC; reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref014">14</xref>]).</p>
<p>The mechanisms of miRNA degradation are not well understood. Degradation intermediates are hard to detect in the wild-type background, but they are readily detectable in <italic>hen1</italic> mutants, in which miRNAs and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in plants and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in animals lose 2′-<italic>O</italic>-methylation on the 3′ terminal ribose and are more susceptible to degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref025">25</xref>]. Studies of the consequences of loss of methylation in both plant and animal <italic>hen1</italic> mutants revealed two molecular processes associated with small RNA degradation, namely 3′ truncation and 3′ uridylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref022">22</xref>]. The enzyme that causes miRNA 3′ truncation is presumably an exonuclease, but its nature is as yet unknown in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Two nucleotidyl transferases, HESO1 and URT1, play a major and minor role, respectively, in miRNA uridylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref029">29</xref>]. Both enzymes are able to uridylate AGO1-bound, unmethylated miRNAs in vitro, and they act in a partially redundant and synergistic manner to uridylate unmethylated miRNAs in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref029">29</xref>]. The sequence of events in miRNA degradation (truncation followed by tailing or tailing followed by truncation) is unknown.</p>
<p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the SMALL RNA DEGRADING NUCLEASE (SDN) family of 3′ to 5′ exonucleases consisting of five family members degrades short RNAs in vitro and limits the accumulation of miRNAs in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref030">30</xref>]. Prior in vitro enzymatic assays with SDN1 were performed with free RNA oligonucleotides as substrates, and, in these assays, SDN1 was able to reduce the size of its substrate RNA to a uniform and very small size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref030">30</xref>]. This is apparently inconsistent with SDN1 being responsible for the observed miRNA 3′ truncation activity in vivo, as the truncated species lack a small and varying number of nucleotides from the 3′ end. However, in vivo, miRNAs are associated with, and protected by, AGO1; it is possible that the observed varying degree of 3′ truncation is due to the balance between protection by AGO1 and exonucleolytic degradation by SDN1. It is unknown whether SDN1 is able to act on AGO1-bound miRNAs and, if so, whether the interplay between AGO1 and SDN1 leads to the truncation of a varying number of nucleotides. The answer to this question is critical in understanding how miRNAs are degraded in vivo, as SDN1 can act on methylated miRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref030">30</xref>] whereas HESO1 and URT1 cannot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref029">29</xref>], which makes SDN proteins the prime candidates in initiating the degradation of methylated miRNAs in vivo.</p>
<p>In this study, we show that SDN1 and SDN2 are responsible for the 3′ truncation of a subset of miRNAs in the <italic>hen1</italic> background and miR165/6 species in the wild-type background, thereby revealing an enzyme associated with the 3′ truncation process in vivo. We show that 3′ truncated miRNAs are further tailed by HESO1 to lead to their degradation, thus clarifying the relationship between the two miRNA degradation processes. Furthermore, we show that, in vitro, SDN1 acts on AGO1-bound, methylated miRNAs to produce 3′ truncated miRNAs of varying sizes, similar to those observed in vivo. These findings provide a molecular framework of miRNA degradation that acts on many miRNAs. Furthermore, we show that AGO10 promotes the degradation of its associated miR165/6 in vivo, and this effect requires SDNs. AGO10-bound miR165/6 is more susceptible to SDN1-mediated 3′ truncation than AGO1-bound miR165/6 in vitro. This study reveals an unexpected activity of an AGO protein, uncovers a mechanism of specificity determination in miRNA turnover, and implicates the importance of regulated miRNA degradation in stem cell maintenance.</p>

<title>SDN1 and SDN2 are responsible for the 3′ truncation of some miRNAs in vivo</title>
<p>In wild type, 3′ truncated miRNA species are rare, presumably because they are rapidly degraded. Thus, to determine whether SDNs are responsible for miRNA 3′ truncation, we resorted to a <italic>hen1</italic> mutant, in which the lack of 3′ terminal 2′-<italic>O</italic>-methylation of miRNAs is associated with rampant miRNA 3′ truncation and 3′ uridylation. Truncated and/or tailed species of miRNAs are readily detectable by northern blotting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref025">25</xref>] and quantifiable by small RNA high throughput sequencing (sRNA-seq) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref029">29</xref>]. To ascertain whether SDNs are responsible for the production of 3′ truncated miRNA species in vivo, we generated the <italic>hen1-8 sdn1-1 sdn2-1</italic> triple mutant (hereafter referred to as <italic>hen1 sdn1 sdn2</italic>) and compared its miRNA profiles with those of the <italic>hen1-8</italic> single mutant by sRNA-seq. To determine the sequence of events (3′ truncation versus 3′ tailing), we also examined published sRNA-seq data from <italic>hen1-8</italic> and <italic>hen1-8 heso1-1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref029">29</xref>]. Reads corresponding to each miRNA were classified into the full-length (FL), 3′ truncated-only (TR-only), 3′ tailed-only (TA-only), and 3′ truncated-and-tailed (TR+TA) categories and quantified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref029">29</xref>]. For both pairs of genotypes, two biological replicates were performed or analyzed. To be consistent, we present the 23 most abundant miRNAs (reads per million (RPM) &gt; 10) across all eight libraries.</p>
<p>We compared the levels of TR-only and TR+TA species in <italic>hen1 sdn1 sdn2</italic> and <italic>hen1</italic> as these species represented the miRNA 3′ truncation activity. Nine out of the 23 miRNAs showed a significant reduction in the levels of either TR+TA or TR-only species in <italic>hen1 sdn1 sdn2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s010">S2 Data</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). In addition, one miRNA (miR167ab) showed a significant reduction in TR+TA+TR-only species, although the reduction in either TR+TA or TR-only species was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Thus, ten of the 23 miRNAs showed reduced 3′ truncation. Many miRNAs also showed reduced 3′ truncation in both biological replicates but did not pass the <italic>p</italic>-value cutoff (&lt;0.05), while few miRNAs showed increased 3′ truncation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s010">S2 Data</xref>). This indicates that <italic>SDN1</italic> and <italic>SDN2</italic> are responsible for the production of 3′ truncated species in vivo from at least some miRNAs. Functional redundancy with the remaining family members could be responsible for the lack of an observable effect on the 3′ truncation of other miRNAs. Alternatively, non-SDN exonucleases also cause miRNA 3′ truncation.</p>

<p>Having shown that SDN1 and SDN2 cause the 3′ truncation of some miRNAs, we next sought to determine which occurred first, truncation by SDN1/2 or tailing by HESO1. Either is theoretically possible—SDN1 truncates miRNAs and HESO1 uridylates truncated miRNAs, or HESO1 uridylates miRNAs and SDN1 acts on uridylated miRNAs to cause their 3′ truncation. In the <italic>hen1 heso1</italic> double mutant, the levels of TR+TA species for many of the 23 miRNAs were reduced, and those of TR-only species were increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g001">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s011">S3 Data</xref>). Therefore, HESO1 tailed the TR-only species to generate the TR+TA species. In particular, for the ten miRNAs with a significant reduction in 3′ truncation in <italic>hen1 sdn1 sdn2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), nine showed a significant increase in TR-only species in <italic>hen1 heso1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). These data indicate that 3′ truncated species generated by SDNs are further uridylated by HESO1 for degradation.</p>
<p>miR165/6 species were drastically affected in <italic>hen1 sdn1 sdn2</italic> relative to <italic>hen1</italic>. The proportion of FL species of miR165 and miR166 was much higher in <italic>hen1 sdn1 sdn2</italic> than in <italic>hen1</italic>, while those of TR-only or TR+TA species were much reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The proportion of TA-only species was either unaffected (miR166) or affected to a smaller extent (miR165; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). This demonstrated a role of SDN1 and SDN2 in the production of 3′ truncated species of miR165/6 in the <italic>hen1</italic> background. In the wild-type background, the proportions of TR-only, TR+TA, and TA-only miR165/6 species were much lower than those in the <italic>hen1</italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). Nevertheless, a reduction in the proportions of TR+TA species was observed in <italic>sdn1 sdn2</italic> relative to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Therefore, SDN1 and SDN2 are responsible for the 3′ truncation of miR165/6 in vivo in both <italic>hen1</italic> and wild-type backgrounds. In <italic>hen1 heso1</italic>, the reduction in TR+TA miR165 or miR166 species is accompanied by an increase in TR-only species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g001">Fig 1E</xref>), indicating that HESO1 tails 3′ truncated miR165/6 species generated by SDN1/2.</p>

<title>SDN1 acts on AGO1-bound, methylated miRNAs in vitro</title>
<p>Given the results above, an appealing model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s002">S2 Fig</xref>, right panel) of miRNA degradation is that methylated, FL miRNAs are first truncated by SDN1/2, which results in 3′ truncated miRNAs that lack 3′ terminal methylation. These 3′ truncated species are then tailed by HESO1 and URT1 to cause their complete degradation. One important question related to this model is whether SDN1/2 can act on AGO1-bound miRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s002">S2 Fig</xref>, left panel), as mature miRNAs are associated with AGO1 in vivo. HESO1 and URT1 are able to uridylate AGO1-bound, unmethylated miRNAs in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref029">29</xref>], but previous biochemical assays with SDN1 were only conducted with free RNA oligonucleotides as substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref030">30</xref>]. Intriguingly, although SDN1 degrades RNA substrates to a uniform and very small size in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref030">30</xref>], the 3′ truncated species that depended on SDN1/2 for accumulation in vivo had a small and varying number of nucleotides truncated from the 3′ ends (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). One possibility is that SDN1 cannot completely degrade AGO1-bound miRNAs but, instead, only cause their 3′ truncation.</p>
<p>To test this, we conducted SDN1 assays with AGO1 immunoprecipates (IPs; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s003">S3A Fig</xref>) as the substrate under enzyme excess conditions. miR165/6 was detected by northern blotting before and after the reactions. While SDN1 was able to nearly completely degrade a free RNA oligonucleotide, it was largely ineffective in degrading miR165/6 in AGO1 IP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). Thus, AGO1 protects miR165/6 from being degraded by SDN1 in vitro. However, we noticed that upon extended incubation (&gt;2 hr), weak signals representing shorter miR165/6 species were detectable in the AGO1 IP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s003">S3B Fig</xref>), suggesting that SDN1 caused miR165/6 3′ truncation at a low level. As northern blotting was not a sensitive method to detect such 3′ truncated species, we performed sRNA-seq to determine whether SDN1 caused 3′ truncation of AGO1-bound miR165/6 and other miRNAs. AGO1 IP was used as the substrate in assays with a mock (no enzyme) control, SDN1, and a catalytic mutant (SDN1<sup>D283A</sup>) control for 1 hr. After the reactions, AGO1 was precipitated again, and the associated small RNAs were subjected to high throughput sequencing. Two biological replicates yielded highly similar results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s004">S4 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s012">S4 Data</xref>). For the quantification of miRNA 3′ truncation, the 3′ truncated species present in the mock reactions were subtracted from those in the SDN1 or SDN1<sup>D283A</sup> reactions. We analyzed the 3′ truncation status of all abundant miRNAs (RPM &gt; 10 in all six samples). Fifteen of 43 abundant miRNAs exhibited higher levels of 3′ truncation in the SDN1 reactions as compared to the SDN1<sup>D283A</sup> reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Several conclusions can be drawn from this in vitro study. First, SDN1 can act on AGO1-bound miRNAs, and, unlike its activities on free RNAs, it generates heterogeneous, 3′ truncated species from AGO1-bound miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), consistent with the 3′ truncation observed in <italic>hen1</italic> mutants in vivo. Second, miRNAs in AGO1 IP should be methylated. Thus, SDN1 can act on methylated, AGO1-bound miRNAs, consistent with its ability to degrade methylated RNA oligonucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref030">30</xref>]. Third, SDN1 was ineffective against many AGO1-bound miRNAs in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), suggesting that other factors assist SDN1 in miRNA 3′ truncation in vivo or that other exonucleases also cause miRNA 3′ truncation in vivo.</p>

We examined whether the increase in miR165/6 accumulation in these mutants could be attributed to enhanced miR165/6 biogenesis. miR165/6 is encoded by two <italic>MIR165</italic> and seven <italic>MIR166</italic> loci. We designed primers that allowed the detection of the sum of pri- and pre-miRNA species from each of the nine loci. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed to determine whether pri/pre-miR165/6 species from all nine loci were present in young seedlings in wild type. While PCR, using genomic DNA as the template, produced a specific band at each locus, RT-PCR produced a band at all nine loci except for <italic>MIR166g</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). The finding that eight <italic>MIR165/6</italic> genes were expressed in young, wild-type seedlings was in agreement with findings from analyses of promoter activities of <italic>MIR165/6</italic> genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref031">31</xref>]. We performed real-time RT-PCR in wild-type, <italic>pnh-2</italic>, and <italic>ago10-13</italic> seedlings for these eight loci.

<p><italic>AGO10</italic> is expressed in a highly restricted manner in meristems and developing organ primordia, and the expression domains of <italic>AGO10</italic> and miR165/6 are largely exclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref011">11</xref>].

To test this hypothesis, we introduced <italic>YFP-AGO10</italic>, driven by the strong and constitutive Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S promoter into wild-type plants. Among independent T1 transgenic lines, most exhibited phenotypic alterations similar to what was previously observed to be associated with <italic>AGO10</italic> overexpression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref032">32</xref>]. The phenotypes were classified into the Weak, Moderate, and Strong categories (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.2001272.t001">Table 1</xref>). Plants in the different categories were largely similar in size to wild-type plants, but they differed from wild type and from each other in the degrees of leaf hyponasty (upward curling) and serration, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g004">Fig 4A</xref>. We focused on an <italic>AGO10</italic> overexpression (<italic>AGO10 OE</italic>) line in the Strong category (referred to as <italic>AGO10 OE S1</italic>) for subsequent analyses. <italic>AGO10</italic> mRNA levels were much higher in this line than in wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s005">S5A Fig</xref>). A large reduction in miR165/6 levels was observed in <italic>AGO10 OE S1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Levels of pri/pre-miR165/6 from the eight genes with detectable expression in seedlings were unaffected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s005">S5B Fig</xref>). The levels of pre-miR166a were also unaffected by <italic>AGO10</italic> overexpression in two independent transgenic lines (one in the wild-type background [<italic>AGO10 OE S1</italic>] and the other in <italic>pnh-2</italic>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s005">S5C Fig</xref>).

<p>Among the six miRNAs examined by northern blotting in <italic>AGO10 OE S1</italic>, miR173 was found to also accumulate at a lower level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). This raised the possibility that the reduced abundance of miR165/6 and miR173 in <italic>AGO10 OE S1</italic> was due to reduced <italic>AGO1</italic> expression, as previous studies demonstrated the association between miR168 and AGO10 and implicated <italic>AGO10</italic> in the repression of <italic>AGO1</italic> expression at the posttranscriptional level through miR168 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref033">33</xref>]. Real-time RT-PCR showed that the levels of <italic>AGO1</italic> mRNA were reduced by about 20% in <italic>AGO10 OE S1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s005">S5A Fig</xref>). AGO1 protein levels were reduced by about 50% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s005">S5D Fig</xref>). To evaluate whether <italic>AGO10</italic> overexpression indirectly repressed the accumulation of miR165/6 and miR173 through inhibition of <italic>AGO1</italic> expression, we introduced <italic>4mAGO1</italic>, which renders <italic>AGO1</italic> resistant to miR168 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref013">13</xref>], into <italic>AGO10 OE S1</italic>. Transgenic lines were screened by RT-PCR to obtain one in which <italic>AGO10</italic> mRNA levels were comparable to those of <italic>AGO10 OE S1</italic>, but <italic>AGO1</italic> expression was elevated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s005">S5E Fig</xref>). AGO1 protein levels were also elevated in <italic>AGO10 OE 4mAGO1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s005">S5F Fig</xref>). Elevated <italic>AGO1</italic> expression in <italic>AGO10 OE 4mAGO1</italic> failed to rescue the levels of miR165/6 or miR173 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Note that miR168 levels were comparable in wild type and <italic>AGO10 OE S1</italic> and elevated in <italic>AGO10 OE 4mAGO1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>), consistent with the previous observation that miR168 accumulation is tightly buffered by AGO1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref034">34</xref>]. In conclusion, although <italic>AGO10</italic> overexpression led to reduced <italic>AGO1</italic> expression, the reduced accumulation of miR165/6 and miR173 was not attributable to lower <italic>AGO1</italic> expression.</p>
<p>We evaluated whether there were any dosage effects of <italic>AGO10</italic> overexpression on miR165/6 levels. We chose another four independent lines of <italic>AGO10 OE</italic> based on the severity of the morphological phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Lines S2, M1 and M2, and W1 were from the Strong, Moderate, and Weak categories, respectively. The levels of <italic>AGO10</italic> mRNA in these lines were concordant with the severity of morphological defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). We conducted sRNA-seq for wild type and the four <italic>AGO10 OE</italic> lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s013">S5 Data</xref>). The abundance of miR165 and miR166 was reduced in all four lines and was largely anticorrelated with the levels of <italic>AGO10</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g004">Fig 4E</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>AGO10</italic> overexpression results in increased 3′ truncation of miR165/6</title>
<p>As <italic>AGO10</italic> loss-of-function and overexpression led to higher and lower levels of miR165/6, respectively, without affecting miR165/6 biogenesis, we hypothesized that <italic>AGO10</italic> promotes miR165/6 degradation. As miRNA degradation is manifested by the presence of 3′ truncated and/or 3′ tailed intermediates, we examined the status of miRNA 3′ truncation and tailing in wild type and <italic>AGO10 OE S1</italic> with sRNA-seq (three biological replicates). The proportion of FL miR165/6 reads was significantly reduced in <italic>AGO10 OE S1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s006">S6 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s014">S6 Data</xref>). Species of miR165/166 showing 3′ truncation, including both TR-only and TR+TA forms, were increased in <italic>AGO10 OE</italic> relative to wild type, suggesting that <italic>AGO10</italic> overexpression enhanced the 3′-to-5′ truncation of miR165/6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s006">S6 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s014">S6 Data</xref>). Of the TA-only species, only miR165 was modestly increased in abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g005">Fig 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s014">S6 Data</xref>). This suggested that 3′ truncation, but not 3′ tailing, was the primary event in miR165/6 degradation induced by <italic>AGO10 OE</italic>. To examine whether the enhanced degradation of miR165/6 in <italic>AGO10 OE</italic> was due to reduced <italic>AGO1</italic> expression, we also sequenced small RNAs from <italic>AGO10 OE 4mAGO1</italic> plants. The 3′ truncation of miR165/6 induced by <italic>AGO10</italic> overexpression was not rescued by <italic>4mAGO1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s006">S6 Fig</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s015">S7 Data</xref>).

<p>To obtain a global picture of the miRNAs associated with AGO1 and AGO10 in <italic>AGO10 OE S1</italic>, we performed sRNA-seq from AGO1 and AGO10 IPs. Three biological replicates were performed for AGO1 and AGO10 IP from <italic>AGO10 OE S1</italic>. The binding of AGO1 (or AGO10) to a miRNA was quantified by the percentage of reads corresponding to this miRNA in total reads for all annotated miRNAs identified within the small RNA library from the AGO1 (or AGO10) IPs. Results showed that the overall profiles of miRNAs associated with AGO1 or AGO10 in <italic>AGO10 OE</italic> <italic>S1</italic> resembled those in wild type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref005">5</xref>]. AGO1 associated with most miRNAs while AGO10 preferentially associated with miR165/6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g006">Fig 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s016">S8 Data</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine whether <italic>AGO10</italic> overexpression caused a further sequestration of miR165/6 from AGO1, AGO1 IP was performed with wild type and <italic>AGO10 OE S1</italic> with one biological replicate. Consistent with the northern blot results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), reads for AGO1-associated miR165/6 were substantially reduced in <italic>AGO10 OE S1</italic> as compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g006">Fig 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s017">S9 Data</xref>). The northern blotting and sRNA-seq results demonstrated that elevated AGO10 levels allowed AGO10 to compete more effectively with AGO1 for binding to miR165/6. The only other miRNA that showed a similar effect was miR173 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g006">Fig 6D</xref>).</p>
<p>We next examined whether there was any dosage effect of <italic>AGO10</italic> overexpression on the sequestration of miRNAs from AGO1.

Indeed, there was an AGO10 dosage-dependent reduction of miR165/6 levels in AGO1 IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). A similar dosage effect was found for miR173 but not for other miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g006">Fig 6F</xref>).</p>

<title>AGO10 RISCs contain higher levels of 3′ truncated miRNAs than AGO1 RISCs</title>
<p>Mechanistically, the enhanced degradation of miR165/6 by AGO10 could happen under several scenarios. First, 3′ truncation may happen more easily when miR165/6 is bound by AGO10 than when it is bound by AGO1. Second, miR165/6 is dislodged faster from the AGO10 RISC than from the AGO1 RISC, and the degradation happens after miR165/6 is released from RISC. A third (and hybrid) model is that the initial 3′ truncation occurs on AGO10 RISC and triggers the dissociation of miR165/6 from AGO10. In the first and the third model, we would expect the AGO10 RISC to contain more 3′ truncated miR165/6 than the AGO1 RISC. Under the second scenario, AGO1 and AGO10 RISCs are not expected to differ in terms of their association with 3′ truncated species. We examined the status of 3′ tailing and 3′ truncation of miRNAs that were present in AGO1 and AGO10 IPs from <italic>AGO10 OE S1</italic> (sRNA-seq in three biological replicates). We found that the most abundant species of miR165/6 in both AGO1 and AGO10 RISCs were the FL miRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g007">Fig 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s016">S8 Data</xref>). However, the AGO10 IP showed a statistically significant increase in the TR-only miR166 species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). An increase in the TR-only miR165 species was also found in AGO10 IP, although the increase did not pass the <italic>p</italic>-value cutoff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). These data were consistent with the first or the hybrid model and suggested that 3′ truncation occurred, at least initially, on AGO10-associated miR165/6.</p>

Only one miRNA (miR403) showed a significant reduction in 3′ TR-only species in AGO10 IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). This implies that AGO10 RISCs with many different resident miRNAs are more susceptible to miRNA 3′ truncation in vivo.

<title>AGO10-bound miR165/6 species are more susceptible to SDN1-mediated 3′ truncation in vitro</title>
<p>To biochemically test whether AGO10 renders miR165/6 more susceptible to 3′ truncation, we conducted SDN1 assays in vitro. An <italic>ago10-3 His-Flag-AGO10</italic> line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref005">5</xref>] was used to immunoprecipitate AGO10 with anti-Flag antibodies and AGO1 with anti-AGO1 antibodies. Both IPs were successful as shown by western blotting to detect AGO1 and AGO10 as well as northern blotting to detect miR165/6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s003">S3A and S3C Fig</xref>). Like for AGO1 IP, SDN1 was unable to degrade miR165/6 in AGO10 IP, as shown by northern blotting to detect miR165/6 before and after incubation with SDN1 under enzyme excess conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). The lack of a large amount of AGO10 IP precluded the detection of miR165/6 3′ truncation by northern blotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). We resorted to sRNA-seq to compare the degree of SDN1-mediated truncation of miR165/6 in AGO1 IP and AGO10 IP. The AGO1 IP and AGO10 IP were incubated with buffer alone (mock), SDN1, or SDN1<sup>D283A</sup>. After the reactions, the AGOs were precipitated, and small RNAs were isolated and subjected to high throughput sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s012">S4 Data</xref>). Two biological replicates gave reproducible results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Among 13 miRNAs present at &gt;10 RPM in AGO10 IP (in all six samples of mock, SDN1, and SDN1<sup>D283A</sup>), five species, including miR165/6, showed 3′ truncation by SDN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). The AGO10 IP showed more pronounced miR165/6 3′ truncation than AGO1 IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>), indicating that AGO10 rendered miR165/6 more susceptible to 3′ truncation by SDN1 than AGO1.</p>

<title>AGO10-induced 3′ truncation of miR165/6 in vivo requires <italic>SDN1</italic> and <italic>SDN2</italic></title>
<p>SDN1 and SDN2 mediate the 3′ truncation of some miRNAs including miR165/6 in the <italic>hen1</italic> background and the 3′ truncation of miR165/6 in <italic>HEN1</italic> backgrounds. This, together with the finding that SDN1 trimmed AGO10-bound miR165/6 in vitro, prompted us to test whether the increase in miR165/6 3′ truncation in <italic>AGO10 OE</italic> was mediated by SDNs. We generated a large population of primary transformants of <italic>35S</italic>::<italic>YFP-AGO10</italic> in <italic>sdn1-1 sdn2-1</italic> (hereafter referred to as <italic>sdn1 sdn2</italic>) and Col (wild type) backgrounds, identified lines that had comparable levels of <italic>AGO10</italic> expression in the two genotypes, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g008">Fig 8A</xref>) and performed sRNA-seq. Sequencing small RNAs from seedlings of one pair of lines (<italic>AGO10 OE</italic> and <italic>sdn1 sdn2 AGO10 OE</italic>) or inflorescences of another independent pair showed that increased 3′ truncation of miR165/6 in <italic>AGO10 OE</italic> was largely suppressed by <italic>sdn1 sdn2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g008">Fig 8B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s007">S7 Fig</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s019">S11 Data</xref>). Therefore, <italic>AGO10</italic> overexpression triggered SDN-dependent 3′ truncation of miR165/6.

<title>A model of miRNA degradation in vivo</title>
<p>Universal small RNA decay processes in plants and metazoans appear to include 3′-to-5′ truncation and 3′ uridylation. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the nucleotidyl transferases HESO1 and URT1 are responsible for miRNA uridylation when miRNAs lack 2′-<italic>O</italic>-methylation, but the enzymes responsible for miRNA 3′ truncation were unknown, and the relationship between 3′ truncation and 3′ tailing was also unknown. In this study, we provided genetic evidence documenting a role of SDN1 and SDN2 in miRNA 3′ truncation in vivo. In a <italic>hen1</italic> background, loss of function in <italic>SDN1</italic> and <italic>SDN2</italic> resulted in a reduction in miRNA 3′ truncation for some miRNAs. The lack of an effect on other miRNAs could be due to the presence of other <italic>SDN</italic> paralogs or other exonucleases. In addition, we observed that, in the <italic>hen1 heso1</italic> background, 3′ truncated miRNAs accumulate at much higher levels than in the <italic>hen1</italic> background. This supports the model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001272.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) that miRNA degradation is initiated by SDN-mediated 3′ truncation and followed by the uridylation of truncated species, which are further degraded by as yet unknown nucleases. Therefore, these genetic studies not only establish SDNs as one class of enzymes that causes miRNA 3′ truncation but also elucidate the relationship between miRNA 3′ truncation and 3′ tailing in miRNA turnover.</p>
<p>While the observations discussed above were made in the <italic>hen1</italic> background, genetic evidence also supports a role of SDN1 and SDN2 in miRNA 3′ truncation in the wild-type background. In the wild-type background, loss of function in <italic>SDN1</italic> and <italic>SDN2</italic> resulted in a reduction in the levels of TR-only and TR+TA miR165/6. In <italic>AGO10 OE</italic> plants, loss of function in <italic>SDN1</italic> and <italic>SDN2</italic> reduced the levels of 3′ truncated miR165/6 and partially rescued the developmental abnormalities. These observations were especially important, as they suggest that SDN1 and SDN2 cause the 3′ trimming of miR165/6 when it is methylated (as miRNAs are nearly completely methylated in <italic>HEN1</italic> backgrounds).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we provided biochemical evidence showing that SDN1 acts on AGO1-bound and methylated miRNAs in vitro. In fact, SDN1 had different effects on free and AGO1-bound miRNAs—it nearly completely degrades free miRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref030">30</xref>] but causes the truncation of a small and varying number of nucleotides from AGO1-bound miRNAs (this study). The 3′ truncated, AGO1-bound miRNAs caused by SDN1 in vitro mimic the 3′ truncated species in <italic>hen1</italic> mutants in vivo. This indicates that the 3′ trimmed miRNA species that accumulate in vivo result from the balancing act between AGO1-mediated protection and SDN1-mediated truncation.</p>
<p>In summary, these genetic and biochemical observations support the following model of miRNA degradation. SDNs initiate miRNA degradation in wild type by 3′ truncation of AGO1-bound and methylated miRNAs to result in AGO1-bound, 3′ truncated-and-unmethylated miRNAs, which are uridylated by HESO1 and/or URT1. The AGO1-bound, truncated-and-uridylated miRNAs are further degraded by an as yet unknown enzyme. However, we acknowledge that SDNs may not be the only exonucleases causing miRNA 3′ truncation. In addition, miRNA degradation may also entail mechanisms other than 3′ truncation and 3′ tailing.</p>

<title>AGO10 destabilizes its associated miR165/6</title>
<p>In addition to establishing a model of miRNA degradation, the study also uncovered an unexpected function of an AGO protein in destabilizing miR165/6. In vivo, <italic>AGO10</italic> overexpression caused further sequestration of miR165/6 from AGO1, enhanced its 3′ truncation through SDN1/2, and reduced its accumulation. In vitro, AGO10-bound miR165/6 species were more susceptible to SDN1-mediated 3′ truncation than AGO1-bound miR165/6. The 3′ truncation of an AGO-bound miRNA should entail the displacement of the miRNA 3′ end from the binding pocket in the Piwi/Argonaute/Zwille domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref035">35</xref>]. Perhaps the 3′ end of miR165/6 is more accessible in an AGO10 RISC than in an AGO1 RISC. It is not known whether AGO10 confers 3′ end accessibility to its resident miRNAs in general. One observation consistent with this notion is that many miRNAs have higher levels of 3′ truncation in AGO10 IP than in AGO1 IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). However, <italic>AGO10</italic> overexpression did not affect the abundance of most miRNAs. This is probably because most miRNAs are still bound by AGO1 despite <italic>AGO10</italic> overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g006">Fig 6B</xref>).</p>
<p>Another miRNA that is reduced in abundance by <italic>AGO10</italic> overexpression is miR173 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). <italic>AGO10</italic> overexpression caused a depletion of miR173 from AGO1 RISC relative to other miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g006">Fig 6D</xref>) but not relative to AGO1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Thus, the reduced abundance of miR173 by <italic>AGO10</italic> overexpression was perhaps attributable to the lower levels of AGO1. However, increasing AGO1 levels in <italic>AGO10 OE S1</italic> could not restore miR173 accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001272.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Intriguingly, miR173 happens to be the second most preferred miRNA by AGO10 for binding in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref005">5</xref>]. Therefore, it is likely that <italic>AGO10</italic> overexpression allowed AGO10 to better compete with AGO1 for binding to miR173 and lead to its degradation.</p>
<p>This study, together with previous studies demonstrating the importance of <italic>AGO10</italic>-mediated repression of miR165/6 in meristem homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref005">5</xref>], provides an example of active miRNA degradation being employed as a mechanism to regulate stem cells in development. In developing seedlings, the spatial pattern of AGO10 protein accumulation is complementary to that of miR165/6. We propose that <italic>AGO10</italic> enhances the degradation of miR165/6 to help restrict this miRNA to cells not expressing <italic>AGO10</italic>. The clearance of miR165/6 from the SAM by <italic>AGO10</italic> is crucial for stem cell maintenance, as <italic>ago10</italic> mutants accumulate ectopic miR165/6 in the SAM and fail to maintain the stem cell population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref002">2</xref>]. But why is such a mechanism employed to clear miR165/6 from the SAM in addition to restricting the transcription of <italic>MIR165/6</italic> from the stem cells? This may have to do with the potential movement of this miRNA between cells. miR165/6 probably moves across a few cell layers from its site of synthesis in the root and in leaf primordia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref041">41</xref>]. The non-cell autonomy means that cell type-specific transcription alone is not sufficient to restrict the miRNA from the SAM.</p>

<title>A model of miRNA degradation.</title>
<p>SDNs initiate degradation by trimming the miRNA to result in a 3′ truncated and unmethylated miRNA, which is uridylated by HESO1 or URT1. The tailed species are further degraded by an as yet unknown enzyme. SDN1 (this study) and the nucleotidyl transferases (HESO1 and URT1) can act on AGO1-bound miRNAs as well as free miRNAs.</p>

<title>SDN1 enzymatic assays with AGO1 and AGO10 immunoprecipitates as substrates.</title>
<p>Immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed with wild type (Col) or a line with the <italic>His-Flag-AGO10</italic> transgene in an <italic>ago10</italic> mutant background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001272.ref005">5</xref>]. AGO1 and AGO10 IP was performed with anti-AGO1 and anti-Flag antibodies, respectively. (A) The AGO1 IP was subjected to western blotting to detect AGO1 and northern blotting to detect miR165/6. (B) SDN1 enzymatic assays with AGO1 IP, AGO10 IP, and an RNA oligonucleotide as substrates under enzyme excess conditions. Northern blotting was performed to detect miR165/6 in the reactions with AGO1 and AGO10 IPs as substrates. The RNA oligonucleotide was 5′ labeled with <sup>32</sup>P to aid detection. The bands below the full-length form were shorter species present in the RNA oligonucleotide preparation. These shorter versions as well as the full-length form were degraded by SDN1. (C) AGO10 IP was subjected to western blotting with anti-AGO10 antibodies to detect AGO10 and northern blotting to detect miR165/6. The band present in the transgenic line but not in Col is His-Flag-AGO10. The other bands in the input samples are likely non-specific signals.</p>
