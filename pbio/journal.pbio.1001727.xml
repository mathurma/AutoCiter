<p>During zebrafish cardiac development, 3-OST-7 constrains BMP signaling to the atrioventricular junction and precludes it from contractile myocardium, allowing tropomyosin-dependent sarcomere assembly and contraction.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>The 3-O-sulfotransferase (3-OST) family catalyzes rare modifications of glycosaminoglycan chains on heparan sulfate proteoglycans, yet their biological functions are largely unknown. Knockdown of 3-OST-7 in zebrafish uncouples cardiac ventricular contraction from normal calcium cycling and electrophysiology by reducing <italic>tropomyosin4</italic> (<italic>tpm4</italic>) expression. Normal 3-OST-7 activity prevents the expansion of BMP signaling into ventricular myocytes, and ectopic activation of BMP mimics the ventricular noncontraction phenotype seen in 3-OST-7 depleted embryos. In 3-OST-7 morphants, ventricular contraction can be rescued by overexpression of tropomyosin <italic>tpm4</italic> but not by troponin <italic>tnnt2</italic>, indicating that <italic>tpm4</italic> serves as a lynchpin for ventricular sarcomere organization downstream of 3-OST-7. Contraction can be rescued by expression of 3-OST-7 in endocardium, or by genetic loss of <italic>bmp4</italic>. Strikingly, BMP misregulation seen in 3-OST-7 morphants also occurs in multiple cardiac noncontraction models, including potassium voltage-gated channel gene, <italic>kcnh2</italic>, affected in Romano-Ward syndrome and long-QT syndrome, and cardiac troponin T gene, <italic>tnnt2</italic>, affected in human cardiomyopathies. Together these results reveal 3-OST-7 as a key component of a novel pathway that constrains BMP signaling from ventricular myocytes, coordinates sarcomere assembly, and promotes cardiac contractile function.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>A highly complex environment at the cell surface and in the space between cells is thought to modulate cell behavior. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are cell surface and extracellular matrix molecules that are covalently linked to long chains of repeating sugar units called glycosaminoglycan chains. These chains can be subjected to rare modifications and they are believed to influence specific cell signaling events in a lineage specific fashion in what is called the “glycocode.” Here we explore the functions of one member of a family of enzymes, 3-O-sulfotransferases (3-OSTs) that catalyzes a rare modification (3-O-sulfation) of glycosaminoglycans in zebrafish. We show that knockdown of 3-OST-7 results in a very specific phenotype, including loss of cardiac ventricle contraction. Knockdown of other 3-OST family members did not result in the same phenotype, suggesting that distinct 3-OST family members have distinct functions in vertebrates and lending <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence for the glycocode hypothesis. Mechanistically, we found that cardiac contraction can be rescued by reducing the amount of endogenous BMP4, and can be blocked by increasing BMP signaling, suggesting that the glycocode generated by 3-OST-7 is necessary to constrain BMP signaling in the heart for normal cardiac contraction. Furthermore, we show that <italic>tropomyosin4</italic> (tpm4) is downstream of 3-OST-7 function, indicating that Tpm4 is key in this pathway to building the sarcomere, the functional contraction unit of the cardiomyocyte.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Vertebrate heart development requires an accurate integration of patterning and morphogenetic events, leading eventually to the formation of a fully functional heart. It initiates with the specification of the different tissue lineages that will compose the mature heart, followed by an intricate set of differentiation events that will transform the early heart field into a mature, beating organ. This transformation is defined by the subspecialization of regions of the primitive heart tube to acquire characteristics of contractile myocardium or region-specific maintenance of noncontracting myocardium. These complex events are orchestrated by a network of signals and transcription factors that could act differentially depending upon specific spatiotemporal cues. Among the important players are major signaling pathways such as BMP signaling and Wnt signaling, which set the early stages of differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Shi1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Mandel1">[4]</xref>, and the T-box (Tbx) family of transcription factors that confer chamber or nonchamber identity to the primitive heart tube <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Hoogaars1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, generation of a beating heart is the goal of these processes. For the heart to contract, contractile proteins must be produced and assembled into sarcomeres and their contraction must be coupled to the cycling electrophysiological activity. The heart starts beating during the late stages of heart tube formation and through its mechanical action, affects subsequent differentiation steps as shown in studies correlating defective morphogenesis with abnormal function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Rottbauer1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Huang1">[9]</xref>. Despite this understanding of heart development, critical questions remain in the field and unknown players remain to be discovered. In this study, we focus on the role in heart development of an enzyme, 3-O-sulfotransferase-7 (3-OST-7), that modifies heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs).</p>
<p>HSPGs are cell surface and extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules composed of a core protein to which glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains are covalently linked. The ability of HSPGs to interact with signaling ligands and receptors and ECM components place them at a unique advantage to modulate complex biological processes such as morphogenesis, tissue repair, and host defense <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Park1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Lamanna1">[12]</xref>. The specificity of interactions of an HSPG and its environment is due, in part, to the GAG chains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Lamanna1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Bulow1">[14]</xref>. The GAG chains in HSPGs are unbranched, charged polysaccharides composed of 50 or more repeating disaccharide units of <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine and glucuronic acid. These chains are subjected to several kinds of modifications: <italic>N</italic>-deacetylation/<italic>N</italic>-sulfation, epimerization, and O-sulfation. Not all disaccharide residues are modified, resulting in GAG chains with relatively small clusters of modified units interspersed among large sections of unmodified units <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Esko1">[15]</xref>. This gives rise to an astounding level of structural heterogeneity, producing GAG chains with varying specificities for protein binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Park1">[10]</xref>. The repertoire of modifying enzymes differs between cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Park1">[10]</xref>, which in theory could impact how a cell interacts with a ligand, a neighboring cell, or the ECM. Previous gene knockdown and knockout studies have begun to document the roles for these modifying enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Bulow1">[14]</xref>, but none has been implicated in heart development.</p>
<p>In this study, we focus on a rare and specific kind of O-sulfation, 3-O-sulfation, performed by a family of enzymes, the 3-O-sulfotransferases (3-OSTs). 3-OSTs catalyze transfer of a sulfate group to the hydroxyl of the third carbon of <italic>N</italic>-sulfated glucosamine residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Esko1">[15]</xref>. Previous work in our lab has identified and cloned the 3-OST family in zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Cadwallader1">[16]</xref>. Gene expression analysis reveals dynamic spatial and temporal expression patterns for the eight 3-OST family members suggesting distinct roles in the developing embryo.</p>
<p>Here we show that morpholino (MO) knockdown of one of eight 3-OST family members in zebrafish, 3-OST-7 (aka <italic>hs3st1l1</italic>), specifically results in a noncontracting cardiac ventricle at 48 hours post fertilization (hpf). Surprisingly, electrical and calcium transients in cardiomyocytes appear to be normal, suggesting that normal electrophysiological signaling in cardiomyocytes is uncoupled from cardiomyocyte contraction. Further exploring the noncontracting phenotype, we show that 3-OST-7 functions to negatively regulate BMP signaling in cardiomyocytes and to allow <italic>tpm4</italic> mRNA accumulation, which then allows normal sarcomere organization and contraction. The roles of 3-OST-7 and BMP signaling reveal a novel mechanism for the regulation of cardiac cell function.</p>

<title>Cardiac Ventricle Contraction Requires 3-OST-7</title>
<p>To begin elucidating the role of 3-OST-7 in development, we injected zebrafish embryos with either a translation-blocking MO (MO1) or a splice-blocking MO (MO2). Knockdown with MO2 was verified by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001727-g001">Figure 1I</xref>). Embryos injected with either MO exhibited similar phenotypes indicative of a cardiovascular phenotype: pericardial edema and blood pooling at 48 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001727-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). Visualizing the heart in living transgenic <italic>Tg(cmlc2:gfp)</italic> zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Huang2">[17]</xref> revealed that 3-OST-7 morphants had a hypoplastic cardiac ventricle that did not contract normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001727-g001">Figure 1F and 1G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001727.s014">Video S2</xref>), resulting in poor blood circulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001727.s016">Video S4</xref>). In contrast, sibling control embryos had normal cardiac contraction cycles, with sequential diastole and systole, and normal blood circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001727-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001727.s013">Videos S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001727.s015">S3</xref>). In contrast to the ventricle in 3-OST-7 morphants, atrium contraction was normal and similar to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001727-g001">Figure 1C, 1D, 1F, and 1G</xref>). In embryos injected with MO2, only 47%±1% (<italic>n</italic> = 124) had normal ventricular contraction, whereas all control embryos had normal cardiac contraction (<italic>n</italic> = 137) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001727-g001">Figure 1J</xref>).</p>

<p>To assess the specificity of 3-OST-7 knockdowns, we injected MOs against two other members of the 3-OST family, 3-OST-5 and 3-OST-3z, and found that MO-injected embryos had normal cardiac ventricular contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001727-g001">Figure 1J</xref>). Knockdown of 3-OST-5 and 3-OST-6 resulted in other distinct phenotypes, including altered cilia function and left-right patterning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Neugebauer1">[18]</xref>. Together, these results indicate that ventricular cardiac contraction defects are a specific phenotype of 3-OST-7 knockdown, and not knockdown of other members of the 3-OST family, including 3-OST-5, a member of the same subgroup as 3-OST-7.</p>
<p>In order to determine what is causing the hypoplasticity of the 3-OST-7 morphant ventricle, we examined cell number and cell volume. Utilizing the transgene <italic>Tg(cmlc2-DsRed-nuc)</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Mably1">[19]</xref>, which labels cardiomyocyte nuclei, we counted the total number of cardiomyocytes in both control embryos and 3-OST-7 morphants. The cardiomyocyte cell number was similar in control (298±10, <italic>n</italic> = 10) and 3-OST-7 morphant (288±12, <italic>n</italic> = 10), indicating that changes in cell number were not the cause for the hypoplastic ventricle in 3-OST-7 morphants. In contrast, by measuring ventricular myocyte volume in 3D-reconstructions of optical sections of the cardiac tube, we found that the cellular volume of individual ventricular myocytes was significantly reduced in 3-OST-7 morphants compared to control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001727-g001">Figure 1E and 1H</xref>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01), thus suggesting that cell shape changes were correlated with the observed hypoplasticity of 3-OST-7 morphant ventricles. Individual atrial myocyte volume was similar (<italic>p</italic> = 0.10) between control (207±11 µm<sup>3</sup>, <italic>n</italic> = 7) and 3-OST-7 morphant (183±11 µm<sup>3</sup>, <italic>n</italic> = 10).</p>

<title>Expression of 3-OST-7 in Endocardium Rescues Contraction in Myocardium</title>
<p>When using MOs to knockdown gene function, an important control is to rescue MO phenotype by co-expression of the targeted gene. We utilized the Tol2kit cloning system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Kwan1">[20]</xref> to create stable, germline-transmitted transgenic <italic>Tg(β-actin:3-OST-7-IEP)</italic> zebrafish that expressed 3-OST-7 under the control of the <italic>β-actin</italic> promoter for ubiquitous expression throughout early development. To preclude inhibition of transgenic expression of 3-OST-7, the MO binding sequence is not present in the construct. We placed an IRES-EGFP-polyA (IEP) downstream of the 3-OST-7 coding region, which enabled identification of individual transgenic embryos expressing 3-OST-7 by co-expression of EGFP. Constitutive expression of 3-OST-7 reduced the contraction defect in 3-OST-7 morphants, compared to nontransgenic morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001727-g001">Figure 1K</xref>).</p>
<p>3-O-sulfotransferases modify HSPGs, which typically function at the cell surface, making it possible that they modulate cell-cell signaling into 3-OST-expressing cell and/or into neighboring cells. 3-OST-7 is expressed ubiquitously early in development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Cadwallader1">[16]</xref>. In the ventricle at 48 hpf, the myocardium is directly apposed to the endocardium, so either cell lineage could be a source for 3-OST-7 function. To refine our understanding of 3-OST-7 in cardiac ventricular contraction, we asked which ventricular cell lineage required 3-OST-7 in order to allow normal ventricular contraction. We created stable transgenic zebrafish lines that express 3-OST-7 under the control of the <italic>cmlc2</italic> (aka <italic>myl7</italic>) promoter in myocardial-specific lineages, or expressing 3-OST-7 under the control of the fli1 promoter in endothelial/endocardial-specific lineages. The 3-OST-7 MO binding sequence is not present in either construct, therefore the MO would not inhibit transgenic expression of 3-OST-7. Both transgenes have an IRES-EGFP tag downstream of 3-OST-7 coding region, enabling identification of embryos that express 3-OST-7 in either endocardium or myocardium by co-expression of EGFP. These transgenic embryos were injected with 3-OST-7 MO and compared with nontransgenic, MO-injected sibling embryos. We observed significant rescue of ventricle contraction in morphants in which 3-OST-7 was expressed in endocardium, <italic>Tg(fli1:3-OST-7-IEP)</italic>, that was comparable to rescue by ubiquitously expressed 3-OST-7 in transgenic <italic>Tg(β-actin:3-OST-7-IEP)</italic> morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001727-g001">Figure 1K</xref>). In contrast, transgenic expression of 3-OST-7 in cardiomyocytes by <italic>Tg(cmlc2:3-OST-7-IEP)</italic> was not sufficient to rescue cardiac contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001727-g001">Figure 1K</xref>). While the <italic>fli1</italic> driver rescues to the same extent as the ubiquitous driver, it is possible that other tissues might also utilize 3-OST-7. Also, it should be noted that it is not possible to conclude that 3-OST-7 is <italic>not</italic> also required in cardiomyocytes earlier in development. Transgenic <italic>cmlc2</italic> expression begins at approximately 16 hpf, while the <italic>fli1</italic>-driven transgene starts being expressed at approximately 12 hpf, as assessed by co-expression of EGFP with 3-OST-7 (unpublished data). Thus, it is possible that the inability of the <italic>cmlc2:3-OST-7</italic> transgene to rescue is due to expression that is too late to be effective. Nonetheless, these results indicate that expression of 3-OST-7 in endocardium is <italic>sufficient</italic> to rescue the contraction of myocardium, suggesting 3-OST-7 functions to regulate cell-cell signaling across these apposed tissues.</p>

<title>Noncontracting Ventricle in 3-OST-7 Morphants Generates Normal Action Potentials and Calcium Transients</title>
<p>To determine whether ventricular noncontraction in 3-OST-7 morphants was due to defects in cardiomyocyte physiology, we assessed coupling of contraction to excitation. A fully functional heart characteristically undergoes excitation-contraction coupling, a physiological process whereby an electrical stimulus (action potential) is converted to a mechanical response (contraction) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Stern1">[23]</xref>. We first assessed whether the morphant ventricle could generate action potentials and calcium transients. To record action potentials, we performed patch clamp analysis on either the atrium or ventricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001727-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>) as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Arnaout1">[24]</xref>. As expected, atria of 3-OST-7 morphants generated action potentials comparable to atria of control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001727-g002">Figure 2C and 2D</xref>). Surprisingly, however, action potentials were also obtained for the noncontracting ventricles of 3-OST-7 morphants and these action potentials were similar to those recorded for ventricles of control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001727-g002">Figure 2E and 2F</xref>).

<p>(A) Zebrafish embryos were injected with 3-OST-7 MO1 at one-cell stage and allowed to develop until 48 hpf. The heart was then dissected out of the embryo and either placed in a recording chamber perfused with external control solution (for action potential analysis) or incubated in Fluo-4 and imaged using a confocal microscope (for calcium transient analysis). Control 48 hpf hearts from uninjected embryos or injected with control 3-OST-5 MO were processed in parallel. (B) A suction pipette was used to patch clamp the heart at the atrial or ventricular region. Action potentials were recorded from atria (C–D) and ventricles (E–F) of control (uninjected, WT) (C and E) and 3-OST-7 morphant (D and F) embryos. The action potentials were comparable between control and 3-OST-7 morphant embryos. Regions were selected from atrium and ventricle to record the calcium transients (G–J) and measure the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitude (K) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient decay (L) (error bars, SEM). No significant difference was detected between control and 3-OST-7 morphant embryos (<italic>p</italic> = 0.30 for atrial transient amplitude; <italic>p</italic> = 0.16 for ventricular transient amplitude; <italic>p</italic> = 0.37 for atrial transient decay; and <italic>p</italic> = 0.51 for ventricular transient decay).

Optical maps of calcium activation for a single cycle, represented by isochronal lines every 20 ms, show calcium activation and conduction velocity proceed normally in 3-OST-7 morphants (N) compared to control MO injected embryos (M). Conduction proceeds from the atrium through the AV canal to the ventricle and numbers indicate the temporal sequence of calcium activation.

<p>A primary function of the cardiac action potential is to trigger the increase in intracellular calcium that initiates cardiac contraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Bers1">[25]</xref>. To assess whether this increase occurs in 3-OST-7 morphant ventricles, we used two different techniques to image changes in intracellular calcium. In the first technique, explanted embryonic hearts were imaged by high-speed confocal microscopy using the calcium indicator Fluo-4. The amplitude and the decay of recorded calcium transients were measured to assess the release and re-uptake of intracellular calcium. Similar calcium waves were observed in hearts of both control embryos and 3-OST-7 morphants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001727.s017">Videos S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001727.s018">S6</xref>). The 3-OST-7 morphant atria and ventricles generated calcium transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001727-g002">Figure 2H and 2J</xref>) similar to those generated by atria and ventricles from control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001727-g002">Figure 2G and 2I</xref>).

There were no observed differences in conduction velocity. Together these results demonstrated the ability of the noncontracting ventricle of 3-OST-7 morphants to release calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and to re-uptake it at the end of the cycle. These results indicate that the intracellular components that are critical for calcium cycling are functional in 3-OST-7 morphants. In addition, the normal propagation of calcium waves in 3-OST-7 morphant hearts indicates that the gap junctions and excitatory ion currents critical for normal cell-cell conduction were also intact.</p>

<title>3-OST-7-Dependent Expression of <italic>Tpm4</italic> Is Required for Myofibrillogenesis, Sarcomere Assembly, and Contraction</title>
<p>Our observations that action potentials and calcium transients were normal in 3-OST-7 morphants with noncontracting ventricles indicate that excitation was uncoupled from contraction. Moreover, this suggests that the failure of contraction in 3-OST-7 morphants might be due to defects in the myocardial contractile apparatus, which is the direct target of calcium ions released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum during electrical excitation of the heart. To determine whether ventricular noncontraction of 3-OST-7 morphants is due to aberrant sarcomeres, we used immunohistochemistry (IHC) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to visualize the sarcomeric structure of the heart. Using MF20 and phalloidin to stain sarcomeric myosin and the actin filaments, respectively, we found that these filaments were disorganized in 3-OST-7 morphant hearts compared to the orderly filament organization in hearts of control embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001727.s002">Figure S2</xref>). IHC analysis also showed diminished cardiac troponin T (Tnnt2) and tropomyosin (Tpm) organization in 3-OST-7 morphant hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001727-g003">Figure 3B and 3F</xref>) compared to control embryo hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001727-g003">Figure 3A and 3E</xref>).

In contrast, the myofibrils were reduced and disorganized in 3-OST-7 morphant hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001727-g003">Figure 3G</xref>). Together these results demonstrate the noncontraction of the ventricle in 3-OST-7 morphants is correlated with disorganization of sarcomere proteins.</p>

<p>Whole mount IHC was performed on fixed 48(injected with control 3-OST-3Z MO) or 3-OST-7 morphant embryos to detect cardiac sarcomere proteins (<italic>n</italic> = 30 for each group). The heart was then dissected out of the embryo, mounted on cover slips, and imaged using a confocal microscope (thus, the dorso-ventral orientation of the mounted hearts was random). IHC using anti-Tnnt2 antibody and anti-Tpm antibody revealed levels of these proteins were greatly reduced in 3-OST-7 morphants (B and F, dashed lines outline the hearts) compared to control (A and E) embryos.

<p>Since it appears that 3-OST-7 is required for sarcomere organization, and for Tnnt2 and Tpm protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001727-g003">Figure 3B and 3F</xref>), we asked whether 3-OST-7 MO affects RNA transcript accumulation for either of these sarcomeric genes. ISH analysis of <italic>tnnt2</italic> RNA expression at 20 hpf, 24 hpf, and 48 hpf in morphants revealed that <italic>tnnt2</italic> transcript levels were similar to control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001727.s003">Figure S3A, S3B, S3E, S3F, S3I, S3J</xref>). In contrast, transcript levels of <italic>tpm4</italic> were reduced in 3-OST-7 morphants compared to control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001727-g003">Figures 3D, 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001727.s003">S3C, S3D, S3G</xref>, and S3H). In hearts obtained by bulk disruption of 48 hpf embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Burns1">[27]</xref>, <italic>tpm4</italic> transcript levels were reduced 3.8-fold in 3-OST-7 morphants (<italic>p</italic> = 6.2×10<sup>−4</sup>), as assessed by microarray analysis. Similar to ISH data, <italic>tnnt2</italic> transcript levels were unchanged in the microarray analysis (<italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05). Together, these results suggest that 3-OST-7 MO leads to a reduction of <italic>tpm4</italic> RNA accumulation, which then leads to reduced Tpm protein accumulation.</p>
<p>We suggest that cardiac Tpm4 serves as a “lynchpin” protein downstream of 3-OST-7 function; when Tpm4 is reduced, sarcomeres fail to be stably organized, and other sarcomeric proteins are degraded in response. Consistent with this idea, <italic>tnnt2</italic> RNA is present but Tnnt2 protein is diminished in 3-OST-7 morphants. We predicted that if Tpm4 serves as a lynchpin protein in 3-OST-7 function, then we should be able to rescue sarcomere organization and ventricular contraction in 3-OST-7 morphants by injection of <italic>tpm4</italic> RNA. Injection of <italic>tpm4</italic> RNA alone in control embryos had no perceived gross morphological effect, nor did it alter cardiac function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001727.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Strikingly, injection of <italic>tpm4</italic> RNA in 3-OST-7 morphants rescued ventricular contraction as assessed by looking at contraction in 48 hpf embryos (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0097, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001727.s004">Figure S4</xref>) and by measuring ejection area (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001727-g003">Figure 3L</xref>). In keeping with the rescued ventricular contraction, <italic>tpm4</italic> RNA injection in 3-OST-7 MO also rescued the organization and expression of sarcomeric proteins Tnnt2 and Tpm, and rescued the TEM appearance of sarcomeric structures in myofibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001727-g003">Figure 3I–3K</xref>). In contrast with the ability of <italic>tpm4</italic> RNA to rescue cardiac contraction in 3-OST-7 morphants, transient transgenic expression of <italic>tnnt2</italic> did not rescue cardiac contraction. As a control, embryos that were transgenic for a construct that drives cardiac expression of <italic>tnnt2-IRES-EGFP</italic> under the control of the <italic>cmlc2</italic> promoter had normal cardiac contraction. 3-OST-7 MO injected into this transgenic (scored by EGFP expression) resulted in decreased cardiac contraction, at frequencies comparable to 3-OST-7 MO in non-transgenic siblings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001727.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Together these results demonstrate that Tpm4 serves as a downstream lynchpin of 3-OST-7 function for normal cardiac ventricular contraction.</p>

<p>We also investigated whether two major developmental signaling pathways, FGF and Notch signaling, are involved in 3-OST-7 regulation of ventricular contraction. FGF signaling was a strong candidate because it requires HSPG GAG chains for receptor-ligand complex formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Lin1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Pellegrini1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Yayon1">[33]</xref>. If loss of contraction caused by knockdown of 3-OST-7 occurs through deficient FGF signaling, direct perturbation of FGF signaling should mimic the noncontracting ventricle phenotype of 3-OST-7 morphants. However, FGF receptor 1 (<italic>fgfr1</italic>) knockdown resulted in ventricles that were smaller but had normal contractility (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001727.s006">Figure S6A</xref>). Similarly, reducing or abolishing FGF signaling either in the zebrafish <italic>fgf8/ace</italic> mutant or by treatment with the FGFR inhibitor SU5402 also resulted in small hearts with particularly notable reductions of the ventricle, but no reported alterations in contraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Marques1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Reifers1">[35]</xref>.

To determine whether 3-OST-7 regulates ventricular contraction by way of the Notch signaling pathway, we assessed whether the noncontracting ventricle phenotype is recapitulated in <italic>deltaD/aei<sup>AG49</sup></italic> mutant embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Holley1">[37]</xref>. Embryos carrying a homozygous mutation in the <italic>deltaD</italic> gene were identified by misshapped somites posterior to the ninth somite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Holley1">[37]</xref> and separated from wild-type or heterozygous siblings at 18 hpf.

<p>To investigate whether ectopic expression of <italic>bmp4</italic> in the ventricle affects BMP signaling, we performed IHC for phosphorylated-Smad1/5/8 (P-Smad), a downstream marker for Bmp signaling. P-Smad was localized most strongly in the nuclei of AV canal cells in control hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001727-g004">Figure 4G</xref>), which corresponds to <italic>bmp4</italic> being normally restricted to that region at 48 hpf.

In order to quantify this effect, we divided the ventricle images into six domains (domain 1 contains the AV junction and domain 6 was the region farthest from the AV junction) and counted the number of P-Smad-positive nuclei within each domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001727-g004">Figure 4I</xref>). In 3-OST-7 morphants, an increased number of P-Smad-positive nuclei were present even in the domains farthest from the AV, while there were very few P-Smad positive nuclei outside the AV domain in control hearts.

<p>The above results indicate a correlation between expanded BMP expression in ventricular myocytes and failure to contract, but they do not address causality.

<p>These results indicate that ectopic overexpression of BMP is capable of blocking ventricular contraction, but do not test whether the expanded expression of BMP observed in 3-OST-7 morphants is causative of the noncontracting phenotype. If the function of 3-OST-7 is to reduce or constrain BMP expression from ventricular myocytes, and excessive BMP is causative of contraction defects in 3-OST-7 morphants, then reduction of endogenous BMP levels in 3-OST-7 morphants should alleviate the ventricular contraction defect. To test this hypothesis, we utilized the zebrafish <italic>bmp4<sup>st72</sup></italic> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Stickney1">[45]</xref> and asked whether genetic reduction of <italic>bmp4</italic> will rescue the noncontracting ventricle phenotype caused by knockdown of 3-OST-7. We injected 3-OST-7 MO into embryos from crosses between <italic>bmp4<sup>st72</sup>/+</italic> heterozygotes, with uninjected embryos from the same genetic crosses serving as control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001727-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). The embryos were then segregated by cardiac phenotype: normal hearts or noncontracting ventricles at 48 hpf. In some cases a slight AV morphological defect was also observed, as part of the <italic>bmp4<sup>st72</sup></italic> mutant phenotype seen in both uninjected and injected embryos, and these were counted among the normally contracting hearts. The individual embryos were then genotyped. In uninjected embryos, all embryos displayed normal cardiac contraction, regardless of wild-type, heterozygous, or homozygous genotype for <italic>bmp4<sup>st72</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001727-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), indicating that cardiac contraction was not affected in the absence of 3-OST-7 MO. In siblings that were genotypically wild-type for <italic>bmp4</italic> (<italic>+/+</italic>) and injected with 3-OST-7 MO, the percentage of embryos with normal ventricular contraction was only 47.5%, similar to the range seen in other 3-OST-7 MO experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001727-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Strikingly, the percentage of embryos with normal cardiac contraction was increased for 3-OST-7 MO injected <italic>bmp4<sup>st72</sup></italic> mutants (<italic>−/−</italic>), with 73.7% of these mutants having a contracting ventricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001727-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Genomic DNA sequencing of the individual injected <italic>bmp4<sup>st72</sup></italic> mutants confirmed that the 3-OST-7 MO targeted sequence was correct in <italic>bmp4<sup>st72</sup></italic> mutants. These results indicate that reduction of endogenous BMP signaling is capable of rescuing ventricular contraction in 3-OST-7 morphants. Combined with the observation that ectopic BMP signaling can cause a noncontracting ventricle phenotype, these results indicate that 3-OST-7 functions to constrain BMP signaling to the AV junction and to reduce BMP signaling in the ventricle, thereby allowing normal cardiac ventricular contraction.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we demonstrate that 3-OST-7, one of the enzymes that places a rare 3-O-sulfation on GAG chains on HSPGs, has a novel and highly specific function in cardiac development. In 3-OST-7 knockdown zebrafish, early cardiac cell specification, patterning, cardiac tube looping, and cardiomyocyte electrophysiology are normal, but ventricle contraction is defective. We show that 3-OST-7 is required for the normal accumulation of <italic>tpm4</italic> mRNA in the ventricle. Tpm4 protein appears to be a lynchpin in ventricular sarcomere assembly and stabilization, because overexpression of Tpm4 protein by <italic>tpm4</italic> mRNA injection in 3-OST-7 morphants rescues the levels and organization of other sarcomeric proteins, rescues sarcomere structure, and rescues ventricular contraction. Tpm4 is also reduced in the atrium in 3-OST-7 morphants, but either this level of reduction is not sufficient to affect atrial contraction or some other contractile component might compensate functionally for diminished Tpm4 in the atrium. In contrast, transgenic overexpression of cardiac troponin T <italic>tnnt2</italic> cannot rescue cardiac contraction in 3-OST-7 morphants. Thus, knockdown of 3-OST-7 uncouples contraction from the normally functioning excitation cycle by perturbing <italic>tpm4</italic> mRNA accumulation, leading to defective myofibrillogenesis. This places the 3-OST-7-dependent 3-O-sulfation of extracellular GAG chains as the first member of an otherwise unknown signaling pathway that is upstream of <italic>tpm4</italic> regulation and coordinated sarcomere assembly.</p>
<p>We propose that 3-OST-7 functions in the endocardium by modifying HSPGs at the interface between endocardium and myocardium in order to constrain BMP signaling to the AV junction and dampen BMP signaling in functional myocardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001727-g007">Figure 7</xref>). The cardiac ventricular contraction defect in 3-OST-7 morphants could be rescued by ubiquitous transgenic expression of 3-OST-7 and by lineage-specific expression in the endocardium, but surprisingly not by lineage specific expression in the myocardium. This would suggest 3-O-sulfation of HSPGs by 3-OST-7 mediates cell-cell communication between myocardium and endocardium to regulate <italic>tpm4</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001727-g007">Figure 7</xref>). In the presence of normal 3-OST-7 function, BMP signaling is constrained to the AV junction and precluded from functional myocardium, as reflected in high levels of P-Smad in nuclei in the AV junction and little or no P-Smad in adjacent functional cardiomyocytes. Since 3-OST-7 appears to be ubiquitously expressed, the spatial regulation of BMP4 signaling is likely due to positive feedback loops within the BMP pathway that are constrained by 3-OST-7 function. Other studies support the idea of positive feedback loops, showing that ectopic BMP expression activates endogenous BMP expression in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos, and correspondingly, loss of BMP ligands <italic>swirl</italic> (<italic>bmp2b</italic>), <italic>somitabun</italic> (<italic>smad5</italic>), or <italic>snailhouse</italic> (<italic>bmp7</italic>) in zebrafish mutants results in loss of <italic>bmp2b</italic> expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Jones1">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Nikaido1">[49]</xref>. We do not know whether this constraint on BMP signaling occurs by direct interaction of BMP4 and/or its receptors with 3-OST-7 modified HSPGs, or indirectly through other pathways, but it would be exciting in future studies to assess if BMP4 directly bind to specifically modified, 3-O-sulfated HSPGs. The constraint of BMP signaling allows functional cardiomyocytes to accumulate normal levels of <italic>tpm4</italic> mRNA and Tpm4 protein, which then serves as a lynchpin for the organization of normal contractile apparatus. The importance of BMP regulation is evident both from the ability of excessive BMP signaling to block cardiac contraction and the ability of reduced BMP levels to rescue contraction in 3-OST-7 MO. In the absence of 3-OST-7 function, the normal endogenous BMP signaling that occurs in the AV junction at 48 hpf spreads ectopically into myocardium beyond its normal boundaries in the AV junction, most likely mediated by the BMP receptor BMPR2B, which we show to be ectopically expressed in 3-OST-7 morphant hearts. This results in high levels of P-Smad in the nucleus of ventricular myocytes. High levels of BMP signaling result in reduced levels of <italic>tpm4</italic> mRNA, thereby removing the Tpm4 lynchpin and leading to failure of contractile apparatus organization. It is not known whether the reduction of tpm4 mRNA is due to direct transcriptional suppression by the increased levels of P-Smad in the ventricular nuclei, or to indirect effects. Thus, although ventricular myocytes have normal cycling calcium and electrophysiology, they are incapable of contracting. Interestingly, other models of cardiac noncontraction (<italic>kcnh2</italic> and <italic>tnnt2</italic> morphants) also display expanded expression of <italic>bmp4</italic>, suggesting there might be an inappropriate positive feedback loop between overexpression of BMP and a failure of cardiomyocytes to contract. We would not expect manipulations of the BMP4 pathway to rescue ventricular noncontraction in the <italic>kcnh2</italic> and <italic>tnnt2</italic> morphants or mutants, since other critical components, of either the excitation-contraction coupling process or contractile machinery, are still missing.

<p>It is striking that the regulation of BMP signaling can be controlled by a rare modification of 3-O-sulfation on HSPGs, and that loss of this regulation has dramatic effects on the ability of the heart to function. Even more striking is that other 3-OST family members, many of which are expressed ubiquitously in these early stages of development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Cadwallader1">[16]</xref>, do not compensate for the loss of 3-OST-7. Knockdown of other 3-OST family members have distinct phenotypes and regulate other cell signaling pathways, including FGF signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Neugebauer1">[18]</xref>, but do not have the cardiac ventricular contraction defect described here for 3-OST-7.

This level of precise regulation has not been described in vertebrates, in which each enzymatic step has large number of family members. Here, our results suggest that 3-OST-7 has a unique ability to generate a distinct modification on GAG chains of HSPGs, and this modification is necessary for the spatial regulation of BMP signaling during cardiac development, necessary for ventricle contraction.</p>

<title>Calcium Transient Recording</title>
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were recorded as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001727-Jou1">[60]</xref>. Fluorescent signals (F) were normalized to baseline values (F<sub>o</sub>). The maximum Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitude (F<sub>Max</sub>/F<sub>o</sub>) was determined by averaging the peak amplitude of three consecutive transient signals. The decay of the calcium transient was determined by a monoexponential fit of the decaying signal and averaging value of three consecutive transient signals.</p>

<title>Optical Mapping</title>
<p>48 hpf zebrafish was placed on a coverglass. Electromechanical isolation was achieved with 2,3-BDM (Sigma) at 10 mmol/l applied 15 minutes before imaging. Single plane widefield epifluorescence images of the heart were obtained with a Nikon TE-2000 inverted microscope using a 40× Plan Apo air objective, Xcite-120 (Exfo) widefield epifluorescent source and standard FITC filter set. Images were acquired with a Coolsnap HQ camera (Photometrics) using Metavue software (Molecular Devices) in stream acquisition mode at a frame rate of 30 ms/frame (512×512 pixels). Image processing consisted first of manual adjustment of minor spatial shifts of the image over a temporal imaging series. Then, the fluorescence intensity of each pixel in a 2D map was normalized to its percentage between the minimum and maximum recorded values of the pixel over the full series. Isochronal lines at 20 ms intervals were obtained by identifying the maximal spatial gradient for a given time point. The color-coded scheme in each panel and video describes progressive activation of the heart with white/red cells and black/blue cells indicating depolarization and repolarization, respectively. Software processing was performed with Metavue software and procedures written in MATLAB (MathWorks).</p>
