<p>Species-preferential osmotic pollen tube burst and sperm discharge in maize involve induced opening of the pollen tube-expressed potassium channel KZM1 by the egg apparatus-derived defensin-like protein ZmES4.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>In contrast to animals and lower plant species, sperm cells of flowering plants are non-motile and are transported to the female gametes via the pollen tube, i.e. the male gametophyte. Upon arrival at the female gametophyte two sperm cells are discharged into the receptive synergid cell to execute double fertilization. The first players involved in inter-gametophyte signaling to attract pollen tubes and to arrest their growth have been recently identified. In contrast the physiological mechanisms leading to pollen tube burst and thus sperm discharge remained elusive. Here, we describe the role of polymorphic defensin-like cysteine-rich proteins ZmES1-4 (<italic>Zea mays</italic> embryo sac) from maize, leading to pollen tube growth arrest, burst, and explosive sperm release. <italic>ZmES1-4</italic> genes are exclusively expressed in the cells of the female gametophyte. ZmES4-GFP fusion proteins accumulate in vesicles at the secretory zone of mature synergid cells and are released during the fertilization process. Using RNAi knock-down and synthetic ZmES4 proteins, we found that ZmES4 induces pollen tube burst in a species-preferential manner. Pollen tube plasma membrane depolarization, which occurs immediately after ZmES4 application, as well as channel blocker experiments point to a role of K<sup>+</sup>-influx in the pollen tube rupture mechanism. Finally, we discovered the intrinsic rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channel KZM1 as a direct target of ZmES4. Following ZmES4 application, KZM1 opens at physiological membrane potentials and closes after wash-out. In conclusion, we suggest that vesicles containing ZmES4 are released from the synergid cells upon male-female gametophyte signaling. Subsequent interaction between ZmES4 and KZM1 results in channel opening and K<italic><sup>+</sup></italic> influx. We further suggest that K<italic><sup>+</sup></italic> influx leads to water uptake and culminates in osmotic tube burst. The species-preferential activity of polymorphic ZmES4 indicates that the mechanism described represents a pre-zygotic hybridization barrier and may be a component of reproductive isolation in plants.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Sperm cells of animals and lower plants are mobile and can swim to the oocyte or egg cell. In contrast, flowering plants generate immobile sperm encased in a pollen coat to protect them from drying out and are transported via the pollen tube cell towards the egg apparatus to achieve double fertilization. Upon arrival the pollen tube tip bursts to deliver two sperm cells, one fusing with the egg cell to generate the embryo and the other fusing with the central cell to generate the endosperm. Here, we report the mechanisms leading to pollen tube burst and sperm discharge in maize. We found that before fertilization the defensin-like protein ZmES1-4 is stored in the secretory zone of the egg apparatus cells and that pollen tubes cannot discharge sperm in <italic>ZmES1-4</italic> knock-down plants. Application of chemically synthesized ZmES4 leads to pollen tube burst within seconds in maize, but not in other plant species, suggesting this mechanism may be species specific. Finally, we identified the pollen tube-expressed potassium channel KZM1 as a target of ZmES4, which opens after ZmES4 treatment and probably leads to K<sup>+</sup> influx and sperm release after osmotic burst.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Flowering plants (angiosperms) emerged some 180–140 MYA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Bell1">[1]</xref> and have since inhabitated most ecological environments, which are often far away from humid conditions. Hence, new reproductive mechanisms were acquired to keep cells from drying out and to realize species-specific interactions between male and female reproductive structures, partly over long distances. Adaptive selection led to the reduction of the haploid male gametophyte to a three-cellular pollen grain and pollen tube, respectively, which is able to be transported over long distances and to grow deeply inside female reproductive tissues. As a further consequence the sperm cells lost their motility. The reduced female gametophyte (embryo sac), which is haploid in most plant species, is deeply embedded and protected in the maternal tissues of the ovule and ovary and harbors the female gametes (egg and central cell) as well as some accessory cells (synergid and antipodal cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000388-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Of these, the synergid cells are involved in pollen tube signaling, sperm delivery, and transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Punwani1">[2]</xref>. Extensive cell-cell communication events are likely to take place between both gametophytes, among male and female gametophyte cells, respectively, as well as the surrounding sporophytic tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Dresselhaus1">[3]</xref>. The central events preceding fertilization involve signaling towards the pollen tube to arrest growth and to induce discharge of the two sperm cells, a process first described by the famous German-Polish botanist Eduard Strasburger in 1884 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Strasburger1">[4]</xref>. It took more than 120 years to identify the first molecular players involved in these processes.</p>

<p>Cross-talk between both gametophytes to arrest pollen tube growth has recently been shown to depend on the FER receptor-like kinase (RLK) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-EscobarRestrepo1">[5]</xref> and the GPI-anchored protein LRE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Capron1">[6]</xref> localized at the synergid plasma membrane. Nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species seem to play additional roles in this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Prado1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-BoissonDernier1">[8]</xref>, and the activity of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> pump ACA9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Schiott1">[9]</xref> localized at the pollen tube plasma membrane was shown to be required for pollen tube rupture. We were investigating whether small secreted cysteine-rich proteins (CRPs), specifically expressed in the embryo sac cells, play a role in these processes. Plant genomes encode large classes of CRPs accounting for more than 800 genes in Arabidopsis and approximately 600 genes in rice. Among them, defensins/defensin-like proteins (DEFs/DEFLs), lipid transfer proteins (LTPs), rapid alkanization factor (RALF) proteins, and thionins resemble the largest classes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Silverstein1">[10]</xref>. The majority of these genes are expressed in reproductive tissues and a number of genes have been shown to be specifically expressed in the cells of the embryo sac <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Steffen1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Cordts1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Yang1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-JonesRhoades1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Punwani2">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Sprunck1">[16]</xref>. Here, we report the functional analysis of a small gene-family of four members encoding DEFL proteins in the maize inbred line A188. All four genes are specifically expressed in the embryo sac and have been shown previously to be down-regulated immediately upon fertilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Cordts1">[12]</xref>.</p>

<title>ZmES4 Accumulates in the Secretory Zone of the Synergid Cells</title>
<p>ZmES1-4 protein localization was studied in the maize embryo sac cells before and after fertilization in plants expressing GFP fused to the C-terminus of ZmES4 under control of its endogenous promoter. All transgenic lines showed fusion protein localization exclusively in the embryo sac cells. Some variation was observed among the cell types expressing ZmES4-GFP: most ovules expressed it in both synergid cells, others in about 80% ovules only in one synergid cell, while others showed expression additionally in egg and central cells. Signals in the antipodal cells were never observed. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000388-g001">Figure 1A–1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000388.s001">Figure S1N and S1O</xref>, the fusion protein was most prominently located in the secretory zone of the two synergids surrounding the filiform apparatus before fertilization. Unlike the ZmEA1-GFP protein, which is secreted from the egg apparatus and plays a role in short range pollen tube guidance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Mrton1">[17]</xref>, GFP fluorescence was not detected in the cell walls of micropylar nucellus cells. Weaker signals were visible in the central cell of some but not all transgenic lines. In a stack of confocal laser scanning microscopy images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000388-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) of a very young cellularized embryo sac, displayed fusion protein signals were also found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the central cell. 15 hours after pollination (hap), around 7 to 8 h after fertilization, ZmES4-GFP was no longer detectable in the degenerated receptive synergid cell and polar localization in the persisting synergid cell was lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000388-g001">Figure 1E and 1F</xref>). Faint fluorescence, accumulating in the ER around the nucleus, was visible in the fertilized egg cell of some transgenic lines. The fusion protein was no longer detectable in all lines 24 hap, indicating that it was actively degraded after fertilization. Time course measurements using a line expressing the fusion protein in about 80% ovules only in one of the two synergid cells showed that signals first appeared after the whole embryo sac is fully differentiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000388-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). During further maturation and embryo sac enlargement, most fluorescence was visible in the ER around the nucleus and the secretary zone of the synergid cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000388-g001">Figure 1H</xref>). In this line, the single ZmES4-GFP expressing synergid cell was the exclusive target of the pollen tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000388-g001">Figure 1I</xref>). Transient transformation of onion epidermis cells was used to investigate the secretion of ZmES proteins. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000388.s001">Figure S1</xref>, ZmES4-GFP fusion protein entered the secretory pathway and seemed to be present in golgi stacks, constitutive secretory vesicles, as well as in the cell wall. We suggest, however, that in contrast to onion epidermis cells, in non-degenerate synergid cells, ZmES4-GFP appears to be retained in regulated secretory vesicles, as signals were not observed in the cell wall before fertilization.</p>

<title>ZmES4 Has Low DEF Activity</title>
<p>In order to study the DEF activity of ZmES proteins, <italic>ZmES4</italic> was expressed under the control of the ubiquitously expressed <italic>35S</italic> promoter in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000388.s002">Figure S2A and S2B</xref>, antibacterial activity, which has also been reported for most plant DEFs studied so far <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Aerts1">[18]</xref>, was not observed. Although antifungal activity was also not observed at the seedling stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000388.s002">Figure S2C</xref>), infected ZmES4 over-expressing seedlings recovered faster than control seedlings and fungal hyphae were no longer macroscopically visible a few weeks after infection. In contrast, control plants still contained fungal hyphae, displayed chlorosis, and delayed flowering (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000388.s002">Figure S2D</xref>). These experiments indicated that ZmES proteins still display low DEF activity and are apparently able to bind to fungal targets with a low affinity.

<title>ZmES Function Is Required for Pollen Tube Growth Arrest and Burst</title>
<p>To study the role of ZmES proteins during fertilization, the whole gene-family was down-regulated using RNAi-silencing. <italic>ZmES4</italic>-RNAi plants, which showed weak or lack of the RNAi-transcript, did not show any obvious phenotype. Plants that contained high RNAi-transcript levels displayed female sterility after self-pollination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000388-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) but full seed-set after back-crossing to wt plants. Progeny of a single copy RNAi-line back-crossed to wild type plants displayed 43% transmission of the transgene via the pollen (<italic>n</italic> = 28). Self-pollination showed 50% transmission (<italic>n</italic> = 30), indicating almost full transmission of the silencing construct via the pollen but low transmission via the female gametophyte.</p>

<title>Pollen tube arrest and burst is impaired in transgenic lines with reduced <italic>ZmES</italic> activity.</title>
<p>(A) In order to study the function of <italic>ZmES</italic> genes, <italic>ZmES4-</italic>RNAi mutants were generated to down-regulate the whole <italic>ZmES</italic> gene-family simultaneously by RNA silencing. Only about half of self-pollinated ovules of <italic>ZmES4-</italic>RNAi lines developed into kernels (left). Pollination of wt (A188) ovules using pollen from <italic>ZmES4-</italic>RNAi plants led to full seed set (right) and about 43% transmission of a single copy RNAi construct in progeny plants (unpublished data). (B–G) <italic>ACT</italic>p<italic>:GUS</italic> maize pollen was used to monitor pollen tube growth and fertilization rates inside maize ovaries between 27–32 hap (B–E) and 72 hap (F and G), respectively. (B) One pollen tube (arrow) has penetrated the egg apparatus of a wt ovule. Blue staining of both egg apparatus and central cell indicates successful double fertilization. A second pollen tube (arrowhead) is no longer directed towards the fertilized egg apparatus. (C) An <italic>ACT</italic>p<italic>:GUS</italic> maize pollen tube has penetrated the nucellar tissue (arrow) and female gametophyte (arrow head) of an <italic>ZmES4-</italic>RNAi ovule, but GUS signals are neither detectable in the synergid nor in the central cell. (D) A close-up of (C) shows that the pollen tube grew into the cell wall material of the filiform apparatus between the two synergids (arrowhead). GUS activity is visible inside the female gametophyte in the region between egg and central cell indicating pollen tube growth arrest. (E) Another example of an <italic>ZmES4-</italic>RNAi ovule containing a pollen tube inside the egg apparatus region lacking both growth arrest and burst. (F) A wt ovule shows paternal GUS-activity in both pro-embryo and developing endosperm. The endosperm has already enlarged and contains a large number of nuclei (not visible). (G) The nucellus tissue (arrow) of an <italic>ZmES4-</italic>RNAi ovule was penetrated by a pollen tube, which grew around the egg apparatus (arrowhead) without penetration. The synergid cells have already started to degenerate at this stage. (H) Fertilization rates of both egg and central cell are significantly impaired in <italic>ZmES4-</italic>RNAi ovules. On average 88% wt ovules are fertilized (black columns), compared to 60% fertilized <italic>ZmES4-</italic>RNAi ovules (grey columns). A difference between self-pollinated <italic>ZmES4-</italic>RNAi ovules as well as ovules from back-crossed (BC) plants was not detectable neither 1 nor 2 d after fertilization (27–32 and 53–55 hap, respectively). The percentage of unfertilized ovules for both wt and ES4-RNAi lines are represented by white columns.

<p>After pollination with an <italic>ACT</italic>p:<italic>GUS</italic> marker line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Mrton1">[17]</xref>, maternal tissues of the ovary and ovule were sectioned to visualize the pollen tube during the fertilization process. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000388-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, a wt pollen tube penetrated the embryo sac, released its content, and blue staining of both egg and central cell indicated successful fertilization due to the activity of sperm derived paternal <italic>GUS</italic> genes inside female gametes. After fertilization, guidance signals apparently no longer existed, as additional pollen tubes failed to penetrate the micropylar nucellus region of the ovule. In contrast, <italic>ZmES4</italic>-RNAi plants displayed penetration of the micropylar nucellus, but GUS signals were neither detectable inside the gametes nor inside the synergid cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000388-g002">Figure 2C–2E</xref>). Moreover, both synergid cells were still intact and gamete delivery had not occurred. Pollen tube over-growth was partially observed inside the egg apparatus region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000388-g002">Figure 2E</xref>) or growth around the egg apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000388-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). Here, the very mature egg apparatus cells started to disintegrate. Fertilized wt ovules of the same cob show enlargement of the embryo sac and initiation of embryo and endosperm development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000388-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). A summary of fertilization rates is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000388-g002">Figure 2H</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000388.s008">Table S1</xref>): two <italic>ZmES4</italic>-RNAi-lines and a single copy back-crossed line were analyzed for occurrence of fertilization around 1 and 2d after fertilization (27–32 hap and 53–55 hap), respectively. GUS activity in both, egg and central cell, was measured as successful fertilization. In contrast to wt embryo sacs that displayed a fertilization rate of 88%, <italic>ZmES4</italic>-RNAi lines showed a reduction to 60%. This value is higher than the expected 44% of a genetic null-mutant indicating that either the silencing effect is incomplete and/or additional factors are involved in the release of pollen tube contents.</p>

<p>Due to limitations in visualizing the double fertilization process <italic>in planta</italic>, we chemically synthesized mature ZmES4 protein and investigated its effect on the growth behavior of in vitro in liquid-germinated and -grown pollen tubes of maize and other plant species. Buffer containing 30 µM ZmES4 induced rapid pollen tube burst at the very tube tip within seconds after application to germinated pollen tubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000388-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Within less than a minute almost 100% pollen tubes ruptured and tube content was released explosively. Even at 1,000-fold lower concentrations, one-third of pollen tubes bursted within less than 2 min (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000388.s003">Figure S3</xref>). This reaction was species-preferential as pollen tube rupture in the maize relative <italic>Tripsacum dactyloides</italic> was essentially delayed (around 1,600–2,300 s versus 35–50 s in maize, independent from the maize genotype used; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000388-g003">Figure 3C and 3D</xref>) or did not occur at all in other plant species tested, such as tobacco or lily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000388-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).

<title>Mature defensin-like ZmES4 induces pollen tube tip burst after depolarization of the pollen tube membrane.</title>
<p>In order to investigate the role of ZmES4 activity on living pollen tubes, an in vitro pollen tube growth bioassay using various plant species was established. (A) A pollen grain of maize (inbred A188) was germinated for 15 min in liquid medium before addition of 30 µM RsAFP2 in PGM. Growth behavior was further observed for up to 120 min (here after 15 min incubation) displaying normal tube growth. (B) Maize pollen grains were germinated for 15 min before addition of PGM containing 30 µM ZmES4. Pollen tubes started to burst within seconds after ZmES4 application and tube content was released explosively at the tip (arrow). (C) Pollen grains of <italic>Tripsacum dactyloides</italic> were germinated for 15 min before PGM containing 30 µM ZmES4 was added. 15 min after ZmES4 application most pollen tubes were still intact and grew further until rupture occurred on average around 32 min after incubation. (D) Diagram showing average time points when 80% of germinated pollen tubes of maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>) and <italic>T. dactyloides</italic> were ruptured after ZmES4 protein application. Growth of pollen tubes of lily (<italic>H. fulva</italic>) and various tobacco species (<italic>N.</italic> spec.) observed for more than 60 min was not affected by ZmES4 application. CsCl<sub>2</sub> application significantly delayed ZmES4 activity. Standard deviations are indicated. (E) Micro-electrode impalement of <italic>Zea mays</italic> pollen tubes for membrane potential recordings. Pollen grains of maize were germinated on solid medium and impaled right below the pollen tube tip. Control application of CRPs such as trypsin inhibitor from soybean or RsAFP2 in PGM did not affect the pollen tube membrane potential, while the application of ZmES4 in PGM evoked a transient depolarization of the membrane potential followed by pollen tube tip burst (arrowhead). A representative recording is shown displaying tube burst 2 min after ZmES4 application. Bars: 50 µm.</p>

<p>Rapid pollen tube rupture pointed to an osmotic process and, consequently, altered solute transport at the pollen tube plasma membrane. In order to obtain a mechanistic clue about ZmES activity, the membrane potentials of growing pollen tubes were recorded, using the micro-electrode impalement technique. Membrane potentials in the range of −70 to −100 mV (<italic>n</italic> &gt;10) were recorded in fast growing pollen tubes (average −80 mV). In contrast to control substances, ZmES4 application led to a transient membrane depolarization followed by repolarization efforts, but the burst generally occurred within 1 to 2 min before repolarization was achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000388-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). These measurements indicate that ZmES4 application either leads to Cl<sup>−</sup> efflux or H<sup>+</sup> and/or K<sup>+</sup> influx and that ZmES4 target(s) likely represent ion-channel(s).</p>

<p>We aimed to identify ZmES4 target(s) and initially analyzed the secondary and tertiary structure of predicted mature ZmES proteins.

Despite limited overall sequence identity, ZmES DEFLs and related animal toxins contain a conserved structure consisting of an α-helix and a triple-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (in a βαββ configuration) that is stabilized by 3–4 intramolecular disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000388-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Mouhat1">[22]</xref>. Although this core structure is highly conserved, the primary sequence displays little amino acid identity. As a consequence, the surface is highly polymorphic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000388-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) and different from each other, indicating that these proteins bind to different targets. Animal DEFs/toxins related to ZmES containing the described βαββ-structure have been shown to modulate either K<sup>+</sup> or Na<sup>+</sup> ion channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Mouhat1">[22]</xref> by acting as pore blockers or gating modifiers, supporting the assumption of a role for ion channels in ZmES4-mediated pollen-tube rupture.

<p>To study the activity of potassium channels in response to ZmES4 application we expressed several known channels of the plant shaker K<sup>+</sup> channel family of maize in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. This structurally related family consists of three different subgroups: inward rectifying (K<sup>+</sup> uptake) channels, outward rectifying (K<sup>+</sup> release) channels, and weakly voltage dependent channels that conduct outward as well as inward K<sup>+</sup> currents. The rectification properties of these functionally distinct subgroups are based on their voltage dependence. Whereas outward rectifying channels are activating with a time-dependent kinetic upon depolarization, inward rectifying channels are activating with a time-dependent kinetic at hyperpolarized membrane potentials. The third subgroup consists of channels that are only weakly voltage dependent and thus their activation kinetics appear instantaneously. In maize three shaker-like K<sup>+</sup> channels electrophysiologically characterized are shown to be expressed in pollen tubes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000388.s006">Figure S6</xref>). The kinetics of the inward rectifying channel ZMK1 and the weakly voltage-dependent channel ZMK2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Philippar1">[25]</xref> remained unchanged by ZmES4 application (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000388.s007">Figure S7E</xref>). In contrast, the inward rectifying Shaker K<sup>+</sup> channel KZM1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Philippar2">[26]</xref> lost its voltage dependence upon external application of ZmES4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000388-g004">Figure 4B and 4C</xref>). Moreover, KZM1 was inhibited by Cs<sup>+</sup> in a voltage dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000388.s007">Figure S7A</xref>), supporting the finding that ZmES4 induced pollen tube burst could be significantly delayed by Cs<sup>+</sup> application. In line with the properties of a voltage-independent channel, KZM1-mediated K<sup>+</sup> currents appeared with an instantaneous activation kinetic in response to all tested membrane voltages, leading to inward as well as outward K<sup>+</sup> currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000388-g003">Figure 3B and 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000388.s007">Figure S7B</xref>). Interestingly, at membrane potentials more negative than −120 mV the currents in the presence of ZmES4 were smaller than under control conditions. This observation indicates that ZmES4 exhibits a weak inhibitory effect at very negative voltages in addition to its influence on the gating of KZM1. Due to the weak voltage dependence in the presence of ZmES4, the currents reversed at the Nernst potential for potassium. This confirms that the observed ZmES4-induced currents were due to KZM1. Furthermore, the effect of ZmES4 was fully reversible and KZM1 regained voltage dependence and rectification properties upon protein washout (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000388.s007">Figure S7B</xref>). In contrast to ZmES4, 100 µg/ml of the CRP RsAFP2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Terras1">[21]</xref> changed neither the activation kinetics nor the voltage dependence of KZM1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000388.s007">Figure S7C and S7D</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>After the first description of fertilization in flowering plants more than 120 y ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Strasburger1">[4]</xref>, we are now beginning to understand the underlying molecular and physiological mechanisms involved in pollen tube growth arrest and burst leading to sperm discharge and gamete fusion. Here, we described the activity of the synergid cell secreted DEFL protein ZmES4, required for species-preferential pollen tube burst in maize and its activity on the pollen tube expressed potassium channel KZM1. ZmES4 application triggered membrane depolarization and opening of the pollen tube expressed potassium channel KZM1 at physiological conditions before tube burst, which occurred on average within less than a minute. ZmES4 action is very fast, suggesting that a rapid decrease in the cytosolic water potential represents the main physiological cause of pollen tube burst. Moreover, ZmES4 activity was significantly delayed in the presence of Cs<sup>+</sup>, a K<sup>+</sup> channel specific blocker, supporting the finding that changes in potassium fluxes play a central role for pollen tube burst in maize. Indeed, osmotic processes represent important forces driving plant growth, movements, and development. Besides sugars, potassium is the major osmotically active solute to maintain plant cell turgor and drives irreversible cell expansion and reversible changes in cell volume <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Dreyer1">[27]</xref>. Although the potassium concentration in the filiform apparatus, the entry point of the pollen tube inside the embryo sac, is not known, it was shown that synergid cells contain considerably high potassium concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Chaubal1">[28]</xref>. Once released by the degenerating receptive synergid cell, elevated apoplastic potassium concentrations together with a given hyperpolarized pollen tube membrane potential might provide the necessary driving force allowing rapid potassium influx upon K<sup>+</sup> channel opening. This hypothesis is further supported by the observation that high cytosolic potassium concentrations in synergid cells are concomitantly lost with pollen tube discharge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Chaubal1">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>In summary we showed that ZmES4-GFP fusion proteins accumulate before fertilization in vesicles at the secretory zone of mature synergid cells, which have been considered to represent the glandular cells of the female gametophyte <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Dresselhaus2">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Rao1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Davis1">[31]</xref>. Upon pollen tube arrival, vesicles contents seem to be released and disappear within 24 h. Using an RNAi knock-down approach, we found that pollen tubes were guided towards the female gametes but fail to release their contents and occasionally show overgrowth inside the egg apparatus. Using chemically synthesized ZmES4 protein, we further showed that it induced pollen tube rupture in vitro in a species-preferential manner. Moreover, ZmES4 converts the potassium channel KZM1 from a voltage-dependent inward rectifier in a voltage independent, non-rectifying channel. KZM1 is assumed to represent a major housekeeping channel in many tissues and accounts for K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis. KZM1 has also been considered as a mediator of K<sup>+</sup> uptake into the phloem as well as guard cells in the leaf epidermis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Philippar2">[26]</xref>. Pollen tubes have been shown to be especially sensitive to osmotic changes and it is therefore not surprising that a large number of ion channels are involved in osmotic adjustment and K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis and are expressed during pollen development and tube growth (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000388.s006">Figure S6</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Sze1">[32]</xref>. KZM1 is strongly expressed in pollen tubes, but it cannot be excluded that ZmES proteins also act at other pollen tube expressed targets including Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels—a property reminiscent to animal toxins capable of modulating various ion channels simultaneously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Aerts1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Ausubel1">[33]</xref>. However, all described activities are capable to lead to a rapid increase in osmotic pressure in the pollen tube, which ultimately results in pollen tube rupture at its weakest point, the very tip lacking callose containing cell wall material. As a consequence, sperm cells and pollen tube tip factors required for fertilization processes are released explosively into the receptive synergid, a process described previously already at the cellular level in <italic>Torenia fournieri</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Higashiyama1">[34]</xref>. As described above, this process is species-preferential, as ZmES4 strongly modulated KZM1 activity but obviously showed low activity on ion-channels of related <italic>T. dactyloides</italic> pollen tubes and no significant effect on tubes of other plants tested. We discovered an up to now unknown additional species-specific reproductive hybridization barrier that could represent a further component of reproductive isolation and, thus, speciation in plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Dresselhaus2">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Widmer1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Rieseberg1">[36]</xref>. Moreover, this finding opens the possibility to introduce ZmES related CRPs of the DEFL subclass in embryo sac cells or potassium channels in pollen tubes of various grass species to overcome species-specific crossing barriers.</p>
<p>The surface loop that is responsible for species-specific antifungal activity of the plant DEF RsAFP2 has been mapped as C5-C6-loop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Terras1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-DeSamblanx1">[37]</xref>, the same loop that protrudes from the ZmES1 structural model (arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000388-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). This region differs in ZmES1 and ZmES2-4 indicating that ZmES CRPs may indeed target different proteins. Additionally, this region indicates a first sub-domain that could be engineered in order to overcome its species-specific properties.</p>
<p>Considering that the egg apparatus secretes a large cocktail of diverse small CRPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Steffen1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Cordts1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Yang1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-JonesRhoades1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Punwani2">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Sprunck1">[16]</xref>, perhaps more ion channels and/or receptors are affected simultaneously culminating in explosive tube discharge. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that RNAi silencing of the whole <italic>ZmES</italic> family did not lead to the expected 50% reduction of the fertilization rate. However, it also cannot be ruled out that the knock-down effect was indeed 100% efficient. Thus a systematic approach is now required to analyze the functions and activities of the various embryo sac expressed <italic>DEFL</italic> genes on all pollen tube expressed ion channels and other receptors. Interestingly, our findings show that pollen tube growth inhibition and discharge is not only mechanistically related to defense mechanisms against fungal attack, but moreover similar molecular players are involved. While many DEFs are required to protect both plant and animal reproductive tissues from pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Dresselhaus2">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Li1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-RodriguezJimenez1">[39]</xref>, ZmES proteins obviously evolved a novel function, although still possessing low antifungal activity. As indicated above, a large number of <italic>DEFL</italic> genes are also expressed in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>Torenia fournieri</italic> female gametophyte <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Steffen1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Punwani2">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Okuda1">[20]</xref> indicating that the reported physiological mechanism of tube burst might well be conserved in angiosperms and that more <italic>DEFL</italic> genes obtained other functions. Hoverer, due to the polymorphic nature of <italic>DEFL</italic> genes, orthologous genes cannot be predicted and have to be identified experimentally. For example, related <italic>DEFL</italic> genes <italic>LURE1</italic> and <italic>LURE2</italic> from <italic>Torenia fournieri</italic> have recently been shown to encode the female gametophyte secreted attractants of the pollen tube <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Okuda1">[20]</xref> providing further support for the assumption that <italic>DEFL</italic> genes have evolved specific functions during plant reproduction. Interestingly, a similar evolutionary phenomenon has recently been proposed for the FER RLK: a homozygous <italic>fer</italic> mutant in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leads to fungal resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-EscobarRestrepo2">[40]</xref>, although the function of this RLK in the ovule seems to be restricted to pollen tube growth arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-EscobarRestrepo1">[5]</xref>. Thus, after the identification of the first players involved in pollen tube growth arrest and burst, it will now be exciting to find out how the pathways are connected and how they evolved: for example, do FER or LRE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Capron1">[6]</xref> signaling pathways lead to secretion of ZmES1-4 containing vesicles similar to the release of cortical granules of animal species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Mrton2">[41]</xref>? Do ZmES proteins also act on maize homologs of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ACA9 Ca<sup>2+</sup> pumps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000388-Schiott1">[9]</xref> whose activity is also required for pollen tube burst? And finally, can we switch back the evolutionary clock and engineer “reproductive” DEFLs into “defense” DEFLs and vice versa? Systematic approaches to study female gametophyte expressed <italic>DEFL</italic> gene families will provide exciting answers during the next few years.</p>

The size of various genomic PCR products (KZM2, ZMK1, ZMK2, and GAPDH) is larger than that of cDNAs indicating that the cDNA used as a template did not contain genomic DNA. M: 100 bp DNA ladder was used to visualize the length of the amplified DNA fragments.</p>

<p><bold>Reversibility of KZM1 activation by ZmES4 and inhibition of KZM1 currents by Cs<sup>+</sup>.</bold> (A) Instantaneous potassium currents (I<sub>t</sub>) elicited by oocytes expressing KZM1 were inhibited by 5 mM Cs<sup>+</sup> in a voltage dependent manner. Recordings were performed at membrane potentials in the range of +60 to −180 mV in a bath solution containing 95 mM KCl at pH 7.4. Data points of four independent experiments were normalized to the value at −160 mV in control solution. Error bars indicate the standard deviation. (B and C) Whole oocyte currents recorded in 100 mM KCl in the presence and absence of ZmES4 (B) or RsAFP2 (APP in C). Starting from a holding potential of −10 mV a single voltage pulse to −100 mV was applied. Due to the loss of voltage dependence, the application of ZmES4 altered the activation kinetics of KZM1 from a time-dependent activation to a instantaneous activation. Reversion to voltage dependence and time-dependent activation kinetics of KZM1 is observed after washout of ZmES4. In contrast RsAFP2 did not alter the activation kinetics of KZM1. (D) Current voltage relation of KZM1 steady state currents in response to 100 µg/ml RsAFP2. Recordings were performed as follows: currents were evoked upon voltage jumps in the range of +20 to −150 mV in a bath solution containing 100 mM KCl. Data points of four independent experiments were normalized to the value at −150 mV in control solution. Error bars indicate the standard deviation. (E) Application of ZmES4 did not affect kinetics of the maize potassium channels ZMK1 (left panel) or ZMK2 (right panel). Recordings were performed in 100 mM KCl, pH 7.4. Currents were monitored in response to voltage changes ranging from +20 to −170 mV in 10 mV decrements.</p>
