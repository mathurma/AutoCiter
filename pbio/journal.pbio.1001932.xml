<p>Light and electron microscopy of the primary visual cortex of mice indicates that pyramidal neurons connect preferentially to inhibitory neurons.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>One of the hallmarks of neocortical circuits is the predominance of recurrent excitation between pyramidal neurons, which is balanced by recurrent inhibition from smooth GABAergic neurons. It has been previously described that in layer 2/3 of primary visual cortex (V1) of cat and monkey, pyramidal cells filled with horseradish peroxidase connect approximately in proportion to the spiny (excitatory, 95% and 81%, respectively) and smooth (GABAergic, 5% and 19%, respectively) dendrites found in the neuropil. By contrast, a recent ultrastructural study of V1 in a single mouse found that smooth neurons formed 51% of the targets of the superficial layer pyramidal cells. This suggests that either the neuropil of this particular mouse V1 had a dramatically different composition to that of V1 in cat and monkey, or that smooth neurons were specifically targeted by the pyramidal cells in that mouse. We tested these hypotheses by examining similar cells filled with biocytin in a sample of five mice. We found that the average composition of the neuropil in V1 of these mice was similar to that described for cat and monkey V1, but that the superficial layer pyramidal cells do form proportionately more synapses with smooth dendrites than the equivalent neurons in cat or monkey. These distributions may underlie the distinct differences in functional architecture of V1 between rodent and higher mammals.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The mammalian visual cortex, which is part of the cerebral cortex, contains 50 to 100 thousands of neurons per cubic millimetre, most of which are excitatory (85%) and the minority, inhibitory (15%). Unlike neurons in the retina, neurons in the visual cortex are preferentially activated by lines or edges of a particular orientation. This is termed a neuron's “orientation preference.” In the visual cortex of higher mammals like cats and monkeys, neurons that share an orientation preference are clustered in functional columns. However, in rodents like mice, orientation preferences are randomly distributed. In this study, we investigate whether the differences between columnar and non-columnar cortex is correlated with differences in the connectivity patterns between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Using light and electron microscopy, we mapped the connectivity of pyramidal neurons—the primary excitatory neurons—in the superficial layers of the primary visual cortex (V1) of mice. Our results show that the ratio of excitatory-inhibitory neurons in mouse V1 is similar to that of cat or monkey V1, but in mouse V1 local pyramidal neurons target proportionately many more inhibitory neurons compared to what other studies found in cat or monkey. This difference may indicate the significance of inhibition in maintaining orientation selectivity in the non-columnar visual cortex of rodents like mice and is a distinct difference in the architecture of V1 between mice and higher mammals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The concept of the cortical “column” is one of the few organising principles for cortical circuits that we have, yet the characteristic orientation columns in the primary visual cortex (V1) of the cat and monkey appear to be completely absent in rodent V1. In place of the ordered maps of orientation seen in cat and monkey, the distribution of orientation preferences in rodent V1 appears to be essentially random <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Girman1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Roth1">[3]</xref>. This “salt-and-pepper” arrangement in the rodent must reflect differences in the wiring of superficial layer neurons in rodents compared to cat and monkey.</p>
<p>Another striking difference between V1 of mouse and those of cat and monkey is the tuning properties of inhibitory neurons. While in cat and monkey the receptive fields of smooth (putative GABAergic inhibitory) neurons are typically orientation selective <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Gilbert1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Anderson1">[10]</xref>, with only occasional exceptions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Hirsch1">[11]</xref>, in the mouse they are essentially weakly tuned <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Kerlin1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Liu1">[13]</xref> (but see Runyan and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Runyan1">[14]</xref>).</p>
<p>A third striking difference is that neurons in mouse V1 receive many more synapses on average <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Cragg1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Schz1">[16]</xref> than a neuron in primary visual cortex of cat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Beaulieu1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Beaulieu2">[18]</xref> or monkey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Cragg1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-OKusky1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Mouton1">[21]</xref>. In rodent barrel cortex a significant proportion of these synapses are probably contributed by neighbouring pyramidal cells, which form their synapses on the basal dendrites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Koester1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Feldmeyer1">[23]</xref>. In cat, superficial layer pyramidal neurons are estimated to receive more than 60% of the excitatory synapses from their neighbouring pyramidal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Binzegger1">[24]</xref>. This suggests that positive feedback loops are more likely between superficial layer pyramidal cells than between pyramidal cells in other layers, whose principal projections tend to project out of their home layers (see Douglas and Martin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Douglas1">[25]</xref>). By implication, the large number of excitatory synapses per neuron in the mouse may require a stronger component of recurrent inhibition.</p>
<p>Clear evidence for an enhanced inhibitory component in the recurrent circuit came from a recent ultrastructural study by Bock et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Bock1">[26]</xref> designed to investigate whether the broadly tuned receptive fields of GABAergic inhibitory neurons could be explained by the convergence of input from excitatory neurons with different orientation preferences. This work involved partial reconstruction of 13 pyramidal cells and one smooth (putative GABAergic inhibitory) neuron in a single 50 µm thick section of V1 from a mouse that had undergone calcium imaging in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Bock1">[26]</xref>. Their main conclusion was that pyramidal cells of different orientation preferences converged on individual smooth neurons. No synapses were formed between any of the 13 pyramidal cells.</p>
<p>A remarkable statistic from Bock et al. was that 51% of the synapses formed by the pyramidal axons were targeting smooth neurons. This is a staggeringly high proportion, and it implies a very different wiring strategy from the cat or monkey V1, where the proportion of excitatory synapses formed by layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons with smooth neurons is 5% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Kisvrday2">[27]</xref> and 19% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-McGuire1">[28]</xref>, respectively. The results of Bock et al. thus raise the question of whether this arises because there are proportionately more smooth neuron targets in the mouse, or whether pyramidal cells select smooth neurons as their targets in a way they do not in the cat or monkey.</p>
<p>To answer these questions we made detailed analyses not just of the synaptic targets of superficial layer pyramidal cells, but also of the content of the neuropil in mouse V1 in our material, and made the same analyses of the neuropil in the material of Bock et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Bock1">[26]</xref>. Our analyses indicate that the superficial pyramidal cells do not connect randomly to dendrites in the neuropil, as Braitenberg and Schüz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Braitenberg1">[29]</xref> have proposed (and named “Peters' rule”), but instead form a far higher proportion of their synapses with neighbouring smooth neurons than would be expected by chance.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Our goal was to determine the proportion of pyramidal cell synapses with smooth and spiny neurons and to determine whether the composition of the neuropil reflected the proportion of pyramidal axon targets found experimentally. To replicate the results of Bock et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Bock1">[26]</xref>, we used the same mouse strain and, as they did, used in vivo calcium imaging with two-photon microscopy (2PM) to record the responses of V1 neurons to visual stimulation. In contrast to the Bock study, however, we did not reconstruct the unlabelled axons by serial section electron microscopy (EM). Instead, we reduced the load of EM reconstruction considerably by filling individual imaged neurons with biocytin by electroporation after their functional characterization using 2PM, and making a correlated light/electron microscopic examination of their axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001932-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>We successfully characterized the morphology and synaptic ultrastructure of six neurons in layer 2/3 of five mice. The visual tuning properties were obtained for five neurons in five mice. In one mouse, a second serendipitously filled neuron was also reconstructed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001932-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows the steps from imaging to electroporation to recovering the functionally characterised neuron. After 2PM calcium imaging of the neuronal population and functional characterization using drifting gratings, a reliably responsive and selective neuron was selected for electroporation. The white arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001932-g001">Figure 1A</xref> shows the neuron selected, which was tuned for vertically oriented drifting gratings (Circular Variance Index [CVI] = 0.62; Direction Selectivity Index [DSI] = 0.17). We then used targeted electroporation to label this neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001932-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). We observed that the electroporated neuron maintained its selectivity and responsiveness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001932-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001932.s001">Figure S1</xref>). By aligning a stack of 2PM images with the serial 80 µm thick sections imaged with bright field light microscopy (LM), the recorded neuron was identified and recovered for morphological examination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001932-g001">Figure 1D, E</xref>).</p>

The position of the cell body relative to the laminae is indicated by a triangle and the laminar borders are indicated with dashed and dotted lines.

<p>Serial ultrathin sections were taken through the axon to examine 21–31 boutons per neuron. These segments of the axon were correlated with the light microscopy (LM) reconstructions to define the precise position of the synapses and their targets along the axon. A total of 163 boutons were investigated in the EM. They formed a total of 170 synapses (148 boutons formed one synapse, 11 boutons formed two synapses, and four boutons formed no synapses).</p>
<p>The different targets of the pyramidal axons were classified by standard criteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Kisvrday2">[27]</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001932-g003">Figure 3</xref> shows two examples of spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001932-g003">Figure 3A, B</xref>) forming synapses with the biocytin-labelled boutons, which are electron-dense and filled with vesicles. The large postsynaptic density (arrow head) indicates a typical asymmetric synapse formed by pyramidal neurons. Two unlabelled vesicle-filled boutons forming asymmetric synapses are also indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001932-g003">Figure 3A</xref> (arrowheads) for comparison. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001932-g003">Figure 3C</xref> the bouton formed an asymmetric synapse with the dendritic shaft of a smooth neuron. Unlike the dendrites of spiny neurons, where most asymmetric synapses are formed with spines, the asymmetric synapses formed with dendrites of smooth (i.e. spine-free) neurons are naturally found on the shafts (arrow heads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001932-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). In all cases the classification of the targets was made on the basis of serial section analyses of the postsynaptic dendrite.</p>

<p>By reconstructing the axons at the LM level, we were able to identify the particular branch segments that contained the synapses examined with subsequent EM. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001932-g004">Figure 4</xref> shows a summary dendrogram that reveals the branch ordering of the axons and the relative location of the 170 synapses examined on the axons. As in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001932-g002">Figure 2</xref>, the target type is indicated by closed circles for spines and open circles for dendritic shafts. The axon leaving the soma descends vertically before branching and forming collaterals with boutons in layers 2 and 3. The dendrogram shows that the synapses we sampled were found on all orders of the branches, even on the main descending axon.</p>

<p>A total of 126 synapses were formed with spiny neurons (120 formed with dendritic spines and 6 with dendritic shafts) and 44 with dendritic shafts of smooth neurons. The data for each neuron in terms of target type are plotted in the histograms of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001932-g005">Figure 5A</xref>. These histograms show that although spines formed the majority of targets, the variance between individual neurons was surprisingly high. If Peters' rule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Braitenberg1">[29]</xref> applied, we would expect the proportion of different targets to reflect the local average proportions of smooth and spiny neurons in layer 2/3. The question was whether this high variance reflected some local heterogeneities in distribution of targets in the neuropil, or whether it was due to specific targeting of smooth neurons by some pyramidal cells. We tested this using the unbiased disector counting technique (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Sterio1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-DaCosta1">[31]</xref>) to determine the distribution of asymmetric synapses formed with spiny or smooth neurons in the neuropil at the vicinity of each of the reconstructed neurons. These results show that in the neuropil many more synapses were formed with spines than were found for the labelled axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001932-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Next, we explored the possibility that the observed specificity was due to the fact that labelled boutons formed synapses in regions of the neuropil where there were more dendritic shaft targets. Again using the physical disector method we placed a 5 µm×5 µm sampling square centred on labelled boutons (randomly selected boutons indicated by arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001932-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The results plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001932-g005">Figure 5B</xref> show that in the region around any labelled bouton, virtually all the synapses were formed with spines. This was again different from the distribution of targets of the labelled boutons, which formed significantly more synapses with smooth neurons than Peters' rule would predict.</p>

<p>Finally, to test whether the difference in targeting between labelled axons and the unlabelled neuropil could be due to a random process, we ran a simulation of an axon growing through a virtual neuropil and connecting to its targets by chance. The location of targets in the neuropil was uniformly distributed, as found in the large disectors (30 µm×30 µm), and each simulation was performed 10,000 times. When the simulations used the percentage of smooth dendritic targets collected from locations surrounding labelled boutons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001932-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), the Monte Carlo analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001932.s002">Figure S2</xref>) revealed that, with the exception of neuron M20 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.077) the other neurons showed a strong statistical difference (<italic>p</italic> = 0) between the number of inhibitory targets observed experimentally and that predicted from a random process. When the simulations used the percentage of smooth dendritic targets collected from random locations in the neuropil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001932-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), the Monte Carlo analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001932.s003">Figure S3</xref>) revealed that, with the exception of neuron M31 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.48), the other neurons showed strong a statistical difference (<italic>p</italic> = 0) between the number of inhibitory targets observed experimentally and that predicted from a random process.</p>
<p>We also tested whether the biases observed by Bock et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Bock1">[26]</xref> followed the same trend as our data. We applied the unbiased disector method on their web-based data to estimate the proportion of synapses formed with spiny and smooth neurons in the neuropil of the superficial cortical layers of their mouse (pie charts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001932-g006">Figure 6</xref>, right column). We found that 80% of the targets were on spiny dendrites (35 synapses on spines and one on a spiny shaft) and 20% on smooth dendrites (nine synapses). Our analyses of their data indicate that the axons contained in their reconstructed volume targeted far more smooth neurons than would be expected from the composition of the neuropil through which they passed (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001932-g006">Figure 6</xref>, data from imaged neurons in the lower pie chart with disector counts in the upper pie chart). Thus, although on average our labelled neurons formed proportionately fewer synapses with smooth neurons than did those of Bock et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Bock1">[26]</xref>, in both studies the proportion of targeted smooth neurons was far higher than would be expected on the basis of random connectivity. Thus the data from both studies indicate that these superficial layer pyramidal cells in mouse V1 appear to select smooth neurons as their targets.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our goal was to establish whether the salt-and-pepper representation of orientation in rodent V1 is reflected in the synaptic connections formed by the superficial layer pyramidal cells. After 2PM calcium imaging, individual pyramidal neurons were labelled with biocytin, sectioned, and reconstructed with LM. The synaptic targets of their axons as well the synaptic complement of the surrounding neuropil were quantified using EM. Previous physiological studies suggested that pyramidal cells connect specifically to one another <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Yoshimura1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Ko2">[36]</xref> and to GABAergic neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Yoshimura2">[37]</xref>. Moreover, in mouse V1, the probability of pyramidal neurons connecting to neighbouring fast-spiking interneurons is much higher than the probability of pyramidal neurons connecting to each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Hofer1">[38]</xref>. Our data further indicate that pyramidal cells make specific connections with smooth, putative GABAergic neurons.</p>
<p>A previous combined 2PM calcium imaging and electron microscopy study by Bock et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Bock1">[26]</xref> of 13 pyramidal cells in one mouse indicated that the pyramidal cells formed a consistently high proportion (50%) of their synapses with smooth, putative GABAergic neurons. This is an astonishingly high fraction, since more extensive analyses of superficial layer pyramidal cells in V1 of other species indicate that typically 20% or fewer of the synapses are formed on smooth neurons. One explanation for the data from Bock et al. might be that the neuropil of mouse V1 contains a higher proportion of smooth neurons than other species. This seems not to be the explanation since no major differences have been noted in the proportion of pyramidal cells and smooth neurons in the superficial layers of rodent, cat, or monkey V1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Beaulieu3">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Gabbott1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Beaulieu4">[40]</xref>. The critical question is then whether the result obtained from the single section in one mouse by Bock et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Bock1">[26]</xref> is an outlier, or whether it really reflects a wiring strategy to increase the local component of recurrent inhibition in V1.</p>
<p>The composition of the neuropil based on our own samples and those of Bock et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Bock1">[26]</xref> indicates that the superficial layer pyramidal cells in mouse V1 form a significantly higher proportion of their synapses with smooth, putative inhibitory neurons than would be predicted by Peters' rule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Braitenberg1">[29]</xref>, which assumes that axons and dendrites connect in the proportions in which they are found in the neuropil. Our disector counts indicated that virtually all the unlabelled synapses in the neuropil within a 5 µm radius of any of the labelled pyramidal cell boutons were formed with spines, not smooth dendrites. Bock et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Bock1">[26]</xref> concluded that geometry dominates over function, since the proximity of two pyramidal cells, not their receptive field similarity, was the strongest indicator that their axons would converge onto a smooth neuron. However, our own results, and our new analyses of the cortical tissue from Bock et al., indicates that the pyramidal cell connections to smooth neurons are far from being determined purely by geometry, for if geometry were the sole determinant, the pyramidal neurons should connect to smooth neurons in proportion to their occurrence in the neuropil. Instead, some pyramidal cells preferentially formed a subset of their synapses with smooth neurons. What is unexplained, however, is why the variance across the pyramidal cells is so high. In this context it is noteworthy that all the pyramidal cells in the mouse of Bock et al. had consistently high proportions of smooth targets, as did the mouse in which we examined two pyramidal cells. This suggests that the source of variance might not be within the individual, but between individuals of the same strain. These interesting observations across the two studies raise both a warning and an interesting challenge as to how we might discover the principles by which mouse brain wires itself if such high variance does exist between individuals.</p>
<p>Our results and those of Bock et al. have implications for the functional architecture of mouse visual cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001932-g007">Figure 7</xref>) and its operation. If layer 2/3 smooth neurons receive more than their fair share of synapses from local pyramidal cells than would be expected from Peters' rule, this implies that they receive proportionally fewer synapses from other excitatory projections into layers 2 and 3. These other excitatory inputs arise from spiny neurons in layer 4 and 5 of V1 as well as other cortical areas and subcortical nuclei, like the thalamus. By this argument, pyramidal cells then have proportionately fewer synapses to devote to connections to other pyramidal neurons in the same layer. If this is the case, then in layer 2/3 of mouse visual cortex one might expect proportionately less recurrent excitation from within these layers than is present in the cat.</p>

<p>Smooth neurons, like basket cells and chandelier cells, form their axonal arbours largely within the same layer as the cell body. Therefore, the smooth neurons targeted by our labelled pyramidal cell axons most likely are recurrently inhibiting the pyramidal cells that excite them. The fact that in mouse the smooth neurons have more convergent input from neurons with a variety of orientation tuning produces a circuit configuration that is very reminiscent of a winner-take-all (WTA) circuit. In this circuit, excitatory neurons have a map of some parameter (e.g. orientation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Ko1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Ko2">[36]</xref>), and the inhibitory neurons receive input from all excitatory neurons in the map and provide inhibition proportional to the overall excitation in the circuit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Douglas2">[41]</xref>.</p>
<p>While this study focuses on mouse V1, previous work on superficial layer pyramidal cells in V1 of cat and monkey gave dramatically different results to those presented here. In monkey V1, McGuire et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-McGuire1">[28]</xref> have shown that the axons of intracellularly filled layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons formed 19% of their targets with smooth dendritic shafts (28% if one considers spiny and dendritic shafts). As we did, McGuire et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-McGuire1">[28]</xref> analysed the neuropil surrounding one of their neurons, but unlike us found no evidence for preferential targeting of smooth GABAergic neurons by the superficial layer pyramidal neurons (see also Beaulieu and colleagues for other counts of targets in monkey V1 neuropil <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Beaulieu3">[20]</xref>).</p>
<p>In cat V1, Kisvarday et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Kisvrday2">[27]</xref> found that the axons of intracellularly filled layer 3 pyramidal neurons formed only 5% of their synapses with GABAergic neurons. They did not analyse the neuropil surrounding the labelled neurons, but in a different study Beaulieu and Colonnier analysed the neuropil of cat layer 2/3 of and found that 18% (mean of layers 2, 3A, and 3B) of the asymmetric synapses are formed with dendritic shafts, some of which may be of spiny neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Beaulieu2">[18]</xref>. These data strongly suggested that in cat there is no preferential targeting of inhibition by layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, unlike what we, and Bock et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Bock1">[26]</xref>, now find for mouse V1. This was also the conclusion of a theoretical study by Stepanyants and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Stepanyants1">[42]</xref>, who found that the results of Kisvarday et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Kisvrday2">[27]</xref> were consistent with Peters' rule. The conclusion of Stepanyants et al. makes it very clear that in the cat the proportion of GABAergic smooth neurons that are targets of superficial layer pyramidal axons is well below that of the mouse V1.</p>
<p>One idea for the generation of orientation “columns” in cat is that the orientation selectivity of neurons is created in layer 4 and then simply fed-forward to neurons in the superficial and deep layers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Hubel1">[43]</xref>. In the macaque monkey, the situation is somewhat different, because most layer 4C neurons have non-oriented receptive fields, whereas neurons in the superficial and deep layers are orientation selective and form an orderly map of orientation, as in the cat. Development of the acolumnar salt-and-pepper arrangement of rodent V1 demands a high degree of specificity if it were to be achieved by feed-forward connections alone. Here, the stronger bias in the connections to smooth cells in the mouse may reflect increased demands on the inhibitory circuitry to shape the receptive field mediated by the superficial layer pyramidal cells.</p>

<title>Animal Preparation</title>
<p>All animal procedures were carried out according to the guidelines of the University of Zurich, and were approved by the Cantonal Veterinary Office. C57BL/6 mice (2–4 months old, of either sex) were either first sedated with chlorprothixene (Sigma; 0.2 mg/mouse) and anaesthetized with urethane (0.5–1.0 g/kg) or anaesthetized by 2.7 ml/kg of a solution containing one part fentanyl citrate and fluanisone (Hypnorm; Janssen-Cilag, UK) and one part midazolam (Hypnovel; Roche, Switzerland) in two parts of water, both delivered by intraperitoneal injections. Atropine (0.3 mg/kg) and dexamethasone (2 mg/kg) were administered subcutaneously to reduce secretions and oedema. Lactate-Ringer solution was regularly injected subcutaneously to prevent dehydration. Pinch reflexes were used to assess the depth of anaesthesia.</p>

<title>Two-Photon Guided Staining</title>
<p>The location of the primary visual area, V1, was determined by stereotaxic coordinates (V1 monocular segment – 1.0 mm anterior to lambda and 2.5 mm lateral from the midline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Coleman1">[44]</xref>) and confirmed by subsequent intrinsic imaging. Briefly, the skull above the estimated visual cortex was carefully thinned until a noticeable transparency of the bone was achieved. We then illuminated the cortical surface with 630-nm LED light, presented drifting gratings for 5 s, and collected reflectance images through a 4× objective with a CCD camera (Toshiba TELI CS3960DCL). Intrinsic signal changes were analysed as fractional reflectance changes relative to the pre-stimulus average. V1 was the largest area active during visual stimulation at a location in accordance with stereotaxic coordinates.</p>
<p>After identification with intrinsic imaging, a small craniotomy (from 500 µm×500 µm to 1 mm×1 mm) was opened above V1, the dura removed and the exposed cortex superfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) (135 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 5 mM Hepes, 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.2, with NaOH). Calcium indicator loading was performed using the “multi cell bolus loading” technique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Stosiek1">[45]</xref>. Briefly, 50 µg of the acetoxymethyl (AM) ester form of the calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye Oregon Green BAPTA-1 (OGB-1; Invitrogen, Basel, Switzerland) were dissolved in 2 µl of DMSO plus 20% Pluronic F-127 (BASF, Germany) and diluted with 37 µl standard pipette solution (150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.2) yielding a final OGB-1 concentration of about 1 mM. 1 µl of Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen; 2 mM stock solution in distilled water) was added for visualization of the pipette during 2PM guided staining. The dye was pressure ejected under visual control through a glass pipette (4–5 MΩ) at a depth between 150–300 µm to stain layer 2/3 neurons. Brief application of sulforhodamine 101 (SR101; Invitrogen) to the exposed neocortical surface resulted in co-labelling of the astrocytic network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Nimmerjahn1">[46]</xref>.

<title>Visual Stimulation</title>
<p>Visual stimuli were presented on a 7-inch TFT monitor (75 Hz refresh rate) 7 cm in front of the right eye roughly at 60° along the body axis of the anesthetized mouse. For the majority of the study, the visual stimuli were full contrast square wave gratings generated by the VisionEgg software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Straw1">[47]</xref> moving for 3 s in eight different directions spaced by 5 s blank (grey screen presentation). The temporal frequency (TF) was 0.5 to 1 Hertz (Hz) and spatial frequency (SF) was 0.02 to 0.05 cycles per degree (cyc/°), which have been shown to activate most neurons. For one animal, the stimulation used was full contrast square wave gratings moving back and forth during 4 s for each of four orientations.</p>

<p>Calcium transients were acquired using a custom-built two-photon microscope equipped with a 40× water immersion objective (LUMPlanFl/IR; 0.8 NA; Olympus 2). 128×128 pixel frames or 256×256 pixel frames were acquired at rates from 2 to 4 Hz using custom written software (LabView; National Instruments, USA).</p>

<title>Calcium Signal Analysis</title>
<p>Data were analysed with ImageJ (National Institute of Mental Health, NIH) and MATLAB (Mathworks). Cells were detected manually by drawing a region of interest around cell bodies. Relative percentage changes in fluorescence (ΔF/F) were calculated using as baseline the blank just before each stimulation. Traces were filtered using a Savitzky-Golay filtering approach. Responses were calculated by averaging 3–6 points around the peak fluorescence change (time window of 1.5 s around the peak) for each stimulation epoch.</p>

<title>Circular Variance</title>
<p>We defined a selectivity criterion using circular variance over gratings responses. Circular variance is defined as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001932.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>θ</italic> is the average drift direction of the grating:<disp-formula id="pbio.1001932.e002"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001932.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>This measure of circular variance combines aspects of amplitude modulation and tuning width and takes into account all the responses to each direction of drift <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Ringach1">[48]</xref>. To use it as an index comparable to orientation selectivity indexes, the values given in this manuscript are 1 – circular variance (see Niell and Stryker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Niell1">[49]</xref>) referred to in the text as CVI, for Circular Variance Index). Consequently, a perfectly tuned neuron would have a CVI value close to 1, and a perfectly untuned neuron close to 0.

<title>Targeted Electroporation</title>
<p>Glass pipettes of resistance from 4 to 6 MΩ were filled with a standard pipette solution containing 2%–5% biocytin. These concentrations of biocytin were reached by mixing 4% biocytin (ε-Biotinoyl-L-Lysine; Invitrogen) diluted in some cases with the red dye Alexa 594 (20 µM; Invitrogen) with a solution of 0.8 to 1.5% 5-(and-6)-Tetramethylrhodamine biocytin (Biocytin TMR; Invitrogen).</p>
<p>The tip of the pipette was placed near the selected neuron for electroporation and a loose seal was formed to record extracellular spikes. Spikes were recorded at 5 kHz using a patch-clamp amplifier (npi, Reutlingen, Germany) and Spike2 software (CED, Cambridge, UK). Once a stable configuration was reached, pulses from 300 to 400 mV of 10 ms duration were applied until successful electroporation was verified visually by uptake of the red indicator dye. In addition, we verified in some experiments the viability of the neuron by retesting the responses to visual stimulation after a recovery period of 10–20 min. This recovery period allows sufficient time for the pores formed during the electroporation to reseal, which usually occurs within 1 min <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Nevian1">[50]</xref>.</p>

<title>Perfusion and Histology</title>
<p>At the end of the experiment the mouse was given an extra dose of anaesthesia and perfused transcardially with normal 0.9% NaCl solution, followed by a warm solution of 4% paraformaldehyde (w/v), 0.5% glutaraldehyde (v/v) and 15% saturated solution of picric acid (v/v) in 0.1 M PB pH 7.4. After fixation the mouse was perfused with solutions of 10%, 20%, and 30% sucrose in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB). Once the brain was removed it was allowed to sink in a 30% sucrose solution in 0.1 M PB to provide cryoprotection and then freeze-thawed in liquid nitrogen. The brains were then washed in 0.1 M PB for at least 2 h to allow them to recover from the shrinkage provoked by the incubation in sucrose solution. Sections containing V1 were cut at 80 µm in the coronal plane and collected in 0.1 M PB. After cutting, the sections were washed several times in buffer in order to remove any remaining fixative. To reveal biocytin the sections were washed in TBS and then incubated overnight (5°C) with an avidin-biotin complex (Vector ABC kit – Elite). The peroxidase activity was identified using 3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) with nickel intensification. After assessment by LM, regions of tissue containing the imaged area were treated with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M PB, dehydrated through alcohols (1% uranyl acetate in the 70% alcohol) and propylene oxide, and flat mounted in Durcupan (Fluka) on glass slides.</p>

<p>We would like to thank Stefan Roth for providing the original code to run the Monte Carlo simulation and to German Koestinger for help implementing it. We would also like to thank the Clay Reid lab in Harvard, specially Davi D. Bock and Wei-Chung Lee, the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, and the Open Connectome Project for making the dataset from Bock et al. (2011) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001932-Bock1">[26]</xref> available for our estimations of the percentage of dendritic targets.</p>
