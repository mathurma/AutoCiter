				<article-title>When Skin Damage Causes Death</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>Epidermal keratinocytes form a highly organized stratified epithelium and sustain a competent barrier function together with dermal and hematopoietic cells. The Notch signaling pathway is a critical regulator of epidermal integrity. Here, we show that keratinocyte-specific deletion of total Notch signaling triggered a severe systemic B-lymphoproliferative disorder, causing death. RBP-j is the DNA binding partner of Notch, but both RBP-j–dependent and independent Notch signaling were necessary for proper epidermal differentiation and lipid deposition. Loss of both pathways caused a persistent defect in skin differentiation/barrier formation. In response, high levels of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) were released into systemic circulation by Notch-deficient keratinocytes that failed to differentiate, starting in utero. Exposure to high TSLP levels during neonatal hematopoiesis resulted in drastic expansion of peripheral pre- and immature B-lymphocytes, causing B-lymphoproliferative disorder associated with major organ infiltration and subsequent death, a previously unappreciated systemic effect of TSLP. These observations demonstrate that local skin perturbations can drive a lethal systemic disease and have important implications for a wide range of humoral and autoimmune diseases with skin manifestations.</p>

          <title/>
          <p>Skin is the largest organ of the body, forming an elaborate barrier that prevents water loss and protects the internal environment from outside invaders. When this barrier is compromised, keratinocytes, keratin-producing epidermal cells, alert and recruit the immune cells to the site of the breach as part of an adaptive defense mechanism. However, chronic activation of such an “alarm” could have undesired consequences. Using genetic engineering to progressively remove components of Notch signaling from mouse skin in utero resulted in chronic skin-barrier defects, mimicking a form of human skin disease called atopic dermatitis. Surprisingly, we discovered that a persistent alarm signal in newborns triggered a systemic B-lymphoproliferative disorder, which precisely mirrored the degree of skin defect and was lethal in its extreme form. This alarm signal, in the form of a cytokine called thymic stromal lymphopoietin, was produced by Notch-deficient keratinocytes that failed to form a competent skin barrier. Therefore, we uncovered a long-range proliferative effect on fetal pre-B cells in vivo that is induced by injured skin and mediated by thymic stromal lymphopoietin. These findings highlight the central role that skin-derived factors can play in initiating systemic diseases with skin involvement.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The vertebrate skin is an organ in which keratinocytes, underlying mesenchymal cells, and circulating hematopoietic cells engage in reciprocal communication as they monitor organ integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b001">1</xref>]. Therefore, skin is an ideal system in which to study how complex, multicompartmental networks function. Epidermal keratinocytes are organized in several distinct layers with the innermost (basal) layer containing the stem cells and transiently amplifying cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b002">2</xref>]. The next layer contains spinous cells that, under normal conditions, begin a terminal differentiation program, giving rise to granular and cornified layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b004">4</xref>]. However, after injury, spinous cells proliferate to contribute to the restoration of an intact integument and produce cytokines that trigger an inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b001">1</xref>]. Defects in execution of this terminal differentiation program can lead to what are collectively known as skin-barrier defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b005">5</xref>].</p>
      <p>Notch activation contributes to spinous cell differentiation. Loss of canonical Notch signaling, induced by deletion of the <italic>RBPSUH</italic> gene (coding for RBP-j, the DNA binding partner of Notch), causes severe epidermal barrier and differentiation defects highlighted by reduced spinous, granular, and cornified layer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b006">6</xref>]. However, overexpression of activated Notch1 exclusively in basal cells under the <italic>K14</italic> promoter triggers their premature differentiation into spinous cells, concomitant with loss of proliferative capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b006">6</xref>]. The pattern of Notch1 activation in epidermal keratinocytes is consistent with its proposed role in suppressing basal cell proliferation and promoting spinous cell differentiation via cell autonomous modulation of targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b011">11</xref>]. However, overexpression of activated Notch1 in the differentiated spinous cells (where it is normally present) triggers basal cell hyperproliferation and formation of acanthotic epidermis with a thickened granular layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b012">12</xref>], indicating that the Notch signaling pathway has a complex role by not only promoting differentiation and exit from the basal layer but also by contributing in a non-cell autonomous fashion to skin homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b013">13</xref>]. How Notch performs its functions within spinous cells is a matter of some controversy, and multiple autonomous mechanisms have been proposed, including both canonical and noncanonical pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b011">11</xref>].</p>
      <p>To study the role of Notch signaling in skin homeostasis and barrier formation, we used the <italic>Msx2-Cre</italic> line to delete components of the Notch signaling pathway in skin keratinocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b014">14</xref>]. A burst of <italic>Msx2-Cre</italic> expression on embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) creates chimeric skin with dorsal and ventral patches (clones) lacking floxed alleles, confining the consequences of gene loss only to a fraction of the surface area (for a detailed analysis of <italic>Msx2-Cre</italic> expression in skin, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b015">15</xref>]). This allows animals lacking total Notch signaling to survive through birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060123-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). With this system, we have shown previously that Notch loss also involves non-cell autonomous alteration in transforming growth factor ß and insulin-like growth factor signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b015">15</xref>]. Removal of both Notch1 and Notch2 proteins or both presenilin-1 (PS1) and presenilin-2 (PS2) proteins (the catalytic subunits of γ-secretase) within epidermal clones is sufficient to cause early postnatal lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b014">14</xref>]. In the current study, we investigated the mechanistic basis for this early demise.</p>

Like interleukin 7 (IL-7), TSLP can support B cell development; however, the in vivo effects of high TSLP levels on B-lymphopoiesis are not fully understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b017">17</xref>]. A perinatal increase in TSLP levels produced a dose-dependent expansion of pre- and immature B cells in the periphery, causing a B-lymphoproliferative disorder (B-LPD), a previously unappreciated effect of TSLP. In its extreme form, B-LPD complications, including B cell infiltration into vital organs, culminated in death. Therefore, this study provides the first physiological confirmation that skin perturbation can cause a lethal systemic disease.</p>

Surprisingly, we found that mice from both genotypes had extremely high white blood cell (WBC) counts (&gt;150,000 cells/μl) at around the time of death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060123-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). Importantly, analysis of an extensive Notch allelic series revealed that the severity of the leukocytosis during the first few weeks of life was correlated inversely with Notch dosage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060123-g001">Figure 1</xref>C).</p>
        <p>To characterize the cells causing leukocytosis, we analyzed various hematopoietic parameters in Notch-deficient mice. Peripheral blood analysis showed that the leukocytosis in both N1N2CKO and PSDCKO animals was of a lymphoblastic/lymphocytic nature; hence the mice displayed a severe case of lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060123-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). This LPD was accompanied by the failure of bone marrow (BM) to participate in normal hematopoiesis, as demonstrated by reduced red blood cells and platelets (normocytic anemia and thrombocytopenia; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060123-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Because the blood phenotypes of N1N2CKO and PSDCKO mice were similar, we use the term “mutant” to describe the common LPD features of both genotypes and “wild type” for all genetic combinations that either lack <italic>Cre</italic> or carry <italic>Msx2-Cre</italic> and a wild-type allele of <italic>PS1</italic>. Macroscopic examination showed that mutant mice were smaller than their wild-type littermates and had enlarged spleen and lymph nodes but smaller than normal thymus, suggesting that the expanding lymphocytes are of B cell origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060123-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060123-st001">Table S1</xref>).

These observations suggested that extreme B-LPD could be the cause of death in PSDCKO and N1N2CKO animals.</p>

        <title>RBP-j–Independent (but γ-Secretase–Dependent) Notch Signaling in the Skin Contributes to Longevity</title>
        <p>Unexpectedly, <italic>Msx2</italic>-<italic>Cre</italic>/+; <italic>RBP-j<sup>flox</sup></italic><sup>/<italic>flox</italic></sup> (RBP-jCKO) mice lived significantly longer (95 days on average) and showed lower WBC counts (∼70,000 cells/μl) compared to mice lacking Notch receptors or γ-secretase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060123-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060123-g001">1</xref>C). Although we could not exclude the possibility that <italic>Cre</italic>-mediated deletion of <italic>RBPSUH</italic> is marginally less efficient than that of <italic>PS1</italic> or <italic>Notch1</italic> and <italic>Notch2</italic>, examination of RBP-j protein in RBP-jCKO animals confirmed its loss in keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060123-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). If RBP-j could actively repress some target genes in the absence of Notch signaling and this repression would be lost upon RBP-j deletion, then the milder RBP-j phenotype could be explained by de-repression of some targets that ameliorated the phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b018">18</xref>]. Alternatively, the Notch pathway may have bifurcated; RBP-j-independent (yet γ-secretase-dependent) targets of Notch in skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b019">19</xref>] may contribute to the severity of the phenotypes reported here. To distinguish between these possibilities, mice that lack both γ-secretase and RBP-j in the skin were generated (<italic>Msx2-Cre</italic>/+; <italic>PS1<sup>flox</sup></italic><sup>/<italic>flox</italic></sup>; <italic>PS2</italic><sup>–/–</sup>; <italic>RBP-j<sup>flox</sup></italic><sup>/<italic>flox</italic></sup>; PSDRBP-jCKO). In this genetic experiment, de-repressed targets should suppress the PSDCKO phenotype (i.e., PSDRBP-jCKO would display the RBP-jCKO phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b018">18</xref>]). However, if RBP-j-independent targets of Notch contribute to the life span and leukocytosis, then the γ-secretase mutation should be epistatic to RBP-j (i.e., the animal will have the PSDCKO phenotype). A combination of both would be expected to produce an intermediate phenotype.</p>
        <p>The PSDRBP-jCKO mice lost RBP-j yet had the same life expectancy as PSDCKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060123-g001">Figure 1</xref>B) and had WBC counts comparable to those of PSDCKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060123-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), a result inconsistent with target de-repression. To confirm that these outcomes were Notch-dependent but RBP-j-independent, we also created the triple mutant <italic>Msx2-Cre</italic>/+; <italic>N1<sup>flox</sup></italic><sup>/<italic>flox</italic></sup>; <italic>N2<sup>flox</sup></italic><sup>/<italic>flox</italic></sup>; <italic>RBP-j<sup>flox</sup></italic><sup>/<italic>flox</italic></sup> (N1N2RBP-jCKO). As with PSDRBP-jCKO animals, the life span of N1N2RBP-jCKO animals was not prolonged by removal of RBP-j (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060123-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060123-g001">1</xref>C), indicating that a Notch-dependent activity contributes to the phenotype. This suggested that canonical Notch signaling could not be the sole determinant of the phenotypes described and instead supports the alternative assertion that RBP-j-independent effects of Notch in the skin may contribute to leukocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b020">20</xref>].

        <title>Drastic but Transient Expansion of B-Lymphocytes Results in Severe Systemic Complications in Notch-Deficient Animals</title>
        <p>To understand B-LPD progression better, the WBC count from mutant animals was measured over their life span (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060123-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). The WBC counts increased exponentially over the first 2 weeks starting at around P4 but plateaued during the third week of life within the same time window when most mutant animals expired. However, to our surprise, the longest surviving mice showed a trend toward normalization of their WBC counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060123-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). A reduction in peripheral B cell number (and thus normalization of WBC count) was more evident in animals with partial loss of Notch signaling and in the longer living RBP-jCKO mice (unpublished data). Accompanying the surge in peripheral WBC count, B220<sup>+</sup> B cells expanded the spleen (splenomegaly) and infiltrated several vital organs including lung and liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060123-g002">Figure 2</xref>E, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060123-g002">2</xref>F, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060123-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A). To characterize the identity of the expanding cells in B-LPD further, two additional markers, CD43 and IgM, were applied to segregate pro-, pre-, and immature B cell populations by FC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060123-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). The FC analysis showed that pre-B cells (B220<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>–</sup>IgM<sup>–</sup>) constituted the majority of the expanding population in both BM and periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060123-g003">Figure 3</xref>B, red ovals). Immature B cells also expanded, as would be expected if differentiation of pre- to immature B cells persisted in the mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060123-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). The ability of pre-B cells to differentiate and the high WBC counts reached at an early age are consistent with a polyclonal origin of this B-LPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b021">21</xref>]. Large expansion of immature B cells was associated with elevated IgM levels, which precipitated at low temperature, a condition known as cryoglobulinemia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060123-sg002">Figure S2</xref>B). Overall, despite the short duration of B-LPD in Notch-deficient mice, we hypothesized that extremely high WBC count, leukostasis, cryoglobulinemia, anemia, and infiltration of B cells into vital organs conspired with the skin phenotype to produce cachexic mice that failed to thrive during the early stages of postnatal development.</p>

        <title>Blocking B-LPD Prevents Early Lethality in the Mutant Mice</title>
        <p>To determine whether B-LPD was an important contributor to early death, we performed an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) experiment with mutant animals as the recipients. Lethally irradiated mutant mice transplanted with BM derived from their wild-type littermates around postnatal day 10 (P10) lived significantly longer than their untransplanted counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060123-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). However, the transplanted mutants still died within a few weeks after transplantation, this time because of severe skin phenotypes including exfoliation, bleeding, inflammation, and infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060123-sg002">Figure S2</xref>C). When treated with systemic antibiotics, the life span of transplanted N1N2CKO animals was extended further and became comparable to that of RBP-jCKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060123-g004">Figures 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060123-g001">1</xref>B). However, antibiotic treatment of PSDCKO mice did not extend further their life span due to the greater severity of skin disease in these animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060123-sg002">Figure S2</xref>C).

In the N1N2CKO group, three mice that are transplanted with wild-type BM also receive daily antibiotic treatment after BMT, leading to their significantly longer life span compared to other transplanted mutants (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, log rank test). B-LPD does not recur in the transplanted mutant animals shown by (B) their persistently low WBC count during their post-BMT life (data are drawn from four animals in each genetic group) and (C) on average lower B220<sup>+</sup> B cell percentage in their blood as compared to the wild-type recipients, measured 25 d after transplantation (four PSDCKO and four wild-type littermates are compared).

        <p>The observations detailed above suggested that if B-LPD was controlled, then life expectancy of the mutant animals could be increased significantly. Indeed, either a sublethal dose of total body irradiation (∼450 cGy) or focal irradiation of the mutant animals extended their life span. In both cases, life expansion correlated with a delay in B-LPD surge (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060123-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). Taken together, these experiments strongly demonstrated that B-LPD, acquired by animals with Notch- or γ-secretase-deficient skin, was a critical mediator of early lethality. However, the short life expectancy of transplanted mutants and RBP-jCKO was related to their skin disease, infection, and granulocyte/monocyte expansion, which again occurred in a Notch dose-dependent manner and in all adult animals lacking canonical Notch signaling (unpublished data and Dr. Freddy Radtke, personal communication).</p>

        <title>B-LPD Is a Non-Autonomous Consequence of Losing Notch or γ-Secretase in Skin Keratinocytes</title>
        <p>Considering the importance of Notch signaling at various stages of lymphopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b023">23</xref>] and the potential for ectopic expression of <italic>Msx2-Cre</italic> in a hematopoietic organ, we asked whether deletion of Notch in BM or any hematopoietic organ might have caused B-LPD. To map the sites of <italic>Msx2-Cre</italic> activity thoroughly, we applied the following approaches.</p>
        <p>First, using a PCR protocol designed to detect the deleted allele of <italic>PS1</italic> (<italic>PS1</italic><sup>Δ</sup>), we confirmed that neither hematopoietic cells nor any hematopoiesis-related organ experienced <italic>Cre</italic>-mediated deletion of <italic>PS1</italic> in PSDCKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060123-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). Of note, we collected peripheral blood from the mutant animals at peak WBC counts, which thus was composed mostly (&gt;90%) of expanding B cells, but still found no evidence of PS1 deletion. To rule out the possibility that loss of Notch signaling in a small subset of BM stromal cells could drive B cell expansion in the mutant animals, we re-analyzed <italic>Prx1</italic>-<italic>Cre</italic>; <italic>PS1<sup>flox</sup></italic><sup>/<italic>flox</italic></sup>; <italic>PS2</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice in which <italic>Cre</italic> is active in BM stroma, the osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b025">25</xref>], and the osteoclasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b026">26</xref>]. The WBC analysis in all these mice showed no sign of B cell expansion (unpublished data), indicating that another organ provided the trigger for B-LPD. Next, we analyzed two reporter lines, <italic>Msx2</italic>-<italic>Cre</italic>; <italic>ZEG</italic>/+ and <italic>Msx2</italic>-<italic>Cre</italic>; <italic>Rosa26R</italic>/+. Only the skin was marked by these reporters (unpublished data) with no detectable reporter staining in any hematopoietic lineage or organ. Together, these findings led us to hypothesize that B-LPD was driven non-autonomously in wild-type B cells as a consequence of reduced Notch signaling in the skin.</p>
        <p>To test this hypothesis, we applied the allogeneic BMT paradigm to ask whether hematopoietic stem cells isolated from the mutant animals could propagate B-LPD in normal recipients. The BM derived from mutant or wild-type littermates was equally competent in its ability to engraft in lethally irradiated wild-type littermate hosts and reconstitute a complete hematopoietic system that sustained a normal WBC count in the recipient animals over several months of follow-up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060123-g004">Figure 4</xref>E). The PCR analysis confirmed the complete repopulation of the recipients' hematopoietic system by donor-derived BM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060123-sg005">Figure S5</xref>B). In addition, BM transplanted from mutant or wild-type animals into sublethally irradiated nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice were indistinguishable in their ability to rescue the recipients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060123-sg006">Figure S6</xref>). Collectively, these findings confirmed the non-autonomous nature of B-LPD and implicated the skin as the primary organ responsible for the disease in Notch/γ-secretase-deficient animals.</p>

        <title>Increasing TSLP Levels Is Sufficient To Cause B-LPD in Mice but Only during the First Weeks of Life</title>
        <p>Collectively, RNA and protein analyses created a consistent picture pointing to TSLP as the likely candidate satisfying most of the criteria for the B-LPD-inducing agent: sensitivity to reduction in Notch dose, systemic availability, and the ability to promote B cell development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b027">27</xref>]. However, such a proliferative role for TSLP has not been demonstrated previously. To satisfy Koch's postulate for disease causation, we injected recombinant mouse TSLP into wild-type mice. Daily injection of the animals with TSLP starting at birth and continuing for 7 days led to a dose-dependent elevation of WBC count (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060123-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). The FC analysis on peripheral blood from the mice injected with TSLP identified the expanding cell population as B220<sup>+</sup> B-lymphocytes, not seen in mice receiving carrier alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060123-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). Further analysis of peripheral blood from wild-type mice receiving 1 μg of TSLP identified the expanding B cell population as pre- and immature B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060123-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). Injecting wild-type animals with 1 μg of TSLP daily resulted in steady-state serum TSLP levels of ∼250 pg/ml, comparable to that in N1CKO animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060123-g006">Figures 6</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060123-g005">5</xref>D, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060123-sg009">Figure S9</xref>).

        <p>To ask if B-LPD represented the confluence of high TSLP with a responding, fetal pre-B cell population, we performed fetal liver transplantation (FLT) into lethally irradiated mutant animals.

To ask if continuous exposure to high TSLP levels sustained a responding pre-B cell population, we performed a third allogeneic BMT experiment in which BM from the mutant animals was transplanted into their lethally irradiated mutant littermates (which continued to produce high TSLP levels, unpublished data). Again, the donor-derived BM reconstituted normal adult hematopoiesis in the recipients, curing their B-LPD, consistent with the limited temporal window in which B-LPD can develop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060123-g004">Figure 4</xref>A).

        <p>To further ascertain if <italic>TSLP</italic> overexpression is a consequence of Notch loss or a consequence of defective differentiation/barrier formation, we isolated keratinocytes from mutant and wild-type pups and measured TSLP in the culture medium of cells grown on plastic.

Because NFκB signaling, a potent inducer of differentiation, can activate TSLP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b032">32</xref>], we asked if this pathway was responsible for <italic>TSLP</italic> expression in cultured keratinocytes.

To solidify the conclusion that TSLP overproduction is a readout of failed differentiation and not a specific repressed target of Notch signaling, we analyzed <italic>wrfr</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice that lack fatty acid transport protein 4 (FATP4) and die at birth because of severe epidermal differentiation and skin-barrier defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b034">34</xref>].

        <title>Skin-Specific Deletion of Notch Signaling Leads to a Lethal B-LPD</title>
        <p>This report details the mechanism by which a local perturbation to the skin induced a lethal systemic disease. We demonstrate that progressive loss of Notch signaling in the embryonic ectoderm caused a dose-dependent impairment of epidermal differentiation and reduced lipid biogenesis, stimulating keratinocytes to secrete excess TSLP into systemic circulation. The pathophysiological consequence of persistent differentiation/barrier defects and the subsequent accumulation of TSLP had a potent proliferative effect on fetal/newborn B-lymphopoiesis, causing an exceptional expansion of pre- and immature B cell populations in newborn animals (i.e., neonatal B-LPD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060123-g008">Figure 8</xref>). A severe B-LPD with its systemic complications including infiltration of B cells into various vital organs, anemia, and cryoglobulinemia explained the early death of the animals lacking total (canonical and noncanonical) Notch signaling in the skin. Indeed, we were able to extend the life span of the mutant newborn animals simply by suppressing their B-LPD through either BMT or sublethal or focal irradiation administered before the onset of full-blown B-LPD in the second week of life. The ameliorating effects of these treatments also reflect the fact that pre-B cells emerging in the adult BM niche are refractory to high TSLP levels (see below).</p>

        <title>Novel Function of TSLP Explains the Main Features of B-LPD in Notch-Deficient Newborns</title>
        <p>A growing body of work has provided extensive evidence that <italic>TSLP</italic> overexpression in skin or lung epithelia can cause local allergic inflammation and subsequent development of atopic dermatitis and asthma, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b036">36</xref>]. However, the systemic consequences of <italic>TSLP</italic> overexpression were not clear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b037">37</xref>]. In this report, we describe the mice in which defects in skin differentiation drive endogenous <italic>TSLP</italic> expression, beginning before birth. We find that TSLP levels are correlated directly with the degree of disruption in differentiation. This enabled us to recognize a novel consequence for TSLP elevation unique to fetal/newborn hematopoiesis and to ascribe TSLP production to failure in skin differentiation rather than its cause, as high levels of TSLP did not alter skin differentiation in newborn <italic>K14-TSLP<sup>tg</sup></italic> mice.</p>
        <p>It has been recognized that TSLP has a differential effect on fetal versus adult B-lymphopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b038">38</xref>], despite the presence of fully functional TSLP receptors on both fetal and adult B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b039">39</xref>]. In addition, in vitro results show that a liver-derived fetal pre-B cell line, NAG8/7, but not a BM-derived adult pre-B cell line, IxN/2B, proliferate in response to TSLP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b040">40</xref>]. Consistent with these findings, we demonstrate that endogenously overexpressed or exogenously supplied TSLP, delivered during the perinatal period, lead to B-LPD and the appearance of a substantial number of pre-B cells (B220<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>–</sup>IgM<sup>–</sup>) in the periphery in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060123-sg009">Figure S9</xref>). Transition from fetal/newborn to adult hematopoiesis occurs during the second week of life in the mouse BM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b041">41</xref>]. We find that persistently high levels of TSLP do not produce B-LPD after this transition, explaining why B-LPD has not been detected in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b037">37</xref>]. The narrow window in which TSLP can drive pre-B cell expansion explains why B-LPD in Notch-deficient and <italic>K14-TSLP<sup>tg</sup></italic> animals is (1) confined to the first few weeks of life, (2) disappears in animals that experience a less severe disease, and (3) does not recur in the mutant mice after BMT, because adult-type pre-B cells that are reconstituted from the donor BM do not proliferate in response to high TSLP levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b038">38</xref>]. In addition, the fact that B-LPD does not recur in the mutant mice after FLT is consistent with the hypothesis that the niche is instrumental in regulating the response of pre-B cells to TSLP. This is reminiscent of the critical role the hematopoietic stem cell niche plays in defining the fetal versus adult characteristics of hematopoietic stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b042">42</xref>].</p>

        <title>Intrinsic Skin Phenotype and Infection Cause Death in Adult Mice Lacking Canonical Notch Signaling</title>
        <p>N1N2CKO or PSDCKO mutant animals transplanted with either wild-type or mutant BM do not enjoy a normal life span, dying before 3 months of age. Mice lacking some Notch alleles or lacking RBP-j do not develop lethal B-LPD but instead die prematurely from compromised skin integrity, exfoliation, inflammation, and systemic infection (unpublished data). Although antibiotic treatment delays the death of the mutant animals by controlling their infection, we find persistent granulocytosis even in antibiotic-treated mice, suggesting that systemic infection and the resulting inflammatory response are severe and incurable. Infection is the most likely cause of granulocytosis in the mutant animals; however, it is intriguing to speculate that persistently high levels of TSLP also contribute to this blood disease ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b037">37</xref>] and Dr. Freddy Radtke, personal communication).</p>

        <title><italic>TSLP</italic> Overexpression in Notch-Deficient Skin Is a Common Keratinocyte Response to Skin-Barrier Formation Defect</title>
        <p>Notably, we observe a tight correlation between systemic TSLP levels, WBC counts, and degree of Notch loss in the neonatal skin. All Notch paralogs contribute to skin homeostasis, and stepwise reduction of Notch dosage leads to progressive skin perturbation resembling atopic dermatitis (unpublished data). However, we find no evidence arguing for a specific molecular connection between Notch loss and TSLP. Instead, the tight reverse correlation between serum TSLP levels and Notch dosage in the skin highlights the fact that TSLP levels reflect, with great precision, the magnitude of the differentiation defects. Thus, TSLP may be a direct readout of defects in differentiation, a systemic signal that many insults, including Notch loss, activate. To confirm this, we demonstrate that wild-type and mutant keratinocytes release significant, but similar, levels of TSLP when placed in culture in the absence of any exogenous stimulus (e.g., tumor necrosis factor α). In addition, <italic>wrfr</italic><sup>–/–</sup> embryos show a substantial increase in epidermal <italic>TSLP</italic> transcripts in utero around the time of barrier formation. Therefore, TSLP is a keratinocyte “quality control” response to defective differentiation/barrier formation and not a secondary product of functional barrier failure after birth. One model for how the TSLP “sensor” works may be through the compensatory activation of NFκB. However, precisely how Notch loss in vivo leads to NFκB activation remains an important unanswered question that falls beyond the scope of this paper.</p>
        <p>A striking finding is that RBP-jCKO mice show lower TSLP levels, a sublethal B-LPD, and improved epidermal morphology when compared to mice lacking total Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060123-sg011">Figure S11</xref>). To differentiate between de-repression of canonical targets and loss of noncanonical target expression, we performed a genetic analysis demonstrating unequivocally that RBP-j-independent Notch activity is of significance in skin homeostasis. This points to the importance of RBP-j-independent effects of Notch, including non-cell autonomous effects on ligand (Delta and Jagged) presenting cells, and only when all these arms of Notch signaling are lost, extreme TSLP levels are reached, causing lethal B-LPD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060123-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Identification of the relevant noncanonical targets also falls beyond the scope of this paper.</p>

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>In this report, we identified canonical and noncanonical Notch signaling as essential regulators of epidermal differentiation/barrier formation, TSLP as a faithful reporter of keratinocyte differentiation/barrier defects, and B-LPD as the pathological consequence of chronic, perinatal TSLP elevation. Our analysis was done in a physiologically relevant setting: chronic skin-barrier formation defect caused by localized reduction in Notch signaling in a temporal and dose-dependent manner. How keratinocytes directly sense the degree of differentiation/barrier defect and translate such a stimulus into TSLP output remains an important, unsolved question. Nonetheless, the demonstration that defective skin differentiation can drive a lethal systemic B-LPD in mice through <italic>TSLP</italic> overexpression and the observation that human B cells also respond to TSLP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060123-b029">29</xref>] bring up a therapeutically important possibility that chronic high levels of TSLP may be an initiating factor in loss of B cell tolerance and/or B-lymphocytosis, a leukemia-like disease in humans. More important, this raises the possibility that skin has a central role in driving a wide variety of inflammatory and humoral diseases in which skin complications are also present.</p>

          <p>Comprehensive (A) antigen and (B) autoimmune analysis on sera collected from P14 mutant (N1N2CKO; <italic>n</italic> = 3) and wild-type (<italic>n</italic> = 3) animals does not identify any other factor besides TSLP that could potentially explain B-LPD in the mutant animals. The antigens with significantly higher levels in mutant serum are marked (values in red). Note that the least detectable dose for each factor is calculated as three standard deviations above the average value obtained measuring 20 blank samples. Therefore, values below the least detectable dose are below accurate detection range. Rules Based Medicine laboratory cutoff values for autoimmune analysis signify the upper limits of normal ratios for each factor measured.</p>
