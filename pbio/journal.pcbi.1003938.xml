<abstract>
<p>Having multiple domains in proteins can lead to partial folding and increased aggregation. Folding cooperativity, the all or nothing folding of a protein, can reduce this aggregation propensity. In agreement with bulk experiments, a coarse-grained structure-based model of the three-domain protein, <italic>E. coli</italic> Adenylate kinase (AKE), folds cooperatively. Domain interfaces have previously been implicated in the cooperative folding of multi-domain proteins. To understand their role in AKE folding, we computationally create mutants with deleted inter-domain interfaces and simulate their folding. We find that inter-domain interfaces play a minor role in the folding cooperativity of AKE. On further analysis, we find that unlike other multi-domain proteins whose folding has been studied, the domains of AKE are not singly-linked. Two of its domains have two linkers to the third one, i.e., they are inserted into the third one. We use circular permutation to modify AKE chain-connectivity and convert inserted-domains into singly-linked domains. We find that domain insertion in AKE achieves the following: (1) It facilitates folding cooperativity even when domains have different stabilities. Insertion constrains the N- and C-termini of inserted domains and stabilizes their folded states. Therefore, domains that perform conformational transitions can be smaller with fewer stabilizing interactions. (2) Inter-domain interactions are not needed to promote folding cooperativity and can be tuned for function. In AKE, these interactions help promote conformational dynamics limited catalysis. Finally, using structural bioinformatics, we suggest that domain insertion may also facilitate the cooperative folding of other multi-domain proteins.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Most individual protein domains fold in an all or nothing fashion. This cooperative folding is important because it reduces the existence of partially folded proteins which can stick to each other and create disease causing aggregates. However, numerous proteins have multiple domains, independent units of folding, stability and/or function. Several such proteins also fold cooperatively. It is thought that strong interactions between individual domains allow the folding to propagate from a nucleating domain to neighbouring ones and this enables cooperative folding in multi-domain proteins. Here, we computationally study the folding of the three-domain protein AKE and find instead that the topology of the protein, wherein the two less stable domains are inserted into the more stable one, promotes folding cooperativity. When the more stable domain is folded, the ends of the inserted domains are constrained and this allows them to fold easily. In such a protein topology, strong inter-domain interactions are not needed to promote folding cooperativity. Interface amino acids which would have been involved in ensuring that the domains fit together correctly can now be tuned for binding or catalysis or conformational transitions. Thus, inserted domains may be present in multi-domain proteins to promote both function and folding.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The presence of multiple domains in proteins can lead to interactions between partially folded domains and in turn to increased misfolding and aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Zheng1">[1]</xref>. Nevertheless, several multi-domain proteins fold reversibly in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Pirchi1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Strucksberg1">[3]</xref>. Cooperative folding, the all or nothing folding of a protein with the population of few intermediates, reduces partially folded states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Chan1">[4]</xref>. It has been hypothesized that folding cooperativity has evolved in proteins to avoid misfolding and decrease aggregation propensity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Dobson1">[5]</xref>. Strong inter-domain interactions have been implicated in the cooperative folding of multi-domain proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Zheng1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Han1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Bhaskara1">[10]</xref>. Here, we computationally investigate the role of inter-domain interactions in the folding of the three-domain protein <italic>E. coli</italic> Adenylate kinase (AKE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) and find that an altogether different method, domain insertion, promotes folding cooperativity. Domain insertion is the presence of the amino acid sequence of one domain (the inserted domain) within the sequence of another domain (the discontinuous domain) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). In the three-dimensional structure, the discontinuous (along the protein chain) amino acid stretches of the discontinuous domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, bottom, grey segments) fold together into a single domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, top, grey regions).</p>

<p>(A) WT AKE (open state, PDB: 4AKE, chain A) colored by domain: CORE (grey; residues 1–29, 68–117 (CORE-N) and 161–214 (CORE-C)), NMP (green; residues 30–67) and LID (orange; residues 118–160). The conformational transitions of LID and NMP are indicated by red arrows. All structures in this article were drawn using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (Version 1.4.1 Schrödinger, LLC). (B) Cartoon showing the domain organization of AKE on the folded structure (top) and the sequence (bottom) colored as in A. The CORE domain is split into three grey regions because of domain insertion. (C) The C-α contact map of WT AKE. X and Y axes represent residue number. Secondary structure is shown along the axes: α helices are empty boxes and β strands are filled boxes. The contacts are colored according to their location (CORE: grey, NMP: green, LID: orange). The absolute contact order of these regions is: LID: 15.27, NMP: 10.42, CORE: 62.87, and the entire WT AKE: 46.04. The red contacts are closed state specific contacts that drive the conformational transitions.</p>

<p>Domain insertion makes protein topology more complex and this will likely slow folding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Plaxco1">[11]</xref>. Why then is domain insertion preferred over tuning the strength of inter-domain interactions as a method to promote folding cooperativity? It has been shown that slow and complex folding arises in order to accommodate function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Gosavi1">[12]</xref>. We hypothesize that in AKE too, domain insertion and the potential slow folding are tolerated for functional reasons. Domain interfaces in many multi-domain proteins are involved in function, i.e., they take part in binding or catalysis or act as hinges to facilitate conformational transitions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Amemiya1">[13]</xref> and it may not be possible to tune such functional interfaces to promote folding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Gosavi1">[12]</xref>. Here, we confirm our hypothesis by computationally studying the mechanism of conformational transitions of AKE.</p>
<p>The 214 residue enzyme, AKE, has become an important model for the study of both protein folding and conformational transitions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Mller1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Li1">[32]</xref>. AKE has three domains termed CORE, LID and NMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Both the N- and C-termini of AKE are present in CORE, which is split into three discontinuous polypeptide segments by the two inserted domains, LID and NMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). In experiment, AKE folds cooperatively with two-state thermodynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Schrank1">[23]</xref>. AKE reversibly catalyzes the reaction ATP+AMP = 2ADP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Mller1">[14]</xref>. The substrates ATP and AMP preferentially bind at the CORE-LID and CORE-NMP interfaces respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Berry1">[15]</xref>. LID and NMP then close over CORE and this extensively studied conformational transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Olsson1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Schrank1">[23]</xref> achieves the right geometry for catalysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Mller1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Berry1">[15]</xref>. The closure of LID before NMP is hypothesized to prevent misligation of the substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Whitford2">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>Structure-based models (SBMs) capture the funnelled energy landscape of proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Onuchic1">[33]</xref> by encoding the native structure into their potential energy functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Clementi1">[34]</xref>. MD simulations of SBMs have successfully reproduced the folding routes and the folding rates of diverse proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Zheng1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Wang1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Itoh1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Gosavi1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Li1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Clementi1">[34]</xref>. We find in agreement with experiment that a C-α structure-based model (C-α SBM) of AKE folds cooperatively. In order to test the role of inter-domain interactions in this cooperative folding, we create AKE mutants where these interactions are deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g002">Fig. 2A, 2C</xref>). MD simulations of these mutants show that the inter-domain interactions play a minimal role in promoting folding cooperativity. We then create circular permutants (CPs) of AKE where either LID or NMP (the inserted domains) are converted to singly-linked domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g002">Fig. 2B, 2C</xref>) and find that the CPs fold less cooperatively than WT AKE. Thus, domain insertion rather than inter-domain interactions promotes folding cooperativity in AKE.</p>

<p>Domains of AKE are colored as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g001">Fig. 1</xref> (CORE: grey, NMP: green, LID: orange). (A) Interface deletion mutants of AKE. All marked residues are represented by their C-α atoms. The CORE-NMP interface is composed of interactions between the green (NMP) and the blue (CORE) residues. The mutant, ΔCORE-NMPi, has these interactions deleted. The CORE-LID interface is composed of interactions between the orange (LID) and the yellow (CORE) residues. This interface is deleted in the mutant ΔCORE-LIDi. (B) Circular permutants of AKE. The WT N- and C-termini are linked by a 4 glycine loop (dotted black line). New N- and C-termini are generated by cutting at one of the positions indicated by the circles (CP-NMPcut: green; between residues 29 and 30; CP-LIDcut: orange; between residues 111 and 112). (C) The C-α contact map of the open state of WT AKE with the intra-domain contacts colored as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>. The CORE-NMP interface interactions (33 blue contacts) are deleted in ΔCORE-NMPi while the CORE-LID interface interactions (22 yellow contacts) are deleted in ΔCORE-LIDi. The absolute contact order of the interfaces is: CORE-NMP interface: 29.58 and CORE-LID interface: 39.73. Colored circles (CP-NMPcut: green and CP-LIDcut: orange) mark the (x, x) location of the first residue x, of the CPs. The closed state specific contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, red contacts; appropriately renumbered in the CPs) are not shown here but are present in the conformational transition simulations.</p>

<p>A dual-SBM which includes information from both the ligand free and the ligand bound structures of AKE has been developed to understand the conformational transitions of WT AKE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Whitford1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Whitford2">[19]</xref>. We use this mechanism of conformational transitions as an assay for function and test if the mechanism is WT-like in the AKE mutants. We find that the mutants with the deleted inter-domain interactions (which show WT-like folding mechanism and cooperativity) show altered mechanisms of conformational transitions. The CPs, on the other hand, have a WT-like mechanism. Together, our results show that domain insertion promotes folding cooperativity in <italic>E. coli</italic> Adenylate kinase while inter-domain interactions are optimized for conformational transitions.</p>

<title>Thermodynamic folding cooperativity</title>
<p>We perform all simulations close to the folding temperature, T<sub>f</sub>, where multiple transitions occur between the equally populated folded and unfolded ensembles and the best sampling of the transition region is achieved. The presence of a single free energy barrier separating the native and unfolded ensembles at T<sub>f</sub> implies that the protein folds cooperatively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Chan1">[4]</xref>. If the different domains of a multi-domain protein fold at different T<sub>f</sub>s, partially folded states get populated at temperatures between the lowest and the highest domain specific T<sub>f</sub>s. Upon mutation, a domain specific decrease of T<sub>f</sub> can result in the incomplete folding of that domain at the T<sub>f</sub> of the whole protein and the population of partially folded states in the folded ensemble. This results in reduced folding cooperativity.</p>
<p>Folding cooperativity is usually deduced from the heat capacity curve (C<sub>v</sub>(T) vs. T) using the ratio of the van't Hoff enthalpy (ΔH<sub>vH</sub>) to the calorimetric enthalpy (ΔH<sub>cal</sub>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Chan1">[4]</xref>. If this curve has a single narrow peak at T<sub>f</sub> then the folding transition is cooperative. We make perturbations to WT AKE which change the free-energetic balance between domains and in turn the folding cooperativity. However, since the domains of AKE are of unequal size (CORE≫LID&gt;NMP) the largest contribution to C<sub>v</sub>(T<sub>f</sub>) comes from the folding of CORE which is not perturbed much across simulations. Thus, the ΔH<sub>vH</sub>/ΔH<sub>cal</sub> is not a sensitive measure of the folding cooperativity of AKE and its mutants (however, it does show the same trend as seen in the following sections; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003938.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). Therefore, we use the height of the free energy barrier at T<sub>f</sub> and the “foldedness” of the protein in this native ensemble to infer the degree of cooperative folding. We define foldedness as the ratio of the population of a mutant at the value of the reaction coordinate where WT AKE is folded to the population of WT AKE at the value of the reaction coordinate where WT AKE is folded. This definition inherently assumes that the value of the reaction coordinate where WT AKE is folded is greater than or equal to the value of the reaction coordinate where the mutants are folded.</p>

<title>A C-α SBM reproduces the main features of folding experiments on WT AKE</title>
<p>Both the conformational transitions and the folding of AKE have previously been studied using different flavors of SBMs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Whitford1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Whitford2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Li1">[32]</xref>. Here, we use a well-tested SBM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Clementi1">[34]</xref> which uses only the C-α atom to represent the entire residue. This C-α SBM, which uses the folded structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g002">2A, 2B</xref>) and its contact map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g002">2C</xref>) as inputs, is sufficient to capture the main changes in folding upon topological perturbation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Hubner1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Radou1">[36]</xref> and is not intended for the detailed analysis of structural populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Pirchi1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Li1">[32]</xref>.

<title>Contact clusters and free energy profiles of WT AKE.</title>
<p>(A) The three contact clusters whose contacts form and break together during the folding and unfolding of WT AKE are projected onto their residues and shown on the structure: CORE-N (black; residues 1–29 and 68–117), LID (orange) and CORE-C (grey; residues 161–214). No contact cluster was found in NMP (green). (B) The contacts of the residues that form the clusters are shown in the same colors as in A. The intra-LID and intra-NMP contacts are enclosed in orange and green boxes and their contact location close to the diagonal underlines that LID and NMP are inserted domains. The CORE-N contacts are demarcated by the black box. (C–G) Reaction coordinates (RCs) for the folding free energy plots are defined as the fraction of native contacts formed in the whole protein (Q; all contacts, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>), CORE-N (Q<sub>CORE-N</sub>; black contacts in B), CORE-C (Q<sub>CORE-C</sub>; grey contacts in B), CORE (Q<sub>CORE</sub>; grey contacts, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>), LID (Q<sub>LID</sub>; orange contacts, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>) and NMP (Q<sub>NMP</sub>; green, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). The more folded a given region, the higher the value of the corresponding Q. (C) The scaled folding free energy (ΔG/k<sub>B</sub>T<sub>f</sub>) of WT AKE plotted as a function of Q. N and U denote the native and the unfolded ensembles. The error bars represent twice the square root of the variance in the folding free energy and were calculated using a jackknife algorithm.

Using these correlation coefficients, we partition native contacts into three clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g003">Fig. 3A, 3B</xref>) such that the contacts in each cluster form and break together (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003938.s009">SI Methods</xref>, section 4 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003938.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). These contact clusters correspond well with the three foldons determined earlier in HX-NMR experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Rundqvist1">[31]</xref>. The three clusters correspond to LID (contacts between residues 118–160), the N-terminal part of CORE (CORE-N: contacts between residues 1–29, 68–117 and between these residues and NMP residues 30–67) and the C-terminal part of CORE (CORE-C: contacts between residues 161–214 and contacts between these and the CORE-N residues). Native contacts from NMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, green) and the CORE-LID interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, yellow) are not part of any cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003938.s001">S1</xref>).</p>
<p>We next analyze folding routes by plotting the free energy profile (FEP) and the 2-dimensional free energy surfaces (2DFESs) for WT AKE along several suitable reaction coordinates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g003">Fig. 3C–G</xref>). The FEP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>) shows a large free energy barrier (∼6 k<sub>B</sub>T<sub>f</sub>) separating the unfolded (Q∼0.2) and the native (Q∼0.8) ensembles. There is a slight dip at Q∼0.3 due to the population of states with only LID folded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>). The single free energy barrier means that bulk probes such as circular dichroism (CD) and FRET observe a cooperative 2-state folding transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Pirchi1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Schrank1">[23]</xref>. In agreement with experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Bae1">[17]</xref>, this transition corresponds to the folding/unfolding of CORE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g003">Fig. 3E and 3F</xref> show that LID can be either folded or unfolded in the N and U ensembles while NMP cannot fold completely in U. In agreement with experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Schrank1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Rundqvist1">[31]</xref>, both LID and NMP can either be folded or unfolded once CORE is folded (N in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g003">Fig. 3E–F</xref>).</p>
<p>Intrinsic fluorescence from single tryptophan (Trp) mutants has been used to study the refolding of AKE (24). These experiments show that regions of AKE near residues 41 (part of NMP), 86 and 73 (both part of CORE-N) (red spheres in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g004">Fig. 4A, B</xref>) fold faster than the region near residue 193 (part of CORE-C; cyan sphere in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). Thus, except for residue 41, the main folding route from our simulations where CORE-N folds before CORE-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g003">Fig. 3G</xref>) rationalizes the behaviour of the single Trp mutant fluorescence experiments. Further, we observe another route (∼10% of transitions) where CORE-C folds before CORE-N, in qualitative agreement with single molecule FRET data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Pirchi1">[2]</xref>.</p>

<p>Refolding kinetics of WT AKE were also monitored by time resolved FRET <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Orevi1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Ratner3">[30]</xref>. In these experiments, the FRET donor acceptor pairs were located at: 58–86 (between CORE-N and NMP); 28–71 and 28–86 (both intra-CORE-N); 73–203, 28–203, 18–203 (all between CORE-N and CORE-C); 188–203, 169–188 (both intra-CORE-C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g004">Fig. 4A, B</xref>). The rates of formation of these distances in experiment broadly agree with the major folding route found in our simulations (CORE-N folds first followed by CORE-C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). In experiment, the burst phase distribution of the 58–86 (NMP-CORE-N) FRET distance resembled the unfolded state distribution and it adopted a native-like distribution only late during refolding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Orevi1">[26]</xref>. NMP is inserted into CORE-N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). CORE-N folds early in our simulations and the folding of NMP is dependent on the folding of CORE-N. Although, the complete folding of NMP occurs only after crossing the free energy barrier, specific NMP residues do fold early (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g003">Fig. 3F</xref>). Local energetic heterogeneities will modulate the order of formation of local contacts in NMP. If our coarse-grained simulations capture such local ordering correctly, it is only by chance. So, we choose to not interpret the specific temporal ordering of our NMP contacts and assume that NMP forms late during folding.</p>
<p>Overall, simulations of the AKE C-α SBM are able to integrate data from diverse bulk experiments into one folding mechanism and this model can be used for further protein perturbations.</p>

<title>Removing inter-domain interactions has a minimal effect on folding cooperativity</title>
<p>AKE has two inter-domain interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g002">Fig. 2A, 2C</xref>). We computationally create two mutants: one with no CORE-NMP inter-domain interactions (ΔCORE-NMPi; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>) and another with no CORE-LID interactions (ΔCORE-LIDi; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). Similar mutants have been experimentally created to study AKE function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-dn2">[22]</xref>. However, when some contacts of an interface residue are deleted in the C-α SBM, it is enthalpically less stable when folded. In order to preserve WT-like energetic stabilization for every residue at the interface, we appropriately scale the strength of the other contacts of that residue when creating both ΔCORE-NMPi and ΔCORE-LIDi. This is similar to converting an outward facing residue which contributes to inter-domain interactions into an inward facing one which contributes to intra-domain interactions. We simulate C-α SBMs of these mutants to understand the effect of inter-domain interactions on the folding cooperativity of AKE.</p>

<p>The free energy barriers (∼5–6 k<sub>B</sub>T) of both ΔCORE-NMPi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>; black) and ΔCORE-LIDi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>; black) are similar to that of WT AKE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g005">Fig. 5B, 5E</xref>, grey). Further, like in WT AKE, NMP and LID are folded in the native ensembles (Q or Q*∼0.8) of ΔCORE-NMPi and ΔCORE-LIDi respectively (“foldedness” of 1). The unfolded ensemble of ΔCORE-NMPi appears at a higher Q* (∼0.25) than that of WT (Q∼0.2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). This is because some intra-NMP contacts are stronger in ΔCORE-NMPi than in WT and these stay folded. Additionally, they also contribute more to Q*. However, this is not sufficient to fold NMP completely in the unfolded state of ΔCORE-NMPi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>) and the folding mechanism of ΔCORE-NMPi is WT-like (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003938.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). Overall, the CORE-NMP interface contributes little to the folding cooperativity of WT AKE. This interface is formed in the transition state of WT AKE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003938.s005">Fig. S5A</xref>, Q∼0.5) and its deletion should destabilize the transition state and affect the height of the free energy barrier. This does not happen because the energetic stabilization of interface residues is preserved in our model of ΔCORE-NMPi. The CORE-LID interface is significantly formed only in the native ensemble (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003938.s005">Fig. S5B</xref>, Q∼0.5) and its deletion is unlikely to affect the transition state or the height of the free energy barrier.</p>
<p>The unfolded ensemble of ΔCORE-LIDi (Q*∼0.32) is higher than that of WT-AKE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>) and LID is partially folded in the unfolded ensemble of ΔCORE-LIDi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g005">Fig. 5F</xref>). This could be interpreted as a loss in folding cooperativity. However, upon closer inspection we find that the same LID residues which contribute to inter-domain interactions contribute to interactions between the N- and C-termini of LID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, orange spheres). When the intra-LID contacts of these residues are strengthened in order to create ΔCORE-LIDi, the N- and C-termini of LID stick to each other more. This constrains the LID domain in a manner similar to when it is inserted into a larger folded domain (even when CORE is unfolded). Reducing the strength of these contacts reduces the population of folded LID in the unfolded ensemble and makes the mechanism and the folding cooperativity more WT-like. We explore domain insertion further in the next section.</p>

<title>CPs of WT AKE, with either LID or NMP converted to a singly-linked domain, have reduced folding cooperativity</title>
<p>We computationally generate CPs of AKE by connecting the WT termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). New N- and C-termini are created before NMP in CP-NMPcut and before LID in CP-LIDcut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g002">Fig. 2B, C</xref>). This converts the inserted NMP and LID domains into singly-linked domains in the CPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g006">Fig. 6A, D</xref>). The C-α SBMs for both CPs have the same native contacts as WT AKE renumbered according to their changes in topology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g002">2C</xref>). Two clusters of hydrophobic residues, one in NMP (V39, A49 and M53) and the other in the flanking helices of LID (I116, V117, V164 and L168) stabilize the two inserted domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Rundqvist1">[31]</xref>. The cuts in both CPs are before these clusters and do not disturb their connectivity. The native contacts from these clusters have the same stabilizing effect on NMP and LID in the CPs as in WT. Thus, any changes in folding cooperativity are only due to the conversion of NMP or LID to singly-linked domains.</p>

<p>On simulating CP-NMPcut, we find that its folding barrier is not significantly different from that of WT AKE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). However, the folded ensemble has a single population at Q∼0.75 with NMP unfolded (N in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). The “foldedness” of CP-NMPcut gives how populated it is at the folded ensemble of WT-AKE (Q∼0.8) as compared to WT-AKE and equals exp(−ΔG<sub>CP-NMPcut</sub>(Q∼0.8)/k<sub>B</sub>T<sub>f</sub>)/exp(−ΔG<sub>WT</sub>(Q∼0.8)/k<sub>B</sub>T<sub>f</sub>) = exp(−1.6)/1∼0.202±0.006. The FEP of CP-LIDcut shows that the barrier height is ∼2 k<sub>B</sub>T lower than that in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g006">Fig. 6E</xref>) and the folded basin has two populations. The less stable one at Q∼0.8 corresponds to completely folded CP-LIDcut, while the more stable population at Q∼0.65 has a partially folded protein with an unfolded LID domain (N in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g006">Fig. 6F</xref>). The foldedness of CP-LIDcut equals exp(−ΔG<sub>CP-LIDcut</sub>(Q∼0.8)/k<sub>B</sub>T<sub>f</sub>)/exp(−ΔG<sub>WT</sub>(Q∼0.8)/k<sub>B</sub>T<sub>f</sub>) = exp(−0.94)/1∼0.390±0.026. In both CPs, incomplete folding in the native state indicates lower folding cooperativity relative to WT. Together our results show that stabilizing interactions (here, appropriately placed native contacts due to a hydrophobic cluster) are insufficient to maintain folding cooperativity and that the insertion of the LID and NMP domains into the CORE domain is necessary. In the next section, we study the conformational transitions of AKE and its mutants to understand why domain insertion is preferred over strengthening inter-domain interactions for promoting cooperative folding.</p>

<p>Unlike in WT AKE, the main route for the conformational transitions in ΔCORE-NMPi is through a LID-open-NMP-closed intermediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). It has been suggested that the mechanism of conformational transitions is important both for preventing misligation during the binding of ATP and AMP and for maintaining the high catalytic efficiency of WT AKE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Whitford2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-dn1">[21]</xref>. The deletion of the CORE-NMP interface contacts completely alters the mechanism of conformational transitions. The main route for the conformational transitions in ΔCORE-LIDi remains WT-like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>). However, removing the CORE-LID interface reduces the population of the open state significantly and this is also likely to increase misligation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Whitford2">[19]</xref>.We conclude that the inter-domain interfaces are not necessary for the cooperative folding of WT AKE but are tuned to achieve the correct mechanism of conformational transitions.</p>
<p>We next simulate the conformational transitions of both CPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g007">Fig. 7D, E</xref>) and find that the population of the three states and the overall mechanism of conformational transitions are largely WT-like. Perturbing the edges of the inserted domains by making them singly-connected marginally affects the populations of the states. Thus, the choice of domain connectivity in AKE (with or without inserted NMP and LID domains) does not affect the mechanism of conformational transitions. We conclude that domain insertion is used to promote folding cooperativity in AKE because domain interfaces are tuned to facilitate conformational transitions.</p>

<title>Domain insertion can stabilize the inserted domain and increase folding cooperativity</title>
<p>Domain insertion constrains the position of the N- and C-termini of the inserted domain when the discontinuous domain (e.g. CORE is the discontinuous domain in AKE; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>) is folded. This reduces the conformational entropy of the inserted domain and stabilizes its folded state. Thus, domain insertion is likely to be advantageous for small, marginally stable domains such as NMP and LID during instances of spontaneous local unfolding in the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Han1">[6]</xref>. Evidence that the folded states of small domains are more stable upon insertion into a stably folded discontinuous domain also comes from experiments on the <italic>E. coli</italic> protein slyD. slyD consists of an unfolded polypeptide binding domain inserted into a proline isomerisation catalyzing FKBP domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Zoldk1">[37]</xref>. The insert is unfolded in isolation but becomes structured within the slyD FKBP domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Zoldk1">[37]</xref>.</p>
<p>Inserting a smaller domain with fewer stabilizing interactions and a lower T<sub>f</sub>, into a larger, more stable one (with a higher T<sub>f</sub>) not only stabilizes the inserted domain but also couples their folding and brings their T<sub>f</sub>s closer to each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Radou1">[36]</xref>. This allows the entire protein to fold more cooperatively. In addition to the present simulations of AKE, reduced folding cooperativity upon the conversion of an inserted domain into a singly-linked one has also been observed in folding experiments on T4-lysozyme (T4L) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Shank1">[38]</xref>.</p>
<p>We extract the structures of diverse families of multi-domain proteins with inserts (36 inserted domain families in total) from the Pfam database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Finn1">[39]</xref> and calculate three structural parameters, which have previously been correlated with the folding properties of single domain proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). For each protein chain (there are a total of 1713 chains), we compare the structural parameters of the inserted domain to those of the discontinuous domain in order to understand if domain insertion can stabilize the inserted domain and increase folding cooperativity in other multi-domain proteins.

<title>Absolute contact order (ACO), chain length and packing fraction of insert-discontinuous domain pairs from the Pfam-A database.</title>
<p>We extract 1713 protein chains from Pfam which have an inserted domain and an associated PDB ID and a chainID. For each chain the (A) ACO, (B) the chain length and (C) the packing fraction of the inserted ( = x) and the discontinuous domains ( = y) are calculated separately and marked as filled grey circles at the (x, y) point. The ACO, chain length and packing fraction for a majority of the insert-discontinuous domain pairs lie above the y = x line (marked in black in A–C). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003938.s006">Fig. S6</xref> represents the same data coloured according to the Pfam family of the inserted domain and corroborates this inference at the Pfam family level.</p>

<p>The structural parameters that we calculate separately for the inserts and the discontinuous domains of each protein chain are the absolute contact order (ACO) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Plaxco1">[11]</xref>, the chain length and the packing fraction. The ACO and to a lesser extent the chain length inversely correlate with the folding rate of a protein domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Rollins1">[40]</xref> and reflect its kinetic stability and its resistance to spontaneous unfolding. The chain length (through its correlation with protein stability) and the packing fraction may correlate with the T<sub>f</sub> (or the thermodynamic stability) of individual domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Ghosh1">[41]</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g008">Fig. 8</xref>, we plot the ACO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>), the chain length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>) and the packing fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g008">Fig. 8C</xref>) of the discontinuous domain versus that of the corresponding inserted domain. (Also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003938.s006">Fig. S6</xref> for a family-wise split of the data).</p>
<p>The ACO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>) is the average of the number of residues along the protein chain that separate a pair of residues that form a native contact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Plaxco1">[11]</xref>. We use the same contact calculation for these protein chains as we use for C-α SBMs. ACO assesses the complexity of a fold and has been shown to be inversely correlated with the logarithm of protein folding rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Rollins1">[40]</xref>. Although unfolding rates have not been directly correlated with ACO, slow folding rates imply a high barrier to folding (and unfolding) at T<sub>f</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Chavez1">[42]</xref> and in turn slow unfolding rates. Slow unfolding rates will reduce the events of spontaneous unfolding once a protein domain is folded. We find that the discontinuous domains of 1343 out of the 1713 protein chains have a larger ACO than their inserted domains. Further, the ACO of the inserted domain of every member of 31 out of the 36 Pfam families is lower than that of the corresponding discontinuous domain. This data and the following data on chain length indicate that discontinuous domains are on an average, more kinetically stable and more resistant to unfolding than the inserted domains. As in AKE and slyD, insertion of a kinetically less stable insert is likely to stabilize its folded state once the discontinuous domain is folded.</p>
<p>Thermodynamic stabilities of proteins can be calculated from their chain lengths <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Ghosh1">[41]</xref> and longer domains are expected to be more stable than shorter ones. The square root of the chain length also inversely correlates with the logarithm of the folding rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Rollins1">[40]</xref>. We find that a greater number of protein chains (1318 out of 1713 and 32 out of 36 Pfam families) have longer discontinuous domains than inserted domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>). An earlier bioinformatics study with a different data set also showed the same trend <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-AroulSelvam1">[43]</xref>.</p>
<p>Finally, we calculate and plot the packing fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g008">Fig. 8C</xref>). This is the ratio of the number of contacts to the number of residues in a protein. It varies between 2.0 and 3.0 when the contacts are coarse-grained to a C-α level as in our simulation models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Gosavi1">[12]</xref>. There is evidence from studies on thermophilic proteins that a higher packing fraction (and consequently better packing) can lead to a higher T<sub>f</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Berezovsky1">[44]</xref>. We find that again that a larger number of discontinuous domains (1175 out of 1713 and 21 out of 36 families) have a higher packing fraction than their respective inserted domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003938-g008">Fig. 8C</xref>). Besides the fact that quantities such as ACO, chain length and packing fraction can only establish trends and may not accurately predict the folding of individual domains and proteins, there are several other caveats to our dataset and our analyses which may bias the above results and we list some of these in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003938.s009">SI Methods</xref>.</p>
<p>The overall trend that emerges is that the T<sub>f</sub>s, the thermodynamic and the kinetic stabilities of the discontinuous domains are larger than those of their respective inserted domains (1079 of the 1713 or 63% of the protein chains have all three i.e. ACO, chain length and packing fraction higher in the discontinuous domain than in the inserted domain). Thus, it is likely that domain insertion stabilizes the folded state and increases the folding cooperativity of at least some other multi-domain proteins with inserts. Further, both our folding simulations and the above structural bioinformatics analysis indicate that the design of singly-linked multi-domain proteins is likely to be fundamentally different from that of proteins with inserts. Thus, studies that investigate the connection between the folding and evolution of multi-domain proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Han1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Jacob1">[45]</xref> should classify proteins based on their chain topology. We next discuss the functional advantages of domain insertion.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3b">
<title>Domain insertion can maintain folding cooperativity even when inter-domain interfaces are tuned for function</title>
<p>Domain insertion naturally couples the folding of the inserted and the discontinuous domains of a protein and can, given the right order of stabilities of domains, make folding cooperative. However, domain insertion also makes the topology of the protein more complex and is likely to slow down its folding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Plaxco1">[11]</xref>. Further, it is also possible for singly-linked, multi-domain proteins to fold cooperatively with appropriately tuned inter-domain interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Zheng1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Han1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Bhaskara1">[10]</xref>. Given the presence of inserted domains in several multi-domain proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-AroulSelvam1">[43]</xref>, we would like to know if domain insertion confers an additional advantage onto a multi-domain protein which is absent when the same two domains are singly-linked. Here we argue, using AKE, T4L and slyD as examples, that domain insertion may be advantageous because it can promote folding cooperativity while accommodating the constraints imposed on domain interfaces by protein function. In AKE, the area of interaction between domains is small and the interface residues are selected to bind ATP and AMP and to locally unfold and promote conformational transitions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Mller1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Olsson1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Whitford1">[18]</xref>. The residues at the domain interface of T4L are tuned to bind and hydrolyze bacterial cell wall peptidoglycans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Hu1">[46]</xref>. slyD has almost no inter-domain interface, likely because the insert needs to be mobile in order to bind unfolded polypeptide chains using a fly casting-like mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Shoemaker1">[47]</xref>. Despite these functional constraints, AKE, T4L and slyD can fold cooperatively due to their inserted domain topologies.</p>
<p>When the area of interaction between domains is small or almost non-existent, it may not be possible to tune inter-domain interactions for anything other than function and with domain insertion, these interactions are not necessary to promote folding cooperativity. If the area of interaction between the domains is large, it may be possible to promote folding cooperativity using only inter-domain interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Bhaskara1">[10]</xref> even when interfaces are functional. In such cases, domain insertion may not confer any extra advantage.</p>
<p>In order to understand if other multi-domain proteins with inserts have function at inter-domain interfaces, we use the 36 inserted domain Pfam families (1713 protein chains). We further classify these families into 38 sets of proteins such that the proteins within each set have the same pair of Pfam IDs for the inserted and the discontinuous domains. We use the function annotation database, Firedb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Lopez1">[48]</xref>, to output groups of residues which are part of individual functional sites in the 1713 protein chains. We then identify chains with functional sites that span the inserted and the discontinuous domains and mark them as having function at the interface. We find that 24 out of the 38 sets of proteins have at least one protein chain that has function at the domain interface. If we assume that similar inserted and discontinuous domain pairs have similar function then ∼63% of the protein sets have functional domain interfaces. We note in passing that 14 out of the 24 sets of protein chains with interface function have higher ACO, chain length and packing fraction in their discontinuous domain than in their inserted domain. It has been hypothesized that the interfaces of multi-domain proteins (whether they be singly-linked or with inserted domains) are enriched in function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Kuriyan1">[49]</xref>. A study of whether the inter-domain interfaces of multi-domain proteins with inserts are more enriched in function than those of singly-linked multi-domain proteins is currently ongoing in our group.</p>

<title>Possible connections to studies on protein evolution and design</title>
<p>A recent study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Pandya1">[50]</xref> discusses sequence and structure divergence in the HAD superfamily of proteins. Insertion of different domains into a Rossmann discontinuous domain imparts specificity to the enzymatic activity of proteins within the HAD superfamily. The inter-domain interface seems to be critical for catalysis and its structure is conserved across the HAD proteins. However, correlated structural changes between the two domains are observed far from the domain interface. Although little is known about the folding of these proteins, we suggest that this structural co-evolution of the domains may also compensate for the differences in size and stability of the inserts and promote folding cooperativity.</p>
<p>Except for the antagonistic coupling between the folding of the inserted and discontinuous domains in protein switches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Ha1">[51]</xref>, the design of multi-domain proteins rarely accounts for folding cooperativity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Ha1">[51]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Arviv1">[53]</xref>. Several proteins with inserts have been designed to couple the functions of two domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003938-Ha1">[51]</xref>. Cooperative folding may be advantageous in such proteins and our study suggests that at the least, the less stable domain should be inserted into the more stable one.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3d">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Based on our simulations of AKE, we conclude that the insertion of a smaller and less stable domain into a larger and more stable one promotes folding cooperativity. Given that folding cooperativity is hypothesized to have evolved to reduce misfolding and aggregation, we expect inserted domains to be an important motif in multi-domain proteins. Further, domain insertion (and the resulting protein topology) allows the residues that promote folding cooperativity to be separate from the residues which are required for function. Using structural analysis of several multi-domain protein families, we hypothesize that domain insertion may promote folding cooperativity in at least some other multi-domain proteins whose interfaces are tuned to facilitate substrate binding, conformational transitions or domain mobility and we hope that future experimental studies will investigate this aspect of the folding of multi-domain proteins with inserts.</p>
