<abstract>
<p>Prostate cancer patients often have increased levels of psychological stress or anxiety, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between psychological stress and prostate cancer as well as therapy resistance have been rarely studied and remain poorly understood. Recent reports show that stress inhibits apoptosis in prostate cancer cells via epinephrine/beta2 adrenergic receptor/PKA/BAD pathway. In this study, we used experimental data on the signaling pathways that control BAD phosphorylation to build a dynamic network model of apoptosis regulation in prostate cancer cells. We then compared the predictive power of two different models with or without the role of Mcl-1, which justified the role of Mcl-1 stabilization in anti-apoptotic effects of emotional stress. Based on the selected model, we examined and quantitatively evaluated the induction of apoptosis by drug combination therapies. We predicted that the combination of PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and inhibition of BAD phosphorylation at S112 would produce the best synergistic effect among 8 interventions examined. Experimental validation confirmed the effectiveness of our predictive model. Moreover, we found that epinephrine signaling changes the synergism pattern and decreases efficacy of combination therapy. The molecular mechanisms responsible for therapeutic resistance and the switch in synergism were explored by analyzing a network model of signaling pathways affected by psychological stress. These results provide insights into the mechanisms of psychological stress signaling in therapy-resistant cancer, and indicate the potential benefit of reducing psychological stress in designing more effective therapies for prostate cancer patients.</p>

<p>Psychological stress and anxiety are often experienced by prostate cancer patients, but the underlying mechanisms of interactions between psychological stress and cancer development, as well as drug resistance, are unclear. Here, we employed a systems biology approach to study interactions between stress-activated epinephrine/beta2 adrenergic receptor/protein kinase A signaling and a regulatory network that controls apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. We developed a dynamic network model of signaling pathways that control apoptosis in prostate cancer cells and quantitatively evaluated the effects of stress-activated signaling on apoptosis induced by drug combinations. Experimental data were used to guide modeling, to fit the unknown parameters and validate the model. Based on our model we found that epinephrine/beta2 adrenergic receptor/protein kinase A signaling can decrease drug efficiency, and can shift the effect of drug combination from synergy to antagonism. We also predicted that in addition to BAD phosphorylation Mcl-1 expression could be upregulated by stress/epinephrine signaling to inhibit apoptosis. This study provides insights into the mechanisms of psychological stress signaling in therapy-resistant cancer, and suggests that reducing psychological stress could help to make prostate cancer treatment more effective.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Psychological stress has been implicated in cancer for almost 2 millennia. It has been observed that psychological stress may contribute to cancer initiation and progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003358-Reiche1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003358-Antoni1">[2]</xref>. However, the causal relationship between stress and cancer remains poorly understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003358-Garssen1">[3]</xref>, largely because of limited information about how stress could influence tumor development and drug resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003358-Kulik1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003358-Hassan1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our recent experiments in an animal model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003358-Hassan1">[5]</xref> demonstrated that injections of epinephrine or immobilization stress counteracted the anti-tumor effects of PI3K inhibitors on prostate cancer xenografts in mice. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that psychological stress activates anti-apoptotic signaling in prostate cancer cells and, as a result, contributes to the progression of prostate cancer and chemotherapeutic resistance in advanced prostate cancer. Our experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003358-Hassan1">[5]</xref>– have demonstrated that tumor-promoting effects of stress depend on phosphorylation of BAD, a member of the BH-3 only subfamily of Bcl2 proteins. BAD is phosphorylated at Ser<sup>112</sup> through the epinephrine-beta2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR)-PKA-BAD anti-apoptotic signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003358-Hassan1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003358-Sastry2">[7]</xref>. BAD can also be phosphorylated by other signaling pathways. For example, epidermal growth factor (EGF) triggers phosphorylation of BAD at Ser<sup>112</sup> through the EGFR-Raf-MEK/ERK-KinaseX pathway and at Ser<sup>136</sup> through the Rac-PAK pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003358-Sastry3">[8]</xref>, whereas activated PI3K transmits signals to Ser<sup>136</sup> through AKT activation, and also regulates Ser<sup>112</sup> via an unidentified mechanism partially dependent on Akt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003358-Sastry3">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>To extend analysis of interactions between stress and apoptosis beyond single linear pathway, we used a systems biology approach to study interactions between stress-activated signaling and a regulatory network that controls apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.</p>
<p>Several mathematical models of apoptosis regulation have been developed. A Boolean model of apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003358-Schlatter1">[9]</xref> was proposed to qualitatively analyze the central intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways and connected pathways. Continuous modeling based on kinetic laws, such as the law of mass action and Michaelis-Menten kinetics, is an alternative approach. Constituted by differential equations, a model of the signaling pathways governing apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003358-Legewie1">[10]</xref> demonstrated that inhibition of caspase 3 and caspase 9 resulted in an implicit positive feedback and in bistability. Recently, a mathematic model of Src control on the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003358-Ballesta1">[11]</xref> was designed and fitted to experimental data, used for theoretical design of optimal therapeutic strategies.</p>
<p>However, no models have examined interactions between signaling activated by psychological stress, apoptosis, and drug resistance, particularly, resistance to drug combination therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003358-Labrie1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003358-Weinstein1">[14]</xref>. We developed a systems biology model to examine the role of psychological stress in apoptosis regulation and therapeutic sensitivity, and to further analyze the associated signaling pathways activated by stress hormones. By comparing predictive power of two different models with or without the role of Mcl-1, we predicted that in addition to BAD phosphorylation Mcl-1 expression could be upregulated by stress/epinephrine signaling to inhibit apoptosis. Overall our modeling showed that stress/epinephrine signaling interfered with apoptosis induced in prostate cancer cells by combinations of signal transduction inhibitors.</p>

<p>BAD is a convergence point for several anti-apoptotic signaling pathways in prostate cancer cells. Phosphorylated BAD is critical for the anti-apoptotic effects of such signaling pathways, while dephosphorylated BAD has pro-apoptotic effects. Stress, EGF and PI3K can activate independent signaling pathways that phosphorylate BAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003358-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). These signaling pathways form a convergent network that control apoptosis via BAD phosphorylation.</p>

<title>BAD signaling pathway of apoptosis regulation in prostate cancer cells, mediated by psychological stress.</title>
<p>Phosphorylated BAD is critical for the anti-apoptotic effect of multiple signaling pathways, while dephosphorylated BAD has a pro-apoptotic effect. Stress, EGF, and PI3K can activate independent signaling pathways that phosphorylate BAD. Stress, represented by epinephrine (or VIP) can promote the phosphorylation of BAD at Ser<sup>112</sup> via activation of cAMP and PKA. EGF phosphorylates BAD at Ser<sup>112</sup> through the Ras/Raf-MEK/ERK-KinaseX pathway and at Ser<sup>136</sup> through the Rac-PAK pathway. PI3K transmits signals to Ser<sup>136</sup> through AKT activation, and AKT can partially regulate Ser<sup>112</sup>. The anti-apoptotic role of the activation of CREB and Mcl-1 induced by stress was determined by comparing the predictive power of different models. Multiple drugs targeting different signaling pathways were integrated into the model.</p>

<p>We modeled these signal transduction networks using a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe the dynamic phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of each protein in the pathways. The model was built according to Michaelis-Menten kinetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003358-Klipp1">[15]</xref> using Hill functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003358-Novak1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003358-Mather1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003358-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>) demonstrated that the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 peaks under the stimulation of EGF, and then decreases within 1 hour due to the short term signaling of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003358-Kholodenko1">[18]</xref>.

<p>Next we linked the BAD phosphorylation signaling pathways established above to apoptosis percentage.

<title>Quantitative evaluation of inhibitor combination</title>
<p>Then we investigated the effects of combined signaling inhibitors on apoptosis percentage with or without EGF and/or epinephrine. Since the combination of more than 3 drugs is less realistic for clinical purposes and may lead to unknown side effects, we limited our considerations to a combination of two inhibitors. The dose of each inhibitor in the pairs was set as 1, so the total dose of each combination was 2, which was the same for one single inhibitor “combined” with this inhibitor itself. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003358-g007"><bold>Figure 7A</bold></xref> shows the apoptosis percentages induced by inhibitor combinations under conditions without EGF and epinephrine.

PI3K-AKT pathway was inhibited by LY294002, and the relative phosphorylation of BAD at S112 and S136 was repressed to a low level around 0.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003358-g010"><bold>Figure 10</bold></xref>). When psychological stress was introduced, the epinephrine-β2AR-cAMP-PKA signaling pathway was activated leading to phosphorylation of BAD at S112, which counteracted the repression of BAD phosphorylation at S112 induced by LY294002 and BADS112A. As a result, the relative phosphorylation of BAD at S112 returned to a higher level.</p>

<p>The time course ranges from 0 to 8-ADRB2-cAMP-PKA transducing to both S112BAD and CREB (or Mcl1), stimulated by psychological stress are responsible for the drug resistance and synergism pattern switch in drug combination therapy. Psychological stress activated epinephrine-ADRB2-cAMP-PKA signaling pathway, which counteracted the repression of S112BAD by proposed inhibitors and decreased their apoptosis-inducing effects. Independently of S112BAD and S136BAD, the CREB (or Mcl-1) pathway activated by PKA added an anti-apoptotic role.</p>

<p>In addition to phosphorylation of BAD at S112 and s136, Mcl1 (or CREB) activated by stress signaling could also inhibit apoptotic, so percent apoptosis in cancer cells was decreased compared to the no-stress condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003358-g010"><bold>Figure 10</bold></xref>). Therefore, the differentially activated signaling pathways stimulated by psychological stress, leading to both BAD phosphorylation and Mcl-1 activation, were responsible for the drug resistance and synergism pattern switch in combination therapy.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our modeling strategy successfully captured key kinetic features of the underlying signaling pathways discussed above. We did not describe the kinetics in the pathway by linear equation based on mass action law, since the detailed reaction was unclear and ignorable. Instead, we incorporated by Michaelis-Menten kinetics using the Hill function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003358-Novak1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003358-Mather1">[17]</xref> to integrate less critical reaction details. Based on experimental data, we phenomenologically modeled the rate of change for dephosphorylation of proteins in EGFR-ERK1/2 pathway and apoptosis regulation to be time dependent. The simulation results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003358-g003"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>) were consistent with experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003358-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>), which suggested the fundamental signaling networks used in this work were reliable. In future work, we will integrate elements downstream of BAD, such as BclXL, BAX and BAK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003358-Youle1">[22]</xref>, to investigate a more detailed mechanism related to stress interactions in prostate cancer.</p>
<p>The anti-apoptotic role of BAD phosphorylation mediated by emotional stress has been well studied. Recently, our lab found that, besides BAD, Mcl-1 may be also involved in stress-mediated apoptosis regulation (Hassan et al unpublished data). Here, we applied a systems biology approach to investigate the potential role of Mcl-1 stabilization in anti-apoptotic effects of emotional stress/epinephrine, which was verified by comparing the predictive power of two different models with or without the role of Mcl-1. The selected model with better predictive power will be used to explore effects of stress on Mcl-1 in our ongoing experiments.</p>
<p>Effects of drugs on apoptosis varied depending on which components in the signaling network were targeted. This was due to kinetic asymmetry of different signaling pathways. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003358-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>, PI3K/AKT pathway can phosphorylate BAD at both S112 and S136 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003358-Sastry3">[8]</xref>, so the inhibition of this pathway by PI3K inhibitor LY294002 could induce more cell death compared to other inhibitors, such as N17Rac or DN-PAK1, that target pathways that phosphorylate only one site of BAD. Expression of phosphorylation-deficient mutant BADS112A can also effectively promote apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003358-Hassan1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003358-Sastry1">[6]</xref>. Finally, drug-induced signaling network remodeling is an important and interesting question for future work.</p>
<p>Psychological stress and anxiety are often experienced by prostate cancer patients. The increased psychological stress that can result from cancer progression and diagnosis strengthens the activation of anti-apoptotic signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003358-Hassan2">[19]</xref>, as demonstrated in our simulation, which could decrease therapy efficiency and shift drug combinations from synergy to antagonism. These results also suggest the need for deeper analysis of the role of stress-related signaling in other therapy-resistant cancers.</p>
<p>In summary, we developed a dynamic network model of signaling pathways that control apoptosis in prostate cancer cells to study the role of psychological stress on prostate cancer therapy, and justified the role of Mcl-1 stabilization in anti-apoptotic effects of emotional stress. A drug resistance and synergism switch was revealed in our model, and the associated signaling mechanisms were explored.</p>

<title>Experimental data</title>
<p>We collected data at both the molecular and cellular levels. The molecular data regarding protein phosphorylation included two sets of Western blotting images <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003358-Sastry1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003358-Sastry2">[7]</xref>, both done in LNCaP cells. In the first experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003358-g002"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>), cells were treated with 50 µm LY294002 for 2 hours followed with increasing concentrations of epinephrine (0.01–1000 nm) for 1 h. BAD phosphorylation at Ser112 and CREB phosphorylated at Ser133 were measured. The second set of data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003358-g002"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref>) contains the time course of protein phosphorylation in cells treated with LY294002 followed with EGF 2 hours later. Phospho-Ser473 Akt, phospho-Thr308 Akt, total Akt, phospho-ERK1/2, total ERK1/2, phospho-Ser112 BAD, and total BAD were measured for the indicated times. LY294002, inducing dephosphorylation of HA-BAD at Ser112 and Ser136, was followed by Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003358-g002"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref>). We quantified the Western blotting data using ImageJ software and the normalized values were listed in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003358.s005">Table S3</xref></bold>. For the first experimental data set, there were 8 conditions with or without LY294002 treatment and with increasing concentrations of epinephrine. The concentration of phosphorylated BADs112 was normalized to the control condition without LY294002 treatment and epinephrine. Phosphorylated CREB was normalized to the maximal concentration, since the concentration in the control condition was minimal. For the second experimental data set, there were 10 treatment conditions with different time periods of LY294002 and EGF treatment. Concentrations of phosphorylated S473Akt, S112BAD, and S136 BAD were normalized to the control condition (neither LY294002 nor EGF treatment). Phosphorylated ERK1/2 concentration was normalized to total ERK1/2 concentration, since the concentration of phosphorylated ERK1/2 under the control condition was almost zero. These data were used to estimate the parameters in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003358.e001">Equations (1</xref>–<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003358.e017">13)</xref>.</p>
