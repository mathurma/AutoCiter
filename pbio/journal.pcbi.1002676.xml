        <p>We analyze the problem of obstacle avoidance from a Bayesian decision-theoretic perspective using an experimental task in which reaches around a virtual obstacle were made toward targets on an upright monitor. Subjects received monetary rewards for touching the target and incurred losses for accidentally touching the intervening obstacle. The locations of target-obstacle pairs within the workspace were varied from trial to trial. We compared human performance to that of a Bayesian ideal movement planner (who chooses motor strategies maximizing expected gain) using the Dominance Test employed in Hudson et al. (2007). The ideal movement planner suffers from the same sources of noise as the human, but selects movement plans that maximize expected gain in the presence of that noise. We find good agreement between the predictions of the model and actual performance in most but not all experimental conditions.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>In everyday, cluttered environments, moving to reach or grasp an object can result in unintended collisions with other objects along the path of movement. Depending on what we run into (a priceless Ming vase, a crotchety colleague) we can suffer serious monetary or social consequences. It makes sense to choose movement trajectories that trade off the value of reaching a goal against the consequences of unintended collisions along the way. In the research described here, subjects made speeded movements to touch targets while avoiding obstacles placed along the natural reach trajectory. There were explicit monetary rewards for hitting the target and explicit monetary costs for accidentally hitting the intervening obstacle. We varied the cost and location of the obstacle across conditions. The task was to earn as large a monetary bonus as possible, which required that reaches curve around obstacles only to the extent justified by the location and cost of the obstacle. We compared human performance in this task to that of a Bayesian movement planner who maximized expected gain on each trial. In most conditions, but not all, movement strategies were close to optimal.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Imagine that you are sitting at your desk with a nice, hot cup of coffee in front of you and your laptop keyboard roughly behind it. In reaching out to hit the return key, you plan a trajectory that takes into account the possibility that you might jostle the cup and spill your coffee – that is, you plan a movement trajectory that you would not pick if there were no coffee cup in the way. Whatever trajectory you pick, however, will typically deviate from the one that you planned due to noise/uncertainty in the neuro-motor system. This noise has two important consequences: a risk of inadvertently spilling your coffee, and a risk of missing the key altogether. Your choice of plan involves a tradeoff between the costs and rewards associated with the possible outcomes of your planned movement.</p>
      <p>The motor system, in planning any speeded movement, is selecting a stochastic “bundle” of possible trajectories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002676-Cisek1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002676-Cisek2">[2]</xref> and the particular bundle chosen determines the probabilities of favorable and unfavorable outcomes. There is no basis for selecting one planned trajectory as “best” without knowing the consequences of these different outcomes. If you are reaching to prevent your laptop from deleting your morning's work, you may be quite willing to put your coffee in peril and clean up later. In this article, we consider the problem of obstacle avoidance within the framework of Bayesian decision theory.</p>
      <p>In this first investigation of obstacle avoidance within the framework of Bayesian decision theory, we translate the above example to one where there is an explicit reward for touching targets and an explicit cost for inadvertently intersecting intervening obstacles. We examine human obstacle-avoidance reach trajectories relative to the benchmark performance of an optimal Bayesian reach planner that chooses motor strategies to maximize expected gain as described next.</p>

        <p>To study obstacle-avoidance reaches within the framework of Bayesian decision theory, we translated the above example to one where there is an explicit reward (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) associated with touching a target and an explicit cost (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) associated with inadvertently intersecting an obstacle that is placed between the starting point of the hand and the target. Contact with a physical obstacle placed along the reach path might change the physical character of the reach and such an obstacle would constitute an intrinsic cost whose value we could not easily measure or manipulate. To avoid these issues, we used virtual obstacles that could not impede the reach.</p>
        <p>Although the virtual obstacle is invisible, a visual indication of its leftmost edge (at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) is presented on the monitor prior to each reach. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002676-g001">Figure 1A</xref> shows a front view of the experimental apparatus with the virtual obstacle shown in transparent blue. The blue line on the monitor marks its edge (at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). The subject incurs the cost <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> if the fingertip passes through the virtual obstacle while reaching toward the target (centered on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, with width <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). One part of training will allow subjects to become familiar with the location of the obstacle in depth and how its edge relates to the visual marker (the blue line). Across experimental conditions we varied the location of the obstacle <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and target <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the cost <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> incurred by passing through the obstacle as described in the next section. In all conditions there was a constant relative distance between the obstacle edge <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the center of the target <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002676-g001">Figure 1B</xref> show the same setup but from an overhead viewpoint.

          <title>Notation</title>
          <p>Reward on each trial is determined by (a) the point where the fingertip passes through the fronto-parallel plane containing the obstacle and (b) where it contacts the fronto-parallel plane containing the target. By making the target a vertical strip and the obstacle region a half-plane with a vertical edge, we reduce the analysis of data to observations in the horizontal dimension. In the horizontal dimension, a pair of points in the obstacle and target planes is given by the coordinate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where horizontal coordinates increase from left to right.

              <p><bold>A.</bold> Probability distribution overlaid on a value diagram. For any speeded trajectory past the obstacle to the target, the actual trajectory will differ from the trajectory plan due to motor noise inherent in speeded movement. There are two critical points along the actual trajectory that determine the rewards and costs derived from each movement: the depth planes containing the obstacle and target. We denote the horizontal excursion of the fingertip from the edge of the obstacle (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and the center of the target (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) within their respective depth planes as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Value diagrams plot the 2D space of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> coordinates, with obstacle and target regions colored in blue and grey (respectively). Reward and cost regions overlap when reaches intersect both obstacle and target. We superimpose the probability distribution induced on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> when the subject attempts to execute a particular speeded trajectory. Any planned trajectory induces such a probability distribution, and the subject in planning is effectively choosing among possible distributions. The probability volume over the blue region defines the probability of hitting the obstacle, and the probability volume over the grey region defines the probability of hitting the target. <bold>B</bold>. Value diagram with the probability distribution representing possible intersection-points at the two planes schematized as an equal-probability ellipse.

          <title>The Dominance Test</title>
          <p>Our goal is to examine human obstacle-avoidance reach trajectories relative to the benchmark performance of a Bayesian movement planner that chooses the movement strategy <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> maximizing expected gain (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002676.e042">Equation 1</xref>) for any choice of target and obstacle location and any choice of cost and reward. If we knew the full range of possible movement strategies <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e068" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> we could calculate the strategy (or strategies) <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that maximized the subject's expected gain in any given experimental condition. We could then compare the subject's average trajectory in each condition to the theoretical trajectories predicted by the model. Any discrepancy between measured performance and predicted would be sufficient to reject the Bayesian model. Of greatest interest, though, would be evidence of patterned deviations from optimality. If, for example, the subject consistently picked excursions <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in all conditions farther from the obstacle plane than the predicted optimal <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for that condition, then we could interpret the subject's failure as a kind of loss aversion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002676-Kahneman1">[14]</xref>: the subject is giving too much weight to avoiding the obstacle.</p>
          <p>The key problem in comparing human performance to a Bayesian model maximizing expected gain is that we have no theoretical model of the possible trajectory bundles available to the subject even in the simplest reaching movement. One solution is to build an empirical model based on observed movement strategies under a range of experimental conditions; that is, to measure the possible types of trajectory bundles that might be produced. One can then determine the optimal movement strategy for each condition based on that empirical model.</p>
          <p>Hudson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002676-Hudson1">[15]</xref> formalize this approach as a <italic>Dominance Test</italic>. It consists of two stages: First, characterize the possible movement strategies available to the subject under the conditions of the experiment by analyzing the subject's performance. Second, test whether, in each experimental condition, the subject selected the movement strategy available to him that maximized expected gain. Suppose, for example, that the subject chose movement strategy <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in condition A of an experiment, strategy <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in condition B, and so on through condition D. One can then calculate the expected gain that the subject could achieve by applying strategy <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> through strategy <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in condition A.</p>
          <p>Now suppose that, for example, the gain that would result from applying <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in condition A is the maximum of the gains expected from applying <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> through <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in condition A. In particular, it is greater than the expected gain resulting from applying <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in condition A. We say that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> “dominates” <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in condition A, and, in this hypothetical example, we can be certain that the subject failed to pick the strategy maximizing expected gain in condition A because a strategy known to actually be exhibited by the subject (in condition D) would have performed better in this condition (condition A).</p>
          <p>Hudson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002676-Hudson1">[15]</xref> apply the Dominance Test in each of two experiments and, in the second, reject the hypothesis that subjects maximized expected gain.

          <title>Modeling assumptions</title>
          <p>The evident complexity introduced by the obstacle is that the covariance term <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as well as the desired trajectory <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> change as we change motor strategy and we must develop models of how <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> change, based on the reach trajectories observed in our experiment. We make two simplifying assumptions, both of which we will verify in the data. First, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; the subject aims for the center of the target. Second, for any choice of obstacle location <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e089" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the choice of planned excursion <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e090" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>in the obstacle plane determines both the standard deviation in the obstacle plane (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e091" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and in the target plane (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e092" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). The result is an empirical model of the trajectory bundles (i.e., the distributions <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) available to the subject.</p>
          <p>The novelty of our approach is threefold: (1) We are examining the tradeoff between uncertainty at two points along a reach trajectory, manipulating this tradeoff by altering the costs associated with intersecting the obstacle. (2) We are considering “soft obstacles” where, given an appropriate cost structure, the optimal choice of movement plan may involve a high risk of hitting the obstacle. (3) We apply a method that allows us to compare human obstacle avoidance to the predictions of a Bayesian model even when we have no theoretical model of the possible trajectory bundles available to the subject (the Dominance Test).</p>

          <p>Following practice reaching to the three target locations, subjects were given an opportunity to learn the location of the <italic>obstacle plane</italic> in 3D space along the reach path. The obstacle always occupied part of the plane at the halfway point between the reach start and the monitor (parallel to the monitor). A vertical line representing the obstacle edge and a small circle near that vertical line were drawn on the screen. The vertical line represented the leftmost edge of the obstacle, and the circle was the target to be touched during obstacle practice.

        <p>Because we cannot predict the biomechanical costs associated with reach speed and overall length of reach trajectory that might accompany the longer and faster reaches necessary to reach targets within the timeout interval for, e.g., midline vs. right-of-midline target locations, we restrict the cost function that must be minimized by an optimal reach planner to the target and obstacle costs defined by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e099" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e100" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

The relationships were close to linear and we thus fit three lines relating empirical fingertip standard deviation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e105" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to mean excursion <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> separately for each of the three obstacle positions <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e107" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> because we allowed for the possibility that fingertip standard deviations will change differently for excursions around nearby and further-away obstacles. Similarly we fit three lines relating empirical fingertip standard deviation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e108" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to mean excursion<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e109" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. These six lines allowed us to predict <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e110" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e111" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as a function of any planned excursion <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e112" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. While it is plausible that we could develop a single equation to predict each of the standard deviations, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by incorporating the obstacle location <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> itself we could only do so at the cost of additional assumptions; the equations we use are sufficient for our purposes.</p>
        <p>After having obtained a function relating excursion size and fingertip uncertainty (at both the target and obstacle planes, for all three obstacle positions), it is possible to predict fingertip standard deviations for theoretical excursions (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) not observed experimentally, around any of our obstacles. This in turn allows one to compute the expected gain associated with any theoretical excursion. Maximizing the expected gain function yields the prediction of the optimal reach planner (i.e., the theoretical excursion maximizing expected gain, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) in each of the 9 conditions of the experiment.</p>

        <p>In the previous section we outline our method of predicting the obstacle avoidance behavior of an optimal Bayesian reach planner based on modeled changes in uncertainty, both at the obstacle plane and the target plane, of making reaches that deviate from their natural unobstructed trajectory. Because we parameterize the expected gain function in terms of obstacle-plane excursion, we can test the hypothesis that data conform to the predictions of the optimal Bayesian reach planner by comparing predicted <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and observed (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) obstacle-plane excursions. Data conforming to the Bayesian (optimal planning) model will fall along the identity line of a plot showing observed vs. predicted excursions.</p>
        <p>Notice that we manipulated value to get the range of data needed to predict the standard deviations <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> given the planned excursion <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and we then use these equations to predict the optimal excursion <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e123" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for each condition. The reader may be concerned that there is an apparent circularity in our use of the Dominance Test. The circularity is only apparent, not actual; This is because, no matter how well the empirical fits (relating planned excursion to standard deviations <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) fit the data, there is no guarantee that the average excursion (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) observed in a particular condition, of all possible excursions, will produce the largest possible gain; i.e., that it happened to fall at the theoretical MEG excursion (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) for that condition. Suppose, for example, that the subject consistently chose excursions that are 80% of the way between the edge of the obstacle and the theoretical MEG excursion (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). While the observer has failed to maximize expected gain in <italic>every</italic> condition, the fits relating planned excursions to standard deviations <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e129" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e130" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> will be little affected. We refer the reader to the second experiment of Hudson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002676-Hudson1">[15]</xref>, which used a similar Dominance Test and demonstrated such a patterned failure.</p>
        <p>We compare performance to that predicted by the optimal planning model using standard Bayesian model comparison techniques (see Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002676.s003">Text S1</xref>).

For example, evidence of between 3 and 4.75 dB (or odds of between 2: and 3∶1 favoring one model over the alternative[s]) is usually considered a lower bound for statistically significant evidence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002676-Hudson1">[see e.g.]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002676-Hudson2">[ 15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002676-Jaynes1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002676-Hudson3">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002676-Jeffreys1">[20,21]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Several features of the data can be observed directly in the value diagrams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002676-g003">Figure 3</xref>). First, higher costs lead subjects to avoid the obstacle region by a greater margin: there is an increasing deviation between obstacle-plane crossing points and the obstacle edge as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e131" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> magnitudes increase, across all targets. However, this change in crossing-point is not accompanied by within-target changes in average target-relative endpoints: no matter how great an excursion the finger took around the obstacle, the location of the distribution of target endpoints was unchanged. This relation of endpoint error with target position alone (i.e., independent of excursion) allowed us to model <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e132" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as the average endpoint error in each condition (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), regardless of excursion size. In addition, covariance ellipses consistently increase in size as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e134" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> magnitudes increase (within each target location). These four functions, relating changes in positions and standard deviations to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e135" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> magnitude, are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002676-g004">Figure 4</xref>.</p>

        <p>One can also see a slight positive correlation (“counterclockwise tilt”) in value diagram covariance ellipses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002676-g003">Figure 3</xref>). That is, a rightward deviation from the mean in the obstacle plane tends to be paired with a rightward deviation in the target plane. This correlation implies that there is a component of the trial-to-trial variation in trajectories that affects the entire reach, and is therefore detectable at both obstacle and target planes. This tendency is quite small, however, and is ignored in our modeling.</p>

        <title>Modeling Covariance</title>
        <p>We have developed a simple empirical model of the relationship between horizontal excursion within the obstacle plane and horizontal variance. While the model allows us to predict optimal behavior, we make no claims regarding the factors affecting horizontal variance.</p>
        <p>Our study was not designed to determine the origins of positional uncertainty, a separate and intriguing question. There are very likely many factors that contribute separately to sensory and motor uncertainty and we implicitly assume that those factors (in our task, direction of gaze, body posture, etc.) are selected by the visuo-motor system so as to provide the best possible tradeoffs between hitting the target and avoiding the obstacles.</p>
        <p>To compute optimal reach plans based on the data available in the value diagrams, we re-organize the plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002676-g004">Figure 4</xref> to predict target- and obstacle-plane fingertip positional uncertainty as functions of the observed obstacle-relative fingertip excursion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002676-g005">Figures 5A and 5B</xref>, respectively). Fitting straight-line functions to these data by linear regression (i.e., a line was fit to the data from each obstacle condition separately; <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> ranged from 0.8 to 0.99), we can predict target- and obstacle-plane uncertainties at unobserved fingertip excursions. By varying the theoretical planned excursion (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e146" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), we compute the expected gain (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002676.e042">Equations 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002676.e047">3</xref>) at the obstacle plane (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e147" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), the target plane (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e148" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and overall, predicted as a function of any possible (i.e., non-positive) planned obstacle-plane excursion for each obstacle location and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e149" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> magnitude.

We verified that this was not the case in the Supplement (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002676.s002">Figure S2</xref>). There, we show that the distribution of excursions <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e180" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> does not vary appreciably over the course of each block. To further investigate the possibility of similar cognitive strategies, we computed autocorrelations for each subject and block up to lag 15. No significant autocorrelations were found, suggesting that cognitive “contamination” was not present in our results.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We developed a model of obstacle avoidance within the framework of Bayesian decision theory and tested that model experimentally. We considered the possibility that reach trajectories around an obstacle can be explained quantitatively by a reach planner that minimizes the overall negative effect of an intervening obstacle. Such a reach planner would optimize the trade-off that increases excursion extent to reduce the expected cost of contacting the obstacle, but also decreases excursion extents so that the probability of contacting the eventual target is not drastically reduced.</p>
      <p>This work represents a different approach to the problem than is traditionally taken: We are not attempting to determine how specific elements of the display determine changes in the details of the obstacle-avoidance reach or affect the possible covariance structures at the two points along the trajectory of interest. The Bayesian decision-theoretic approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002676-Berger1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002676-Blackwell1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002676-Maloney1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002676-Maloney2">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002676-Trommershauser1">[26]</xref> allows us to model and consider a wider range of tasks, of which simply hitting the target or avoiding the obstacle are at the extremes of a continuum. We frame the problem as a tradeoff among possible value-weighted outcomes with the motor system able to select among movement plans that assign probabilities to those outcomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002676-Hudson1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We focused on a task where the key tradeoff is between the uncertainties at two locations (depth planes) along a reach trajectory, and we examined the covariance structure induced by a virtual obstacle placed between the subject and the goal. We employed a method for testing whether subjects maximize expected gain (the Dominance Test) based on an empirical characterization of relevant movement strategies available to the subject followed by a test, in each experimental condition, of whether the subject has selected the movement strategy that maximizes expected gain.</p>
      <p>Studies aimed at identifying the visual <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002676-Chapman3">[e.g.]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002676-MonWilliams1">[ 7,11]</xref>, proprioceptive and biomechanical <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002676-Sabes1">[e.g.]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002676-Sabes3">[ 8,27]</xref> elements that affect the specific form of a reach around an obstacle provide valuable contributions to solving the engineering problem of <italic>how</italic> these variables interact to modify reach trajectories planned around an obstacle. Our goal was different. We asked <italic>why</italic>, out of all possibilities, reach trajectories during obstacle avoidance have the form that they do.</p>

        <title>Value Manipulation</title>
        <p>Reaches have goals. Although particularly obvious when reaching around an obstacle, this aspect of reach planning in the presence of an intervening obstacle has previously been ignored. This has created something of a dilemma for subjects, who must choose how much ‘weight’ to assign to accidentally contacting an obstacle vs. successfully touching the target (reminiscent of studies where one is instructed to perform a task ‘as quickly as possible without sacrificing accuracy’). Subjects must resolve the conflict created by these contradictory goals by choosing a relative weighting, a weighting that cannot generally be inferred from the data alone. Here, we avoid these problems; obstacles are assigned a cost, giving a clear indication of the relative ‘importance’ of accidentally contacting an obstacle and of contacting the reach target.</p>
        <p>Not only does our value manipulation allow us to avoid the uncertainty associated with arbitrary target and obstacle weightings that change by subject (and possibly by experimental condition), it is also a necessary element of an optimal model of obstacle-avoidance reach trajectories. The value component of (1) allows us to quantitatively predict the excursion magnitudes that form the basis of the comparison shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002676-g005">Figure 5D</xref>. This in turn allows us to separate the optimal planning model (data on the unity line of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002676-g005">Figure 5D</xref>) from other models of trajectory planning around the virtual obstacle that might make the same qualitative predictions, but are nevertheless quantitatively sub-optimal (though not observed, such data would lie along a non-unity-line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002676-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Such a separation between qualitative and quantitative optimal performance is demonstrated in Tassinari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002676-Tassinari1">[28]</xref> and in Hudson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002676-Hudson1">[15]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Optimal Feedback Control</title>
        <p>Our data have implications for a class of popular models of obstacle avoidance and reach planning in general based on optimal linear feedback control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002676-Todorov1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002676-Todorov2">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002676-ValeroCuevas1">[31]</xref>. One important prediction of these models is that 2D and 3D variance may be partitioned among the axes to produce the best task performance; for example more precision may be required along the horizontal than along the vertical dimension, as in the current experiments. Such a system is capable of partitioning more variance to the dimension requiring less precision. Here, for the first time, we are looking at a task where variance at two points along the trajectory of a reaching movement affects the outcome of the movement. We find no evidence that subjects partition their covariance in response to rewards or costs. Had they done so, there should have been increased vertical variance, not increased horizontal variance. That is, any manipulation that in fact increased horizontal variance should have been ‘referred’ to the vertical dimension, where it would not have adversely affected performance.</p>

        <title>Trajectories Outside the Obstacle and Target Planes and Multiple Trajectory Constraints</title>
        <p>We confined analysis to the intersection of trajectories with the obstacle and target planes. The subject's reward is determined by these two points: fingertip position at the intersection of the obstacle and target plane, nothing more. The subject should select a movement plan, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e181" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, with the criteria that means and covariances in passing through these two critical planes maximize expected gain. Movement plans that satisfy these criteria clearly form a subset of all possible plans, but are they unique? Does the choice of the movement plan that maximizes expected gain in our experiment determine the entire trajectory bundle? Or, are there multiple planned trajectories (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e182" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>,<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e183" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, etc.) that match <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e184" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in mean and covariance at the two critical planes, but that deviate from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e185" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> elsewhere? We cannot exclude this possibility nor can we exclude the possibility that a subject chooses now <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e186" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, now <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e187" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, now <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002676.e188" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, as he pleases. All would count as optimal choices of movement plan. The constraints we impose in the obstacle and target planes serve to select a set of equivalent optimal movement plans but further research is needed to determine the effect of the constraints we impose on the trajectory outside of the obstacle and target plane. In particular we avoided using data from outside the obstacle and target plane precisely because measured means and covariances at points along the trajectory outside of the obstacle and target planes may not reflect any single movement plan and it would be inappropriate to analyze them as if they were determined by the constraints of our task.</p>
        <p>In our task the location of the fingertip at just two points along the trajectory determines the resulting reward or cost. We can readily generalize the task by adding additional obstacles along the path to create tasks for which the subject must consider his covariance at many points along the trajectory. This sort of generalization would allow investigation of the possible covariance structures along the reach trajectory available to the motor system. It also serves as a model task mimicking the constraints of many natural tasks where the goal is to maneuver around multiple obstacles to reach a goal, as in reaching into a computer chassis to extract one component.</p>

        <title>Biological Costs</title>
        <p>We found that subjects' performance was close to that of a Bayesian decision-theoretic movement planner maximizing expected gain except for the most extreme conditions where the optimal choice of trajectory required a large excursion (“detour”) around the virtual obstacle. One possible explanation is that such movements entail a large biological cost and that the subject includes biological costs in the computation of expected gain. In effect he “prices” biological cost and is willing to reduce his monetary gain in order to reduce biological cost as well (see discussion in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002676-Trommershauser2">[32]</xref>). Although our current data cannot speak to this possibility, one might predict that separate measurements of biomechanical cost would allow these extreme conditions to be predicted as well.</p>
        <p>The costs in our task are monetary but in theory would also apply to tasks where movement constraints are the results of injury or disease to the motor system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002676-Mehta1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002676-Hodges1">[34]</xref>. Patients might limit their motor repertoire in order to prevent undesirable outcomes such as pain or clumsiness, leading to long-term, conditioned motor deficits. This idea forms the basis of a now well-established rehabilitation approach, Constraint Induced Movement Therapy, in which the reward/cost structure of the environment is manipulated in ways that encourage the use of the previously avoided regions of motor space <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002676-Taub1">[35]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The conclusions we draw are based on movements confined to a narrow, clearly visible region of space immediately in front of the reviewer. Subjects presumably have considerable experience in coordinating eye and hand in this region of space before they begin the experiment. It would be interesting to investigate in future work with a full range of arm movements, including whether movement plans tend to avoid awkward or unusual movements.</p>

        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>We examined the problem of obstacle avoidance from the standpoint of Bayesian decision theory. Our approach is different from other work in the area of obstacle avoidance. Previously, this problem has been approached from the standpoint of theories that suggest that the CNS minimizes kinematic or dynamic variables (e.g., total force production), with the constraint that the hand path not intersect an obstacle. Of course, this approach fails to take account of two major contributions to real-world movement plans: the uncertainty of visual estimates and motor outcomes (even for the same real-world obstacle and planned trajectory), and variable costs associated with intersecting different kinds of obstacles (accidentally toppling a cup of water is very different from toppling a cup of scalding coffee). Instead, such models always predict the smallest possible trajectory deviation that does not contact the obstacle (with no ‘room for error’, so to speak). Moreover, the approach confounds the effect on trajectory of hitting an impenetrable obstacle and the cost to the subject. To return to the example we began with, it is easy to imagine circumstances where one would smash through the coffee cup to grasp something on the other side, such as a child in danger of falling. We see that obstacle avoidance, when viewed from the standpoint of Bayesian decision theory, can explain the amount of deviation around a virtual obstacle based on the cost of accidentally intersecting it, and the visuo-motor uncertainty in predicting the location of the fingertip when it passes the obstacle and when it reaches the target.</p>
