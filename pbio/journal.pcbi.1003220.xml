<abstract>
<p>Channelrhodospin-2 (ChR2), a light-sensitive ion channel, and its variants have emerged as new excitatory optogenetic tools not only in neuroscience, but also in other areas, including cardiac electrophysiology. An accurate quantitative model of ChR2 is necessary for <italic>in silico</italic> prediction of the response to optical stimulation in realistic tissue/organ settings. Such a model can guide the rational design of new ion channel functionality tailored to different cell types/tissues. Focusing on one of the most widely used ChR2 mutants (H134R) with enhanced current, we collected a comprehensive experimental data set of the response of this ion channel to different irradiances and voltages, and used these data to develop a model of ChR2 with empirically-derived voltage- and irradiance- dependence, where parameters were fine-tuned via simulated annealing optimization. This ChR2 model offers: 1) accurate inward rectification in the current-voltage response across irradiances; 2) empirically-derived voltage- and light-dependent kinetics (activation, deactivation and recovery from inactivation); and 3) accurate amplitude and morphology of the response across voltage and irradiance settings. Temperature-scaling factors (Q<sub>10</sub>) were derived and model kinetics was adjusted to physiological temperatures. Using optical action potential clamp, we experimentally validated model-predicted ChR2 behavior in guinea pig ventricular myocytes. The model was then incorporated in a variety of cardiac myocytes, including human ventricular, atrial and Purkinje cell models. We demonstrate the ability of ChR2 to trigger action potentials in human cardiomyocytes at relatively low light levels, as well as the differential response of these cells to light, with the Purkinje cells being most easily excitable and ventricular cells requiring the highest irradiance at all pulse durations. This new experimentally-validated ChR2 model will facilitate virtual experimentation in neural and cardiac optogenetics at the cell and organ level and provide guidance for the development of <italic>in vivo</italic> tools.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Optogenetics, the use of light-sensitive ion channels for stimulation of mammalian cells and tissues, offers specificity and superior precision of control compared to traditional chemical or electrical means of stimulation. In particular, Channelrhodospin-2 (ChR2), a light-sensitive ion channel, originally derived from algae, has found wide-spread application in neuroscience for controlled stimulation of different brain regions. More recently, this work was extended to other organs, including the heart, where it opens the possibility for a new generation of optical pacemakers. The development of new optogenetic tools that allow for more efficient optical stimulation can be guided by computational prediction of the response of different cells and tissues to light. In this report, we provide a new computational model of ChR2 that was empirically validated and can be inserted into different cell types – neurons or heart cells – for virtual optical stimulation and prediction of optimal light-delivery arrangements, minimum energy needs etc. Overall, virtual optogenetics can accelerate the development of new optical stimulation tools for better understanding and control of brain and heart function.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Quantitative biophysical approaches have strong traditions in neural and cardiac electrophysiology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Noble1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Hodgkin1">[4]</xref>. The dynamic and highly nonlinear process of cellular excitation is still successfully captured today by Hodgkin and Huxley's empirical modeling framework from 1952 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Hodgkin1">[4]</xref>, even though the complexity of computational models is ever-increasing to reflect new discoveries about diversity in ion channels and their characteristics. The function of classical ion channels is described by voltage- and time-dependent equations; in some cases, additional chemical or mechanical control parameters are used. Only recently, <italic>light-sensitive ion channels</italic> originally found in bacteria or yeast have proven relevant to mammalian electrophysiology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Boyden1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Nagel1">[6]</xref>. These ion channels provide alternative (optical) means of excitation with superior (cell type) specificity and spatiotemporal resolution compared to electrical stimulation. A new field of genetically expressing light-sensitive ion channels in vertebrates to confer specific optical responsiveness has become known as optogenetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Deisseroth1">[7]</xref>. Computational optogenetics, i.e. quantitative modeling for virtual experimentation in optogenetics, is in its infancy with only a handful of published reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Grossman1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Hegemann1">[12]</xref>. Computational optogenetics can aid in quick (virtual) testing of the behavior of newly developed tools in a wide range of cell types, and within realistic tissue settings. Such simulations can also drive the rational design of new optogenetics tools optimized for a specific cell/tissue environment. Furthermore, they can assist in the proper interpretation of experiments within a complex cell/tissue environment, which is often ambiguous and challenging.</p>
<p>Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) is the first light-sensitive ion channel that, after its cloning in 2003 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Nagel2">[13]</xref>, found widespread use as an optical actuator in neuroscience <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Boyden1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Bernstein1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Yizhar1">[16]</xref>, and more recently - in cardiac applications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Abilez1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Bruegmann1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Entcheva1">[19]</xref>. ChR2 is both light- and voltage-sensitive. The conducting pore of the channel associates (via a covalent bond) to retinal, which serves as the chromophore (the light-sensing element). Interaction of all-trans-retinal with a photon of the proper wavelength (470 nm) leads to instantaneous isomerization to 13-cis-retinal. This transition triggers the opening of the ion channel allowing cation movements down their electrochemical gradient, with preferential selectivity to H<sup>+</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Nagel2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Lin1">[20]</xref>. ChR2 provides exclusively inward current (at negative membrane potentials) with a reversal potential near 0 mV. The single channel conductance for the wild type ChR2 is small compared to classical excitatory ion channels (e.g. sodium channels) with reported values ranging from 40–90 fS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Nagel2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Feldbauer1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Zimmermann1">[22]</xref> to 0.25–2.42 pS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Lin1">[20]</xref>. Genetically engineered mutants of ChR2, e.g. H134R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Nagel1">[6]</xref>, T159C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Berndt1">[23]</xref> and ET/TC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Berndt1">[23]</xref>, offer augmented excitatory current; while other mutants alter kinetics to serve different uses, e.g. fast ChETA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Gunaydin1">[24]</xref> or stable switches with a prolonged open state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Berndt2">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>As a prototypical opsin, ChR2 has become the focus of the initial efforts to create a computational branch of optogenetics. ChR2's photocycle has been studied extensively and it formed the basis for abstracting the behavior of the channel to Markov type (three- and four-) state models proposed recently by Hegemann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Hegemann1">[12]</xref> and Nikolic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Nikolic1">[9]</xref>. Versions of a four-state model are currently favored based on experimental evidence for four kinetic intermediates with differing time constants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Hegemann1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Bamann1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Stehfest1">[27]</xref>. Current efforts also include modeling of different mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Grossman1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Talathi1">[11]</xref>, as well as the integration of ChR2 into comprehensive cell models – neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Grossman1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Talathi1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Foutz1">[28]</xref> and cardiomyocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Abilez1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Wong1">[29]</xref>. While ChR2's light sensitivity has been studied extensively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Nagel2">[13]</xref>, data on its voltage dependence are limited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Chater1">[30]</xref>. Early models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Nikolic1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Talathi1">[11]</xref> assumed a linear current-voltage relationship and no voltage-dependent gating. Since experimental results demonstrate prominent inward rectification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Nagel1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Jia1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Lin1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Feldbauer1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Chater1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Gradmann1">[31]</xref>, more recent ChR2 models have incorporated some nonlinearity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Grossman1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Abilez1">[10]</xref>. Voltage sensitivity, however, has yet to be comprehensively addressed.</p>
<p>Proper quantitative prediction of the functionality of light-sensitive ion channels, including ChR2, within mammalian cells and tissues, requires that the kinetics and amplitude of the observed current are scaled to reflect physiological conditions, even when the channel is characterized primarily at room temperature. In this study, we provide a rigorously validated quantitative model of a mutant of ChR2 with enhanced current, the H134R variant, based on experimental data collected over a wide range of irradiances and voltages. The result is a new ChR2 model with updated voltage dependences – not only of the current-voltage response but also of relevant kinetic parameters. We also empirically derive scaling factors (Q<sub>10</sub>) to adjust processes to physiological temperature. Experimental validation of the model-predicted ChR2 behavior in guinea pig ventricular cardiomyocytes was done using an optical action potential clamp. Finally, our simulations with different human cardiomyocyte types (ventricular, atrial and Purkinje cells) offer insights into the differential cell-specific response to ChR2-mediated stimulation depending on the ion channel milieu and about actual light irradiances needed to excite such human cells. This validated ChR2 model can serve as a new tool for expanding computational optogenetics to complex tissues and organs, e.g. the brain and the heart.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We developed and validated a new mathematical model of the light-sensitive ion channel ChR2 (with the H134R mutation) based on a comprehensive experimental data set collected in a ChR2(H134R)-HEK293 stable cell line we have described earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Jia1">[18]</xref>. This new model uses a previously established state-transition diagram for the functioning of the channel but yields some new voltage and light dependencies that may be critical in understanding the operation of ChR2 in cardiomyocytes and other cells with more complex action potential morphology.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Using empirical constraints for model development</title>
<p>To construct a ChR2 model that matches ion current responses across voltages and irradiances, we defined five empirical measures of the ChR2 current response to a light pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003220-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>): two amplitude measures (peak current, I<sub>p</sub>, and steady-state current, I<sub>ss</sub>) and three kinetic measures (time constant of activation, τ<sub>ON</sub>, of deactivation, τ<sub>OFF</sub>, and of inactivation, τ<sub>INACT</sub>). These five simplified morphology-capturing measures were quantified (via nonlinear fitting described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> section) for experimental traces obtained under various sets of voltages and irradiances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003220-g001"><bold>Figure 1C</bold></xref>). They were then used as guidance/constraints for the fitting of the actual model parameters, including the seven state transition rates in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003220-g001"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>, assuming a four-state model structure, as previously proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Nikolic1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Hegemann1">[12]</xref>. Fitting was done using multi-parameter optimization via simulated annealing in MATLAB, Mathworks, Natick, MA (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Additional constraints were imposed by data on recovery from inactivation obtained using a classic S1–S2 protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003220-g001"><bold>Figure 1D</bold></xref>), yielding a sixth empirical measure – time constant of recovery from inactivation, τ<sub>R</sub>.</p>

<p>We assumed mono-exponential processes for the respective transitions, although it has been suggested that this may not be completely accurate for the deactivation (τ<sub>OFF</sub>) of wild type ChR2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Nikolic1">[9]</xref>. Nevertheless, for our experimental data on the H134R mutant, the mono-exponential curve fits yielded a good approximation and faithfully captured the magnitude and morphology of the ChR2 current under various experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003220-g002"><bold>Figure 2AB</bold></xref>). When bi-exponential fits were enforced for some of the transient processes, as suggested in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Nikolic1">[9]</xref>, these degenerated to mono-exponential curves for our experimental traces.</p>

<title>Accurate capture of ChR2's prominent inward current-voltage rectification</title>
<p>We and others have shown that ChR2 and its variants display strong inward rectification for both the peak and steady-state current at voltages above 0mV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Jia1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Lin1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Chater1">[30]</xref>.

Therefore, we collected a comprehensive experimental data set using multiple combinations of voltage and irradiances. We then performed multiparameter optimization on the experimental data to derive an empirical rectification function (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003220-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003220.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>), and reproduce the experimental I–V curves with the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003220-g002"><bold>Figure 2C–H</bold></xref>). Experimental measurements of the reversal potential of ChR2 with high precision are challenging because of the small current and poor signal-to-noise ratio around that point.

<p>The ratio of the steady-state to peak current for ChR2 varies considerably among its genetically-engineered variants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Yizhar1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Mattis1">[32]</xref>. Consequently, a proper representation of this parameter over the matrix of voltage-irradiance values required reconsideration of the light sensitivity of the current, and adjustment of some parameters, especially an increase in the absorption cross-section, σ<sub>ret</sub>. This parameter is directly dependent on the extinction coefficient for retinal and its value is spectrally sensitive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Ernst1">[33]</xref>.</p>

<title>Differential light- and voltage-dependence of ChR2's kinetic parameters (activation, deactivation and inactivation)</title>
<p>None of the previously published ChR2 models include voltage–dependent kinetics. Our experimental data revealed strong non-linear light dependence for τ<sub>ON</sub> and τ<sub>INACT</sub> (exponentially decreasing with higher irradiance), which was statistically significant (P&lt;0.001) in both cases, but a relatively light-insensitive τ<sub>OFF</sub>, P = 0.044 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003220-g003"><bold>Figure 3A–I</bold></xref>). Furthermore, we show experimentally (consistent with prior data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Chater1">[30]</xref>) that τ<sub>INACT</sub> is completely voltage-independent (P = 0.178), but τ<sub>ON</sub> and τ<sub>OFF</sub> exhibit mild voltage dependence, which was statistically significant (P = 0.009 and P&lt;0.01, respectively), not included in any previous models. The latter was captured in the model by introducing voltage dependence in the transition from O<sub>1</sub> to C<sub>1</sub> (G<sub>d</sub>), see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003220-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref><bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003220.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>.

Sample responses (an experiment and model simulation) illustrate that for an inter-pulse interval of 3 s, a fixed irradiance (1.6 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) and two holding voltages (−40 mV and −80 mV), the recovery is incomplete, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003220-g004"><bold>Figure 4A–B</bold></xref>. A rigorous experimental examination of the recovery from inactivation revealed that the process (τ<sub>R</sub>) depends on both voltage and irradiance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003220-g004"><bold>Figure 4C–J</bold></xref>), where more positive voltages slow the recovery significantly, while higher irradiances mildly speed the recovery from inactivation. Since in the model, the C<sub>2</sub> to C<sub>1</sub> transition (G<sub>r</sub>) is the parameter most directly linked to τ<sub>R</sub>, we derived an empirical voltage dependence of this rate constant matching the experimental findings. A qualitative summary of the voltage- and irradiance dependence of the six key parameters describing the ChR2 response is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003220-t002"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>.</p>

<title>ChR2 current is temperature-dependent: Q<sub>10</sub> derivation for scaling to physiological temperatures</title>
<p>As with the majority of studies on ion channels, our experiments were conducted at room temperature.

These Q<sub>10</sub> values were found to be relatively voltage-independent, except for τ<sub>OFF</sub>, and within the range of Q<sub>10</sub> values for classic ion channel parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Allen1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003220-g005"><bold>Figure 5E–F</bold></xref>.

<p>Optical stimulation can affect local temperature experienced by the target cells. However, for the wavelengths considered here (470 nm) and the irradiance levels typically used in our experiments (0.1 to 5.5 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>), we find by theoretical analysis that such temperature changes will be negligible. More specifically, using a closed-form solution for the diffusive partial differential equation to model maximum temperature change during heating of a water-based particle within aqueous medium similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Axelrod1">[35]</xref> (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003220.s011">Text S1</xref></bold>), we find that after a single 90 ms light pulse at 5.5 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>, temperature at the center of the light beam will rise by approximately 0.013°C, and for much longer pulses at this irradiance, the saturation temperature rise will be less than 0.04°C. Therefore, heating effects due to the light application itself were not taken into account in the model.</p>

<title>Functionality of the ChR2 within different cardiac cell types – implications for optical excitability</title>
<p>There are no prior records of the behavior of I<sub>ChR2</sub> during a cardiac action potential. To obtain such data, adult guinea pig ventricular myocytes, virally transduced with ChR2, were used here. A modified version of the action potential clamp (AP clamp) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Doerr1">[36]</xref> was applied (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). During the voltage clamp with an optically-triggered AP, the absence of light (dark condition) was used as a selective ChR2 “blocker”, while the ChR2 “enabling” condition required a precisely-timed optical pulse during the AP clamp. An example of such experimental record is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003220-g006"><bold>Figure 6B–D</bold></xref>, confirmed in additional three cells. When timing of the optical pulse was altered (delayed by 100 ms), the distinctive inward net current was lost, thus corroborating ChR2 as a likely source. Striking morphological similarity, albeit not exact quantitative match, is seen between the experimentally-obtained and model-simulated ChR2 current within the ventricular action potential of a guinea pig cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003220-g006"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref>). Since the I<sub>ChR2</sub> scaling in the model is based on average cell data in a HEK-ChR2 cell line, some difference in the magnitude of the current between the model and an individual guinea pig ventricular myocyte, likely with different ChR2 expression levels, is not surprising.</p>

<p>The final ChR2 model, scaled to physiological temperatures, was inserted into several other cardiac cell types, including a human ventricular myocyte <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-tenTusscher1">[37]</xref>, human atrial myocyte <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Courtemanche1">[38]</xref>, and a human Purkinje cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Sampson1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003220-g007"><bold>Figure 7</bold></xref>. In the dark, the channel has no contribution to the cell electrophysiology. Upon a typical supra-threshold light pulse (in this example, 10 ms pulse at 470 nm, 0.5 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>), an inward current is generated, that is sufficient to initiate an action potential in each of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003220-g007"><bold>Figure 7A</bold></xref>). This light-triggered current is self-terminating – a slight outward current is generated after the membrane potential exceeds the reversal potential for ChR2. It is interesting to note the differential response of ChR2 within these three cell types - a smaller ChR2 current is sufficient to bring about excitation in Purkinje, while ventricular myocytes require the highest current, i.e. are the hardest to excite by light across a range of pulse amplitudes and durations (strength-duration curves shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003220-g007"><bold>Figure 7C</bold></xref>). Identical conductance values were chosen for ChR2 in all three cell types based on our data from the ChR2-HEK cell line; g<sub>ChR2</sub> may vary depending on the efficiency of gene expression and the specific cell environment. We find that ChR2 current density or expression levels will scale the strength-duration curves in a similar way for all three cell types, i.e. higher expression levels will monotonically reduce the optical energy needed to excite (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003220.s002">Figure S2</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Motivation for developing a new ChR2 (H134R) model</title>
<p>The quantitative modeling of light-sensitive ion channels from bacteria or yeast, e.g. ChR2, recently used for functional control of mammalian cells and tissues, forms the foundation of a new field - computational optogenetics, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Grossman1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Hegemann1">[12]</xref>. The first computational models were designed to recapitulate primarily the light-responsiveness in optical stimulation of neurons mediated by ChR2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Nikolic1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Hegemann1">[12]</xref>, introducing only rudimentary linear voltage dependence. In contrast to its neuronal use, functionality of ChR2 within cardiomyocytes is impacted by the morphology of the longer action potentials, and therefore voltage dependences need to be described accurately. <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003220.s004">Figure S4</xref></bold> compares the response of a model without nonlinear voltage dependences to the model presented here. Without nonlinearity in the current-voltage characteristics (i.e. no rectification), the functionality of the ion channel within a cardiac cell is misrepresented by an erroneous repolarizing current during the plateau phase of the action potential (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003220.s004">Figure S4C</xref></bold>). Our motivation was to develop a model that accurately captures features of the channel that can affect its action within cardiomyocytes, especially as related to voltage-dependent properties.</p>
<p>Recently, a three-state ChR2 model was published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Abilez1">[10]</xref> that focuses on the same mutant as this study – H134R. The model derived here, matching key empirical measures in our comprehensive experimental data, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003220-g001"><bold>Figures 1</bold></xref><bold>–</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003220-g004"><bold>4</bold></xref>, was compared to the published three-state model of ChR2-H134R. <bold>Figures S5–S6</bold> reveal that this prior model was inconsistent with our data. The main differences include a smaller steady-state current in the published model (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003220.s005">Figure S5</xref></bold>), much lower steady-state to peak ratios (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003220.s006">Figure S6A</xref>–B</bold>), and slower opening of the channel across irradiances and voltages (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003220.s006">Figure S6C</xref>–D</bold>). These significant differences in the response to light and voltage could lead to inaccurate predictions of the action of the channel within cardiomyocytes as shown in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003220.s007">Figure S7</xref></bold>. The source of this discrepancy is unclear but potential confounding factors may include the different cell environment - we used a homogeneous experimental data set acquired in stable HEK cell line with ChR2-H134R, while the published model was partially based on data obtained in cardiomyocytes derived from embryonic stem cells expressing this channel. While classical voltage-gated ion channels are often characterized in artificial heterologous systems under the assumption that their salient features remain independent of the cell environment, for the light-sensitive ChR2 that associates with a cell-derived chromophore, all-trans-retinal, this assumption will need to be tested. To this end, there is no systematic evidence for cell-dependent properties of ChR2 or any other optogenetic tools. Another possible contributor to the discrepancy between the two models in <bold>Figures S5–S7</bold>, can be insufficient constraints used in the prior model construction, i.e. the comprehensiveness of the matrix of voltages and irradiances employed previously was unclear. An interesting question, stemming from the discrepancy between these two mathematical models, is whether the assumed state-transition structure (three states vs. four states in our model) may have been restrictive in any way.</p>

<title>Model structure and empirical approach to ChR2 modeling</title>
<p>Following a tradition of modeling classical ion channels, we adopted an empirical approach towards modeling ChR2. The specific four-state Markov model used here, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003220-g001"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>, is loosely based on functional data about the channelrhodopsin photocycle kinetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Bamann1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Stehfest1">[27]</xref> and has been suggested as most suitable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Nikolic1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Hegemann1">[12]</xref>, although not unique. The simpler three-state model structure, used in the model of ChR2-H134R by Abilez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Abilez1">[10]</xref>, discussed above, is non-branching, with strictly unidirectional flow of transitions, unlike the four-state model used here. Despite its ability to capture qualitatively most of the ChR2 features, such circular three-state model has been criticized previously for limitations in the quantitative description of ChR2's light sensitivity, switch-off kinetics and pH-dependent action spectra shifts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Nikolic1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Ernst1">[33]</xref>. Some of these limitations also may have contributed to the discrepancies with our model in <bold>Figures S4–S7</bold>.</p>
<p>All published mathematical models of ChR2 invariably describe the transition from C<sub>2</sub> to C<sub>1</sub> as irreversible, i.e. C<sub>2</sub> will always recover completely to C<sub>1</sub> in the dark. However, Ernst et al. detected in Volvox Channelrhodopsin (VChR) a pH-dependent equilibrium between photocycle dark states D470 and D480, which approximate to states C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> in our mathematical model of ChR2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Stehfest1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Ernst1">[33]</xref>. To probe for the existence of such dark-state equilibrium and its potential voltage-dependence in ChR2, we designed an experimental protocol (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003220.s008">Figure S8B</xref></bold>) with varied “pre-conditioning” voltage for an extended period in the dark prior to clamping at −80 mV and optically stimulating with blue light.</p>
<p>Our experimental results (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003220.s008">Figure S8C</xref>–F</bold>) show an increase in peak current (I<sub>P</sub>), faster activation kinetics (τ<sub>ON</sub>) and slower kinetics of inactivation (τ<sub>INACT</sub>) with more positive pre-stimulation voltages, particularly above 0 mV. This suggests the presence of voltage-dependent dark equilibrium between C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> with increasing preference for the C<sub>1</sub> state at more positive voltages. Therefore, an augmented 4-state, 8-transition model can be considered (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003220.s008">Figure S8A</xref></bold>), allowing for a C<sub>1</sub>→C<sub>2</sub> transition with a rate G<sub>r12</sub> (similar to e<sub>12</sub> and e<sub>21</sub>), while the reverse transition is with a rate G<sub>r21</sub>.</p>
<p>In light of these results, the time constant for recovery from inactivation, τ<sub>R</sub>, corresponds to 1/(G<sub>r12</sub>+G<sub>r21</sub>) instead of the current τ<sub>R</sub> = 1/G<sub>r</sub> dependence. The development of a new model with such alternative structure can include the following constraints for determination of G<sub>r12</sub>(V) and G<sub>r21</sub>(V): 1) model output of peak current I<sub>P</sub> and the ratio of peak current to steady-state current I<sub>P</sub>/I<sub>SS</sub>, 2) model activation kinetics (τ<sub>ON</sub>), and 3) G<sub>r</sub>(V), which slows with more positive voltages. Preliminary optimization attempts to accommodate such a model structure within these constraints and without introducing additional state transitions showed that a significant increase in γ (the ratio of O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>1</sub>) from its current value of 0.1 is needed. The validity of such a change in the model is unclear, and several alternative scenarios are possible. Namely, a different set of constraints may yield more plausible model parameters. Alternatively, additional model transitions may be added as in Stehfest et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Stehfest1">[27]</xref> that will relax the constraints and possibly yield a different optimal parameter set. In either case, re-structuring the model requires more experimental data than provided here.</p>

<title>Voltage dependencies of ChR2</title>
<p>The first incarnation of a channelrhodopsin model used a reaction scheme built around ChR1's photocycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Hegemann1">[12]</xref> and voltage-dependent nonlinearities were ignored.

Alternatively, inward rectification can be modeled in a more mechanistic way if compelling experimental data are available.

From mathematical/biophysical point of view, these can involve: 1) classic Hodgkin-Huxley style gating; 2) Goldmann-Hodgkin-Katz mechanism of rectification; 3) asymmetric barrier/leaky proton pump – a mechanism put forward by Feldbauer et al. to explain rectification by single-channel properties from noise analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Feldbauer1">[21]</xref>; and 4) a mechanism based on the kinetics of multiple ion species interacting with the channel. The last mechanism was favored in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Gradmann1">[31]</xref>, whereas the remaining three were eliminated based on insufficient nonlinearity to match the experimental data.</p>
<p>In addition to the scenarios discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Gradmann1">[31]</xref>, we note that cytosolic Mg<sup>2+</sup> and cytosolic polyamines (spermine, spermidine, putrescine, cadaverine) are known as common/universal mediators of ion current rectification across a variety of channels, although the exact mechanisms remain elusive. Mg<sup>2+</sup> block and rectification was first reported in the 1980s for inward rectifier channels from the Kir family, including the cardiac Ik1(Kir2.1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Matsuda1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Oliva1">[41]</xref>, as well as for ACh-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Horie1">[42]</xref>. Later, it was established that Mg<sup>2+</sup> acts at low-affinity sites, while endogenous cytosolic polyamines act on high-affinity sites and both mediate rectification. Importantly, polyamines' role in rectification was confirmed for a variety of target channels: inward rectifier, including the cardiac isoform (Kir2.1) by Lopatin and Ficker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Lopatin1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Ficker1">[44]</xref>, ryanodine receptors and their rectification properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Uehara1">[45]</xref>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive AMPA receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Donevan1">[46]</xref>, and recently also for rectification of cloned Na<sup>+</sup> channels, especially the cardiac isoform (Nav1.5) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Fu1">[47]</xref>. Future work should test the possibility for polyamine-mediated rectification in ChR2; such new experimental data can form the basis for a more mechanistic description of voltage rectification within the ChR2 model.</p>
<p>The voltage dependencies in our ChR2 model also extend to some kinetic properties. More specifically, in order to match the experimental data, we had to introduce voltage dependence in the time constants associated with ChR2 opening, closing and especially recovery from inactivation, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003220-t002"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>. The mechanism of such voltage sensitivity has not been discussed before. Very recent structural data on ChR2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Kato1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Muller1">[49]</xref> provide only general information about the seven transmembrane domains, four of which (1, 2, 3 and 7) define the conductive pore, with TM2 determining its ion selectivity, and TM7 being critical for the interaction with the chromophore. We did not find direct evidence for a unique region within the ChR2 pore that is equivalent to a classical voltage sensor, i.e. a specific sequence of charged amino acids (Arg<sup>+</sup>, Lys<sup>+</sup> residues at every third position with nonpolar residues in-between), normally found in the S4 transmembrane domain of voltage-gated ion channels with a tetrameric structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Hille1">[50]</xref>, see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003220.s009">Figure S9</xref></bold>. However, many ligand-gated ion channels, e.g. ACh channel, have been known to display voltage-dependent gating in the absence of classical voltage sensors, but purely due to basic electrostatic interactions between the charged ion channel pore and the flowing ions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Hille1">[50]</xref>. Further work (through mutagenesis) can pinpoint the mechanism of ChR2's voltage-dependent kinetics suggested by our data.</p>

<title>Application of ChR2 model to optical excitation of cardiac tissue</title>
<p>With the realization that optogenetics implies the use of ChR2 within mammalian cells, including cardiac, at physiological temperatures, we derive here scaling factors (Q10) for the model parameters for accurate description of its operation at 37°C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003220-g005"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref>. We deem this essential since most characterization is done at room temperature, while within mammalian cells the operation of ChR2 will be critically dependent on its interaction with the endogenous ion channels, whose properties have been scaled to physiological temperatures. Interestingly, we find that Q10 scaling values for ChR2 parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003220-g005"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref>) fall within the range of temperature sensitivity values for classical voltage-gated ion channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Allen1">[34]</xref>, with expected acceleration of kinetics at elevated temperatures.</p>
<p>To gain confidence in the performance of the proposed model within a cardiac myocyte, it is important to validate the contribution of this exogenous current within the cardiac electrophysiology milieu. Such experimental data for I<sub>ChR2</sub> during a cardiac action potential has not been presented before. Classically, to dissect ionic currents during an action potential, AP clamp approaches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Doerr1">[36]</xref> are used in conjunction with specific pharmacological blocking agents. Lack of light is a very selective “blocker” of I<sub>ChR2</sub>, however enabling I<sub>ChR2</sub> (within the AP clamp context) is more complicated. Owing to the dynamic response of I<sub>ChR2</sub> to a light pulse (in contrast to the response of a typical ion channel to the presence of a blocker), a modified version of the AP clamp was used here with a precisely synchronized optical pulse to extract I<sub>ChR2</sub>. The overall excellent agreement between the model-predicted and experimentally-obtained I<sub>ChR2</sub> during a guinea pig ventricular action potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003220-g006"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref>) lends support to the use of this ChR2 model in other cell types. However, caution should be applied when longer-term optical pacing is considered since this model has not been experimentally constrained to reflect potential long-term inactivation, potential changes in the pH and/or the reversal potential.</p>
<p>Among the advantages of optogenetic stimulation are the spatiotemporal resolution and specificity of action, normally achieved by a cell-type specific promoter for gene expression. These advantages are currently at the crux of deciphering neural circuits in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Yizhar1">[16]</xref>. Similarly, in the heart, there is cell type diversity and spatial gradients of ion channel expression, however, many fewer experimental tools are available for specific cell targeting, i.e. cell-specific promoters for driving exogenous gene expression. Alternative targeting of cell types can be achieved by dosing optical energy and taking advantage of the different excitation threshold of cardiomyocytes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003220-g007"><bold>Figure 7</bold></xref> illustrates that, similar to electrical stimulation, optical excitation threshold is much lower for Purkinje cells than atrial or ventricular myocytes. Different ion channel composition resulting in altered balance of depolarizing (excitatory) and repolarizing (inhibitory) currents across cardiac cells plays an important role in their response to ChR2 as well. More specifically, the human cardiomyocyte models discussed here, have distinctly different inward rectifier current, I<sub>K1</sub>, which serves as the main opposing force to excitatory signals - peak I<sub>K1</sub> after a 10 ms optical pulse for V: 1.84 pA/pF; for A: 0.49 pA/pF, and for P: 0.32 pA/pF (see also <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003220.s010">Figure S10</xref></bold>). Indeed, when simulating a ventricular myocyte with a Purkinje formulation of I<sub>K1</sub> (squares in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003220-g007"><bold>Figure 7C</bold></xref>), we find a significant reduction in excitation threshold (down to 12%, 28% and 37% of the original V-cell irradiance at 100 ms, 20 ms and 5 ms pulses, respectively. In addition to differences in single-cell electrophysiology, the coupling environment of these cell types is different, with ventricular myocytes facing the highest electrotonic load. These results suggest that the Purkinje cells (and the conduction system, in general) may be the preferential target for <italic>in vivo</italic> optical pacing at very low energy. We have confirmed this in a 3D computational heart model exploring different spatial arrangements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Boyle1">[51]</xref>.</p>
<p>Further utility of the ChR2 model developed here can be found in guiding the optimization of spatial gene and light delivery, as demonstrated in our preliminary simulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Boyle1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Boyle2">[52]</xref> for <italic>in vivo</italic> low-energy use. Within cardiac optogenetics, the extension of this work to realistic heart geometries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Wong1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Boyle1">[51]</xref> can precede and guide the design of proper optical actuating assemblies, which face many more challenges than the neuronal <italic>in vivo</italic> tools built around stereotactic systems. As the optogenetics toolbox expands to include more new mutants to serve different experimental needs, we believe that the computational framework presented here (with algorithms for automatic parameter identification) can be adopted to morph this model into other newly developed channels.</p>

<title>Experimental measurements of ChR2 current</title>
<p>Whole-cell patch clamp experiments were used to record the ChR2-mediated current. HEK-ChR2 cells were harvested by trypsinization and replated at a low density on polylysine-coated coverslips prior to experimentation. Cells were clamped using an Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA) and borosilicate glass pipettes (World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL) at room temperature (22°C). An inverted microscope (Olympus, CK40) was used for visualization during the patch-clamp procedure. Membrane currents were at recorded sampling frequencies of 200 Hz to 10 kHz (latter used for all kinetics measurements), digitized (DIGIDATA 1320A, Axon Instruments), and stored for subsequent offline analysis. The pipette solution contained (in mmol/L) potassium aspartate 80, KCl 50, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1, MgATP 3, EGTA 10, and HEPES 10 (pH 7.4 with KOH).

<p>Light-mediated ChR2 currents were triggered by a blue LED (470 nm) unit attached to the microscope epi-illumination port and controlled by a high-power LED driver (both from Thorlabs, Newton, NJ). Light was delivered to the cells through a 40× objective. Optical power was measured with a standard optical power meter (PMD100D, Thorlabs), and irradiance (mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) was calculated based on the illumination spot size (average, 0.78 mm<sup>2</sup>). Light pulses were synchronized with both the initiation of the voltage clamp and signal recording by a custom-designed interface via TTL to implement the experimental protocols shown in <bold>Figure 1CD</bold>.</p>

<title>Data analysis: Filtering, segmentation and derivation of empirical parameters</title>
<p>All data analysis was completed offline in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA). Empirical parameters were extracted from each experimental trace as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003220-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>. The time constants, τ<sub>ON</sub>, τ<sub>INACT</sub>, and τ<sub>OFF</sub>, respectively describe activation (light on), inactivation, and deactivation (light off) processes. Current magnitude was characterized by I<sub>P</sub> (peak current) and I<sub>SS</sub> (steady-state current). Median filtering was performed on all current traces prior to analysis. All curve fits were done with the MATLAB Curve Fitting Toolbox using the “trust-region” algorithm with variable tolerance of 10<sup>−12</sup>, minimum and maximum step size - 10<sup>−12</sup> and 0.1, respectively; maximum number of 600000 iterations and function evaluations was used as a criterion for termination.</p>
<p>To determine time constants, ChR2 current traces were segmented into three parts and fit to mono-exponential curves. For each trace, I<sub>P</sub> was determined to be the maximum (peak) current magnitude; the steady-state current, I<sub>SS</sub>, was calculated as the mean of current values 400 to 450 ms after the onset. Bounds and length of segmentation for each parameter were as follows: 1) for τ<sub>ON</sub>, 10 ms before I<sub>P</sub> to I<sub>P</sub>; 2) for τ<sub>INACT</sub>, 10 to 110 ms after I<sub>P</sub>; 3) for τ<sub>OFF</sub>, 500 to 600 ms after I<sub>P</sub>. In addition, both I<sub>P</sub> and I<sub>SS</sub> were normalized to the baseline current, as well as cell capacitance.</p>
<p>To evaluate recovery from inactivation, percent recovery from inactivation was determined as the ratio of the peak current during the second vs. the first pulse (I<sub>P1</sub>/I<sub>P2</sub>). Mono-exponential curve fits were performed on data acquired from 1.6 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> light pulses to find the curve fit time constant of recovery, τ<sub>R</sub>.

Viral particles were diluted in M199 media containing 2% FBS and applied to the cardiomyocytes during a two hour incubation period during which the dishes were gently shaken every 20 minutes to disperse the virus. Transgene expression was assessed 48 hours after exposure at which time ∼50% of the cells exhibited eYFP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003220-g006"><bold>Figure 6A</bold></xref>) and a measureable response to optical excitation.</p>
<p>Whole-cell patch clamp experiments were performed 40–48h post-infection using the setup and solutions described above for ChR2 measurements. ChR2-expressing cells were identified by the EYFP fluorescence. Barium (0.5 mmol/L) was added to the pipette solution to facilitate optical excitation by reducing the inward rectifier current. Timing synchronization between the LED and the patch-clamp software was done by computer control using a USB data acquisition controller (Measurement Computing, Norton, MA).</p>
<p>A version of the classic action potential clamp (AP clamp) approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003220-Doerr1">[36]</xref> was used to extract the ChR2 current during a ventricular action potential. After confirming cell's electrical and optical excitability, an optically-triggered (470 nm, 50 ms, 1.5 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) action potential was recorded under current clamp mode (I = 0) for later use in AP clamp regime. The optical AP waveform was then used in a voltage-clamp mode under two different conditions and the total resultant current was recorded. First, the AP clamp was applied in the dark, thus obtaining a total ionic current without the ChR2 contribution. Second, the AP clamp was applied in conjunction with a light pulse, precisely timed with respect to the clamping AP (to replicate the conditions of the original AP record) and the total current containing ChR2 contribution was saved. The difference between these two total currents (net current, normalized by the cell capacitance) was interpreted as the ChR2 current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003220-g006"><bold>Figure 6B–D</bold></xref>). Upon AP clamp application, immediately before the light pulse, the cell was pre-clamped to 0 mV to temporarily reduce availability of sodium channels and therefore avoid interference by this large current during the AP upstroke.</p>
