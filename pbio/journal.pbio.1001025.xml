        <p>Store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) has been associated with two types of channels: CRAC channels that require Orai1 and STIM1 and SOC channels that involve TRPC1, Orai1, and STIM1. While TRPC1 significantly contributes to SOCE and SOC channel activity, abrogation of Orai1 function eliminates SOCE and activation of TRPC1. The critical role of Orai1 in activation of TRPC1-SOC channels following Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion has not yet been established. Herein we report that TRPC1 and Orai1 are components of distinct channels. We show that TRPC1/Orai1/STIM1-dependent I<sub>SOC</sub>, activated in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion, is composed of TRPC1/STIM1-mediated non-selective cation current and Orai1/STIM1-mediated I<sub>CRAC</sub>; the latter is detected when TRPC1 function is suppressed by expression of shTRPC1 or a STIM1 mutant that lacks TRPC1 gating, STIM1(<sup>684</sup>EE<sup>685</sup>). In addition to gating TRPC1 and Orai1, STIM1 mediates the recruitment and association of the channels within ER/PM junctional domains, a critical step in TRPC1 activation. Importantly, we show that Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry via Orai1 triggers plasma membrane insertion of TRPC1, which is prevented by blocking SOCE with 1 µM Gd<sup>3+</sup>, removal of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, knockdown of Orai1, or expression of dominant negative mutant Orai1 lacking a functional pore, Orai1-E106Q. In cells expressing another pore mutant of Orai1, Orai1-E106D, TRPC1 trafficking is supported in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing, but not Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free, medium. Consistent with this, I<sub>CRAC</sub> is activated in cells pretreated with thapsigargin in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium while I<sub>SOC</sub> is activated in cells pretreated in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing medium. Significantly, TRPC1 function is required for sustained K<sub>Ca</sub> activity and contributes to NFκB activation while Orai1 is sufficient for NFAT activation. Together, these findings reveal an as-yet unidentified function for Orai1 that explains the critical requirement of the channel in the activation of TRPC1 following Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion. We suggest that coordinated regulation of the surface expression of TRPC1 by Orai1 and gating by STIM1 provides a mechanism for rapidly modulating and maintaining SOCE-generated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. By recruiting ion channels and other signaling pathways, Orai1 and STIM1 concertedly impact a variety of critical cell functions that are initiated by SOCE.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry is present in all cell types and determines sustained cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] increases that are critical for regulating a wide variety of physiological functions. This Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry mechanism is activated in response to depletion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). When ER [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] is decreased, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor protein STIM1 aggregates in the ER membrane and moves to regions in the periphery of the cells where it interacts with and activates two major types of channels that contribute to store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry: CRAC and SOC. While gating of Orai1 by STIM1 is sufficient for CRAC channel activity, both Orai1 and transient receptor potential channel 1 (TRPC1) contribute to SOC channel function. The molecular composition of SOC channels and the critical role of Orai1 in activation of TRPC1 have not yet been established. In this study, we demonstrate that TRPC1 and Orai1 are components of distinct channels, both of which are regulated by STIM1. Importantly, we show that Orai1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry triggers plasma membrane insertion of TRPC1 which is then gated by STIM1. Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry via functional TRPC1-STIM1 channels provides additional increase in cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] that is required for regulation of specific cell functions such as K<sub>Ca</sub> activation. Together, our findings elucidate the critical role of Orai1 in TRPC1 channel function. We suggest that the regulation of TRPC1 trafficking provides a mechanism for rapidly modulating cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] following Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) is activated in response to a reduction of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the ER. SOCE generates local and global [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> signals that regulate a wide variety of cellular functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-DiCapite1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Parekh1">[2]</xref>. The first store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel to be characterized, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> release-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (CRAC) channel, has a high selectivity for Ca<sup>2+</sup> versus Na<sup>+</sup> and displays a typical inwardly rectifying current-voltage relationship. CRAC channel accounts for the SOCE in lymphocytes and mast cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Feske1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Vig1">[6]</xref> and has recently been detected in some other cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Abdullaev1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Potier1">[9]</xref>. Key molecular components of the channel are STIM1 and Orai1. STIM1 is an ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein that has been established as the primary regulator of SOCE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Liou1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Zhang1">[12]</xref>. In response to store depletion STIM1 oligomerizes and translocates to ER/PM junctional domains where it aggregates into puncta. The site of these aggregates is the location where STIM1 interacts with and activates channels involved in SOCE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Liou2">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Wu1">[15]</xref>. Orai1 is the pore-forming subunit of the CRAC channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Prakriya1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Yeromin1">[18]</xref>. Following store depletion, Orai1, which is localized diffusely in the plasma membrane in resting cells, is recruited by STIM1 into the puncta and gated by interaction with a C-terminal region of STIM1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Park1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Yuan1">[20]</xref>. While expression of this STIM1-domain induces spontaneous CRAC channel activation in extra ER/PM junctional domains, the site of the STIM1 puncta represents the cellular location where endogenous SOCE is activated by store depletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Luik1">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Store depletion also leads to activation of relatively non-selective Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable cation channels, usually referred to as SOC channels, that have been associated with SOCE in several other cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Parekh1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Ambudkar1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Worley1">[25]</xref>. Despite more than a decade of studies, the molecular components of these channels have not yet been established and their function and regulation remain somewhat controversial. TRPC channels have been proposed as molecular components of SOC channels. Data in this regard are strongest for TRPC1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Parekh1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Beech1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Tiruppathi1">[34]</xref> although TRPC3 and TRPC4 also appear to contribute to SOCE in some cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Ambudkar2">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Worley1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Montell1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Zagranichnaya1">[38]</xref>. Numerous studies show that disruption of TRPC1 attenuates SOCE and SOCE-dependent cell function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Ambudkar2">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Beech1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Tiruppathi1">[34]</xref>. We have previously provided extensive data to demonstrate that TRPC1 is a critical component of SOC channels and SOCE in the human salivary gland cell line, HSG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Liu2">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Cheng1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Ong1">[42]</xref>. Further, salivary gland acinar cells from TRPC1−/− mice display reduced SOCE and SOC channel activity, which account for loss of sustained K<sub>Ca</sub> activation and, consequently, salivary fluid secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Liu1">[29]</xref>. However, the role of TRPC1 in SOCE has been questioned based on the lack of function of heterogously expressed channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-DeHaven1">[43]</xref>. Further, some tissues from TRPC1−/− mice do not display any changes in SOCE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Dietrich1">[44]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-VargaSzabo1">[45]</xref>. The strongest evidence for the regulation of TRPC1 following store depletion has been provided by data demonstrating that STIM1 interacts with and activates TRPC1-SOC channels in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Cheng1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Ong1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Huang1">[46]</xref>. SOC channels are attenuated by knockdown of endogenous STIM1 and spontaneously activated by expression of the STIM1 mutant, D76ASTIM1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Ong1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Huang1">[46]</xref>. An important study showed that TRPC1 is gated by electrostatic interaction between STIM1(<sup>684</sup>KK<sup>685</sup>) and TRPC1(<sup>639</sup>DD<sup>640</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Zeng1">[47]</xref>.</p>
      <p>An intriguing finding is that STIM1 alone is not sufficient for activation of TRPC1-SOC channels following Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion. Functional Orai1 is also required since knockdown of Orai1 or expression of functionally deficit Orai1 mutants prevents TRPC1 activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Cheng1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Kim1">[48]</xref>. We have shown earlier that store depletion leads to the recruitment of a TRPC1/STIM1/Orai1 complex that is associated with the activation of SOCE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Cheng1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Ong1">[42]</xref>. Thus, while STIM1 is the primary protein involved in SOC channel gating, both TRPC1 and Orai1 appear to contribute to SOC channel activity. There has been much debate about the essential role of Orai1 in TRPC1-SOC channel function and more specifically regarding whether TRPC1 and Orai1 contribute to a single SOC channel pore or whether Orai1 is a regulatory subunit of SOC channels. In this study we have assessed the critical role of Orai1 in regulation of TRPC1 function following intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion and determined the contributions of TRPC1 and Orai1 to SOCE. We report that TRPC1 and Orai1 constitute two distinct channels that contribute to SOCE in HSG cells. Suppression of TRPC1 function unmasks the underlying CRAC channel function. Further, in response to store depletion, STIM1 mediates association of Orai1 and TRPC1 within ER/PM junctional domains. Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry via Orai1/STIM1-CRAC channel triggers plasma membrane insertion of TRPC1 and gating is achieved by interaction with STIM1(<sup>684</sup>KK<sup>685</sup>) residues. Remarkably, while both Orai1 and TRPC1 contribute to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase following store depletion, they impact different cellular functions. Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry mediated by TRPC1 is the primary regulator of K<sub>Ca</sub> channel and partially contributes to NFκB activation while Orai1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry alone is sufficient for maximal NFAT activation and partial NFκB activation. Together these findings reveal the molecular events that determine activation of TRPC1 channels following store depletion. We suggest that local Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry mediated by Orai1 determines plasma membrane insertion of TRPC1 while gating by STIM1 controls its activation. Thus, Orai1 and STIM1 not only determine Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals generated by CRAC channels but by regulating TRPC1 channel activity rapidly modulate [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and thus significantly impact various cell functions.</p>

        <p>Compared to SOCE in control HSG cells (transfected with vector or scrambled siRNA; black traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001025-g001">Figure 1</xref>), knockdown of endogenous Orai1, STIM1, or TRPC1 attenuated thapsigargin (Tg)-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx by &gt;90%, &gt;80%, or &gt;60%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001025-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). These conditions did not significantly affect internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. Western blots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001025.s001">Figure S1A</xref>) demonstrate the effectiveness of TRPC1 knockdown in these cells. Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry induced by Tg treatment of HSG cells was blocked by 1 µM Gd<sup>3+</sup> and 20 µM 2APB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001025.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). Further, expression of TRPC1, TRPC1+STIM1, Orai1+STIM1, or TRPC1+STIM1+Orai1 increased Tg-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001025.s001">Figure S1G</xref>), which was also blocked by 1 µM Gd<sup>3+</sup> and 20 µM 2APB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001025.s001">Figure S1C</xref>–F). Together, these data are consistent with our previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Ong1">[42]</xref> that Orai1, STIM1, and TRPC1 contribute to endogenous SOCE in HSG cells. Additionally, the contributions of TRPC1, STIM1, and Orai1 to SOCE were not dependent on the level of stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001025.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The relative decrease in SOCE induced by individual knockdown of the three proteins was similar in cells stimulated with 100 µM carbachol (CCh, a maximal stimulatory concentration) or 1 µM CCh (submaximal stimulatory concentration).</p>

Consistent with our previous findings, Tg stimulation of cells resulted in activation of I<sub>SOC</sub> in HSG cells that is distinct from the typical I<sub>CRAC</sub> currents measured in RBL cells and T lymphocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Liu3">[40]</xref>. We have previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Liu3">[40]</xref> that I<sub>SOC</sub> is a relatively Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective cation current with E<sub>rev</sub> around +20 mV and pCa<sup>2+</sup>/pNa<sup>+</sup> = 40 (I<sub>CRAC</sub> displays E<sub>rev</sub>&gt;+60 mV and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> selectivity ≥400). Silencing of Orai1 expression blocked generation of I<sub>SOC</sub> while knockdown of TRPC1 by shRNA significantly reduced the amplitude of the inward current but induced more pronounced loss of the outward current. Thus the residual current detected in 6/10 shTRPC1 treated cells was more inwardly rectifying, i.e. more like I<sub>CRAC</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001025-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, blue trace). These findings indicate the possibility that I<sub>CRAC</sub> in HSG cells can be masked by the larger relatively non-selective TRPC1-mediated current that is activated under the same conditions. The extent of TRPC1 knockdown would then determine the detection I<sub>CRAC</sub>. In the present set of experiments, 40% of the cells displayed I<sub>SOC</sub> or reduced I<sub>SOC</sub>. Our present data are somewhat contradictory to our previous finding that the residual current in Tg-stimulated submandibular gland acinar cells from TRPC1−/− mice was a much reduced transient current that was linear and did not display I<sub>CRAC</sub>-like properties (i.e. activation by low [2APB] or increase in DVF medium) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Liu1">[29]</xref>. We suggest that other TRPC channels or volume-regulated channels could account for the linear current. While further studies are required to determine the channel(s) involved in this residual current, our previous findings strongly demonstrate that TRPC1 contributes to SOCE and is critically required for salivary gland fluid secretion.</p>

Expression of the TRPC1 mutant that cannot be gated by STIM1, TRPC1(<sup>639</sup>KK<sup>640</sup>), induced a similar suppression of endogenous SOCE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001025-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, blue trace).

        <title>Orai1-Mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> Entry Triggers Plasma Membrane Insertion of TRPC1 Channels</title>
        <p>To identify the mechanism involved in regulation of TRPC1-SOC channels we examined the effect of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion on the surface expression of TRPC1. In resting cells the surface expression of TRPC1 (i.e. in the biotinylated fraction) was relatively low. Tg treatment of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001025-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, left panel, total TRPC1 and GAPDH are shown in input) significantly enhanced (about 3-fold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001025-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) the insertion of TRPC1 into the plasma membrane. An important finding of this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001025-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) is that Tg-stimulated increase in plasma membrane insertion of TRPC1 was dependent on Orai1. Decreasing Orai1 expression or compromising Orai1 function by expression of the dominant negative mutant Orai1-E106Q (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001025-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, middle and right panels, respectively, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001025-g003">Figure 3C</xref> for average data) severely reduced Tg-stimulated surface expression of TRPC1 without significantly affecting the resting level of TRPC1. To examine whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry was involved in TRPC1 trafficking, biotinylation of TRPC1 was assessed in cells stimulated with Tg in nominally Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium or in normal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing medium with 1 µM Gd<sup>3+</sup>. Both conditions blocked the increase in the surface expression of TRPC1 induced by Tg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001025-g003">Figure 3B and C</xref>). These effects on TRPC1 trafficking were not due to loss of TRPC1/STIM1/Orai1 clustering, which was not affected in cells expressing Orai1-E106Q <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Cheng1">[39]</xref> or in the absence of external Ca<sup>2+</sup> (unpublished data). The role of Orai1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry was more directly assessed by using Orai1-E106D, an Orai1 mutant that is permeable to Ca<sup>2+</sup> in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing medium, but unlike the wild type channel, it is permeable to Na<sup>+</sup> in nominally Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium. Tg treatment of cells expressing this mutant induced surface expression of endogenous TRPC1 in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing medium but not in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001025-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Finally, trafficking of TRPC1 was examined in HSG cells expressing STIM1(<sup>684</sup>EE<sup>685</sup>), which display I<sub>CRAC</sub> in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001025-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Although TRPC1 activation was suppressed in these cells, trafficking of the channel was not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001025-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). In aggregate these novel data suggest that Orai1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is sufficient for plasma membrane insertion of TRPC1 but not activation; the latter depends on STIM1.</p>

        <title>STIM1 Mediates Co-clustering and Association of TRPC1 and Orai1</title>
        <p>The mechanism involved in the clustering of TRPC1 with STIM1 and Orai1 was assessed by TIRFM. Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion resulted in co-localization of YFP-TRPC1 and Orai1-CFP into puncta in the sub-plasma membrane region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001025-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, HA-STIM1 was co-expressed in these cells). Further, STIM1 co-clustered with both the channels following Tg stimulation of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001025-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). As has been reported for Orai1, Orai1-TRPC1 clustering also required co-expression of STIM1 (unpublished data) and was not detected in cells when endogenous STIM1 expression was knocked down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001025-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). More significantly, co-IP of endogenous TRPC1 and Orai1 was abolished in cells treated with siSTIM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001025-g004">Figure 4D</xref>) but not in cells expressing STIM1(<sup>685</sup>EE<sup>685</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001025-g004">Figure 4E,F</xref>). TRPC1 clustering was not dependent on Orai1 since co-clustering of TRPC1 with STIM1 was unaffected by knockdown of Orai1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001025.s004">Figure S4</xref>, compare data in A and B). Thus, STIM1 determines TRPC1 clustering in the sub-plasma membrane region following Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion, and Orai1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry regulates its surface expression. Based on these findings we hypothesize that TRPC1 is present in recycling vesicles that traffic in and out of the plasma membrane region. Following store depletion when STIM1 clusters in ER/PM junctional domains, it interacts with TRPC1 possibly via the ERM domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Huang1">[46]</xref> and increases the retention of TRPC1-containing vesicles. Concurrently, STIM1 also recruits Orai1 into the same regions, thus bringing the two channels in close proximity to each other. Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry via Orai1 induces fusion of TRPC1-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane followed by gating of the channel by STIM1. Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms involved in trafficking and plasma membrane insertion of TRPC1.</p>

        <p>In aggregate, these data suggest that local Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry via Orai1 determines plasma membrane insertion of TRPC1 and that [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevation due to intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is insufficient for triggering TRPC1 insertion. Further when cells were treated with Tg in a Ca<sup>2+</sup> free medium for 5 min, there was no increase in TRPC1 expression in the plasma membrane until Ca<sup>2+</sup> was added to the external solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001025-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, right panel). As shown above, when cells were stimulated with Tg in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001025-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, left panel), TRPC1 insertion in the plasma membrane was enhanced. Surprisingly, subsequent removal of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the external solution (for 10 min) did not change the level of TRPC1 in the surface membrane. Functional consequences of these treatments are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001025-g005">Figure 5E–F</xref>. In this experiment, HSG cells were treated with Tg in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium prior to whole cell current measurements in DVF medium. Typical inwardly rectifying I<sub>CRAC</sub> with rapid inactivation was detected in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001025-g005">Figure 5E</xref>), consistent with the lack of TRPC1 insertion in the plasma membrane under these conditions. However, when pre-treatment was done in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing medium, I<sub>SOC</sub> was detected in the DVF medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001025-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). Note that the I<sub>SOC</sub> in DVF was relatively sustained, again consistent with the stable biotinylation of TRPC1. In aggregate, the findings presented above suggest that Orai1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry triggers insertion of TRPC1 in the plasma membrane, followed by activation of the channel by STIM1. Thus while channel insertion into the plasma membrane appears to depend on local increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, TRPC1 internalization does not strictly depend on a decrease in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. Further studies will be required to determine the exact molecular mechanisms involved in internalization of TRPC1.</p>

        <title>Contribution of TRPC1 to SOCE-Regulated Cell Function</title>
        <p>The data presented above demonstrate that two STIM1-gated channels, Orai1 and TRPC1, are activated in response to internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion in HSG cells. To establish the relative contributions of these channels in SOCE-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, we examined three SOCE-activated mechanisms: K<sub>Ca</sub> channel, NFκB, and NFAT. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001025-g006">Figure 6A</xref> demonstrates that expression of STIM1(<sup>684</sup>EE<sup>685</sup>) in HSG cells induced a slow, much diminished (&gt;80% reduction), and transiently activated K<sub>Ca</sub> current compared to that in control cells. As shown above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001025-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), only CRAC channel activation was seen in cells expressing this STIM1 mutant. Thus, Orai1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry does not appear to be sufficient for activation of K<sub>Ca</sub> activity following Tg stimulation. Further, NFκB activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001025-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) was significantly decreased by the knockdown of TRPC1 expression, and predictably knockdown of Orai1 induced an even greater loss of activity. Significantly, expression of SOAR did not lead to much activation of NFκB. Remarkably, TRPC1 had minimal contribution to the regulation of NFAT since knockdown of Orai1 but not TRPC1 suppressed NFAT activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001025-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Thus, Orai1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry is sufficient for regulation of NFAT and for partial stimulation of NFκB, but not for K<sub>Ca</sub> activation. In contrast, TRPC1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry regulates K<sub>Ca</sub> channel activity and contributes to NFκB signaling, but not NFAT activation.</p>

        <p>Similar to the findings in HSG cells, K<sub>Ca</sub> activity was severely reduced in acinar cells from submandibular glands of TRPC1−/− mice, which could account for loss of salivary fluid secretion in these animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Liu1">[29]</xref>. While our current findings suggest that Orai1+STIM1 dependent regulation of TRPC1 would be very critical for regulating salivary gland function, functional interaction between these proteins will depend on their precise localization within acinar cells, as is required in HSG cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001025-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). We have previously reported that TRPC1 is localized in the basal and lateral regions of submandibular gland acinar cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Liu1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Singh1">[52]</xref> and that TRPC1 and STIM1 co-IP following stimulation of acini by either Tg or CCh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Pani1">[53]</xref>. To determine possible physiological relevance of the present findings, we examined the localization of TRPC1, Orai1, and STIM1 in submandibular glands excised from resting and pilocarpine-stimulated mice (tissue was fixed in vivo in mice following pilocarpine injection and after an increase in saliva secretion was detected). In the samples from unstimulated mice, endogenous Orai1 was prominantly detected in the apical and lateral regions of submandibular gland acini (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001025.s006">Figure S6A</xref>, upper panels, green signal, Orai1 signal shown by white arrows), co-localization of Orai1 with the luminal membrane protein AQP5 is also shown (red signal, right panel). STIM1 showed diffused localization within the acinar cells from unstimulated mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001025.s006">Figure S6B</xref>, red signal, upper panel). Consistent with our previous findings, diffuse localization of TRPC1 was detected in the basal and lateral regions (green signal, upper panels, the same sections were labeled for STIM1 and TRPC1). In samples obtained from stimulated mice, Orai1 and AQP5 localization did not change (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001025.s006">Figure S6A</xref>, lower panels). However, a dramatic translocation of TRPC1 and STIM1 to the basal and lateral membrane regions was seen with relative decrease in intracellular staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001025.s006">Figure S6B</xref>, lower panels, see white arrows). Thus stimulation induces co-localization of STIM1, Orai1, and TRPC1 in the lateral membrane region of cells. While further studies are required to determine whether sufficient Orai1 is present in the basolateral membrane to regulate TRPC1, our data strongly suggest that regulation of TRPC1 by STIM1 and Orai1 is feasible within the lateral membrane region of salivary gland acinar cells. Our findings are generally consistent with the strong co-localization of Orai1 and STIM1 in the lateral membrane region of stimulated pancreatic acinar cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Lur1">[54]</xref>. STIM1 was also localized in the basal membrane and co-localized with heterologously expressed, but not endogenous, Orai1, in these cells. This study suggested that localization of Orai1 and STIM1 in the lateral membrane was consistent with the proposed site of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in exocrine acinar cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Kiselyov1">[55]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Petersen2">[57]</xref>.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The findings described herein address several important and as-yet unresolved questions regarding the molecular components of TRPC1-SOC channel, the mechanism involved in regulation of the channel in response to store depletion, and its contribution to SOCE. We report that the previously described I<sub>SOC</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Cheng1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Liu3">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Ambudkar3">[58]</xref>, which is stimulated by store depletion and dependent on TRPC1, STIM1, and Orai1, is a sum of Orai1/STIM1-mediated I<sub>CRAC</sub> and TRPC1/STIM1-mediated non-selective cation current. Our findings suggest that the latter relatively larger current masks the underlying I<sub>CRAC</sub> since suppression of TRPC1 function either by shTRPC1 or by expression of the STIM1(<sup>684</sup>EE<sup>685</sup>) mutant, which does not gate TRPC1, facilitates detection of I<sub>CRAC</sub>. Further, SOAR-activated I<sub>CRAC</sub> required Orai1 but not TRPC1. Thus Orai1 and TRPC1 are components of two distinct channels. These findings provide strong argument against the possibility that TRPC1 and Orai1 contribute to the same channel pore or that Orai1 is a regulatory, non-conducting, subunit of TRPC channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Liao1">[59]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We also report that Orai1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry triggers plasma membrane recruitment of TRPC1. These data reveal a novel function for Orai1 that can explain its critical requirement in the activation of TRPC1 channels following Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion. We show that Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion leads to enhanced surface expression of TRPC1, which is blocked when Ca<sup>2+</sup> is removed from the external medium or SOCE is inhibited by addition of Gd<sup>3+</sup>. Knockdown of endogenous Orai1 expression or expression of non-functional Orai1 mutants (Orai1-E106Q) also lead to loss of TRPC1 in the plasma membrane. Notably, in cells expressing Orai1-E106D, TRPC1 trafficking is supported in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing medium but not Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium. Together, these findings provide strong evidence that surface expression of TRPC1 is determined by the Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability of Orai1 and that TRPC1 is gated by STIM1 and not directly by [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase. Presently we cannot conclusively rule out the involvement of possible downstream signaling pathway(s) activated by Orai1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry.</p>
      <p>The data presented above also reveal important aspects of TRPC1, Orai1, and STIM1 clustering that are critical in the regulation of TRPC1 within the same ER/PM junctional domains where Orai1 is regulated by STIM1. We show that in response to store depletion TRPC1 co-clusters with STIM1 and Orai1. More importantly while Orai1 is not required for clustering and association of TRPC1-STIM1, localization of STIM1 in the ER/PM junctional domains is critical for recruitment and association of Orai1 and TRPC1. Thus far there are no data to show that TRPC1 and Orai1 directly interact with each other, although both channels interact with STIM1. STIM1 interacts with Orai1 via the SOAR domain, which also leads to gating of the channel. In the case of TRPC1 while the C-terminal <sup>684</sup>KK<sup>685</sup> residues of STIM1 are involved in gating the channel, the ERM domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Huang1">[46]</xref> could interact with the channel and serve as a scaffold to retain TRPC1 within the ER/PM junctional regions. We suggest that interaction with STIM1 allows the channels to be localized in close proximity to each other, facilitating Orai1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry to locally regulate plasma membrane insertion of TRPC1. However, our data show that internalization of TRPC1 is apparently not dependent on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001025-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, TRPC1 can remain active provided the Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores are depleted and STIM1 is localized in the peripheral domains. Based on our data, we suggest the following sequence of events in the activation of TRPC1: (i) Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion leads to translocation of STIM1 to ER/PM junctional domains and recruitment of Orai1 (localized within the plasma membrane) and TRPC1 (likely localized in intracellular trafficking vesicles), (ii) Orai1 is activated by STIM1 and Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry via Orai1 triggers exocytosis of TRPC1, and finally (iii) STIM1 gates plasma membrane TRPC1 (depicted in the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001025-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

          <p>In resting cells Orai1 and STIM1 have diffused localization in the PM and ER membrane, respectively. We predict that TRPC1 is localized in recycling vesicles (top panel). Following Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion, STIM1 aggregates and translocates to the ER/PM junctional domains. Orai1 is recruited to the STIM1 puncta resulting in CRAC channel activation. The resulting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase leads to activation of NFAT and insertion of TRPC1-vesicles into the plasma membrane (middle panel). TRPC1 is then gated by STIM1 resulting in enhancement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, higher [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, and activation of K<sub>Ca</sub> channels and NFκB (lower panel).</p>

      <p>We also demonstrate the unique contributions of TRPC1 and Orai1 to SOCE. Remarkably, different cellular functions are regulated when Orai1 alone is activated compared to conditions when both channels are activated. Our data suggest that TRPC1 augments the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase resulting from Orai1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. Consistent with this, TRPC1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry is required for K<sub>Ca</sub> function and contributes to NFκB activation, both of which require relatively higher [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, but not for NFAT activation, which can be activated at lower [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001025-g007">Figure 7</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Liu1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Dolmetsch1">[60]</xref>. Interestingly, the requirement of TRPC1 for K<sub>Ca</sub> activity is similar to our previous finding that submandibular gland acinar cells from TRPC1−/− mice display loss of sustained K<sub>Ca</sub> activity, which accounts for the decrease in fluid secretion in these glands. We have previously shown that TRPC1 is localized in the basal and lateral regions of acinar cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Liu1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Singh1">[52]</xref> and that TRPC1 and STIM1 associate following stimulation of acini <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Pani1">[53]</xref>. Since Orai1 is critical for TRPC1 function, localization of these proteins in the salivary gland acinar cells is a key determinant for the functional interaction between them. Feasibility for the interaction of the three proteins and regulation of TRPC1 in the gland is demonstrated by our data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001025.s006">Figure S6</xref>), showing that following agonist stimulation Orai1, TRPC1, and STIM1 are strongly co-localized in the lateral membrane region of acinar cells while TRPC1 and STIM1 also appear to be colocalized in the basal region. In salivary gland acinar cells agonist stimulation leads to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevation, which is first detected in the apical region of the cells and then spreads to basal and lateral regions, irrespective of the level of stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Kiselyov1">[55]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Melvin1">[61]</xref>. Although further studies will be required to confirm the presence of Orai1 in the basal membrane region of acini, co-localization of TRPC1, Orai1, and STIM1 in the lateral membrane region of stimulated cells supports our suggestion that Orai1 can regulate TRPC1 function in this region and thus modulate SOCE.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the data described above reveal novel insight into the molecular components and regulation of TRPC1-SOC channels. Our findings provide strong evidence that TRPC1 and Orai1 constitute distinct SOC and CRAC channels, respectively, both of which are gated by STIM1 in response to store depletion and contribute to SOCE in the same cell. The critical step in the activation of TRPC1 is its insertion into the plasma membrane, which is governed by Orai1-mediated local Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. In addition to gating TRPC1 and Orai1, STIM1 also mediates the association of the two channels within discrete ER/PM junctional domains, which is the site for SOCE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Park1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Luik1">[21]</xref>. The three proteins are also co-localized in the membrane region predicted to be the site of SOCE in acinar cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Kiselyov2">[56]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Petersen2">[57]</xref>, thus highlighting the potential physiological relevance of our findings. Importantly, TRPC1 augments Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry mediated by Orai1-CRAC channels and is required for activation of K<sub>Ca</sub> channels and NFκB, but not NFAT, signaling. As has been suggested, the amplitude, frequency of oscillations, or spatial patterning of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> changes determines the regulation of different cell functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-DiCapite1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Feske2">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Petersen1">[51]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Kiselyov1">[55]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Dolmetsch1">[60]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Petersen3">[62]</xref>. Although further studies are required to elucidate exactly how TRPC1 alters the primary [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> signals generated by Orai1, the present data suggest that regulation of TRPC1 trafficking can provide a mechanism for rapidly modulating [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. STIM1 is emerging as a versatile ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor that regulates multiple target proteins in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion. In addition to activation of Orai1 and TRPC channels, STIM1 has been reported to inhibit Cav1.2 channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Park2">[63]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Wang2">[64]</xref> and activate adenylyl cyclase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Hofer1">[65]</xref>, both of which depend on Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion. While regulation of TRPC1 and Cav1.2 require association of the channels with Orai1 within ER/PM junctional domains, Orai1 function does not appear to be involved in STIM1-dependent inhibition of Cav1.2. Thus Orai1 and STIM1 by coordinating the regulation of other ion channels and signaling components can modulate [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and critically impact SOCE-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and a variety of cellular functions.</p>

        <p>An Olympus IX81 motorized inverted microscope (Olympus) was used as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001025-Ong1">[42]</xref> using 447, 514, and 568 nm lasers for excitation of CFP, YFP, and mCherry, respectively, and a TIRF-optimized Olympus Plan APO 60x (1.45 NA) oil immersion objective and Lambda 10-3 filter wheel (Sutter Instruments) containing 480-band pass (BP 40 m), 525-band pass (BP 50 m), and 605-band pass (BP 52 m) filters for emission. Images were collected using a Hamamatsu EM C9100 camera (Hamamatsu) and the MetaMorph imaging software (Molecular Devices). MetaMorph was also used to measure the fluorescence intensity before and after stimulation with Tg. Briefly, regions of interest were selected to obtain the values for their fluorescence intensities during a time course experiment. These values were then plotted using the Origin 8 software (OriginLab).</p>

        <p>Balb/c mice were anesthetized and injected subcutaneously with either saline (Resting) or 0.5 mg of pilocarpine/kg (Stimulated). After the saliva secretion was observed in stimulated mice, the animals were perfusion fixed with 10% buffered formalin and immediately euthanized. Salivary glands were excised and embedded in paraffin for histologic processing. Slides of paraffin sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated. Sections were unmasked by microwaving samples for 10 min in a microwave pressure cooker (NordicWare) in 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, containing 0.05% Tween 20. After cooling, sections were blocked either with 0.5% BSA in PBS (for direct conjugates) or with 10% donkey serum in PBS (for samples using secondary antibodies). After blocking for 30 min at room temperature, primary antibodies were applied and incubated at 4°C overnight. For samples using two or more rabbit host primary antibodies, direct-conjugation with a fluorescent tag using Invitrogen's Zenon labeling kit was used. For antibodies requiring secondary antibody labeling, donkey anti-rabbit Alexa conjugates were used (Invitrogen). A negative control using normal rabbit IgG at the same concentration as specific primaries was included for both methods. After labeling with primary antibodies only, samples were washed extensively and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and mounted with VectaShield mounting medium containing DAPI. Zenon conjugated samples were washed extensively and mounted with cover slips as above. Images were collected by using a Leica Confocal microscope and MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).</p>
