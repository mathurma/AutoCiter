        <p>The phosphorylation of a substrate at multiple sites is a common protein modification that can give rise to important structural and electrostatic changes. Scaffold proteins can enhance protein phosphorylation by facilitating an interaction between a protein kinase enzyme and its target substrate. In this work we consider a simple mathematical model of a scaffold protein and show that under specific conditions, the presence of the scaffold can substantially raise the likelihood that the resulting system will exhibit bistable behavior. This phenomenon is especially pronounced when the enzymatic reactions have sufficiently large <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic>, compared to the concentration of the target substrate. We also find for a closely related model that bistable systems tend to have a specific kinetic conformation. Using deficiency theory and other methods, we provide a number of necessary conditions for bistability, such as the presence of multiple phosphorylation sites and the dependence of the scaffold binding/unbinding rates on the number of phosphorylated sites.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The modification of a protein at multiple sites can result in a number of interesting behaviors at the cellular level, such as all-or-none responses to an external input, or two different stable cellular states in otherwise identical environments. Such behaviors can aid in many different forms of cellular decision-making, e.g., cell differentiation or cell division. In this paper, we show that bistable behavior can be greatly enhanced by the presence of a scaffold protein, which binds to the substrate protein and either relocates it or otherwise affects the action of the modifying enzymes. The scaffold protein substantially widens the range of parameters for which bistability is observed when<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, a key descriptor of enzymatic activity, assumes medium to large values found in a majority of enzymes. Indeed, when <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was greater than the concentration of the target substrate, bistability was never observed in the absence of a scaffold. In addition to extensive computational work, we also carried out a mathematical analysis of a simplified system in order to identify the conditions under which bistability is possible. We conclude that scaffold proteins can be a simple yet very useful addition to multisite protein systems when bistability is advantageous.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Protein phosphorylation is a ubiquitous form of post-translational modification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Alberts1">[1]</xref>. Since covalently-bound phosphate groups are strongly hydrophilic and negatively charged, they can activate or inhibit a protein by changing its conformation or the way it interacts with other proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Johnson1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Holmberg1">[3]</xref>. Phosphorylation is a key element of biological regulatory processes including signal transduction, gene regulation, the cell cycle, and protein degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Manning1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Multisite phosphorylation is also a very common occurrence. For example, Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) receptor activation involves phosphorylation at multiple tyrosine residues by another EGF receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Alberts1">[1]</xref>. Also, many proteins have a surprisingly large number of phosphorylation sites. For example, nine phosphorylation sites were identified in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Sic1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Verma1">[5]</xref>, more than 30 sites in EGF Receptor (EGFR) and several dozen in p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Gnad1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It has long been known that the presence of multiple ligand binding sites in a protein can give rise to cooperative binding through allosteric interactions between binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Monod1">[7]</xref>. Phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reactions (and other reversible enzymatic reactions) can exhibit a related property known as <italic>ultrasensitivity</italic>, consisting of a steep, switch-like response of output to increasing input concentrations. <italic>Bistability</italic> refers to the ability of a deterministic system to have two stable steady states. This property is useful in all-or-none cell fate decisions, such as the decision to differentiate, or to progress through the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Ferrell1">[8]</xref>. Another potential advantage of bistability is that it might allow genetically identical cells to respond heterogeneously to nearly-identical conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Paliwal1">[9]</xref>; this is thought to be advantageous for unicellular organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Veening1">[10]</xref>. Bistability in natural systems is often thought to result from the existence of an overt positive feedback loop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Mitrophanov1">[11]</xref>. More recent work with multisite phosphorylation systems, however, has revealed that bistability can occur in the absence of such a loop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Wang1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Thomson1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Markevich1">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Biochemical models of multisite phosphorylation have been studied in the literature with an eye towards ultrasensitivity and bistability, see for instance Gunawardena <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Gunawardena1">[15]</xref>. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Liu1">[16]</xref> some of us introduced scaffold proteins and showed that the presence of the scaffold strongly increased the ultrasensitive behavior of the system under various parameter conditions. Several other plausible mechanisms have also been suggested to enhance the ultrasensitive response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Qian1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Serber1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Wang2">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this paper, we focus on the bistability of multisite phosphorylation systems with scaffold proteins. Four mathematical models with different topology and assumptions are developed. An analytical study using deficiency theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Anderson1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Feinberg1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Craciun1">[22]</xref> is carried out in search for network topologies that can support bistable behavior. Then, through systematic exploration of parameter space, we conclude that scaffold proteins substantially increase the likelihood of bistability, in the sense that a larger fraction of randomized parameter sets exhibits this property. This holds even for systems where bistability is observed without scaffold protein. On the other hand, we find patterns in kinetic parameters that are more likely to have bistability.</p>

        <title>Description of the model</title>
        <p>The multisite (de)phosphorylation system is modeled using a standard sequential mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002551-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). To introduce the scaffold we allow for reversible binding between the scaffold protein <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the substrate <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with <italic>i</italic> phosphorylated sites, to form the complex <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002551-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). We allow phosphorylation to take place only for the scaffold-bound substrate, due to the fact that scaffolds accelerate substrate phosphorylation either by tethering the kinase and the substrate in proximity to each other, or by allosterically activating the kinase or the substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Good1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Zeke1">[24]</xref>. The degree of rate acceleration by scaffold proteins can be as much as 10,000 fold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Good1">[23]</xref>.</p>

            <p>A) Phosphorylation occurs only on scaffold-bound substrates, and dephosphorylation can take place both on and off scaffold except when stated otherwise. <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represents a protein that has been phosphorylated <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> times, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represents the scaffold-bound protein. Phosphorylation is mediated by a kinase <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and dephosphorylation is facilitated by a phosphatase <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. B) Full enzymatic (de)phosphorylation mechanism using standard mass action kinetics (MA). The parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represent the on, off, and catalytic rates for the phosphorylation reaction. For the dephosphorylation reaction these rates are <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, respectively. C) Mechanism for scaffold binding. The substrate binds with the scaffold to form a heterodimer that can also unbind back to its original form. The parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represent the on and off rates, respectively. D–G) We distinguish between models with a scaffold (S) and models with no scaffold (NS), as well as models with full mass action enzymatic reactions (MA) and models with simplified, linear enzymatic reaction rates (LR). This gives rise to the four models MA-S (D), LR-S (E), MA-NS (F), and N LR-S (G). The reactions in the dotted squares are omitted when dephosphorylation only takes place off-scaffold.</p>

        <p>With regard to dephosphorylation, it has been proposed that some scaffold proteins may protect bound proteins from the action of phosphatases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Levchenko1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Heinrich1">[26]</xref>, while other scaffold proteins actually recruit phosphatases in addition to kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Lester1">[27]</xref>. We assume by default that dephosphorylation takes place equally on and off the scaffold, but we will also consider cases where phosphatases act exclusively off the scaffold.</p>
        <p>To quantify the dynamics of multisite phosphorylation, we have explored two types of commonly used mechanisms: full mass action kinetics (MA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Wang1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Thomson1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Markevich1">[14]</xref>, and simplified linear enzymatic rates (LR). In the linear rate model LR, the rates of flux of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are given by <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> respectively, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the total kinase and phosphatase concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002551-g001">Figure 1D,F</xref>). In the full model MA, the free kinase concentration <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is distinguished from the total kinase concentration <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and phosphorylation follows a standard Michaelis-Menten mechanism of complex formation using <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as the on, off, and catalytic rates, respectively. Similarly for the dephosphorylation mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002551-g001">Figure 1B,E,G</xref>). The full model has many more variables, parameters, and nonlinear reaction terms than the simplified LR model for a given total number of sites, which in practice means that LR is more amenable to mathematical analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Liu1">[16]</xref>. In fact, it is known that in the absence of a scaffold the LR model always results in a unique steady state, while the full model can support multistability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Wang1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Thomson1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Markevich1">[14]</xref>. We termed the simplified model without scaffold as “LR-NS” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002551-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), the simplified model with scaffold as “LR-S” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002551-g001">Figure 1F</xref>), the full model without scaffold as “MA-NS” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002551-g001">Figure 1E</xref>), and the full model with scaffold as “MA-S” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002551-g001">Figure 1G</xref>).</p>
        <p>It is worth pointing out that a distributive mechanism is assumed for (de)phosphorylation on scaffold, that is, that the enzymes tend to unbind from the substrate after each modification. There is evidence that some scaffold proteins may behave in this way. For example, the Ste5 scaffold protein binds weakly to its associated kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Maeder1">[28]</xref>, and it has even been hypothesized that one of those kinases (Ste7) may be frequently ejected from the Ste5 as a result of feedback phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Maleri1">[29]</xref>. Similarly, human MEK1 protein, when bound to the KSR scaffold protein, is thought to be phosphorylated by an (unbound) trans-acting homodimer of the RAF kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Brennan1">[30]</xref>. If a kinase were to remain bound to the scaffold through multiple, processive phosphorylation events, however, this would be expected to reduce the propensity of the scaffold to promote bistability.</p>

        <title>Monostable topologies</title>
        <p>Before investigating the parameter patterns of bistable multisite (de)phosphorylation systems with scaffold, we first explore network topologies that exclude bistability regardless of kinetic parameter values. To this end, we employ the deficiency theory developed by Feinberg and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Anderson1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Feinberg1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Craciun1">[22]</xref>, and we restrict our attention to the simplified linear rate model with scaffold, LR-S.</p>
        <p>The deficiency theory of chemical reaction networks is able to predict under certain circumstances that a given system is incapable of having multiple steady states, regardless of the parameter values used (assuming fixed total protein concentrations). In order to do this, it only makes use of qualitative graphic-theoretic properties of the network, such as the number <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of connected components in the reaction diagram, and the number <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of nodes in this diagram, called <italic>complexes</italic>.

The most widely used result in the theory is the Deficiency Zero Theorem, which states that if <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and every connected component is strongly connected (such as in the simple example above), then multistability is impossible, regardless of parameter values. That theorem is the basis for several of the results in this analysis. Please refer to Section 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002551.s004">Text S1</xref> for details on the proofs of all results.</p>
        <p>If the scaffold association and dissociation rates <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are independent of the phosphorylation state of the system, i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are constant for all values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, then there cannot be multiple steady states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002551-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In other words, to achieve multistability, the scaffold binding mechanism must be related to, or affected by, the phosphorylation state of the substrate. This is consistent with the finding in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Liu1">[16]</xref> that scaffold sequestration rates need to vary with the phosphorylation state, in order to affect the ultrasensitive behavior of the system.</p>

        <p>We point out that even though the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002551-g002">Figure 2C</xref> is always monostable, this particular topology has shown to be highly ultrasensitive for some parameter values <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Liu1">[16]</xref>, which underscores the difference between ultrasensitive behavior and bistability.</p>
        <p>Even in the presence of a scaffold, a substrate with a single phosphorylation site is incapable of producing bistable behavior for several possible network configurations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002551-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). This result provides evidence that if the kinase and the substrate both remain bound to the scaffold long enough, on average, for the kinase to catalyze two or more phosphorylation events in a processive manner, then the propensity for scaffold-driven bistability will be reduced. The proof for all configurations given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002551-g002">Figure 2D</xref> is given in Section 1.4 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002551.s004">Text S1</xref>, and it is based on exploring the signs of the entries in the stoichiometric matrix as well as all its square submatrices.</p>

        <p>In summary, the above features in parameters indicate a fast flow <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, together with a small flow out of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, ensuring that there is an accumulation of phosphorylated protein in the scaffold-unbound state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002551-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Similarly, the scaffold-bound, unphosphorylated protein <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> accumulates due to a low scaffold dissociation rate. This configuration can give rise to multiple steady states, where in fact most of the protein accumulates at either <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (data not shown).</p>
        <p>It is remarkable that this is the <italic>only</italic> common conformation giving rise to bistability under the chosen parameter regime. Due to the mass conservation of total substrate, a conformation in which all variables are present in either high or low concentrations is precluded. The fact that we do not allow for phosphorylation off scaffold also breaks some of the possible symmetries. It is also significant that bistability is rarely observed when <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In fact, for large relative amounts of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e089" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, it holds that <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e090" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the system becomes approximately linear. Hence in the limit it cannot have two discrete stable steady states.</p>
        <p>It is worth pointing out that although the cell membrane was considered a suitable scaffold for ultrasensitive behavior in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Liu1">[16]</xref>, it may not itself be a good scaffold for bistable behavior, since <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e091" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> must be limiting for bistability. Given that the cell membrane has a relatively large surface area, it is not likely that binding sites on the membrane will be saturated by a given membrane-binding regulatory protein. Thus, under the hypotheses of this model, employing the plasma membrane as a scaffold would be unlikely to aid in the promotion of bistability. On the other hand, the scaffold may well be a membrane-bound protein available in limited concentration. This effectively recruits the substrate onto the membrane while limiting the total amount of scaffold.</p>

        <p>We now consider the full mass action (MA) models and to what extent the addition of a scaffold facilitates bistable behavior.

However, in the presence of the scaffold, with the same phosphorylation parameters (except now phosphorylation takes place only on the scaffold), the response curve presents bistability for a range of values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002551-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). We randomize every parameter in the system over several orders of magnitude (see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section for full ranges), in order to find whether this behavior is typical. One preliminary result was that for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e094" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> no bistable behavior was found computationally for either MA-NS or MA-S, consistent with the theoretical findings for LR-NS and LR-S in the section on monostable topologies.

        <p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002551-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, we compare the behavior of the simplified system LR-S to that of MA-S, and we find that the dose response of both systems becomes very similar for large values of the Michaelis constant <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e100" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This parameter is essential in the quantitative study of enzymes and constitutes the substrate concentration at which the enzymatic reaction takes place at half the maximal rate. It is important to note that most enzymes have been experimentally found to have a <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e101" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> between <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e102" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e103" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (Section 8.4 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Berg1">[31]</xref>).

        <p>We are particularly interested in bistable behavior with a significant distance between steady states. To this end, we define <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e108" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e109" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as the highest and lowest stable steady state values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e110" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the case that multiple steady states exist. We restrict our definition of bistability to the case where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e111" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This definition is biologically relevant. Imagine a biological circuit with two stable steady states that are close to each other. This system is likely to have similar properties as one with a single stable steady state. It is well known that bistability can give rise to cell differentiation or other types of cellular decision-making. The underlying premise is that one of the proteins in the system, say, the most phosphorylated version of the substrate, is responsible for activating a downstream response that triggers one of the two possible cellular behaviors. If this protein is not present in sufficient concentration, the other cellular behavior should result. Therefore in practice, bistability by itself is not enough, but the two different steady states (or at least the key active proteins) should be sufficiently different from each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002551-g004">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>
        <p>In order to systematically compare different systems, we classify the models according to the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e112" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> value of the different enzymatic reactions. Thus enzymatic parameters are chosen randomly in such a way that all the individual <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values lie within a specified range of one order of magnitude. For <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the system tends to be bistable even without the addition of a scaffold, and adding a scaffold decreases the probability for bistability (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002551-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

For <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the effect of adding a scaffold becomes much more pronounced. Simulations based on a set of 500 randomly chosen parameters for each entry in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002551-t001">Table 1</xref> indicate that in the absence of a scaffold the system is monostable for such <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

Remarkably, if a scaffold is considered in the same circumstances the probability of bistability leaps up to 18.4% for <italic>n = 5</italic>, which is significant considering that the on and off rates as well as the total protein concentrations are randomly varied over several orders of magnitude. If the phosphatase acts only off the scaffold, the probability for bistability further increases to 29.8%. Similar results as in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002551-t001">Table 1</xref> are found when the assumption of a sufficient ratio between the steady states is dropped, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002551.s003">Table S3</xref>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In cellular signal transduction, multiple, consecutively-acting components of a signaling pathway are often physically organized into complexes by scaffold proteins. Here, by exploring various models of multisite (de)phosphorylation with scaffold, we conclude that under the following specific conditions the presence of a scaffold can enhance bistability of multisite phosphorylation systems.</p>
      <list list-type="order">
        <list-item>
          <p><bold>Non-processive multisite substrate phosphorylation.</bold> The signaling proteins that bind to scaffolds are often phosphorylated at multiple sites and believed to act in a non-processive manner, for instance in the case of the MAPK cascade (MAP3K, MAP2K and MAPK). Many such proteins are organized by scaffold proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Dhanasekaran1">[33]</xref>; furthermore, the activity of each kinase is regulated by phosphorylation of two or more distinct sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Avruch1">[34]</xref>.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p><bold>A substrate concentration in the same order of magnitude or higher than the scaffold concentration.</bold> This assumption is also reasonable; for instance, in the case of the yeast mating MAPK cascade, several measurements indicate that the cellular concentrations of the Ste5 scaffold and its associated kinases Ste11 and Ste7 are all around 30–50 nM (i.e., ∼700 molecules/cell), and the ultimate substrate of Ste5 scaffolding, Fus3, has a cellular concentration that is at least 5-fold greater <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Maeder1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Bardwell1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Slaughter1">[36]</xref>.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p><bold>Kinases with a relatively high </bold><inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e145" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><bold> value.</bold> For such enzymatic reactions the kinase-substrate complex is relatively transient. This assumption can be explained on the grounds that high <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e146" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values (relative to substrate concentrations) tend to make a system more linear. In the absence of a scaffold, such a linear system cannot exhibit multistable behavior. In the case of low <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e147" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the flow rates for an enzymatic reaction can be approximated by a constant proportional to the total enzyme. Thus the steady state substrate distribution depends subtly on the total enzyme and phosphatase concentrations, leading to zero-order ultrasensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Goldbeter1">[37]</xref>. The bifurcation graph using <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e148" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as a bifurcation parameter is likely to be highly ultrasensitive, which might make it more likely that the system is already bistable for similar parameters without the need for a scaffold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Thomson1">[13]</xref>. This is evidenced on the first column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002551-t001">Table 1</xref>.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p><bold>A scaffold-substrate dissociation constant that varies with the substrate phosphorylation state.</bold> A possible implementation of this assumption is through a bulk electrostatic mechanism for substrate binding. If the scaffold is naturally negatively charged near its binding domain to the substrate, then the presence of negatively charged phosphorylations at the scaffold might prevent its binding and accelerate its unbinding. In principle, this can take place for a multisite scaffold protein in the absence of allosteric behavior. For instance, in the yeast pheromone-response pathway, protein Ste5 (itself a scaffold protein but here viewed as a substrate) binds to the membrane in part due to bulk electrostatic interactions that are modified by multisite phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Strickfaden1">[38]</xref>.</p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>Notice that certain relations among the various parameters are also consistently preserved. For instance, the larger phosphorylation rate for the second site suggests an allosteric behavior between the substrate and kinase.</p>
      <p>Several different models of bistability in protein networks are described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Pomerening1">[39]</xref>. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Legewie1">[40]</xref>, protein sequestration is considered as a means to obtaining bistability in an apoptosis network. Another approach was carried out in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Legewie2">[41]</xref> for the MAPK system, where the activity of MEK is inhibited by unphosphorylated ERK acting as a scaffold. These systems are similar in spirit to this work, although they likely exploit a different mechanism for bistability. For instance, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Legewie2">[41]</xref> bistability takes place largely because the substrate is allowed to phosphorylate the scaffold and alter its binding activity, a key feedback component that we do not assume here. Also in that model the scaffold must be in excess of the substrate for bistability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Legewie2">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002551-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), whereas in our system we have the opposite requirement. See also the work in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Qiao1">[42]</xref>, where a 25-fold parameter variation analysis is carried out for a MAPK model to determine the likelihood of behaviors such as bistability and oscillations.</p>
      <p>Another important aspect to consider in these chemical reaction systems is the effect of noise and stochastic behavior. If chemical reactions are allowed to take place in a non-deterministic way, the variables in a bistable system might switch spontaneously from one steady state to another. Here the fold-change measure introduced in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> section is again useful: if the distance between the two steady states is increased, one can expect in general that the frequency of such spontaneous events is reduced. To the extent that the addition of a scaffold increases this distance, it may reduce the effect of noise. Also, we have found, for LR-S, that bistability is in a sense characterized within a certain parameter regime. If parameters are changed due to stochastic effects, bistability will tend to be preserved as long as the parameters remain within that regime. In that sense bistability in LR-S can be described as robust with respect to parameter noise.</p>
      <p>Notice that the simulations in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002551-t001">Table 1</xref> suggest that zero-order ultrasensitivity isn't just a mechanism for bistability in the traditional non-scaffold system, but the only such mechanism. This is because low<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e149" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values (or low <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e150" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ratios) seem to be necessary for bistability. Also, the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002551-g003">Figure 3</xref> suggest that ligand binding, as opposed to phosphorylation, could provide a framework for bistability using scaffolds. Assuming that the ligand is in high concentration, a simple model of multisite ligand binding would look very much like LR-S and the same analysis would likely apply.</p>
      <p>We have concluded that adding a scaffold has a large likelihood of turning a monostable multisite system into a bistable one, for large <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e151" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-to-substrate ratio. The intuition behind this result can be described as follows. Recall that for large values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e152" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the MA system resembles the LR system, with and without scaffold respectively. Suppose that a parameter regime is such that the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e153" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are large, and that the relationships in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002551-g003">Figure 3B</xref> are satisfied. Then LR-S is likely to be bistable, and the corresponding system MA-S is likely bistable as well since it resembles LR-S. On the other hand, LR-NS must be monostable because it is fully linear, and MA-NS is likely monostable too since it resembles LR-NS. Therefore for such a regime MA-S is much more likely to be bistable than MA-NS. This conclusion is further justified mathematically in Section 3 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002551.s004">Text S1</xref>.</p>
      <p>Scaffolds typically do not possess any enzymatic activity themselves, but facilitate signaling between their bound components. One way in which they are thought to do this is by tethering their ligands in close spatial proximity to each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Zeke1">[24]</xref>. Another mechanism by which scaffolds can enhance signal transmission is to induce an allosteric conformational change in a bound substrate that reveals target residues, as exemplified by yeast Ste5 (scaffold) unlocking Fus3 (substrate) for phosphorylation by Ste7 (kinase) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Good1">[23]</xref>, and human KSR (scaffold) unlocking MEK (substrate) for phosphorylation by RAF (kinase) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Brennan1">[30]</xref>. In addition to speeding up certain rates, scaffolds may also slow down the rates of other enzymatic reactions by blocking the access of certain enzymes (e.g., phosphatases) to bound ligands. Regardless of the precise mechanism by which they act, scaffolds generally exhibit two key properties examined in this work: sequestration and rate partition. By sequestration, we mean that the scaffold-bound population is separated from the unbound (e.g., cytoplasmic) population, essentially creating two different compartments. Of course, if reaction rates and enzyme/substrate concentrations are the same in these two compartments, the scaffold will essentially be inert. Thus, rate partition –the ability of the scaffold to speed up or slow down the rate of enzymatic reactions by one of the mechanisms described above– is also crucial for forming an effective scaffold.</p>
      <p>The mathematical model of scaffolding employed herein features these two key elements of sequestration and rate partition. Sequestration is achieved in our model by accounting for the second order mass action binding of scaffold and substrate. Rate partition is achieved by allowing different rates of substrate modification depending on whether the substrate is bound to the scaffold or not. Our simple model does not incorporate other potentially interesting features of scaffold-mediated signaling, such as combinatorial inhibition, processive on-scaffold phosphorylation, and multi-tier scaffolding (our model just has two tiers: a single kinase and its substrate). For other theoretical treatments of scaffold action, the reader is referred to the following references: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Levchenko1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Heinrich1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Komarova1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Locasale1">[44]</xref>, .</p>
      <p>There has been considerable interest in understanding how common biochemical modules and motifs can be flexibly tuned to achieve a variety of desired outcomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Chapman1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Bashor1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Bardwell3">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Macia1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-OShaughnessy1">[52]</xref>. The work presented here can be viewed as a contribution to this theme. For instance, if bistability were a desirable (pro-fitness) performance objective during an evolutionary trajectory, then a viable evolutionary strategy might be either a low-<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e154" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> multisite phosphorylation module, or a high-<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e155" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> scaffolded multisite phosphorylation module. On the other hand, if multistability were to be avoided, then there are still multiple ways that a module might have evolved, either with or without scaffolding, so that other desirable performance objectives (e.g., speed, amplification, specificity, etc) might be maximized.</p>

      <p>Throughout the computational modeling, we used mass action kinetics to construct the systems of differential equations associated with each individual model. Given a parameter set, in order to test for bistability we first reduced the problem to a 3-variable system of equations involving <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e156" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e157" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e158" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, generalizing the approach described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Thomson1">[13]</xref> for scaffold systems; see Section 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002551.s004">Text S1</xref> for details of this reduction for each type of model. Solutions of the reduced system were then found using Newton's Method with multiple different initial conditions for the MA models, and using polynomial numerical solvers for the LR models. Even though <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e159" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was used as the <italic>de facto</italic> output, we verified in hundreds of independent trials that the system is only bistable if <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e160" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> itself admits multiple stable steady states.</p>
      <p>A key aspect of the analysis is the choice of random parameter sets over several orders of magnitude. Rates of substrate binding to an enzyme or scaffold are normally in the range of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e161" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e162" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002551-Alon1">[53]</xref>.

It was determined for LR-S in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002551-g003">Figure 3A</xref> that bistability is not found in practice for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e182" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, therefore to optimize the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002551-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002551-t002">Table 2</xref> we assumed <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551.e183" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.
