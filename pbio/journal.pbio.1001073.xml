      </related-article><abstract>
        <p>Amino-terminal acetylation is probably the most common protein modification in
                    eukaryotes with as many as 50%–80% of proteins reportedly
                    altered in this way. Here we report a systematic analysis of the predicted
                    N-terminal processing of cytosolic proteins versus those destined to be sorted
                    to the secretory pathway. While cytosolic proteins were profoundly biased in
                    favour of processing, we found an equal and opposite bias against such
                    modification for secretory proteins. Mutations in secretory signal sequences
                    that led to their acetylation resulted in mis-sorting to the cytosol in a manner
                    that was dependent upon the N-terminal processing machinery. Hence N-terminal
                    acetylation represents an early determining step in the cellular sorting of
                    nascent polypeptides that appears to be conserved across a wide range of
                    species.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The eukaryotic cell comprises several distinct compartments, called organelles,
                    required to perform specific functions. The proteins in these compartments are
                    almost always synthesised in the cytoplasm and so require complex sorting
                    mechanisms to ensure their delivery to the appropriate organelle. Of course, not
                    all proteins need to leave the cytoplasm since many remain there to perform
                    cytoplasmic functions. It is well known that many proteins are modified by
                    acetylation of their amino-terminus at a very early stage in their synthesis. We
                    have discovered a profound difference between the likelihood of such a
                    modification on cytoplasmic proteins and on those destined for one of the major
                    organelles, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER): whereas cytoplasmic proteins are
                    typically acetylated, those bound for the ER are largely unmodified. Moreover,
                    when specific ER proteins were engineered to induce their acetylation we found
                    that their targeting to the ER was inhibited. Our data suggest that N-terminal
                    acetylation is a major determinant in protein sorting in eukaryotes.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The mechanism of translational initiation dictates that eukaryotic proteins are
                synthesized with an amino-terminal methionine residue. In 80% of yeast
                proteins studied, the initiating methionine is removed to reveal a new
                amino-terminal residue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Giglione1">[1]</xref>, and some 50% of proteins have their amino-terminal
                residue acetylated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Martinez1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Arnesen1">[3]</xref>. Hence rather few proteins possess an unmodified
                N-terminus. However, while N-terminal processing is widespread, its biological
                significance is not well understood. It has been suggested to contribute to
                differential protein stability and has recently been shown to function as a degron
                for certain cytosolic proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Arfin1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Hwang1">[5]</xref>, while in a small number of cases the processed N-terminus
                is known to contribute directly to protein function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Polevoda1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Coulton1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Methionine cleavage is catalysed by methionine aminopeptidases (MetAPs) that act
                co-translationally as the N-terminus emerges from the ribosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Giglione1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Jackson1">[10]</xref>. MetAPs exhibit substrate
                specificity and are strongly influenced by the residue at position 2 (P2), with
                cleavage favoured by P2 residues with small side chains such as glycine, alanine, or
                serine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Huang1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Boissel1">[12]</xref>. Yeast and
                humans each possess two MetAPs (MetAP1 &amp; 2), and while yeast can tolerate the
                loss of either enzyme, the double mutant is lethal demonstrating that methionine
                processing is a vital function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Li1">[13]</xref>. Interestingly, MetAP2 is the target for the potent
                anti-angiogenic compound fumagillin that exhibits anti-tumourigenic properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Griffith1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Sin1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Protein N-termini can also be modified by acetylation of the free α-amino group
                by N-α-acetyl transferases (NATs). Five distinct NATs have been identified with
                different substrate specificities. NatA normally acetylates N-terminal G, S, A, and
                T residues exposed by MetAP cleavage, whereas NatB acetylates methionine residues
                that are followed by either D, E, or N at P2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Arnesen1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Polevoda2">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Polevoda3">[17]</xref>. NatC acetylates certain
                methionines with either L, I, W, or F at P2, but other sequence elements influence
                processing in this case <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Polevoda4">[18]</xref>. NatD appears to be specialised for histone N-acetylation
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Song1">[19]</xref> and finally
                NatE acetylates substrates with Leucine at P2 and Proline at P4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Evjenth1">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>While most proteins remain in the cytoplasm after synthesis, others are targeted to
                different compartments. Those destined for the secretory pathway typically possess
                an N-terminal signal-sequence which directs them to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Blobel1">[21]</xref>. These
                proteins are translocated into the lumen of the ER, via the Sec61 translocon,
                whereupon their signal-sequence is removed by signal peptidase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Rapoport1">[22]</xref>. A subset of membrane
                proteins can be targeted to the ER via non-cleaved internal signal anchor or
                C-terminal trans-membrane segments, which act as both targeting and
                membrane-integration signals.</p>
      <p>N-terminal signal sequences are degenerate in primary structure but are typically
                15–30 residues long, and usually comprise charged/polar residues, followed by
                6–15 hydrophobic residues and a polar C-terminal region containing the
                cleavage site for signal peptidase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-vonHeijne1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Martoglio1">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In yeast, there are two pathways by which secretory proteins are targeted to the ER.
                The co-translational pathway is mediated by Signal Recognition Particle (SRP), which
                recognises a signal sequence emerging from the ribosome and targets the
                ribosome-nascent chain (RNC) complex to the translocon via SRP-receptor (SR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Keenan1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Pool1">[26]</xref>. The targeted
                ribosome then binds tightly to the cytosolic surface of Sec61p allowing the
                elongating polypeptide chain to be delivered directly into the translocation channel
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Kalies1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Becker1">[29]</xref>. The alternative “post-translational” pathway
                is independent of SRP/SR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Ng1">[30]</xref> and targets full-length polypeptides in a reaction that
                requires cytosolic chaperones that maintain precursors in a translocation-competent
                conformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Chirico1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Plath1">[33]</xref>. Translocation occurs via the same Sec61-channel, but in
                this case, targeting requires the essential integral membrane protein Sec62p that
                interacts with precursor and may constitute a specific receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Deshaies2">[34]</xref>. Mammalian
                cells possess a homologue of SEC62, but this mode of translocation remains poorly
                characterized in metazoans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Tyedmers1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Meyer1">[36]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Properties of the signal sequence, and in particular the hydrophobicity of the
                central core, determine which pathway a substrate will access, with more hydrophobic
                signal sequences utilizing the SRP pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Ng1">[30]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Cleavage of the signal sequence reveals a novel N-terminus for the mature
                translocated protein, which is located in the ER lumen and so inaccessible to the
                N-terminal processing enzymes. The processing status of the initiating methionine of
                signal sequences has largely been ignored, particularly as such N-termini are not
                detected in proteomic analyses. We therefore decided to investigate the N-terminal
                processing of signal sequences using a combination of bioinformatic and experimental
                approaches and find that N-terminal modification is incompatible with targeting to
                the ER.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s2">
      <title>Results</title>
      <p>Signal sequence recognition and N-terminal processing both occur co-translationally
                as the nascent chain emerges from the ribosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Jackson1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Jungnickel1">[37]</xref>. We therefore decided to
                investigate whether secretory proteins might be subject to N-terminal processing in
                a similar manner to their cytosolic counterparts. As the P2 residue is the major
                determinant of N-terminal processing, we first surveyed the amino acid frequency at
                this position for signal sequence-containing proteins versus cytosolic proteins
                    (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001073-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Surprisingly,
                we found a significantly different frequency distribution between the two sets
                    (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001, according to the χ<sup>2</sup> test with 18
                degrees of freedom). Lysine, leucine, and arginine were most frequent at P2 in
                signal sequences but were rarely found at this position in the cytosolic set.
                Conversely, while serine and alanine were most frequent at P2 in cytosolic proteins,
                these were less evident in signal sequences. A clear pattern emerged when the ratio
                of frequencies were compared between the two classes of proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001073-g001">Figure 1B</xref>); small and acidic
                residues were strongly biased towards cytosolic proteins, whereas large and basic
                ones were favoured in signal sequences. The frequency of small residues at P2 in
                cytosolic proteins predicts that ∼72% of these proteins would be
                substrates for MetAP cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001073-g001">Figure
                    1C</xref>), in good agreement with empirical data from proteomic studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Martinez1">[2]</xref>. In contrast
                only 23% of signal sequences would be predicted to be MetAP substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001073-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Hence our data reveal
                that for signal sequences there appears to be a strong selection for P2 residues
                that would maintain the original N-terminal methionine.</p>

      <p>We next addressed whether this bias was of functional significance for ER
                translocation. The signal sequence of Carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Johnson1">[38]</xref> begins with “MK”
                and so, like most secretory proteins in our analysis, is predicted to remain
                unprocessed. Rather than mutating the native P2 residue we chose to insert one of
                seven different amino acids between the initiator methionine and the following
                lysine residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001073-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). We
                then assessed the translocation efficiency of these mutants in vivo by monitoring
                their ER-dependent glycosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001073-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Insertion of arginine or valine had no effect on the
                efficiency of translocation, demonstrating that an insertion at this position does
                not inherently perturb signal sequence function. However, the other five insertions
                tested all resulted in translocation defects indicated by the accumulation of the
                cytosolic precursor form of preproCPY (ppCPY). The most significant defects were
                observed for glycine, serine, and glutamate, which are three of the four residues
                most biased in their frequency distribution towards cytosolic proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001073-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus the bias observed
                in our bioinformatic analysis correlates with defects in translocation, thereby
                implying an important role for P2 in a functional signal sequence.</p>

      <p>The inhibitory effects of these various P2 residues might reflect either some simple
                perturbation of the signal sequence or their predicted impact on N-terminal
                processing. We reasoned that if processing alone were responsible for the effects,
                then inhibiting MetAP activity might restore translocation of the mutant proteins.
                We therefore analysed translocation in wild-type and Δ<italic>map1</italic>
                cells in the presence of the Map2p inhibitor fumagillin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001073-g002">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001073.s001">S1</xref>). In
                wild-type (<italic>MAP1</italic>) cells, fumagillin had little or no effect on the
                translocation of native (MK) CPY nor the translocation defects observed for the
                various insertion mutants. Similarly, the absence of Map1 alone
                    (<italic>Δmap1</italic>) had no discernible effect on any of the
                translocation substrates. In contrast, when <italic>Δmap1</italic> cells were
                treated with fumagillin we found almost complete restoration of translocation for
                the MA, MC, MG, and MS mutants. All four are predicted substrates for Met-cleavage,
                and our data demonstrate that their inhibitory effects are entirely dependent upon
                MetAP activity. In contrast, ME is not a substrate for MetAP and we found that the
                translocation defect for this mutant persisted under these conditions. The effect of
                fumagillin was therefore substrate-specific, correlating precisely with the known
                specificity of MetAPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Huang1">[11]</xref>. We therefore conclude that MetAP-dependent cleavage of a
                signal peptide's initiating methionine has a strong inhibitory effect on the
                translocation of CPY.</p>
      <p>In our analysis, the ME and MS mutations had the strongest effects on translocation
                    (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001073-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) and these P2
                residues displayed extreme bias against their occurrence in natural signal sequences
                    (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001073-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). While
                “ME” is not a substrate for MetAP, it is known to promote
                N-α-acetylation of the N-terminal methionine by NatB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Polevoda1">[6]</xref>. Likewise, the P2 serine, once
                revealed by MetAP, is predicted to be N-α-acetylated by NatA. We therefore
                tested whether acetylation might be the key determinant affecting translocation by
                analysing translocation efficiencies in either NatA(Δ<italic>ard1</italic>) or
                    NatB(Δ<italic>nat3</italic>)-deficient strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001073-g003">Figure 3</xref>). In Δ<italic>ard1</italic> cells,
                translocation of MS-CPY appeared largely restored while the ME mutant remained
                unaffected. The converse was observed in the Δ<italic>nat3</italic> strain.
                Importantly, the ability of the different <italic>Nat</italic> mutants to rescue
                precursor translocation matched precisely the substrate specificities of NatA and
                NatB for MS and ME, respectively. Moreover, the observation that inhibition of MAP
                activity specifically rescues the translocation of NatA substrates is entirely
                consistent with methionine cleavage being a prerequisite for NatA-dependent
                acetylation. Thus, it is the N-α-acetylation of these substrates that is the
                major determinant in the inhibition of translocation in vivo.</p>

      <p>We next examined the effect of mutants predicted to induce acetylation of two
                independent ER translocation substrates, namely Pdi1p and prepro-alpha factor
                (ppαF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001073-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>).
                The signal sequence of Pdi1p begins MK and hence is not predicted to be a substrate
                for MetAP or N-acetylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Martinez1">[2]</xref>. MSK and MEK mutations both led to accumulation of
                non-translocated precursor and a reduction of fully translocated glycosylated Pdi1p
                at steady state. Furthermore, analysis by mass-spectrometry confirmed that the MSK
                mutant of pPdi1 was methionine-processed and N-acetylated in vivo, as predicted

      <p>Wild-type ppαF, which begins MR, is efficiently translocated and secreted. In
                contrast an MS mutant, which is a predicted substrate for NatA, accumulated in
                cells, as the non-translocated precursor. Hence, the inhibitory effect of
                acetylation appears widespread and not restricted to CPY.</p>
      <p>Next we sought to reconstitute this phenomenon in vitro using ppαF. We translated
                both wild-type (MR) and MS mutant forms of ppαF in reticulocyte lysate and then
                incubated these precursors with yeast microsomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001073-g004">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001073.s003">S3</xref>). We
                observed microsome-dependent translocation and glycosylation of wild-type ppαF
                but found no evidence of translocation of the MS mutant. Thus the inhibitory effect
                of the P2 Serine can also be reconstituted in vitro.</p>
      <p>Our data thus far indicate that MS-ppαF would be acetylated following processing
                by MetAP. To verify this directly we performed in vitro translations in the presence
                of 1-[<sup>14</sup>C]-acetyl-CoA and detected incorporation of radiolabel
                into MS-ppαF but not wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001073-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). For this experiment, we utilised a ppαF variant where
                all lysines have been mutated to arginine; hence, the only primary amine potentially
                available for acetylation is the N-terminal αNH<sub>2</sub> group. These in
                vitro data demonstrate directly that the MS mutant form of ppαF is indeed
                acetylated as predicted and support our hypothesis that N-terminal acetylation
                inhibits ER translocation.</p>
      <p>Charge distribution across the signal sequence has been shown to affect translocation
                efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-vonHeijne2">[39]</xref>. N-α-acetylation of the signal peptide would reduce the
                overall positive charge of the N-terminus by +1, and therefore one potentially
                trivial explanation might be that it is the loss of positive charge, rather than
                acetylation per se, that inhibited translocation. However, we can exclude this
                possibility given that the insertion of an additional arginine residue at position 3
                (MSRR), which restores the overall charge of the N-region following
                N-α-acetylation, also failed to translocate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001073.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
      <p>We next wished to assess the stage at which the translocation of an acetylated MS
                substrate is blocked. We incubated in vitro translated wild-type (MR) ppαF with
                yeast microsomes in the absence of ATP, which permits targeting to Sec61, but not
                subsequent translocation. Using site-specific photocross-linking probes incorporated
                into the signal sequence, we could detect a complex spectrum of uv-induced adducts
                as has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001073-g004">Figure
                    4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Plath2">[40]</xref>). An adduct of ∼50 kD could be readily immunoprecipitated
                with Sec61p antisera, indicating the engagement of precursor with the translocon. In
                striking contrast, the MS mutant completely failed to crosslink with Sec61p. Hence
                we conclude that targeting arrests at a step prior to the interaction of the
                precursor with the translocon.</p>
      <p>There are two pathways by which secretory precursors can be targeted to the ER; some
                precursors follow a post-translational Sec62p-dependent pathway, while substrates
                with more hydrophobic signal sequences utilise a co-translational SRP-dependent
                mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Keenan1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Ng1">[30]</xref>. As CPY, Pdi1p, and ppαF are all translocated
                post-translationally, we therefore sought to compare the behaviour of an
                SRP-dependent substrate. We chose the well-characterised SRP-dependent substrate
                OPY, a variant of CPY in which the endogenous signal sequence is replaced with that
                of Ost1p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Willer1">[41]</xref>. The
                OPY signal sequence begins MR, and so should remain unprocessed, enabling us to
                perform a precisely parallel mutational analysis to that for CPY (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001073-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). In striking contrast
                to CPY, we found that the introduction of various processable residues at P2 had no
                effect on the translocation of OPY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001073-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>). Thus the observed inhibitory effect of an MS mutation
                on translocation can be suppressed in the context of an SRP-dependent signal
                sequence. This property was not limited to the Ost1p signal sequence;
                co-translational translocation of the SRP-dependent substrate D<sub>HC</sub>-αF

                microsomes using a yeast translation extract was also unaffected by the

      <p>These data suggest either SRP can successfully target an acetylated substrate or
                alternatively such substrates might not be processed as expected. Therefore, to
                address this point we assessed whether or not the Ost1p signal sequence was
                N-terminally processed. We tested the MS mutant for the presence of any unmodified
                N-termini using a biotinylation assay to detect free α-NH<sub>2</sub> groups in
                a protein completely lacking lysine residues. We observed no difference in the
                efficiency of biotinylation between wild-type (MR) and mutant (MS) suggesting that
                in the context of an SRP-dependent signal sequence, and contrary to expectation, the
                MS amino-terminal was not acetylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001073-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>
      <p>This effect of SRP might go some way to explain the small, but not insubstantial,
                minority of secretory proteins predicted to be processed in our bioinformatic
                analysis. Consistent with this idea, we found that average peak hydrophobicity of
                signal sequences among this minority was significantly greater than for the majority
                subset of sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001073.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Overall, more than 99% of signal sequences were
                either not predicted to be acetylated or were sufficiently hydrophobic to interact
                with SRP.</p>
      <p>Having validated the biological significance of the bias observed in our
                bioinformatic study, we extended our analysis from yeast to higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001073-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The pattern observed in
                nematodes and insects was remarkably similar to that seen in yeast, with
                ∼70% of signal peptides predicted to retain an unprocessed methionine
                compared to only 20% for the proteome as a whole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Martinez1">[2]</xref>. The trend was similar in
                humans and plants, albeit less pronounced, with ∼50% of secretory
                N-termini predicted to remain unprocessed compared to 15% for the proteome as
                a whole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Martinez1">[2]</xref>.
                Thus this phenomenon appears not to be restricted to fungi but is very widely

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we describe the striking observation that yeast signal sequences display a
                profound bias against N-terminal processing. The bias is precisely converse to that
                observed in cytosolic proteins where N-terminal processing is highly favoured.
                Moreover, we show that this bias is of functional significance as introduction of
                residues at position 2 which promote N-terminal processing inhibits translocation in
                to the ER. Importantly this inhibition can be reversed by blocking N-terminal
                processing, confirming that it is the processing itself that leads to the block in
                translocation. The bias against N-terminal processing is not restricted to yeast but
                is also observed across eukaryotes, suggesting this is a widely conserved
                phenomenon.</p>
      <p>It is possible that other factors distinct from N-terminal processing might affect
                the observed bias in amino acid frequency at position 2. We considered the potential
                effect of the Kozak consensus sequence that favours a G at the +4 position
                (corresponding to the first base of codon 2) in genes optimised for translation
                efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Kozak1">[44]</xref>.
                However, while this might contribute to the bias observed among cytosolic proteins,
                it is unlikely to be the dominant feature since it does not explain the predominance
                of Serine at position 2. Furthermore, the Kozak consensus does not have such a
                strong effect in yeast and it has recently been reported that the effect of the
                +4 position may be more important in promoting N-terminal modification than in
                influencing initiation efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Xia1">[45]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A second possible factor influencing the P2 frequency distribution could be the
                previously reported bias for an adenine-free stretch within the signal-sequence
                coding region of a secretory mRNA, which is important for its nuclear export <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Palazzo1">[46]</xref>. However, this
                also seems an unlikely explanation as lysine, with its A-rich codon (AAA/AAG), is
                actually more frequent at position 2 of signal sequences as compared to cytosolic
                proteins. Critically, however, both translation initiation and nuclear mRNA export
                operate independently of N-terminal processing and so would not lead to
                translocation defects that could be reversed by N-terminal processing mutants, as we
                observe. Furthermore the restoration of translocation in such processing mutants
                shows a precise substrate dependency, ruling out rescue of translocation by some
                indirect effect. Hence, while we would not completely exclude a minor role for the
                Kozak consensus or mRNA elements in influencing the P2 residue of signal sequences,
                the strong correlation and clear functional effects make a bias against N-terminal
                processing the simplest and most likely explanation of the relative P2 residue
                frequency.</p>
      <p>A trivial explanation for the inhibitory effect of acetylation could be the change in
                charge distribution across the signal sequence, which is known to be important for
                targeting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-vonHeijne2">[39]</xref>.
                However, this appears unlikely, firstly as insertion of an additional positively
                charged residue to counteract the loss of the +1 charge following acetylation
                of the free amino terminus did not restore translocation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001073.s003">Figure S3</xref>).
                Secondly, translocation of the ME CPY mutant can be restored in a strain lacking
                NatB activity (<italic>Δnat3</italic>), which results in the same net N-terminal
                charge as is present in the acetylated MS CPY mutant, which fails to translocate
                    (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001073-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Hence simple
                charge distribution alone cannot explain the inhibitory effects of
                N-acetylation.</p>
      <p>Overall our data indicate that N-acetylation inhibits ER translocation and that most
                secretory proteins avoid this by virtue of a P2 residue that prevents processing.
                Interestingly, SRP-dependent substrates appear to evade this effect as SRP blocks
                N-terminal N-acetylation even in the presence of a P2 residue predicted to be a NatA
                substrate. SRP and NatA are both thought to contact the ribosome via the same site
                (ribosomal protein Rpl25/L23a) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Polevoda5">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Dalley1">[49]</xref>. Hence competition for this site would provide a
                potential mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon. This finding also predicts
                that while the P2 residue is the major determinant of N-acetylation by NatA, there
                are scenarios where N-acetylation does not occur, despite the presence of an
                appropriate P2 residue. Empirical evidence for this prediction was recently provided
                by the global analysis of N-acetylation of the drosophila proteome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Goetze1">[50]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Comparison of predicted N-terminal processing of signal sequences across other
                species indicates an almost identical bias for nematodes and drosophila as seen in
                yeast. In plants and humans, the bias is still present but is less marked.
                Interestingly, a bias against predicted N-terminal processing (73%) has also
                been noted for prokaryotic signal sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Flinta1">[51]</xref>. Hence the bias against
                processing of signal sequences appears widespread and not restricted to yeast.</p>
      <p>Current dogma suggests that the SRP-dependent targeting pathway is more pervasive in
                mammals. As SRP appears to allow substrates to evade the effects of acetylation,
                this may well explain why the bias against N-terminal processing is less pronounced
                in humans. Nevertheless, homologues of the SRP-independent pathway components Sec62
                and Sec63 are present in mammals and form complexes with the Sec61 translocon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Tyedmers1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Meyer1">[36]</xref>. Furthermore,
                both mammalian and drosophila Sec62 can functionally replace their yeast counterpart
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Muller1">[52]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Noel1">[53]</xref>. These
                observations, combined with our observed bias against N-terminal processing in these
                organisms, suggest that although SRP-dependent targeting is perhaps more dominant,
                Sec62-dependent translocation still likely occurs. Identification of substrates for
                this pathway remains an important question to be addressed in the future.</p>
      <p>What might be the reason as to why secretory and cytosolic proteins have a precisely
                converse bias for N-acetylation? Cytosolic proteins, once synthesized, typically
                fold rapidly to their final tertiary structure in the cytoplasm. In contrast,
                secretory precursors must reach the translocon in an unfolded state in order to be
                competent for translocation. Post-translationally translocated substrates achieve
                this by their interactions with cytosolic chaperones that prevent their folding
                within the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Deshaies1">[32]</xref>. SRP-dependent substrates are targeted co-translationally
                and so reach the translocon as short nascent chains, thus eliminating the
                possibility of folding in the cytoplasm. It is not known what causes translocation
                substrates to recruit these chaperones, but our data allow us to propose a model in
                which acetylation determines the fate of nascent polypeptides. We speculate that
                acetylation identifies nascent polypeptides, very early in their synthesis, as being
                destined to fold in the cytoplasmic compartment. Most secretory proteins are
                unmodified and so would be delayed in their folding sufficiently to facilitate their
                functional interaction with the translocon. This would be entirely consistent with
                our finding that acetylation blocks secretory substrate interaction with Sec61,
                arresting the protein in the cytosol.</p>
      <p>Not all proteins that fold and remain in the cytosol are acetylated. It may be that
                such modification would be incompatible with function, but it might also be that
                such proteins have more complex folding requirements; for example, they might be
                required to fold more slowly, perhaps relying on the recruitment of specific
                cytosolic chaperones.</p>
      <p>An alternative biological explanation for this phenomenon could relate to a
                proofreading step for Sec62-dependent substrates. Unlike their SRP-dependent
                counterparts, Sec62-dependent signal sequences are only modestly hydrophobic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Ng1">[30]</xref>. It is quite
                likely, therefore, that globular cytosolic proteins may contain internal regions of
                similar hydrophobicity, which upon folding form the hydrophobic core of such
                proteins. Clearly, it is critical that these proteins do not translocate into the ER
                and become mis-sorted. Entirely consistent with this idea, it has been shown that
                randomly selected regions of the mature domains of both CPY and invertase (Suc2) can
                promote translocation, albeit inefficiently, when positioned at the N-terminus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-BlachlyDyson1">[54]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Kaiser1">[55]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A requirement for a free N-terminus proximal to the hydrophobic region could provide
                a mechanism to prevent internal regions of non-secretory proteins engaging the
                translocation machinery. Modification of the N-termini of cytosolic proteins would
                also help prevent mis-sorting.</p>
      <p>Internal ER targeting sequences of course exist, but they tend to be trans-membrane
                domains which act as signal anchor sequences; hence they are much more hydrophobic
                and thus promote targeting via the SRP pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001073-Ng1">[30]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In summary, our finding that N-terminal processing inhibits ER translocation of
                secretory proteins identifies a non-acetylated N-terminus as a hitherto
                unappreciated yet general feature of signal sequences, which is necessary to promote
                efficient targeting of substrates to the ER translocon.</p>
