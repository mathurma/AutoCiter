        <p>Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies are an integral tool to investigate the genetic component of gene expression variation. A major challenge in the analysis of such studies are hidden confounding factors, such as unobserved covariates or unknown subtle environmental perturbations. These factors can induce a pronounced artifactual correlation structure in the expression profiles, which may create spurious false associations or mask real genetic association signals. Here, we report PANAMA (Probabilistic ANAlysis of genoMic dAta), a novel probabilistic model to account for confounding factors within an eQTL analysis. In contrast to previous methods, PANAMA learns hidden factors jointly with the effect of prominent genetic regulators. As a result, this new model can more accurately distinguish true genetic association signals from confounding variation. We applied our model and compared it to existing methods on different datasets and biological systems. PANAMA consistently performs better than alternative methods, and finds in particular substantially more <italic>trans</italic> regulators. Importantly, our approach not only identifies a greater number of associations, but also yields hits that are biologically more plausible and can be better reproduced between independent studies. A software implementation of PANAMA is freely available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ml.sheffield.ac.uk/qtl/" xlink:type="simple">http://ml.sheffield.ac.uk/qtl/</ext-link>.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The computational analysis of genetical genomics studies is challenged by confounding variation that is unrelated to the genetic factors of interest. Several approaches to account for these confounding factors have been proposed, greatly increasing the sensitivity in recovering direct genetic (<italic>cis</italic>) associations between variable genetic loci and the expression levels of individual genes. Crucially, these existing techniques largely rely on the true association signals being orthogonal to the confounding variation. Here, we show that when studying indirect (<italic>trans</italic>) genetic effects, for example from master regulators, their association signals can overlap with confounding factors estimated using existing methods. This technical overlap can lead to overcorrection, erroneously explaining away true associations as confounders. To address these shortcomings, we propose PANAMA, a model that jointly learns hidden factors while accounting for the effect of selected genetic regulators. In applications to several studies, PANAMA is more accurate than existing methods in recovering the hidden confounding factors. As a result, we find an increase in the statistical power for direct (<italic>cis</italic>) and indirect (<italic>trans</italic>) associations. Most strikingly on yeast, PANAMA not only finds additional associations but also identifies master regulators that can be better reproduced between independent studies.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Genome-wide analysis of the regulatory role of polymorphic loci on gene expression has been carried out in a range of different study designs and biological systems. For example, association mapping in human has uncovered an abundance of <italic>cis</italic> associations that contribute to the variation of a third of all human genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Stranger1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Stegle1">[2]</xref>. In segregating yeast strains, linkage studies have revealed extensive genetic <italic>trans</italic> regulation, with a few regulatory hotspots controlling the expression profiles of tens or hundreds of genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Brem1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Smith1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Despite the success of such expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies, it has also become clear that the analysis of these data comes along with non-trivial statistical hurdles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-McCarthy1">[5]</xref>. Different types of external confounding factors, including environment or technical influences, can substantially alter the outcome of an eQTL scan. Unobserved confounders can both obscure true association signals and create new spurious associations that are false <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Leek1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Kang1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Suitable data preprocessing, or careful design of randomized studies are helpful measures to avoid confounders in the first place <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Churchill1">[8]</xref>, however they rarely rule out confounding influences entirely. It is also relatively straightforward to account for those factors that are known and measured. For example, it is standard procedure to include covariates such as age and gender in the analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Balding1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Johnson1">[10]</xref>. Similarly, the effect of populational relatedness between samples, a confounding effect that is observed or can be reliably estimated form the genotype data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Kang2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Kang3">[12]</xref>, is usually included in the model. However other factors, including subtle environmental or technical influences, often remain unknown to the experimenter, but still need to be accounted for. Their potential impact has previously been characterized in multiple studies; for example Plagnol et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Plagnol1">[13]</xref> and Locke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Locke1">[14]</xref> showed that virtually any aspect of sample handling can impact the analysis.</p>
      <p>Several computational methods have been developed to account for unknown confounding variation within eQTL analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Stegle1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Leek1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Kang1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Stegle2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Listgarten1">[16]</xref>. A common assumption these methods built on is that confounders are prone to exhibit broad effects, influencing large fractions of the measured gene expression levels. This characteristic has been exploited to learn the profile of hidden confounders using models that are related to PCA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Stegle1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Leek1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Stegle2">[15]</xref>. Once learnt, these factors can then be included in the analysis analogously to known covariates. Another branch of methods avoids recovering the hidden factors explicitly, instead correcting for the correlation structure they induce between the samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Kang1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Listgarten1">[16]</xref>. Here, the inter-sample correlation is estimated from the expression profiles first, to then account for its influence in an association scan using mixed linear models. Both types of methods have been applied in a number of studies. Advantages versus naive analysis include better-calibrated test statistics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Listgarten1">[16]</xref> and improved reproducibility of hits between independent studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Kang1">[7]</xref>. Perhaps most strikingly, statistical methods to correct for hidden confounders have also been shown to substantially increase the power to detect eQTLs, increasing the number of significant <italic>cis</italic> associations by up to 3-fold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Stegle1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Nica1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>While improved sensitivity to detect <italic>cis</italic>-acting eQTLs is an important and necessary step, we expect that even more valuable insights can be gained from those loci that regulate multiple target genes in <italic>trans</italic>. The interest in these regulatory hotspots has been tremendous in recent years, but limited reproducibility between studies has been a concern (see for example the discussion in Breitling et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Breitling1">[18]</xref>). Accurate correction for confounding factors is key to improve the reliability of these regulatory associations, however statistical overlap between confounding factors and true association signals from downstream effects can hamper the identification and fitting of confounders. For example, methodology that merely accounts for broad variance components, such as PCA, is doomed to fail. If the effect size of <italic>trans</italic> regulatory hotspots is large enough, they induce a correlation structure that is similar to the one caused by confounding factors. As a result, true <italic>trans</italic> regulators tend to be mistaken for confounders and are erroneously explained away.</p>
      <p>Here, we report an integrated probabilistic model PANAMA (Probabilistic ANAlysis of genoMic dAta) to address these shortcoming of established approaches. PANAMA learns a dictionary of confounding factors from the observed expression profiles. Unique to PANAMA is to jointly learn these factors while accounting for the effect of loci with a pronounced <italic>trans</italic> regulatory effect, thereby avoiding overlaps between true genetic association signals and the covariance structure induced by the learnt confounders. The statistical model underlying our algorithm is simple and computationally tractable for large eQTL datasets. PANAMA is based on the framework of mixed linear models, and combines the advantages of factor-based methods, such as PCA, SVA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Leek1">[6]</xref> or PEER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Stegle1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Stegle2">[15]</xref> with methods that estimate the implicit covariance structure induced by confounding variation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Kang3">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Listgarten1">[16]</xref>. The model is fully automated and can be easily adapted to include additional observed confounding sources of variation, such as population structure or known covariates.</p>
      <p>We applied PANAMA to a range of eQTL studies, including synthetic data and studies from yeast, mouse and human. Across datasets, PANAMA performed better than previous methods, identifying a greater number of significant eQTLs and in particular additional <italic>trans</italic> regulators. We provide multiple sources of evidence that the associations recovered by PANAMA are indeed likely to be real. Most strikingly in yeast, the findings by PANAMA can be better reproduced between independent studies and are more consistent with prior knowledge about the underlying regulatory network. Finally, we also give insights into the limitations of current methods to account for confounders that help to understand the relationship between confounding variation, <italic>cis</italic> regulation and <italic>trans</italic> effects.</p>

        <title>Learning of confounding factors in the presence of <italic>trans</italic> regulators</title>
        <p>The statistical model underlying PANAMA assumes additive contributions from true genetic effects and hidden confounding factors.

Parameter inference in PANAMA is done in the mixed model framework <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Kang3">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Lippert1">[19]</xref>. In this hierarchical model, the regression weights of the hidden factors are marginalized out, yielding a covariance structure in a multivariate Gaussian model to capture the effect of confounders. Intuitively, the objective during learning in PANAMA is to explain the empirical correlation structure between samples shared across genes by the state of the hidden factors. In the presence of extensive <italic>trans</italic> regulation this approach leads to over-correction, running the risk of explaining away true genetic association signals. To circumvent this side effect, PANAMA also includes a subset of all SNPs in the model, resulting in a more complete covariance structure that satisfies an appropriate balance between explaining confounding variation and preserving true genetic signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002330-g001">Figure 1b,c</xref>). In this approach, the variance contribution of few major signal SNPs and the state of the hidden factors are then jointly estimated. Moreover, an appropriate number of hidden factors is determined automatically during learning. As a result, PANAMA is statistically robust and inference of hidden factors is feasible without manual setting of any tuning parameters. Additional observed covariates, if available, can also be included in the model; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> and the supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002330.s014">Text S1</xref> for full details.</p>

        <title>Simulation study</title>
        <p>The evaluation of methods to call eQTLs is difficult as reliable ground truth information is not available. Following previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Stegle1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Price1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Yu1">[21]</xref>, we have used synthetic data to assess and compare PANAMA with alternative approaches. To minimize assumptions we need to impose on the simulation procedure we created an artificial dataset that borrows key characteristics from a real eQTL study in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Smith1">[4]</xref> (See also Application to segregating yeast strains). In this approach, we first fit PANAMA to the original yeast eQTL data, thereby estimating the number of <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> associations, an empirical distribution of effect sizes, and finally the characteristics of confounding variation. Based on these estimates we recreated an in silico eQTL dataset using standard linear assumptions; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002330.s014">Text S1</xref> for full details on the exact approach. To rule out possible biases of this dataset towards our method, we additionally considered a simulation setting when fitting the ICE model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Kang1">[7]</xref> to the real data for estimating simulation parameters (see below).</p>
        <p>Given the synthetic eQTL study, we employed alternative methods to recover the underlying simulated associations. We compared PANAMA to standard linear regression (LINEAR), ignoring the presence of confounders entirely, as well as SVA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Leek1">[6]</xref>, ICE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Kang1">[7]</xref> and PEER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Stegle1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Stegle2">[15]</xref>, established and widely used approaches to correct for hidden confounders. For reference, we also compared to an idealized model with the simulated confounders perfectly removed (IDEAL). First, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002330-g002">Figure 2a and 2b</xref> show the respective number of significant <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> associations as a function of the false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff. To avoid overly optimistic association counts due to linkage disequilibrium, we considered at most a single <italic>cis</italic> association per gene and at most one <italic>trans</italic> association per chromosome for each gene. PANAMA found more <italic>cis</italic> associations than any other approach and retrieved the greatest number of <italic>trans</italic> associations among methods that correct for hidden confounders. Notably, the linear model appeared to find even more <italic>trans</italic> associations, however the majority of these calls were inconsistent with the simulated ground truth and were spurious false positives. The extent of false associations called by the linear model is also reflected in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002330-g002">Figure 2c</xref>, which shows the receiver operating characteristics for each method. All approaches that correct for confounders performed strikingly better than the linear model. Among these, PANAMA was most accurate, achieving greater sensitivity than any other method for a large range of false positive rates (FPR), approaching the performance of an ideal model (IDEAL).</p>

        <p>Since some models, including SVA and PEER, allow to account for additional known covariates, we investigated their performance when adding the strongest genetic regulators as covariates. This procedure is mimicking the central concept of PANAMA using previous methods. However, comparative results (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002330.s009">Figure S7</xref>) show that iterative learning of PANAMA still performs significantly better.</p>
        <p>Next, we studied the statistics of obtained p-values, checking for departure from a uniform distribution that either indicates inflation (genomic control <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002330.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) or deflation (genomic control <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002330.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) of the respective methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002330-g002">Figure 2d</xref> and Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002330.s010">Figure S8</xref> for corresponding Q-Q-plots). All methods except for ICE yielded an inflated p-value distribution. Notably, this observation also applies to the ideal model where the effect of confounders had been perfectly removed. Thus, in settings with sufficiently strong <italic>trans</italic> regulation, inflated statistics are not necessarily due to poor calibration because of confounders, but instead may occur as a consequence of an excess of true biological signals themselves. We also checked that calls by the various methods were not overly optimistic and artificially inflated. Indeed, false discovery rate estimates from all methods but the linear model were approximately in line with the empirical rate of errors when taking the ground truth into account (Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002330.s003">Figure S1</xref>), with PANAMA being the best calibrated method.</p>
        <p>We then repeated the same analysis on a broader range of simulated datasets, varying particular aspects of the simulation procedure around the parameters obtained from the fit to the real yeast data. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002330-g002">Figure 2e</xref> shows the accuracy of alternative methods when reducing the extent of simulated <italic>trans</italic> regulation by subsampling from the set of initial <italic>trans</italic> effects. These results highlight that previous methods only work well in the regime of little <italic>trans</italic> regulation, while PANAMA provides for accurate calls for a wider range of settings. Similarly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002330-g002">Figure 2f</xref> shows results for strong <italic>trans</italic> regulation, now varying the extent of confounding factors from weaker to stronger influences. Again, PANAMA was found to be more robust than previous approaches, recovering true simulated associations with great accuracy irrespectively of the magnitude of simulated confounding.</p>
        <p>Finally, we investigated the impact of the exact of model used to fit the association characteristics to the initial yeast dataset. Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002330.s004">Figure S2</xref> shows summary results for a second synthetic dataset fitted using ICE. As ICE tends to be the most conservative approach among the considered methods, the extent of <italic>trans</italic> regulation on this simulated data was severely reduced. As a consequence, the differences between methods were considerably smaller, however confirming the previously observed trends.</p>

        <title>Application to segregating yeast strains</title>
        <p>Having established the accuracy of PANAMA in recovering hidden confounders, we applied PANAMA and the alternative methods to the primary eQTL dataset from segregating yeast strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Smith1">[4]</xref>. These data cover a set of 108 genetically diverse strains that have been expression profiled in two environmental conditions, glucose and ethanol. First, we focused on the glucose condition, which has previously been expression profiled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Brem1">[3]</xref>, providing an independent study for the purpose of comparison.</p>

Again, we considered at most one association per chromosome to avoid confounding the size of associations with their number. In line with previously reported results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Stegle1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Kang1">[7]</xref> and the simulated setting (Simulation study), the standard linear model identified fewer <italic>cis</italic> associations than methods that correct for confounding variation. The trends from the simulated dataset also carried over for <italic>trans</italic> associations, where the linear model called many more associations than methods that account for confounders, yielding an excess of regulatory hotspots (See Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002330.s005">Figure S3</xref>). It has previously been suggested that many of these are likely to be false; see for example the discussion in Kang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Kang1">[7]</xref>. Among the methods that correct for confounding variation, PANAMA identified the greatest number of associations. Among the alternative methods, ICE appeared to be more sensitive in recovering <italic>cis</italic> associations while PEER and SVA retrieved a greater number of <italic>trans</italic> associations. Also note that models that account for confounding factors yielded slightly inflated p-value distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002330-g003">Figure 3c</xref>, Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002330.s011">Figure S9</xref>), supporting that also in real settings, a certain degree of inflation may be caused by extensive <italic>trans</italic> regulation. Finally, supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002330.s005">Figure S3</xref> shows the number of associations called by different methods as a function of the genomic position. This summary of genome-wide eQTLs confirms that ICE is most conservative in detecting hotspots, whereas all other methods do find multiple <italic>trans</italic> bands. For comparison we also included a version of PANAMA that also corrects for the <italic>trans</italic> regulators that are accounted for while learning (PANAMA<sub>trans</sub> , see Methods and supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002330.s014">Text S1</xref>). PANAMA<sub>trans</sub> yields near-identical results to ICE, which explains the differences and similarities between the two approaches, where PANAMA can be regarded as generalization of ICE. By accounting for pronounced regulators PANAMA circumvents the over-conservative correction of the ICE model.</p>

Alternatively, focusing on the consistency of regulatory hotspots, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002330-g003">Figure 3e</xref> shows the ranking consistency of polymorphisms ordered by their regulatory potential on multiple genes. Reassuringly, for both <italic>cis</italic> effects and <italic>trans</italic> regulatory hotspots, PANAMA yielded results with far greater consistency than any other currently available method. In particular the consistency of <italic>trans</italic> hotspots suggest that PANAMA achieved an appropriate balance between explaining away spurious signals as confounding variation and identifying hotspots that are likely to have a true genetic underpinning.</p>

          <title>Consistency of <italic>trans</italic> regulatory hotspots with respect to known regulatory mechanisms in yeast</title>
          <p>As a second means of validating <italic>trans</italic> eQTLs, we investigated to what extent polymorphisms that regulate multiple genes in <italic>trans</italic> can be interpreted as indirect effects that are mediated by known transcriptional regulators. For this analysis we considered an established regulatory network of transcription factors extracted from Yeastract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Teixeira1">[22]</xref>. Although we do not expect <italic>trans</italic> associations to be exclusively mediated by direct transcriptional regulation, the degree of associations that are consistent with this regulatory structure is nevertheless an informative indicator for the validity of eQTL calls from different models.</p>
          <p>For each transcription factor, we considered polymorphisms in the vicinity of the coding region of the transcription factor (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002330.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>10 kb around the coding region), and tested the fraction of associations with genes that are known targets of the transcription factor versus other associations with genes that are no direct targets. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002330.s012">Table S1</xref> shows the F-score (harmonic mean between precision and recall) for each of 129 transcription factors that had at least one SNP in the local <italic>cis</italic> window. For half of the 129 TFs, PANAMA yielded a higher F-score than any of the other methods considered. Interestingly, the standard linear models performed second best under this metric, achieving the greatest F-score in 36% of all cases, followed by PEER (28%), SVA (15%) and ICE (6%).

Because each yeast strain was profiled twice, the set of samples was not independent, but instead had a replicate population structure. Similarly as done in previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Listgarten1">[16]</xref>, we accounted for this genetic relatedness in PANAMA by adding a population covariance term (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Material and Methods</xref>).

Because PANAMA accounted for the replicate structure of the dataset, the increase in the number of associations compared to the analysis of the single-condition analysis was modest. Other methods, not accounting for the replicate structure of the genotypes, yielded severely inflated test statistics, identifying a <italic>trans</italic> effect for the great majority of all genes. To check the impact of the population structure covariance, we also applied PANAMA without the correction for artificial genetic relatedness, yielding similarly inflated results (data not shown).</p>

        <p>We successfully applied PANAMA to additional ongoing and retrospective studies. For example, on a dataset from inbred mouse crosses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Schadt1">[23]</xref>, PANAMA identified a greater number of associations than other methods (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002330.s007">Figure S5</xref>). In contrast to the yeast dataset, the distribution of p-values on this dataset was almost uniform, suggesting that the extent of true <italic>trans</italic> regulation is lower. We also investigated parts of a dataset of the genetics of human cortical gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Myers1">[24]</xref>. On chromosome 17, methods that account for confounders identified more genes in associations than a linear model, with SVA and PANAMA retrieving the greatest number (see supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002330.s008">Figure S6</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have reported the development of PANAMA, an advanced statistical model to correct for confounding influences while preserving genuine genetic association signals. We have shown that this approach is of substantial practical use in a range of real settings and studies. The correction approach of PANAMA, for the first time, is able to not only find more <italic>cis</italic> eQTLs, but also greatly improves the statistical power to uncover true <italic>trans</italic> regulators. PANAMA finds a greater number of associations, and calls eQTLs that are more likely to be real, as validated by means of realistic simulated settings and an analysis of eQTL consistency between independent studies. Most notably, PANAMA identified several strong <italic>trans</italic> hotspots on yeast, out of which at least 40% could be reproduced on a replication dataset.</p>
      <p>There are several previous approaches to correct for confounding influences in eQTL studies. These methods can be broadly grouped into factor-based models like PCA, SVA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Leek1">[6]</xref> and PEER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Stegle1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Stegle2">[15]</xref>, and approaches that employ a mixed linear model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Kang1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Listgarten1">[16]</xref>, estimating a covariance structure that captures the confounding variation. An important reason why PANAMA performs well is the intermediate approach taken here, that is, learning a covariance structure within a linear mixed model (LMM), but at the same time retaining the low-rank constraint which yields an explicit representation of factors. Moreover, PANAMA systematically exploits the flexibility provided by the representation in terms of covariance structures, jointly accounting for genetic regulators while estimating the confounding factors. Our approach is stable and robust, avoiding the need to first subtract off the genetic contribution greedily, as for example suggested and implemented in SVA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Leek1">[6]</xref> and PEER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Stegle1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Stegle2">[15]</xref>. Although this is not the focus of this work, we have shown how our approach can be combined with additional measures to correct for observed sources of confounding variation, such as known covariates or populational relatedness. The utility of such measures has been illustrated in the joint analysis on data from two environmental conditions. A more specialized approach that is aimed at the combined correction for expression confounders and population structure has recently been proposed by Listgarten et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002330-Listgarten1">[16]</xref>. This LMM-EH approach is methodologically related to what is done here, as the contribution from multiple sources of variation are combined within a single covariance structure. Importantly, the main contribution in PANAMA is an integrated model that does not include additional confounders but true genetic regulators. Unique to PANAMA, these regulators are jointly identified and accounted for during learning of the confounding factors. Our analysis shows, that this approach yields a significant improvement in the sensitivity of recovering <italic>trans</italic> associations and plausible regulatory hotspots. A tabular overview of the relation between alternative methods is shown in Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002330.s013">Table S2</xref>.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, PANAMA is an important step towards exhaustively addressing common types of confounding variation in eQTL studies. The number of datasets that benefit from careful dissection of true genetic signals and confounders, as done here, is expected to rise quickly. Growing sample sizes and expression profiling in more than one environment allow for the estimation of more subtle confounding influences and at the same time provide the statistical power to detect many more <italic>trans</italic> effects than possible as of today.</p>

In practical applications of PANAMA, this model fitting (Equation (4)) is not carried out with the set of all genome-wide SNPs included in Equation (1), because the number of weight parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002330.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for each SNP would be prohibitive. Only those genetic regulators with strong effects on multiple genes do play a role during the estimation of hidden factors and thus need to be accounted for. Our inference scheme determines the set of relevant regulators in an iterative procedure. The number of hidden factors to be learnt, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002330.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is not set <italic>a priori</italic> and instead <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002330.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is set to a sufficiently large value.
