<p>A small molecule inhibitor of the malarial protease Plasmepsin V impairs protein export and cellular remodeling, reducing parasite survival in human erythrocytes.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>The malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> exports several hundred proteins into the infected erythrocyte that are involved in cellular remodeling and severe virulence. The export mechanism involves the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> export element (PEXEL), which is a cleavage site for the parasite protease, Plasmepsin V (PMV). The <italic>PMV</italic> gene is refractory to deletion, suggesting it is essential, but definitive proof is lacking. Here, we generated a PEXEL-mimetic inhibitor that potently blocks the activity of PMV isolated from <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic>. Assessment of PMV activity in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> revealed PEXEL cleavage occurs cotranslationaly, similar to signal peptidase. Treatment of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>âinfected erythrocytes with the inhibitor caused dose-dependent inhibition of PEXEL processing as well as protein export, including impaired display of the major virulence adhesin, PfEMP1, on the erythrocyte surface, and cytoadherence. The inhibitor killed parasites at the trophozoite stage and knockdown of PMV enhanced sensitivity to the inhibitor, while overexpression of PMV increased resistance. This provides the first direct evidence that PMV activity is essential for protein export in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. and for parasite survival in human erythrocytes and validates PMV as an antimalarial drug target.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>To survive within human red blood cells, malaria parasites must export a catalog of proteins that remodel the host cell and its surface. This enables parasites to acquire nutrients from outside the cell and to modify the cell surface in order to evade host defenses. Protein export involves proteolytic cleavage of the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> Export Element (PEXEL) by the aspartyl protease Plasmepsin V. We report here the development of a small molecule inhibitor that closely mimics the natural PEXEL substrate and blocks the activity of Plasmepsin V from the malarial parasites <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic>. The inhibitor impairs export and cellular remodeling and kills <italic>P. falciparum</italic> at the ring-trophozoite transition, providing direct evidence that Plasmepsin V activity is essential for export of PEXEL proteins and parasite survival within the host. These findings validate Plasmepsin V as a highly conserved antimalarial drug target.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Each year malaria parasites cause several hundred million infections and over 650,000 deaths <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-World1">[1]</xref>. <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> causes the most lethal malaria and is endemic in Africa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Snow1">[2]</xref>. <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> causes most malarial deaths outside Africa and is associated with liver-stage hypnozoites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Mendis1">[3]</xref>. Although chloroquine and artemisinin have been effective antimalarials, their decreasing efficacy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Dondorp1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Eastman1">[5]</xref> emphasizes the need for therapies against novel targets shared by both <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp.</p>
<p>Malaria parasites develop in erythrocytes within a parasitophorous vacuole and export over 450 proteins to the cell (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Deponte1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Boddey1">[7]</xref>). Export utilizes an N-terminal motif called the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> export element (PEXEL; RxLxE/Q/D) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Marti1">[8]</xref> or Vacuolar transport signal (VTS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Hiller1">[9]</xref>. Exported proteins are cleaved in the PEXEL after Leu (RxLâ) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Chang1">[10]</xref>, which requires the conserved Arg and Leu residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Boddey2">[11]</xref>. PEXEL cleavage is performed by the aspartyl protease Plasmepsin V (PMV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Russo1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Boddey3">[13]</xref>. PEXEL-containing proteins and PMV are conserved in all <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Marti1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Sargeant1">[14]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Klemba1">[16]</xref>. Repeated attempts to disrupt the <italic>PMV</italic> gene have failed, suggesting it is essential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Russo1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Boddey3">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Klemba1">[16]</xref>, but direct and decisive proof is still lacking. A functional survey of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> exported proteins indicated that 25% or more are essential for parasite survival in human erythrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Maier1">[17]</xref>. The current <italic>P. falciparum</italic> PEXEL exportome is predicted to be 463 proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Boddey4">[18]</xref>; thus, possibly 100 or more exported parasite proteins are required for development in erythrocytes.</p>
<p>Some exported proteins lack a PEXEL, for example, skeleton binding protein 1 (SBP1) and the major virulence adhesin family known as <italic>P. falciparum</italic> erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1). PfEMP1 is expressed on the erythrocyte surface and mediates cytoadherence to microvascular endothelia, causing severe malaria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Marti2">[19]</xref>. PfEMP1 is thought not to be cleaved by PMV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Boddey4">[18]</xref>, but its transport to, and expression on, the erythrocyte surface requires exported PEXEL and PEXEL-negative proteins (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Boddey1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Maier2">[20]</xref>).</p>
<p>Aspartyl proteases can be inhibited by transition-state isosteres in which the scissile bond is replaced by a noncleavable moiety. Examples include statine (Sta)-containing inhibitors and several are now in clinical use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Drag1">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here, we developed a transition-state inhibitor that potently blocks PMV from <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic>. The inhibitor demonstrates that PMV activity is essential for protein export, PfEMP1 surface display, cytoadherence, and parasite survival in human erythrocytes.</p>

<title>PMV Is Highly Conserved in <italic>Plasmodium</italic></title>
<p>The <italic>PMV</italic> gene is present in all <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp.; however, only the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> enzyme (PfPMV; Pf3D7_1323500) has been characterized. A multiple alignment of PfPMV with putative <italic>P. vivax</italic> PMV (PvPMV; PVX_116695) indicated that they share 82.2% similarity, 54.7% identity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001897.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Both proteins are predicted to contain a signal peptide, an aspartyl protease domain with DTG and DSG residues defining the catalytic dyad, and a C-terminal transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Due to four insertions, PfPMVHA is predicted to be approximately 7.5 kDa larger than PvPMVHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g001">Figure 1A</xref>); however, following signal peptide removal, PfPMVHA is predicted to be 8 kDa larger than PvPMVHA.</p>

<p>(A) Structure and size of PMVHA proteins used in this study. Catalytic dyad residues DTG/DSG are shown including Asp to Ala mutations* in red. TM, transmembrane domain. (B) Immunoblot of infected erythrocytes with Î±-HA antibodies shows expression of PMVHA proteins in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. Sizes indicate that the signal peptides were removed (PfPMVHA, 69.1 kDa; PvPMVHA, 60.9 kDa). (C) Immunoblotting of infected erythrocytes with rabbit Î±-PfPMV antibodies (RÎ±-PfPMV) validates they are specific for PfPMV. Endogenous PfPMV is the lower band (lanes 1, 3, 4, 5), and the larger band corresponds to 3Ã HA-tagged PfPMV (lanes 2, 4). Aldolase is a loading control in (B) and (C) and shows slight overloading of some lanes compared to others. (D, Top) Immunofluorescence micrographs show rabbit Î±-PfPMV antibodies (RÎ±-PfPMV, green) label PfPMV in the ER. Colocalizations were performed with mouse Î±-PfPMV antibodies (MÎ±-PfPMV, red), shown previously to label PMV in the ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Klemba1">[16]</xref>. (Middle) Î±-HA antibodies (red) label PfPMVHA (Top) and PvPMVHA (Bottom) in the parasite ER. (Bottom) Î±-HA antibodies (red) label PvPMVHA in the ER, as shown by clocalization with ERC (green). (E) Immunopurified PfPMVHA and PvPMVHA cleave KAHRP peptides containing the PEXEL sequence RTLAQ but not peptides containing point mutations R&gt;K, L&gt;I, or RL&gt;A. Pf and Pv PMVmutHA proteins with catalytic D&gt;A mutations did not cleave the KAHRP RTLAQ peptide. (F) Overexpression of PfPMVmutHA from episomes in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> 3D7 impairs growth relative to expression of a similar episomal construct encoding a mini PfEMP1HA reporter (miniVarHA). Parasites expressing episomes were selected on 5 nM WR99210 (WR). Two starting inocula were used in triplicate wells, and parasitaemia was determined at 72 h. *<italic>p</italic>&lt;.0001 (<italic>t</italic> test). Data are mean Â± SEM from duplicate experiments.</p>

<p>To determine whether PvPMV is an ortholog of PfPMV, we expressed it in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> fused to 3Ã hemagglutinin (HA) tags (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). As a positive control, we expressed PfPMV fused to 3Ã HA tags (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Boddey3">[13]</xref>. Expression of PfPMVHA and PvPMVHA was confirmed by immunoblot using anti-HA antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). PvPMVHA was â¼8 kDa smaller than PfPMVHA, as predicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>PfPMV was previously localized to the ER using a mouse anti-PfPMV antibody that colocalizes with BiP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Klemba1">[16]</xref> and ERC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Boddey3">[13]</xref>. To further study PMV, we developed a rabbit antibody that was specific for PfPMV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 2) and colocalizes with the ER signal from the mouse PfPMV antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, top) but does not cross-react with PvPMVHA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001897.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). Using anti-HA antibodies, a strong perinuclear signal was observed in parasites expressing PvPMVHA or PfPMVHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, middle panels, red). Both proteins colocalized with rabbit anti-PfPMV antibodies, indicating the location was the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). PvPMVHA also colocalized with ERC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, bottom), as shown previously for PfPMVHA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Boddey3">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>To investigate PvPMVHA activity, we affinity purified it, as well as the PfPMVHA control, using anti-HA agarose, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Boddey3">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Boddey4">[18]</xref>. Immunoblot with anti-HA and anti-PfPMV antibodies showed that the purified proteins were species-specific (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001897.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). The proteins were incubated with a fluorogenic peptide of nine amino acids that contained the PEXEL sequence from knob-associated histidine-rich protein (KAHRP), and efficient processing was observed by both enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Cleavage of KAHRP by PfPMVHA was previously shown to occur after Leu (RTLâ) by mass spectrometry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Boddey3">[13]</xref>, and this position was also confirmed for PvPMVHA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001897.s002">Figure S2B</xref>âE). <italic>Km</italic> values of 9.7 (Â±3.0) and 11.7 (Â±1.8) ÂµM were calculated for PvPMVHA and PfPMVHA, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001897.s002">Figure S2F</xref>). In contrast, no processing was observed when the PEXEL Arg and Leu residues were mutated to Ala (<underline>A</underline>T<underline>A</underline>AQ), consistent with the substrate specificity of PfPMV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). To verify that processing was due to HA-tagged PMV rather than other co-precipitated proteases, we expressed in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> a mutant of PvPMVHA or PfPMVHA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Boddey3">[13]</xref>, where one or both catalytic Asp residues were mutated to Ala (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g001">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Following affinity purification, the mutant enzymes were incubated with KAHRP PEXEL peptides, but no processing was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g001">Figure 1E</xref>; blue, white), confirming that the PEXEL-dependent cleavage activity observed for each protease was attributable only to HA-tagged PMV.</p>
<p>The substrate specificity of PfPMV is restricted, such that even minor changes to the PEXEL sequence markedly reduces cleavage efficiencyâthat is, Arg to Lys (R&gt;K) or Leu to Ile (L&gt;I) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Boddey4">[18]</xref>. We assessed whether PvPMVHA shares this feature. Indeed, PvPMVHA poorly cleaved peptides possessing R&gt;K or L&gt;I mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g001">Figure 1E</xref>; <underline>K</underline>TLAQ, RT<underline>I</underline>AQ). Collectively, these data show that PvPMV localizes to the ER and cleaves the PEXEL with the same restricted specificity as PfPMV.</p>
<p>While maintaining <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cultures overexpressing PfPMVmutHA, we noticed a delay in growth, suggesting a possible dominant negative phenotype, which has been reported previously with a different PfPMV catalytic mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Russo1">[12]</xref>. A flow cytometry-based growth assay revealed that parasites expressing PfPMVmutHA with WR99210 selection grew to a parasitemia 2.6-fold less than parasites expressing a similar episomal construct, encoding a mini PfEMP1 reporter fused to 3Ã HA tags (miniVarHA) with WR99210 selection (<italic>p</italic>&lt;.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). This demonstrated that overexpression of inactive enzyme conveyed a growth disadvantage, providing evidence that PMV is important for parasite survival. Analysis of PMV protein levels in parasites overexpressing the PMVHA transgenes indicated that PvPMVHA and PvPMVmutHA had no effect on endogenous PfPMV levels; however, overexpression of inactive PfPMVmutHA caused a clear decrease in expression of the endogenous enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 4, and Aldolase loading controls), indicating a negative feedback mechanism occurs in these parasites.</p>

<p>As control compounds, we synthesized analogs similar to 916 but that mimic noncleavable PEXEL mutant substrates, with the aim that they would be poor PMV inhibitors; the first replaced the P<sub>3</sub> Arg with Lys (R&gt;K; WEHI-024) and the second replaced the P<sub>1</sub> Leu with Ile (L&gt;I; WEHI-025; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). These analogs were designed on the basis that mutations of the conserved PEXEL residues R&gt;K or L&gt;I almost completely inhibit cleavage by PMV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g001">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Boddey4">[18]</xref>) and should therefore have lower affinity for PMV.</p>
<p>Each compound was incubated with PfPMVHA in the presence of KAHRP PEXEL peptides. WEHI-916 (henceforth 916) potently inhibited PEXEL cleavage by PfPMVHA with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 20 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). In contrast, WEHI-024 and WEHI-025 (henceforth 024 and 025, respectively) had weak activity (IC<sub>50</sub>&gt;100 ÂµM and 1.11 ÂµM, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). 916 inhibited PvPMVHA with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 24 nM, whereas 024 and 025 again had weak activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate potential off-target activity against human aspartyl proteases, the compounds were assessed against beta-secretase (BACE-1), for which PMV has distant relatedness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Russo1">[12]</xref>, Cathepsin D, and two human cell lines; the compounds displayed poor activity (IC<sub>50</sub>&gt;100 ÂµM for BACE-1; 25 ÂµM for Cathepsin D) and had negligible toxicity against human HEpG2 and fibroblast cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Collectively, this demonstrated that 916 potently inhibited PMV and had low off-target activity against BACE-1 and Cathepsin D, whereas the closely related analogs 024 and 025 were poorly active.</p>

<p>To understand the timing required for PMV inhibition in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, parasites were treated with 916 for 1â5 h, and cleavage was evaluated by immunoblot. No effect was seen after 1 h; however, uncleaved PfEMP3-GFP increased between 2 and 5 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), indicating 916 accessed the parasite ER slowly. Inhibition of PfEMP3-GFP cleavage by 916 was rescued following culture in inhibitor-free medium, to approximately 50% after 2 h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001897.s003">Figure S3A</xref>), indicating that cleavage inhibition was reversible or that additional active PMV was synthesized during the experiment.</p>
<p>We next assessed whether the control analogs 024 and 025, which were poor inhibitors of PMV <italic>in vitro</italic>, had an effect on PEXEL cleavage in parasites. Although a dose-dependent effect was again observed with 916, analogs 024 and 025 had no effect on PEXEL processing of PfEMP3-GFP or KAHRP-GFP, even at 50 ÂµM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). In the case of KAHRP-GFP, 916 treatment caused accumulation of both uncleaved (black arrow) and signal peptide-cleaved (red arrow) protein, which were the same size as bands observed for PEXEL R&gt;A mutant KAHRP-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, right). These bands were shown previously to be uncleaved and signal peptide-cleaved KAHRP-GFP, respectively, by mass spectrometry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Boddey2">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>As 916 treatment caused accumulation of both uncleaved and signal peptide-cleaved species of PEXEL proteins, the potential for off-target effects against signal peptidase was investigated using parasites expressing SERA5s-GFP. This protein contains a signal peptide but lacks a PEXEL and is efficiently secreted to the parasitophorous vacuole (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001897.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). 916 treatment did not impair processing of the signal peptide from SERA5s-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, see position of black arrow), indicating it cannot inhibit signal peptidase. Taken together, this shows that 916 can effectively inhibit PMV, but not signal peptidase, in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>âinfected erythrocytes and that 024 and 025 have no affect on PMV or signal peptidase activity at concentrations up to 50 ÂµM.</p>

<title>PMV Acts Cotranslationaly at the ER in <italic>P. falciparum</italic></title>
<p>The rate of PEXEL protein synthesis, ER import, and processing by PMV in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> is unknown. We evaluated these processes by radiolabeling parasite proteins in culture for 0.5â15 min before immunoprecipitating PfEMP3-GFP with anti-GFP agarose, visualizing bands by autoradiography and quantifying them by densitometry. Labeled PfEMP3-GFP became evident 1 min after addition of label to the culture medium and increased exponentially throughout the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g003">Figures 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001897.s003">S3D</xref>). Uncleaved PfEMP3-GFP (black arrow) was faint and the major species was a doublet of approximately 33 kDa (red arrow; signal peptide-cleaved) and 29 kDa (blue arrow; PEXEL-cleaved; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). This showed that signal peptidase cleaves PfEMP3 within seconds (&lt;1 min) of protein synthesis (i.e., cotranslationaly), but this molecular species may be transient, as it was not detected by immunoblot of 916-treated parasites, or in PEXEL R&gt;A mutant protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g003">Figure 3AâC</xref>). The radiolabeled bands on the <sup>35</sup>S-membrane were confirmed to be GFP-specific by immunoblot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001897.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). PEXEL-cleaved PfEMP3-GFP (blue arrow) was also evident 1 min after addition of label to the culture medium and increased exponentially, indicating PMV cleavage was also rapid and likely cotranslational (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g003">Figures 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001897.s003">S3D</xref>). The proportion of PEXEL-cleaved protein increased slightly as signal peptide-cleaved protein decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g003">Figure 3E</xref>), suggesting signal peptidase cleaves before PMV and that PMV may cleave after signal peptidase.</p>
<p>Addition of 916 to parasites for 5 h prior to radiolabeling caused accumulation of uncleaved PfEMP3-GFP in parasites (black arrow), which was evident 1â2 min postlabeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). After a total of 15 min, the degree of PMV inhibition in parasites was quantified by densitometry, and a 13-fold decrease in PEXEL cleavage was observed compared to labeling without 916 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g003">Figure 3G</xref>), indicating PMV was inhibited. The signal peptide-cleaved and PEXEL-cleaved species were only weakly detectable throughout the experiment and were not visible until 3â5 min postlabeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g003">Figure 3F</xref>), compared to a stronger signal within 1â2 min of labeling in the absence of inhibitor when the same quantity of parasites was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). This indicated that 916 significantly blocked PMV in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and caused a delay in protein synthesis, ER import, or N-terminal processing of PfEMP3-GFP.</p>
<p>Processing of uncleaved PfEMP3-GFP within the PEXEL was rescued after 15 min of culture in inhibitor-free medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001897.s003">Figure S3E</xref>,F), indicating that PMV is able to process full-length PfEMP3-GFP.</p>

Because PEXEL processing in parasites was unaffected by 024 and 025 treatment, even at 50 ÂµM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), we conclude that the analogs impart toxicity at high concentrations independent of PMV.</p>

<p>To determine the stage of the parasite lifecycle that 916 exerted its toxic effects, ring parasites were treated with 15 ÂµM 916 for increasing times through the 48 h cycle and then cultured in inhibitor-free medium to a total of 72 h to see if parasites could recover. Parasites grown in 916 for 1â20 h completely recovered and grew like DMSO-treated controls; however, treatment for &gt;23 h adversely affected growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), indicating the timing of killing began after 20 h of age, at the ring-trophozoite transition. Analogs 024 and 025 did not affect growth at any parasite stage at the concentration used (15 ÂµM), whereas chloroquine and artemisinin killed parasites when added to rings for only 30 min before addition of inhibitor-free medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, see 0 h). This indicated the controls either killed rapidly (artemisinin) or were retained inside parasites and killed later, as chloroquine is reported to kill trophozoites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-terKuile1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Fidock1">[23]</xref>. Both profiles were clearly different than that observed for 916.</p>
<p>Toxicity by 916 after the ring-trophozoite transition was then investigated by adding compound to parasites at different time points through the 48 h cycle. At 48 h, inhibitor-free medium was added and parasitemia for all conditions was determined at 72 h. Toxicity decreased when 916 was added to parasites aged beyond 24 h and schizonts were resistant, indicating 916 did not affect merozoite egress or reinvasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). As expected, the addition of 916 to rings or early trophozoites was lethal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). 024 and 025 did not have any effect on parasite growth at the concentration used, whereas all parasite stages were sensitive to chloroquine and artemisinin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>Light microscopy of parasites following treatment of early ring stages with 916 revealed a normal ring-stage morphology after 16 h; however, treatment for 32 h revealed a blockage in the ring-trophozoite transition and the majority of parasites appeared pyknotic and abnormal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). As greater than 50% of parasites could not recover from this treatment condition (refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), the majority of parasites with this appearance were dying or dead. Treatment with DMSO, 024, or 025 had no effect on development by 32 h at 15 ÂµM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). The morphology of parasites treated with 916, 024, 025, and DMSO was distinctly different from that observed for E-64âtreated parasites, which contained swollen food vacuoles from inhibition of haemoglobin breakdown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Rosenthal1">[24]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, arrow). This indicated that parasite toxicity to 916 was unlikely due to off-target inhibition of those food vacuole proteases. Collectively, the toxicity profile seen in the above experiments defines the window of parasite death as between 20 and 30 h, consistent with perturbed protein export and erythrocyte remodeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Boddey1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>To gain further insight into the effects of 916, 024, and 025 on parasites, we assessed global protein synthesis following drug treatment by radiolabeling parasite proteins. Treatment of trophozoites with inhibitor for 5 h prior to radiolabeling had no detectable effect on translation, even at 50 ÂµM concentrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001897.s004">Figure S4A</xref>), indicating the compounds are not direct inhibitors of the translation machinery. We next assessed protein synthesis following 23 h of drug treatment of ring stage parasites (aged 1â3 h old at the initiation of treatment). A minor reduction in translation was observed following 916 treatment, but not 024 or 025 treatment, even at 50 ÂµM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001897.s004">Figure S4B</xref>). A small but concomitant decrease in the cytosolic protein, Aldolase, was also evident by immunoblot following 916 treatment but not 024 or 025 treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001897.s004">Figure S4B</xref>), suggesting that parasites were beginning to die from the 916 treatment (parasites ranged from 24â26 h old at this time point). Indeed, Giemsa smears following treatment identified a small proportion of pyknotic parasites in the population (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">results</xref> not shown). Treatment with Brefeldin A, which prevents retrograde trafficking and ER exit, for 23 h severely impaired translation and parasites appeared as dying rings (i.e., had not progressed to trophozoites). It is possible that PMV inhibition by 916 treatment has a similar but weaker effect to BFA, in that it causes the accumulation of uncleaved PEXEL precursors in the ER, perturbing ER transport, and that this negatively affects translation by an ER stress response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Hetz1">[25]</xref>. An alternative possibility is that translation was decreased slightly as a result of parasites dying from 916-mediated impairment of erythrocyte remodeling. Either way, the profile for 916 was different to that seen for 024 and 025, even at 50 ÂµM, indicating the latter analogs likely kill parasites via a different mechanism to 916.</p>

<title>Knockdown or Overexpression of PMV Modulates Parasite Sensitivity to WEHI-916</title>
<p>Treatment of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> with 916 impaired PEXEL cleavage and killed parasites, strongly suggesting that PMV is essential. To investigate this phenotype further, conditional protein knockdown was attempted in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> using the RNA-degrading <italic>glmS</italic> ribozyme, which utilizes glucosamine (GlcN) as a cofactor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Prommana1">[26]</xref>. DNA encoding 3Ã HA epitopes, a stop codon, and <italic>glmS</italic> was incorporated in frame at the 3â² of the <italic>PMV</italic> locus by homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001897.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). Correct genomic integration was confirmed by immunoblot with anti-HA and anti-PfPMV antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). To activate <italic>glmS</italic>, GlcN was titrated into the culture medium of trophozoites. From 75% to 90% PMV knockdown was achieved after 48 h using 4â6 mM GlcN, but higher concentrations adversely affected parasite HSP70 levels and were subsequently avoided (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001897.s005">Figure S5B</xref>). Addition of 5 mM GlcN to trophozoites for 24 h reduced PMV levels in subsequent rings by approximately 80% and trophozoites by â¼90% but caused little knockdown in parasites expressing inactive <italic>glmS</italic> (M9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Prommana1">[26]</xref>.

(B) Knockdown of PMV in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> NF54 following 5 mM GlcN treatment. (Left) 0 h GlcN treatment of trophozoites causes no knockdown. (Center) The 24 h GlcN treatment of trophozoites causes â¼80% knockdown of PMV in subsequent rings compared to ââGlcN.â (Right) 48 h GlcN treatment of trophozoites causes â¼90% knockdown of PMV in subsequent trophozoites compared to ââGlcN.â A small degree of knockdown is seen for M9, indicating GlcN has a minor effect. (C) PMV knockdown by GlcN has no significant effect on parasite growth rate (<italic>p</italic>â=â.6250). Trophozoites were treated with 0 mM or 5 mM GlcN and parasitaemia determined 48 h later by flow cytometry. Data are % growth â+GlcNâ relative to ââGlcN,â and data are mean Â±SEM of a representative of duplicate experiments. (D) PEXEL processing of PfEMP3-GFP in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites expressing PMVHA-<italic>glmS</italic> is reduced more by 916 treatment when PMV is knocked down [+GlcN (5 mM for 48 h prior to addition of 916)]. Densitometry shows the ratio of uncleaved to PEXEL-cleaved protein in each lane beneath the blot. Note that PfEMP3-GFP expression is lower in â+GlcNâ parasites despite relatively similar HSP70 levels. (E) Dose-response curves of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> expressing PMVHA-<italic>glmS</italic> shows parasites have enhanced sensitivity to 916 following PMV knockdown (3.3-fold decrease in EC<sub>50</sub>). Parasitemia was determined 72 h after addition of 916 to ring parasites with or without PMV knockdown (knockdown ring parasites were obtained by adding 6 mM GlcN to trophozoites for 24 h). GlcN and 916 were maintained in the culture medium throughout. (F) Dose-response curves of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> overexpressing PvPMVHA or a mini PfEMP1HA reporter (miniVarHA) in the presence of 5 nM WR99210 show parasites have increased resistance to 916 when PMV is overexpressed (1.9-fold increase in EC<sub>50</sub>).</p>

<p>As 916 inhibited PMV in parasites (for example, by 13-fold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g003">Figure 3G</xref>), the additive effect of PMV knockdown plus 916 treatment was investigated. Parasites expressing PMVHA-<italic>glmS</italic> were transfected with a construct encoding PfEMP3-GFP, and PEXEL processing was assessed by immunoblot. PEXEL processing of PfEMP3-GFP was barely affected by 48 h of PMV knockdown alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g005">Figure 5D</xref>, see â+GlcN,â 0 ÂµM 916); however, addition of 916 to parasites for 5 h impaired PEXEL cleavage and this was significantly enhanced following knockdown of PMV (e.g., by 50% at 20 ÂµM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). The quantity of PfEMP3-GFP expressed in the PMV knockdown (+GlcN) appeared slightly less than in parasites without knockdown (âGlcN), whereas the loading control HSP70 did not vary appreciably between conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g005">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>Parasites expressing PMVHA-<italic>glmS</italic> were next assessed for toxicity to 916. The EC<sub>50</sub> of 916 was reduced by 3.3-fold following PMV knockdown compared to no knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). As a control, parasites expressing PMVHA-M9 were treated with 916 in the presence or absence of GlcN; the EC<sub>50</sub> reduced by 1.4-fold in the presence of GlcN, indicating it had a minor effect. However, the enhancement of PEXEL cleavage inhibition and 3.3-fold sensitization of parasites to inhibitor following knockdown indicated that PMV is a direct target of 916 and that PMV inhibition is lethal to parasites.</p>
<p>We next investigated the possible effects of PMV overexpression on parasite sensitivity to 916. Although parasites expressing PfPMVHA do not overexpress enzyme, due to integration of the construct at the endogenous <italic>PMV</italic> locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Boddey3">[13]</xref>, parasites expressing PvPMVHA from episomes also express wild-type levels of endogenous enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g001">Figure 1B,C</xref>) and therefore contain additional, active PMV in the ER. To control for the carriage of episomes and selection on WR99210, sensitivity to 916 was compared between parasites overexpressing a similar construct on episomes on WR99210 selection (encoding miniVarHA; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). The EC<sub>50</sub> of 916 was 1.9-fold greater for parasites overexpressing PvPMVHA compared to parasites overexpressing the control construct, and 1.4-fold greater than wild-type 3D7 parasites without WR99210 selection, indicating that PMV overexpression had increased parasite resistance to 916 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g005">Figure 5F</xref>).</p>

<title>PMV Inhibition Impairs Protein Export, PfEMP1 Display, and Cytoadherence</title>
<p>Localization of parasite proteins in Maurer's clefts (MCs), which are parasite-induced membranous structures in the erythrocyte that facilitate protein trafficking, enables accurate quantification of export by immunofluorescence microscopy as the signal is concentrated in puncta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Tilley1">[27]</xref>.

<p>The effect of 916 treatment on export in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>âinfected erythrocytes was then examined. Early ring parasites were treated with inhibitor, and the subcellular Hyp8-GFP fluorescence was quantified by immunofluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). 916 treatment caused a dose-dependent decrease of Hyp8-GFP in MCs (the GFP signal in puncta outside the EXP2-labelled parasitophorous vacuole membrane) compared to DMSO and 024 treatment (<italic>p</italic>&lt;.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). A small but significant increase in nonexported GFP signal (the signal inside the EXP2 labeling) was observed as puncta of fluorescence internal to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane following 916 treatment (<italic>p</italic>&lt;.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g006">Figure 6D</xref>, see also arrows in B).</p>
<p>We next examined whether 916 treatment affected protein secretion in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>âinfected erythrocytes by measuring the quantity of EXP2 signal at the parasitophorous vacuole membrane following treatment. There was no statistical difference in EXP2 signal between treatments (<italic>p</italic>â=â.0977; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g006">Figure 6E</xref>), indicating 916 specifically affected export but not secretion, under the conditions used.</p>
<p>As Hyp8 localizes to MCs, we quantified the number of GFP-positive MCs in infected cells following the drug treatments. The mean number of clefts was significantly reduced by 916 treatment, by up to 39%, compared to DMSO (<italic>p</italic>&lt;.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g006">Figure 6F</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrated that 916 dramatically reduced the export of the PEXEL protein, Hyp8, and that MC development was impaired following treatment.</p>
<p>An important function of exported proteins in remodeling and virulence is to assemble the cytoadherence complex at the erythrocyte surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Maier1">[17]</xref>. Because export of Hyp8 and MC formation was decreased following PMV inhibition, we investigated whether trafficking of PfEMP1 was also affected by quantifying its display on the surface of infected erythrocytes. Ring-stage CS2-GFP parasites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Wilson1">[29]</xref> selected for expression of the PfEMP1 <italic>var2csa</italic> gene were treated with one of two sublethal doses of 916 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001897.s007">Figure S7A</xref>), and surface-expressed PfEMP1 was measured 24 h postinvasion using PAM1.4 antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Barfod1">[30]</xref> that specifically recognize VAR2CSA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Barfod2">[31]</xref> by flow cytometry. PfEMP1 surface expression decreased in a dose-dependent manner, by up to 55%, following 916 treatment, but addition of DMSO and 025 had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g006">Figure 6G</xref>). Parasitemia across all treatment conditions was measured as GFP fluorescence by flow cytometry and was approximately equal at 24 h, confirming parasite viability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001897.s007">Figure S7B</xref>).</p>
<p>To evaluate whether decreased PfEMP1 surface expression affected cytoadherence of infected erythrocytes, static binding assays with purified CSA were performed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Rogerson1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Reeder1">[33]</xref>. Adhesion to CSA was reduced by almost 50% following treatment with 916 compared to DMSO (<italic>p</italic>&lt;.0001) and 025 had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g006">Figure 6H</xref>). Collectively, this experimentally validates PMV activity as essential for export of PEXEL-containing proteins, resulting in correct MC formation and PfEMP1 assembly at the erythrocyte surface and cytoadherence.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Protein export allows malaria parasites to remodel their cellular niche, and the protein machineries involved are obvious targets for the development of inhibitors. PMV acts by cleaving the PEXEL in the parasite ER and represents one such target. We developed a PEXEL-mimetic compound that potently inhibits the activity of PMV and, combined with protein knockdown or overexpression, used it to demonstrate the essentiality of PMV for parasite survival and its function for export.</p>
<p>The PMV inhibitor 916 mimics the transition-state of amide bond proteolysis for PEXEL substrates using statine. Our PfPMV structural model in complex with 916 outlines key interactions that are likely necessary for inhibitor binding: the guanidine side chain of Arg forms salt bridges with the acid of Glu179 and 215, and a Ï-stacking interaction with Tyr177 in the S<sub>3</sub> pocket of PMV. This in part explains the necessity for Arg at P<sub>3</sub> for PEXEL processing. The P<sub>1</sub> Leu side chain is encased by hydrophobic residues in the S<sub>1</sub> pocket formed in part by Ile116, Tyr177, and Val227, explaining the importance of Leu in PMV binding.</p>
<p>916 potently blocked PMV activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and reduced PEXEL cleavage, by up to 13-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001897-g003">Figure 3G</xref>), in cultured parasites, demonstrating the inhibitor directly engaged PMV in the ER. However, inhibition was time-dependent and incomplete at even 50 ÂµM, indicating the inhibitor has suboptimal qualities. This may be due to a combination of poor diffusion across membranes, suboptimal final concentration in the ER, and the potent activity of PMV in parasites, revealed in this study by knockdown of PMV protein levels. Although further work is required to develop an inhibitor with enhanced properties, 916 has proven sufficiently active in parasites to examine PMV function and essentiality.</p>
<p>Previously, it has been shown that overexpression of a PfPMV D118A mutant produced a dominant-negative effect on parasite growth rate and protein export <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Russo1">[12]</xref>. When we overexpressed an alternate PfPMV mutant (D118A, D365A, F370A) on episomes in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, we observed a similar defect in parasite growth rate and subsequent down-regulation of endogenous PfPMV expression levels, suggesting a negative feedback effect. A similar negative feedback effect has been described for <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> myosin A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Meissner1">[34]</xref>. Collectively, these PMV dominant-negative mutants provide evidence that the enzyme is important for parasite survival.</p>
<p>The effects of 916 were amplified when PMV was knocked down and decreased when PMV was overexpressed, demonstrating that PMV is a target and that its inhibition is toxic to parasites. Addition of 916 to ring stages arrested their transition to trophozoites, between 20 and 30 h postinvasion, and parasites could not recover. Although this phenotype is consistent with death from impaired export and cellular remodeling, it is possible that ER stress due to accumulation of uncleaved PEXEL proteins in the organelle, and a decrease in translation, contributed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Hetz1">[25]</xref>. The morphology of parasites treated with 916 was distinctly different to E-64âtreated parasites, which contained swollen food vacuoles from inhibition of haemoglobin breakdown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Rosenthal1">[24]</xref>. This indicates that parasite toxicity to 916 was unlikely due to off-target effects on food vacuole proteases. Although aspartyl protease inhibitors are known to kill <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, it is not entirely clear which aspartyl proteases (Plasmepsins) are essential (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Coombs1">[35]</xref>). In <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, there are 10 Plasmepsins; IâIV are important enzymes for haemoglobin degradation by <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, but the genes encoding each enzyme can be deleted from the genome, indicating they are not essential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Bonilla1">[36]</xref>. The death of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> following 916 treatment is therefore unlikely to be due to inhibition of these Plasmepsins. A survey of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> transcriptomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-LopezBarragan1">[37]</xref> suggests that, of the remaining five Plasmepsins (VIâX), only VII, IX, and X are expressed by asexual blood-stage parasites; however, VII and X are expressed at very low levels. Thus, Plasmepsin IX (PMIX) is considered the primary possible off-target in our study. However, we have shown previously that HA-tagged PMIX does not cleave the PEXEL motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Boddey3">[13]</xref>, and although the enzyme itself possesses a PEXEL motif, its function and essentiality is currently unknown.</p>
<p>Analogs of 916 that mimic noncleavable PEXEL mutant sequences (R&gt;K, L&gt;I) were ineffective inhibitors of PMV <italic>in vitro</italic> and had no discernable effect on parasites at concentrations that 916 inhibited PEXEL cleavage in parasites and was lethal (i.e., &lt;20 ÂµM). However, at concentrations above 20 ÂµM they were toxic to parasites and possessed EC<sub>50</sub> values between 6- and 26-fold less potent than 916. At 50 ÂµM, we saw no evidence of PMV or signal peptidase inhibition, export or secretion defects, or global effects on translation caused by 024 or 025. This suggests that they hit a target(s) distinct from 916.</p>
<p>The rapid rate of protein synthesis, ER import, signal peptide processing, and PEXEL cleavage in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> was determined for the first time. The rate was within immeasurable seconds after translation, consistent with both signal peptidase and PMV activity occurring cotranslationaly. The full-length PEXEL is thus only present in the proprotein very transiently, making its function in export even more remarkable. This underscores the importance of the remaining PEXEL residues (xE/Q/D) in export following processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Boddey2">[11]</xref>. The PEXEL has been suggested to function independent of PMV by binding PI3P in the ER, and ER-derived transport vesicles, via the PEXEL Arg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Bhattacharjee1">[38]</xref>. The rate at which PEXEL processing occurred in our experiments is inconsistent with this hypothesis, as the PEXEL Arg is cleaved off during, or soon after, ER entry. It is also challenging to envisage how the PEXEL Arg could dock within the S<sub>3</sub> pocket of PMV, where it is required for proteolytic cleavage, if it is bound to the ER membrane via an interaction with PI3P.</p>
<p>This work has characterized a novel PEXEL protein, Hyp8, which is exported in the early ring-stage to MCs. The function of Hyp8 is unknown, but the <italic>hyp8</italic> gene was refractory to deletion and may be essential. 916 treatment dramatically impaired Hyp8 export, resulting in some accumulation in the parasite and possibly degradation. It is unknown whether the reduced export of Hyp8 directly contributed to parasite death; however, the phenotype demonstrates the importance of PMV in export of PEXEL-containing cargo. This is further supported by the decrease in MC numbers observed following 916 treatment; MC formation is known to require exported proteins (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Maier2">[20]</xref>). The secretion of EXP2 to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane was unaltered by 916 treatment, demonstrating that the effects of 916 were specific to export. A clear defect in PfEMP1 surface exposure and cytoadherence was also observed following 916 treatment. PfEMP1 is unlikely to be a PMV substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Boddey4">[18]</xref>, but its trafficking through the erythrocyte and onto the surface requires at least six PEXEL-containing proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Maier1">[17]</xref>; thus, the demonstration that PMV activity is essential for PfEMP1 surface expression and cytoadherence is consistent with the current literature and validates the specificity of the inhibitor. Further, it directly demonstrates the importance of PMV at the first step in the export pathway for cellular remodeling that leads to virulence.</p>
<p><italic>P. vivax</italic> is an important global pathogen that cannot be cultured in the laboratory, and novel therapeutic targets for this enigmatic parasite are urgently needed. This work has characterized PMV from <italic>P. vivax</italic> for the first time. PvPMVHA possesses the trafficking information to localize to the ER and has similar PEXEL cleavage activity and specificity to PfPMV. This indicates that PMV function is to cleave the PEXEL motif of exported proteins across <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp., and future compounds that block PMV are likely to affect multiple <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. Protein export also occurs in gametocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Silvestrini1">[28]</xref> and liver stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Singh1">[39]</xref>, and 916 may aid the characterization of PMV in these stages.</p>
<p>A putative PMV homolog, ASP5, is present in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and localizes to the Golgi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Shea1">[40]</xref>. Recent evidence suggests that some exported <italic>T. gondii</italic> proteins contain a PEXEL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Bougdour1">[41]</xref>, and some are cleaved in a manner that requires the conserved PEXEL residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001897-Hsiao1">[42]</xref>. The PEXEL protease may therefore be conserved beyond the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> genus, and PMV and its homologs may therefore represent multistage, multispecies antiparasitic targets of the future.</p>

A slight reduction in translation is seen with 916 treatment, and immunoblotting revealed that Aldolase levels were also reduced following 916 treatment, suggesting either that accumulation of uncleaved PEXEL precursors in the ER has a negative effect on translation or that a proportion of parasites were beginning to die or both. BFA treatment, which halts retrograde transport and ER exit, severely reduced translation in parasites and Aldolase levels, suggesting negative feedback on protein synthesis occurs in parasites with blocked ER transport. The effect of 916 was clearly different to that of 024 and 025, suggesting the latter impart toxicity independent of PMV at concentrations &gt;20 ÂµM.</p>

(B) Measurement of surface-exposed PfEMP1 on erythrocytes infected with CS2-GFP parasites by flow cytometry using monoclonal human PAM1.4 serum (specific for VAR2CSA). In each plot, the lower left gate corresponds to GFP-negative (uninfected) erythrocytes. The upper left gate corresponds to GFP-positive, surface PfEMP1-negative erythrocytes. The upper right gate corresponds to GFP-positive, surface PfEMP1-positive erythrocytes. Using all GFP-positive cells (upper left and right gates) the geometric mean fluorescence of PAM1.4-labelled cells (channel FL4) was quantified (i.e., the gradient of surface PfEMP1 positivity) from a total input of &gt;100,000 infected and uninfected cells per condition. Parasitemia corresponds to all GFP-positive cells. Plot of uninfected erythrocytes is also shown. Upper panels (âWith PAM4.1â) contain cells labeled with primary, secondary, and tertiary antibodies, while lower panels (âWithout PAM4.1â) contain cells labeled with secondary and tertiary antibodies only, to show specificity.</p>
