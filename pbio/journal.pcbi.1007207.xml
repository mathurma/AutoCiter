<abstract>
<p>Antibodies developed for research and clinical applications may exhibit suboptimal stability, expressibility, or affinity. Existing optimization strategies focus on surface mutations, whereas natural affinity maturation also introduces mutations in the antibody core, simultaneously improving stability and affinity. To systematically map the mutational tolerance of an antibody variable fragment (Fv), we performed yeast display and applied deep mutational scanning to an anti-lysozyme antibody and found that many of the affinity-enhancing mutations clustered at the variable light-heavy chain interface, within the antibody core. Rosetta design combined enhancing mutations, yielding a variant with tenfold higher affinity and substantially improved stability. To make this approach broadly accessible, we developed AbLIFT, an automated web server that designs multipoint core mutations to improve contacts between specific Fv light and heavy chains (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ablift.weizmann.ac.il/" xlink:type="simple">http://AbLIFT.weizmann.ac.il</ext-link>). We applied AbLIFT to two unrelated antibodies targeting the human antigens VEGF and QSOX1. Strikingly, the designs improved stability, affinity, and expression yields. The results provide proof-of-principle for bypassing laborious cycles of antibody engineering through automated computational affinity and stability design.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Antibodies are highly important in research, biotechnology, and medical applications. Despite their great utility, however, many antibodies exhibit suboptimal stability and affinity, raising production costs and limiting their practical usefulness. To tackle this general limitation, we used deep mutational scanning to characterize the effects of mutations in an antibody variable fragment on its antigen-binding affinity. Surprisingly, many of the affinity-enhancing mutations clustered at the variable light-heavy chain interface. We, therefore, developed an automated method, called AbLIFT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ablift.weizmann.ac.il/" xlink:type="simple">http://AbLIFT.weizmann.ac.il</ext-link>) to optimize this interface through design. Two unrelated antibodies were tested and showed improvements in expression levels, stability, and antigen-binding affinity. Since AbLIFT requires testing of only a few dozen specific designs, it may dramatically accelerate the development of promising antibodies into useful research and clinical tools.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>High-affinity natural antibodies are generated through an iterative process of mutation and selection for antigen binding known as affinity maturation. Affinity maturation also selects antibodies that exhibit higher stability and expressibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref001">1</xref>], both of which are essential parameters in the development of antibodies into research or medical tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref002">2</xref>]. In recent decades, synthetic antibody repertoires have been widely adopted in antibody discovery and optimization, providing greater control over the selection process than animal immunization. In this approach, a library of antibody variable fragments (Fv) is displayed, for instance on yeast cells, and screened to select high-affinity binders or to improve the affinity of existing antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref003">3</xref>]. These methods are powerful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref005">5</xref>], but a large fraction of high-affinity antibodies isolated from synthetic repertoires exhibits impaired stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref006">6</xref>]. Impaired stability can limit expression yields and increase aggregation propensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref007">7</xref>], resulting in high production costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref008">8</xref>], fast antibody clearance from circulation and adverse immune responses in patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref009">9</xref>]. Thus, the tradeoff between antibody stability (including solubility and expressibility) and affinity can delay and even block the development of antibodies in research and medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref010">10</xref>]. General methods to improve antibody stability while maintaining or even increasing affinity are therefore urgently needed to reduce the attrition rate in antibody development pipelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>To boost antibody stability and affinity, computational design methods have been developed. These have focused on the Fv complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), which are typically in direct contact with the antigen. Some methods, for instance, improved electrostatic complementarity with the antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref012">12</xref>] or eliminated hydrophobic surface patches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref018">18</xref>]. Natural and laboratory affinity maturation, by contrast, introduce mutations in both the CDRs and the antibody core [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref005">5</xref>]. Core mutations may improve antibody stability by eliminating packing defects, and they may enhance affinity by preorganizing the antigen-binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref001">1</xref>]. Although mutations in the core may contribute less to affinity than ones in the CDRs, they are more likely to retain the intricate structure of the antigen-binding site and are therefore likely to be compatible with affinity-enhancing mutations in the CDRs that were obtained through other optimization strategies. The antibody core, however, is a large and densely packed region, complicating the design of improved variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref019">19</xref>]. For instance, we recently presented and validated an automated computational strategy, called PROSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref020">20</xref>], for protein-stability design. Similar to other stability design algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref021">21</xref>], however, PROSS only rarely introduces core mutations and does not improve binding affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref022">22</xref>]. Reliable prediction of mutational effects in the antibody core and especially successful design of networks of interacting multipoint core mutations has, therefore, remained a challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Recently, deep mutational scanning has been successfully applied to study the mutational tolerance of antibodies and other binders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref030">30</xref>]. In this approach, amino acid positions in the binder are systematically mutated to all of the natural amino acid identities; the mutants are pooled into one library containing all single-point mutations; populations of binders are selected from this library using <italic>in vitro</italic> display and high-throughput screening; and the selected and unselected populations are subjected to deep-sequencing analysis to infer which mutations are enriched relative to the starting binder, thus systematically identifying affinity-enhancing mutations. Deep mutational scanning has been very successfully used to guide protein design and engineering of improved binders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref032">32</xref>] but has not yet been exploited to improve protein-design methodology itself. The large improvements in the reliability and breadth of detection of affinity-enhancing mutations through deep mutational scanning inspired us to revisit the challenge of accurately predicting the effects of core mutations on antibody affinity and stability. Deep mutational scanning guided us in uncovering a cluster of core positions at the light-heavy chain (vL-vH) interface where many affinity-enhancing mutations occurred. We then used these systematic data to establish general rules for computational design of antibody Fvs with improved vL-vH interactions; we implemented these rules as an automated method, called AbLIFT and made it available through a web server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ablift.weizmann.ac.il/" xlink:type="simple">http://AbLIFT.weizmann.ac.il</ext-link>). AbLIFT designs exhibited striking gains in affinity, stability, and expressibility in two unrelated antibodies that target the human disease markers Vascular-Epidermal Growth Factor (VEGF) and the enzyme Quiescin Sulfhydryl Oxidase 1 (QSOX1).</p>

<title>A cluster of affinity-enhancing mutations at the vL-vH interface</title>
<p>To study the mutational tolerance of an antibody Fv, we selected 135 positions in the anti-lysozyme antibody D44.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref033">33</xref>] for deep mutational scanning (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007207.s001">S1A Fig</xref></bold>). The positions encompassed most of the CDRs, the vL-vH interface and additional peripheral positions (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007207.g001">Fig 1A</xref></bold>). D44.1 and each point mutant were genetically encoded as single-chain variable fragments (scFv) in which the heavy chain was fused to the light chain via a flexible linker, and the genes were transformed into yeast cells for binding and expression screens by yeast display [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref003">3</xref>]. Following incubation with hen egg-white lysozyme, the top 15% binders were selected from this library, and the same library was also subjected to low-stringency selection for expression levels to provide a baseline. The plasmids containing scFv-encoding genes from both selections were purified, amplified by PCR, and subjected to deep sequencing, resulting in 8 million high-quality reads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref032">32</xref>]. We then determined the enrichment of each mutant relative to D44.1 as the ratio between populations selected for binding and expression (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007207.g001">Fig 1B</xref></bold>).</p>

The variants were transformed into yeast cells, subjected to low-stringency selection for binding (green spots) and for expression (purple + green spots), and then to deep-sequencing analysis.

<p>We found affinity-enhancing mutations at 34 positions, mostly within the CDRs, as expected (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007207.g001">Fig 1C</xref></bold>). We also noticed a surprisingly large cluster of eight positions at the vL-vH interface where affinity-enhancing mutations occurred, although they were not in direct contact with the antigen (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007207.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref></bold>). This cluster of affinity-enhancing mutations in the vL-vH interface is intriguing for four reasons: (1) the vL-vH interface mediates the assembly of the Fv from the two antibody chains, and mutations in this region have the potential to also enhance stability through improved Fv assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref001">1</xref>]; (2) the genetic pairing of light and heavy chains during germline antibody generation is a random process which may result in suboptimal vL-vH interfaces, flexibility in the antigen-binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref034">34</xref>], and therefore in lower antigen affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref035">35</xref>]; (3) this region is distant from the mutational hotspots in the CDRs and may not be fully optimized in the course of natural affinity maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref036">36</xref>]; and (4) antibody-engineering procedures, such as humanization or CDR grafting may inadvertently compromise the structural integrity of this region by mispairing CDRs and frameworks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref037">37</xref>]. Based on these considerations, we hypothesized that the vL-vH interface may be especially amenable to the design of multipoint mutants that simultaneously improve stability and affinity in both natural and engineered antibodies.</p>
<p>Combining mutations in densely packed protein cores, such as the vL-vH interface, is challenging, however, because inadvertently introduced voids, steric overlaps, or mispaired polar amino acid side-chains can lead to protein instability, misfolding, and aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref023">23</xref>]. We, therefore, asked whether the mutational-tolerance map could guide Rosetta design in finding improved multipoint mutants at the vL-vH interface. In preliminary calculations starting from the lysozyme-bound D44.1 structure (PDB entry: 1MLC), we restricted Rosetta combinatorial design to the eight positions and 38 identities (including the wild type identities) at these positions that showed at least threefold enrichment relative to D44.1 according to the mutational-tolerance map (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007207.g001">Fig 1B and 1E</xref></bold>). The resulting design, however, comprised only three conservative mutations, suggesting that the dense packing and backbone rigidity at the vL-vH interface restricted sequence optimization. We, therefore, repeated design calculations but this time excluded the wild type identities at the eight positions, forcing the design of an optimal combination of mutations only from those that were substantially enriched in deep mutational scanning. We iterated sequence design and backbone and sidechain minimization to promote the acceptance of even radical mutations yielding design D44.1<sup>des</sup> with eight mutations. As a preliminary qualitative test, we analyzed D44.1<sup>des</sup> binding to lysozyme and to seven of the eight single-point mutations formatted as scFvs using yeast display [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref003">3</xref>]. As expected, each of the point mutations improved the apparent binding affinity relative to D44.1; and yet, the multipoint D44.1<sup>des</sup> exhibited a substantial improvement in apparent affinity compared to the single-point mutations (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007207.s001">S1B Fig</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>To determine what molecular factors might underlie higher affinity in D44.1<sup>des</sup>, we expressed the design as an antigen-binding fragment (Fab) and determined its structure by X-ray crystallography in the absence of lysozyme (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007207.s007">S1 Table</xref></bold>). Despite eight core mutations, the overall agreement between D44.1<sup>des</sup> and the bound structure of D44.1, which served as the starting point for designing D44.1<sup>des</sup>, was excellent (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007207.s002">S2 Fig</xref></bold>): The two structures deviated by &lt;1 Å backbone root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) and in side-chain residues comprising the lysozyme-binding site. The mutations apparently improved various molecular aspects of the vL-vH interface including interface packing, solvation, and backbone rigidity (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007207.g002">Fig 2A</xref></bold>). Next, we tested lysozyme binding by D44.1 and D44.1<sup>des</sup> (both expressed and purified as Fab) using surface-plasmon resonance (SPR). D44.1<sup>des</sup> exhibited nearly tenfold improvement in affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub> of 15 versus 135 nM for D44.1<sup>des</sup> and D44.1, respectively), with a 25-fold slower off-rate (8 * 10<sup>−4</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007207.g002">Fig 2B</xref></bold>). D44.1<sup>des</sup> also exhibited improved thermal denaturation and aggregation resistance (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007207.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>We also compared the molecular structure of D44.1<sup>des</sup> to the unbound structure of D44.1 (PDB entry: 1MLB). The main difference between the two structures was localized to the backbone conformation of CDR H2: Whereas H2 in the unbound structure of D44.1 adopts a conformation that would sterically overlap with lysozyme in the bound structure, the H2 backbone of D44.1<sup>des</sup> moves away from this position such that, even in the unbound state, the design is sterically compatible with lysozyme binding. The H2 backbone conformation of D44.1<sup>des</sup> is not identical but is similar to the H2 conformation in the bound D44.1 structure and also to the conformation observed in the unbound structure of the high-affinity anti-lysozyme antibody F10.6.6 (PDB entry: 1P2C) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007207.g002">Fig 2E</xref></bold>). Although it is possible that the observed conformational differences among the structures are due to differences in crystallographic conditions, we note that the mutation Trp47<sup>H</sup>Tyr in D44.1<sup>des</sup> is incompatible with the observed H2 conformation in the unbound state of D44.1 and may induce the observed change in the design’s backbone conformation. Hence, the structure-based analysis suggested that the design of the vL-vH interface based on the bound antibody structure might increase the compatibility of the CDR backbones for the ligand while simultaneously improving stability.</p>

<title>Computational mutation-tolerance mapping</title>
<p>The successful optimization of antibody affinity and stability encouraged us to fully automate the design procedure, eliminating the requirement for experimental deep mutational scanning. We, therefore, sought a general computational strategy that would predict which mutations in the vL-vH interface were likely to enhance affinity and stability, with the goal of developing a general computational procedure for mutational-tolerance mapping. To achieve this goal, we exploited the large experimental dataset of the D44.1 mutational tolerance map, comprising 2,294 point mutations, for training. At each of the mutated D44.1 Fv positions, we used Rosetta to compute the changes to native-state energy due to each of the 19 amino acid mutations (ΔΔ<italic>G</italic>). Using a multiple-sequence alignment of homologous Fvs, we additionally computed each point mutation’s evolutionary-conservation score, as represented in a Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref038">38</xref>]. These two computed parameters provide complementary predictions of mutational tolerance: the former predicts the impact of a mutation on native-state stability and the latter discriminates between evolutionarily tolerated mutations and those that have been purged by evolution. The use of these two parameters has recently led to substantial improvement in design accuracy in binder and enzyme design challenges in our laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref038">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref043">43</xref>]. We specifically used these two parameters because they can be computed for any antibody given an accurate experimental or model structure, allowing us, in principle, to compute mutational tolerance maps for any antibody Fv.</p>
<p>We systematically screened different combinations of ΔΔ<italic>G</italic> and PSSM thresholds to determine which combination optimally discriminates enhancing from deleterious mutations as observed in the experimental mutational-tolerance map of D44.1. We defined the prediction true-positive rate (TPR) as the proportion of correctly predicted affinity-enhancing mutations (&gt;1.5-fold enrichment according to deep mutational scanning) and the true-negative rate (TNR) as the proportion of correctly predicted deleterious ones (enrichment ratio &lt;1). The resulting phase space of (PSSM, ΔΔ<italic>G</italic>) thresholds revealed an expected tradeoff, wherein high TNR came at the cost of low TPR, and <italic>vice versa</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007207.g003">Fig 3A</xref></bold>). The likelihood of obtaining a multipoint mutant without a single deleterious mutation can be roughly approximated by TNR<sup><italic>n</italic></sup>, where <italic>n</italic> is the number of mutations. Given the large size of the vL-vH interface (20–30 positions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref044">44</xref>]), we aimed for a large maximum number of mutations in each multipoint mutant (<italic>n</italic> = 10) and therefore selected a stringent cutoff TNR = 94%, providing a rough estimate that 50% of designs with ten mutations would not contain a single deleterious mutation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007207.g003">Fig 3B</xref></bold>). At this high TNR, the TPR is only 40%, reflecting the challenging tradeoff in the design of multipoint variants. We anticipate that in certain applications, such as in the design of improved antibodies for therapeutic application, a smaller number of mutations may be preferred. In such cases, a lower TNR and therefore a higher TPR may be implemented, and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007207.g003">Fig 3C</xref></bold> provides a guide for choosing different (PSSM, ΔΔ<italic>G</italic>) thresholds. Instructions for computing a mutation-tolerance map based on any structure of an antibody Fv are available as Supplemental Data, and the AbLIFT web server enables user control of these parameters.</p>

<title>Automated affinity and stability design in the vL-vH interface</title>
<p>We next sought to develop a general and fully automated design protocol for improving molecular interactions across the vL-vH interface. AbLIFT starts by computing a mutational-tolerance map at the vL-vH interface using the approach described above; it then exhaustively enumerates the multipoint combinations of tolerated mutations; ranks them by energy, and selects low-energy variants for experimental testing. This algorithm resembles our recently described FuncLib method for designing functionally diverse enzyme repertoires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref041">41</xref>], with the key differences that AbLIFT is applied to the core of obligatory binding surfaces rather than to solvent-exposed surfaces and most importantly, AbLIFT does not require an initial design round of protein stabilization.</p>
<p>To validate AbLIFT, we chose two antibodies as subjects for design: the synthetic antibody G6, which targets human Vascular-Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref045">45</xref>], and an engineered variant of the 492.1 antibody, designated h492.1, which targets human Quiescin Sulfhydryl Oxidase 1 (QSOX1). QSOX1 is a multi-domain disulfide-catalyst that is overproduced in tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref046">46</xref>] and is a potential drug target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref048">48</xref>]. These antibodies are unrelated to D44.1 or to one another and are the products of protein engineering. G6 is widely used in animal studies and resulted from a phage-displayed synthetic Fab library of the light chain with a heavy chain sequence of an anti-mVEGF antibody (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub> approximately 1 nM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref049">49</xref>]. The h492.1 antibody was obtained by fusing the variable domains from the high-affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub> approximately 1 nM) QSOX1-inhibiting murine antibody 492.1 onto a human IgG scaffold. Following this fusion, h492.1 could not be expressed to detectable levels in a recombinant cultured human cell system, frustrating its further development. Thus, with these two targets, we sought to test the ability of AbLIFT to optimize high-affinity antibodies that resulted from conventional antibody-engineering procedures, whether well-behaved ones (G6) or ones that showed low (or no) detectable expression levels (h492.1).</p>
<p>The computed mutational-tolerance map of G6 (starting from its bound structure, PDB entry 2FJG) at 30 vL-vH interface positions defined 26 affinity-enhancing mutations at 11 positions. To achieve significant improvement of vL-vH interface packing, we sought to design multipoint mutants with 4–10 mutations relative to G6, resulting in a tolerated sequence space of 203,835 unique multipoint mutants. All multipoint mutants were modeled in Rosetta, including by a backbone and side-chain minimization step, which is essential for enabling cavity-filling small-to-large mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref051">51</xref>], and the models were then ranked by energy. 53% of the mutants (&gt;100,000) exhibited energies as favorable as or better than the G6-bound antibody. Therefore, although the exhaustive enumeration of this large number of mutants is computationally demanding (approximately 6,000-CPU hours), the very large number of potentially improved designs makes a compelling case for exhaustive enumeration and ranking of variants within the tolerated sequence space. Furthermore, the computed mutational-tolerance map focuses exhaustive enumeration on a subset of stable multipoint mutants within the vast hypothetical sequence space of mutants at the vL-vH interface (20<sup>30</sup> = 10<sup>39</sup> unique sequences), &gt;99% of which are predicted to have reduced stability compared to the parental antibody (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007207.s003">S3 Fig</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>We clustered the designs, eliminating ones that had fewer than four mutations relative to one another and selected the 18 lowest-energy ones for experimental testing. The designs were formatted as scFvs, and their binding signals relative to the G6 antibody were first qualitatively measured at 8 nM VEGF concentration using yeast display [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref003">3</xref>] (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007207.g004">Fig 4A</xref></bold>). Encouragingly, seven designs (approximately 40%) showed comparable or higher binding signal at this concentration. The best two designs, G6<sup>des1</sup> and G6<sup>des13</sup>, were expressed as Fabs. When subjected to Ni-NTA purification, G6 exhibited multiple bands, indicative of sample heterogeneity, whereas, remarkably, both designs eluted mostly in the size expected for a Fab (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007207.s004">S4A and S4B Fig</xref></bold>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref052">52</xref>].</p>

<p>Next, the designs’ affinities for VEGF were determined using SPR (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007207.g004">Fig 4B</xref></bold>). Both designs improved binding on-rate, and G6<sup>des13</sup> also improved the off-rate, resulting in fivefold improvement in <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub> relative to G6. Both designs also exhibited substantial improvements in thermal stability and the temperature of aggregation onset (19° C and 10° C, respectively) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007207.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref></bold>). We examined the model structure of G6<sup>des13</sup>, which comprised six mutations at the vL-vH interface relative to G6, finding that the mutations were likely to improve the interface through backbone rigidification and the introduction of a new buried polar hydrogen-bond network (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007207.g004">Fig 4E</xref></bold>). Such cooperative interaction networks do not typically arise in conventional antibody affinity-maturation processes (either in nature or the laboratory), which select mutations in a stepwise manner and are therefore biased towards additive rather than cooperative multipoint mutations. Introducing accurate new polar interaction networks is also a fundamental challenge for computational design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref054">54</xref>] and the use of evolutionary constraints during design has recently been shown to overcome this challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref042">42</xref>].</p>
<p>We next tested the stability and expressibility of the VEGF designs formatted as full-length IgGs. We expressed G6, G6<sup>des1</sup>, and G6<sup>des13</sup> in HEK293 cells and found that the designs exhibited nearly an order of magnitude higher expression level than G6 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007207.g004">Fig 4F</xref></bold>). We next measured the relative stabilities of G6 and G6<sup>des13</sup> using native mass spectrometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref055">55</xref>] under reducing conditions by titrating the collision energy (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007207.g004">Fig 4G</xref></bold>). We found that G6 IgG disassembly started at lower collision energy compared to G6<sup>des13</sup>, indicative of the design’s higher stability (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007207.s005">S5 Fig</xref></bold>). We, therefore, concluded that AbLIFT could substantially improve expressibility, stability, and affinity, regardless of whether the antibody was formatted as Fab or IgG.</p>
<p>We applied the same computational strategy to h492.1, in which the Fv was derived from a murine antibody and the constant regions were derived from human IgG1. Since h492.1 failed to show detectable expression in HEK293 cell cultures, we started the computational design from the structure of the murine 492.1 parental antibody in complex with QSOX1 (PDB entry: 4IJ3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref047">47</xref>]. We selected the 20 lowest-energy, sequence-clustered AbLIFT designs, fused them to human IgG1 constant domains and subjected them to HEK293-expression screening from crude cell lysate supernatant. Dot-blot analysis showed detectable expression levels for all 20 designs, in clear contrast with the lack of detectable expression for h492.1 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007207.g005">Fig 5A</xref></bold>). We further quantitated expression levels using Western blot, revealing substantial variation in the expression levels among the designs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007207.g005">Fig 5B</xref></bold>). In parallel, we examined the levels of QSOX1 inhibition by the 20 designs, finding that 50% showed high levels of QSOX1 inhibition (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007207.s006">S6 Fig</xref></bold>). Based on activities and expression levels, we selected h492.1<sup>des3</sup> and h492.1<sup>des18</sup> for further analysis. These designs were purified and added to QSOX1 activity assays to test for inhibition. h492.1<sup>des18</sup> showed comparable inhibitory levels to the murine parent antibody when provided at equimolar amounts to a typical physiological concentration of QSOX1 (25 nM) as found in human serum (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007207.g005">Fig 5C</xref></bold>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref056">56</xref>]. This analysis demonstrated that h492.1<sup>des18</sup> almost completely recovered the activity of the parental antibody while gaining high expression levels (approximately 75 mg/L supernatant). Structural analysis indicated that this design improved packing at the vL-vH interface (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007207.g005">Fig 5D</xref></bold>), demonstrating that in some cases optimizing this region could have a dramatic effect on the expression levels of engineered antibodies.</p>

<p>Finally, we asked whether there were any sequence features in common among the designs (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007207.s009">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007207.s010">S4</xref> Tables</bold>). Strikingly, position 43<sup>L</sup> (Chothia numbering) was mutated to Pro in D44.1<sup>des</sup> and in &gt;60% of the G6 and h492.1 designs. Position 43<sup>L</sup> is located in a tight turn that connects two neighboring β strands, away from the CDRs, but Pro is not the consensus identity at this position (Ala and Ser are preferred). Furthermore, mutations at this position may have an important effect on the rigid-body angle formed by the variable light and heavy domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref057">57</xref>], and it is, therefore, unlikely that this mutation would universally improve antibody stability and affinity. Other than this mutation to Pro, we did not observe common sequence features among the designs. Overlapping but non-identical sets of positions were varied in each of the three case studies presented here, and the mutations at aligned positions were dissimilar. We, therefore, concluded that the designs improved interactions across the vL-vH interface through a variety of mechanisms that depended on the specific molecular structure of the parental antibodies.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study demonstrates that improved interactions across the vL-vH interface may result in substantial optimization of a range of essential parameters for antibody development, including expressibility, stability, and affinity. The automated AbLIFT strategy enables the design of cooperative networks of multipoint mutations in the antibody core that are likely to be inaccessible to experimental affinity maturation processes since these latter methods select mutations in a stepwise manner. Since AbLIFT impacts the antibody core and does not alter the structure of the antigen-binding site, the designed mutations cooperate with surface mutations identified through conventional antibody-engineering processes to further increase affinity and stability. AbLIFT may be particularly beneficial in antibodies, such as G6 and h492.1, which were the product of antibody-engineering approaches that might compromise antibody structural integrity, resulting in reduced affinity or stability. Moreover, antibody structure-prediction methods now often produce atomically accurate models at the vL-vH interface (though still not at the CDR H3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref058">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref060">60</xref>], suggesting that by restricting design to the framework regions, AbLIFT may in some cases enable antibody optimisation even in the absence of an experimental structure. We note, however, that AbLIFT considers only phylogenetic information and molecular energetics and disregards immunogenicity, which may be an important consideration in antibodies developed for clinical use. To address this concern, the AbLIFT web server enables complete control over the design sequence space and can be used to eliminate mutations with immunogenic potential.</p>
<p>The surprisingly broad ability of vL-vH design to optimize antibody properties is consistent with the Colman interface-adaptor hypothesis, according to which the formation of the Fv from two chains renders it flexible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref034">34</xref>]. According to this hypothesis, Fv flexibility is likely to be an adaptive property selected by evolution to broaden molecular recognition by each individual antibody to a range of antigens through induced fit or conformational selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref061">61</xref>], thereby solving the conundrum of how a large but finite antibody repertoire could recognize a potentially infinite range of antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref062">62</xref>]. Flexibility, however, might come at a cost, since an Fv that exhibits flexible vL-vH pairing may occupy multiple molecular states that compete with the binding-competent state, thus lowering antigen-binding affinity. Flexibility may moreover result in misfolding or transient dissociation of the two variable chains, resulting in terminal aggregation or degradation by the cellular proteostasis machinery, thereby lowering expression yields. In extreme cases, poorly defined packing at the vL-vH interface can lead to substantial rearrangements of the antibody variable domain during binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref063">63</xref>], and such rearrangements could lower antigen-binding affinity and specificity. Therefore, while the interface-adaptor hypothesis neatly explains why flexibility at the vL-vH interface is advantageous in early steps of antibody selection, broad specificity and marginal vL-vH interface stability become liabilities in later stages of antibody development into research or therapeutic tools. We anticipate that AbLIFT will have a wide scope to automatically and reliably improve stability, solubility, expressibility, affinity, and structural integrity in numerous antibodies in which these important properties are compromised.</p>

Furthermore, the web-server implements more accurate atomistic scoring and enables greater user control: it uses the recent Rosetta energy function ref15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007207.ref069">69</xref>] with improved electrostatics and solvation potentials relative to the previous Rosetta energy function talaris and allows the user to manually modify the tolerated sequence space (for instance, based on prior experimental data or to eliminate potential immunogenic sequence signatures). Accordingly, ΔΔ<italic>G</italic> and PSSM cutoffs may be different from those used to in the designs described in the paper, and the web server provides user control over these parameters.</p>

<title>Bacterial expression and purification (D44.1 and D44.1<sup>des</sup>)</title>
<p>The design and wild-type were transformed into RH2.2 plasmid for expression as Fabs, where the heavy chain was N-terminally His-tagged and the light chain was expressed as a separate protein. Both chains contain a secretion sequence for direction to the periplasmic space, where they fold and dimerize. Restriction-free cloning was done using Kapa HiFi Hotstart Readymix (Kapa Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.</p>
<p>Cells were induced with 1 mM IPTG at OD600 = 0.6, transferred to 20°C, and harvested after 20 h. The cells were then resuspended in buffer A [20 mM phosphate buffer pH 6.2, 150 mM NaCl] and sonicated. The supernatant was harvested by centrifugation (20,000 × <italic>g</italic>, 1 h), filtered, and loaded on HiTrap TALON crude 1 ml column (GE Healthcare). Then it was washed with 15–20 bed volumes of buffer A, and then eluted with buffer B [20 mM phosphate buffer pH 6.2,150 mM NaCl, 150 mM imidazole]. Imidazole was removed from the eluate by dialysis against Buffer C [20 mM Hepes buffer pH 7,150 mM NaCl] (1:400).

The next day, cells were transfected with 1 μg DNA mixture consisting of 200 ng pLXN plasmid encoding Luciferase, 400 ng of a plasmid encoding the light chains and 400 ng of a plasmid encoding the heavy chains of the designated antibodies. Each transfection was carried in 100 μl DMEM in which 2 μg of linear 40,000 Da PEI (Polysciences) per μg of DNA were mixed. The transfection mixture was added to cells, for a total volume of 400 μl DMEM per well. 4 hours after transfection, cells were washed and fresh 1 ml DMEM with 1% penicillin and streptomycin, glutamine and non-essential amino acids was applied. 72 hours post-transfection supernatant was separated from cells and the cells were resuspended in 500 μl PBS. A sample of 100 μl from the suspended cells from each well was transferred to 96-well white plates (Nunc) with 100 μl of Bright-Glo reagent (Promega) to quantify the level of luciferase as a proxy for the transfection efficiency. Adjusted volumes of supernatants based on the luciferase levels were loaded on a gradient gel (Bio-Rad) and run according to manufacturer's instructions. Semi-dry blotting was performed to a nitrocellulose membrane followed by blocking in 5% milk powder in TBST (0.1% Tween 20, 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM sodium chloride) buffer for 30 min at room temperature.

Conditions within the mass spectrometer were adjusted to preserve noncovalent interactions. The source was operated in positive mode, the capillary voltage was set to 1.7 kV, the capillary temperature was 180°C and argon was used as the collision gas in the higher-energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) cell. MS spectra were recorded at a resolution of 10,000 and HCD voltage was set to 50 V, at trapping gas pressure setting of 3.9, which corresponds to HV pressure of 1.04 x 10<sup>−4</sup> mbar and UHV pressure of 2.35 x 10<sup>−10</sup> mbar.

<title>Gas-phase stability assay</title>
<p>Antibody stability was monitored by tandem MS (MS/MS), at different HCD voltages. The 23<sup>+</sup> charge state of the G6 and G6<sup>des13</sup> antibodies was isolated in the quadrupole, with an isolation window of 20 m/z, and the transmitted ions were subjected to collision-induced dissociation in the HCD cell, at a gradient of accelerating voltages ranging between 50–200 V. The relative abundance of the full IgG’s and the dissociated light chains, recorded at the different HCD voltages, was determined by measuring their peak heights. The total intensity of the light chains was calculated as the sum of intensities of their corresponding charge states. In each experimental condition, the total intensities of all the measured species were summed and referenced as 100% intensity. The relative intensity of each species was then calculated as a percentage of the total intensity. The stability assay was performed six times. Error bars represent standard deviation.</p>
