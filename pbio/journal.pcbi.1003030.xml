      <abstract>
         <p>Intrinsically disordered regions have been associated with various cellular processes and are implicated in several human diseases, but their exact roles remain unclear. We previously defined two classes of conserved disordered regions in budding yeast, referred to as “flexible” and “constrained” conserved disorder. In flexible disorder, the property of disorder has been positionally conserved during evolution, whereas in constrained disorder, both the amino acid sequence and the property of disorder have been conserved. Here, we show that flexible and constrained disorder are widespread in the human proteome, and are particularly common in proteins with regulatory functions. Both classes of disordered sequences are highly enriched in regions of proteins that undergo tissue-specific (TS) alternative splicing (AS), but not in regions of proteins that undergo general (i.e., not tissue-regulated) AS. Flexible disorder is more highly enriched in TS alternative exons, whereas constrained disorder is more highly enriched in exons that flank TS alternative exons. These latter regions are also significantly more enriched in potential phosphosites and other short linear motifs associated with cell signaling. We further show that cancer driver mutations are significantly enriched in regions of proteins associated with TS and general AS. Collectively, our results point to distinct roles for TS alternative exons and flanking exons in the dynamic regulation of protein interaction networks in response to signaling activity, and they further suggest that alternatively spliced regions of proteins are often functionally altered by mutations responsible for cancer.</p>

         <title>Author Summary</title>
         <p>A protein's cellular and molecular function is typically determined by its folded structure. However, a large fraction of proteomes lack stably folded structure. These regions are referred to as intrinsically disordered. Protein disorder has largely been understudied, although it is emerging to have numerous important functions in a cell. Similarly, although alternative splicing (AS) is well established as an important regulatory layer of metazoan gene expression, its specific roles at the protein level are not well understood. Others and we recently have provided evidence that tissue-regulated AS likely plays a widespread role in the control of protein-protein interactions. In the present study, we investigate how two different classes of conserved protein disorder may contribute distinct functions in relation to roles of regulated alternative exons in the dynamic remodeling of interaction networks. We also investigate the distribution of cancer causing mutations in regulated and other alternatively spliced regions of proteins.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>While it is well established that a protein's three-dimensional structure determines its function, a large fraction of proteins and protein regions lack stable structure. Such intrinsically disordered proteins contain extended regions that do not fold into a native fixed conformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Dyson1">[1]</xref>. These disordered regions are widespread across the tree of life, particularly in eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Ward1">[2]</xref>. For example, amino acids comprising approximately 30–40% of the human proteome are predicted to reside within disordered regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Pentony1">[3]</xref>. Many different functions have been ascribed to disordered proteins. For instance, they have been shown to carry out regulatory functions associated with signal transduction and molecular recognition, including transcription, protein phosphorylation, mRNA metabolism, RNA processing, translation, chaperone activity and regulation of the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Dyson1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Gsponer1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Lobley1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Alternative splicing (AS) and post-translational modification such as phosphorylation are known to regulate and diversify the functions of proteins and are thought to partly account for the increased complexity of metazoan species. Human alternatively spliced exons are enriched in regions of intrinsic disorder, presumably to provide functional and regulatory diversity while avoiding disruption to core protein structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Pentony1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Romero1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Weatheritt1">[7]</xref>. Moreover, we and others have recently shown that tissue-regulated alternative exons are enriched in highly disordered regions of proteins where they frequently modulate interactions in protein-protein interaction networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Ellis1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Davis1">[10]</xref>. In addition, disordered regions often harbor linear motifs that mediate recognition functions and therefore can be considered as a class of functional domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Tompa1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Bellay1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Finally, intrinsic disorder is abundant among proteins associated with various human diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, amyloidoses, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Uversky1">[13]</xref>. Furthermore, highly connected proteins in “diseasome” networks are enriched in disorder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Goh1">[14]</xref>. However, due to the wide range of roles of disordered proteins it has been difficult to ascribe specific functions to disordered regions.</p>
      <p>In order to better understand the roles of intrinsic disorder, we previously developed a method to analyze the conservation of intrinsic disorder across the yeast clade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Bellay2">[15]</xref>. Over large regions of proteins, the property of disorder is highly conserved, i.e., the same residues are disordered in most orthologous proteins. Additionally, the underlying amino acid sequence of the disordered regions may either be conserved or significantly diverged. Based on this observation, we defined two types of conserved disorder: 1) “constrained disorder”, regions where the amino acid sequence is well conserved, and 2) “flexible disorder”, regions where the amino acid sequence has diverged. Our analyses revealed that these two types of conserved disorder have different biophysical and biological properties. Flexible disorder is predominantly associated with signaling and regulation, whereas constrained disorder is associated with chaperones and ribosomal proteins.</p>
      <p>Here, we investigate the roles of these different forms of disorder in metazoans, with a focus on the human proteome. We provide evidence for distinct roles for disorder in tissue-specific regulation. In particular, we find different roles for constrained and flexible disorder in relation to alternatively spliced regions of proteins, phosphorylation sites and short linear motifs. While flexible disorder may predominantly function by providing structural flexibility that enables the expression and folding of splice isoforms, constrained disorder appears to provide structural scaffolding for presentation of linear motifs and phosphorylation sites, enabling tissue-regulated alternative splicing to rewire signaling pathways and protein interaction networks.</p>

         <title>A new role for disorder in tissue-specific protein regulation</title>
         <p>Using our previously described methodology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Bellay2">[15]</xref>, we analyzed the distribution of conserved flexible and constrained disorder in human proteins. To ensure reliable disorder prediction and sequence alignment we used two different and independent strategies, which yielded qualitatively similar results (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003030.s010">Text S1</xref>). As the assignment of the two types of conserved disorder categorization is dependent on the cut-off values used to classify residues as disordered and conserved, we employed steps to ensure consistent criteria in our analyses (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Specifically, we sought to maximize consistency in assignments of disorder category between the current work and previous study in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Bellay2">[15]</xref> i.e., residues in human proteins should be assigned the same category as the corresponding residue in their yeast ortholog (if existent). Among all orthologous proteins, we observe 61% overlap between assigned disordered residues in both species. Interestingly, there is a significantly higher overall level of conserved flexible disorder in human compared to yeast proteins (79% vs. 38%; P = 0, Chi-squared Test). In contrast, when comparing human proteins that have yeast orthologs, which are an older evolutionary origin, with human proteins that lack yeast orthologs, there is significantly more constrained disorder in the latter set (5% and 8%, respectively; P = 0, Chi-squared Test). Similarly, yeast proteins that lack human orthologs on average have a slightly higher level of constrained disorder (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003030-g001">Figure 1</xref>). It is interesting to consider that the significant increase in constrained disorder in more recently evolved human proteins may be associated with increase in organismal complexity. Likewise, the increase of flexible disorder in such human proteins may be associated with a higher rate of neutral change, which may provide a basis for the evolution of new functions.</p>

The human proteome contains higher rates of flexible disorder than the yeast proteome. Proteins without yeast orthologs, which are presumably younger, have higher rates of disorder.</p>

         <p>To further examine the possible role of conserved constrained and flexible disorder, we performed a functional enrichment analysis of proteins containing relatively high proportions of flexible or constrained disordered residues (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). We find that both flexible and constrained disorder are enriched in proteins with functions related to cell differentiation and development (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003030.s009">Table S1</xref>). For example, proteins enriched in flexible disorder are significantly associated with categories such as erythrocyte differentiation and osteoblast development. Likewise, proteins with constrained disorder are enriched in functions associated with fibroblast migration and smooth muscle development. This is consistent with our earlier findings focusing on the yeast clade, in which we found that disorder is closely related to regulatory functions, rather than structural or enzymatic activities. Regulatory function in human proteins is often related to cell differentiation and development and, evidently, disordered regions play an important role in these processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Bellay2">[15]</xref>.</p>

         <title>Relationships between disorder and alternative splicing</title>
         <p>Regulation of tissue-specificity can be achieved through multiple processes including differential gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Wu1">[16]</xref>, posttranslational modification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Huttlin1">[17]</xref> and alternative splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Licatalosi1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Barash1">[22]</xref>. To better understand the role of conserved disorder in determining tissue-specificity, we explored its relationship with tissue-specific regulation at the levels of mRNA expression, alternative splicing and phosphorylation. We observe that constrained disorder is weakly although significantly correlated with tissue-specificity in mRNA expression (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003030.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, P&lt;2.2e-16, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003030.s002">Figure S2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Wu2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Babu1">[24]</xref>. However, we observe a stronger association between constrained disorder and tissue-regulated AS (see below).</p>
         <p>We have recently shown that tissue-specific exons are enriched in regions of highly disordered amino acid sequences, and that these exons often function in controlling PPIs in networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Ellis1">[8]</xref>. In contrast to a previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Romero1">[6]</xref>, we found that alternatively spliced exons that are not alternatively spliced in a tissue-specific manner, termed here as general AS events, are not significantly enriched in disordered regions (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003030-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Here, we resolve this apparent discrepancy. The Romero <italic>et al</italic>. study mostly analyzed UniProt-annotated alternatively spliced exons, which are enriched in tissue-specific AS exons (P&lt;0.004, Chi-squared test, See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003030.s010">Text S1</xref>). In fact, by pre-defining a bona-fide set of proteins with tissue-specific AS exons, we find that the UniProt set of proteins contain approximately the same level of disorder as our set, whereas exons that are not pre-selected as tissue-specifically regulated in the UniProt set have a markedly lower level of disorder and are very close to the genomic average (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003030-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Our findings underline the importance distinguishing between tissue-specific and general AS exons when establishing relationships between disorder and AS.</p>

               <title>Disorder in alternatively spliced exons.</title>
               <p>A) The set of exons annotated in UniProt as alternatively spliced can be split into two sets: Bona-fide Tissue-Specific and bona-fide General. We show here that while general alternatively spliced exons are only slightly enriched in disorder, tissue-specific exons are highly enriched in disorder (P&lt;1.7e-5, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). The dotted line refers to the background level of disorder in the proteome. B) Using a larger set of alternatively spliced exons, tissue-specific alternative exons are found to be highly enriched in disorder (P&lt;4.7e-7), whereas general alternative exons are not. The dotted line refers to the background level of disorder in the proteome.</p>
            </caption><graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003030.g002" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
         <p>Importantly, when extending the above analysis by further categorizing conserved protein disorder into subgroups associated with AS regions of proteins, we observe several interesting relationships. While tissue-specific alternative exons have a significantly higher rate of flexible disorder relative to general alternative exons (i.e. those exons that are generally not subject to tissue regulation), conserved constrained disorder is not enriched in these exons (P&lt;3.36e-5 for flexible disorder, Mann-Whitney test; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003030-g003">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003030-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In contrast, the constitutive exons immediately flanking the tissue-specific alternative exons are significantly enriched in both flexible and constrained disorder when compared to general alternatively spliced exons. Similar results are observed when controlling for potential biases stemming from alignment methodology, alignment quality, or from disorder prediction methodology, as well when controlling for possible biases due to alternative exons missing in some orthologs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003030.s010">Text S1</xref> and Figures S5, S6, S7, S8).</p>

         <p>The enrichment in flexible disordered amino acids in tissue-specific alternative exons is consistent with the hypothesis that disordered regions afford structural flexibility such that exons can be alternatively spliced in or out without jeopardizing protein stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Romero1">[6]</xref>. This view is consistent with previous observations that regulated AS events are under-represented in folded domains of proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Ellis1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Buljan1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Wang1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Resch1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Kriventseva1">[26]</xref>, while transcripts harboring such AS events appear to be generally translated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Tress1">[27]</xref>, although in some cases it has been reported that alternatively spliced exons lead to misfolded or unstable proteins, which are degraded <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Calarco1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-MisquittaAli1">[29]</xref>. This latter situation may in some cases provide a form of post-translational regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-MisquittaAli1">[29]</xref>. Furthermore, a subset of AS events will lead to low-abundance isoforms, including those containing premature termination codons, which are often targeted by nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD) and are less likely to be translated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Pan1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Melamud1">[31]</xref>.</p>
         <p>Given these possible scenarios, we determined whether our set of proteins containing tissue-specific alternative exons are enriched in bona-fide proteins listed in Hegyi <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Hegyi1">[32]</xref> (i.e., proteins for which there is evidence from mass spectroscopy studies), over the set of proteins that contain general alternative exons. Indeed, we find proteins harboring tissue-regulated alternative exons are significantly more often likely to be functional (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>), consistent with the idea that tissue-specific AS events affect tissue development and identity through the regulation of protein function (P&lt;0.03, Chi-squared Test, See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003030-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Further supporting this conclusion, as found for tissue-regulated alternative exons, we find that alternative exons overlapping bona-fide proteins are also significantly enriched in flexible disorder, compared to the general alternative exons (p&lt;0.05, Mann-Whitney Test, See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003030-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). These results suggest that the enrichment of tissue-regulated alternative exons in flexible disorder in is largely due to structural reasons, i.e., to aid the folding and stability of both alternative isoforms.</p>
         <p>We also observe a second, distinct relationship between conserved disorder and tissue-regulated AS events, namely, that both flexible and constrained disorder are significantly enriched in the constitutive exons immediately flanking the alternatively spliced exons (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003030-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>). The majority of interactions in signaling pathways are mediated by short, flexible interfaces that can be detected at the sequence level as linear motifs. These motifs mostly occur in disordered regions due to the conformational flexibility afforded by these regions, which is important for their recognition. Some are bound by peptide binding domains such as SH3 domains, while others are sites of post-translational modification, e.g., by protein kinases. Taken together with our recent results revealing a widespread role for tissue-specific alternative exons in controlling PPIs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Ellis1">[8]</xref>, we considered that the enrichment of the flanking constitutive exons in flexible disorder may be important for controlling interactions mediated by the adjacent alternative exons. Accordingly, we sought to better define the linear motifs and phosphosites associated with alternatively spliced exons.</p>

         <title>Linear motifs and phosphosites are enriched in flanking constitutive exons, but not in alternatively spliced exons</title>
         <p>First, we analyzed the role of flexible and constrained disorder with respect to phosphosites and linear motifs. Consistent with earlier results, we find that both kinds of disorder are enriched in these protein features <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Bellay2">[15]</xref>. Extending this, we find that while actual phosphosites and linear motifs are associated with a peak in constrained disorder, the immediate flanking regions have comparatively higher rates of flexible disorder (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003030-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). This finding leads to one tempting image: regions around phosphosites are enriched in flexible disorder, thereby providing flexibility needed for phosphorylation. Conversely, the phosphosite itself tends to be conserved, rendering it to be more enriched in constrained disorder.</p>

         <p>Next, we investigated the extent of enrichment of phosphosites and linear motifs in regions surrounding alternatively spliced exons. Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. previously observed an enrichment of phosphosites in proteins regulated by the Nova splicing factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Zhang1">[33]</xref>. While previous studies found enrichment for linear motifs in alternatively spliced exons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Weatheritt1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Buljan1">[9]</xref>, we find strong enrichment for both features in exons flanking the alternative exon, but no measurable enrichment in the alternative exon itself (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003030-g004">Figure 4B, 4C</xref> and also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003030.s011">Text S2</xref> for comparison against recent findings of Buljan <italic>et al</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Buljan1">[9]</xref>). It suggests that the role of disorder in alternative exons likely differs from that in flanking exons.

         <title>Increases in linear motifs account for enrichment of disorder in regions flanking tissue-regulated alternative exons</title>
         <p>We compared the rates of constrained disorder of residues within and outside of phosphosites and linear motifs, respectively, in constitutive exon flanks and in randomly selected distal exons. In other words, in this analysis we compared the increase in constrained disorder due to the presence of a phosphosite or linear motif to the increase due to tissue-specific alternative splicing. We find that the enrichment for constrained disorder in exons flanking tissue-specific AS exons are to a large extent driven by the presence of phosphosites and linear motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003030-g005">Figure 5</xref>). In particular, compared to the proteome-wide disorder rate average of 36%, we find that tissue-specific exons outside of phosphosites are slightly enriched in disorder (45%), while a larger increase in enrichment of both constrained and flexible disorder is observed for residues located around phosphosites and ELMs (81%). Interestingly, when performing the same analysis for alternative exons and flexible disorder, we observe a relatively large enrichment for flexible disorder (&gt;52% See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003030.s003">Figure S3</xref>) that is independent of phosphosites or ELMs compared to the proteome-wide average of 20%.

         <title>Alternatively spliced exons and their flanking exons are enriched in cancer driver mutations</title>
         <p>Both disordered regions and linear motifs are known to have important roles in regulation of many cellular processes and have been implicated in numerous diseases. As we observed significant enrichment of flexible and constrained disorder in tissue regulated exons and flanking exons, respectively, we therefore next asked whether such regions are associated with disease mutations. More specifically, we asked whether mutations implicated in driving cancer growth are enriched in these regulation “hot spots”. For control and comparison purposes, we investigated enrichment of cancer mutations in general alternative exons and flanking exons. Abnormal perturbations in cell regulation due to genetic mutations can result in uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumor formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-BlumeJensen1">[34]</xref>. Such changes are caused by “driver” mutations, i.e., mutations that provide a growth advantage. By contrast, the majority of somatic mutations in cancer are “passenger” mutations that accumulate in the cancer genome as a result of a breakdown of DNA repair processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Stratton1">[35]</xref>. To define driver and passenger mutations, we used cancer mutation frequency information from the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Bamford1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Torkamani1">[37]</xref>. For our analysis, we classified driver mutations based on their occurrence in multiple independent tumor samples, whereas passenger mutations were present in single tumor samples (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> for details).</p>
         <p>Although we did not observe significant enrichment of driver mutations in regions containing tissue specific AS events compared to regions containing general AS events, we did observe an overall significant enrichment of driver mutations in AS neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003030-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) compared to randomly selected exons. Remarkably, 690 of 1502 (46%) driver mutations were detected in alternative splicing regions encompassing alternative (A) exons and flanking constitutive exons (C1 and C2). Specifically, there is a density of 0.43, 0.93 and 0.49 driver mutations per 10 Kb in C1, A and C2, respectively, whereas the density in the overall exome is 0.24 driver mutations per 10 Kb. Since the A and flanking C1 and C2 exons constitute only a small portion of the coding genome (∼10 million nucleotides as per our dataset), this enrichment is highly significant as revealed by a Chi-square test (P&lt;1.99e-108), when comparing the ratios of driver vs. passenger mutations in alternative splicing neighborhoods as compared to the rest of the exome. Our results remain qualitatively unchanged when we use other frequency thresholds for calling driver and passenger mutations, indicating robustness of our observations (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Moreover, a missense mutation occurring in an alternatively spliced neighborhood is ∼5 times more likely to be a driver than a passenger mutations when compared to constitutive distal exons in the same proteins (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003030-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, P&lt;2.59e-63, Chi-square Test). Likewise, it is more than 4.5 times more likely to be a driver than a passenger mutation compared to mutations occurring in the rest of the exome (P&lt;5.9e-202, Chi-square Test).</p>

         <p>These results provide evidence that alternatively spliced exons and their flanking exons are hot spots for cancer driver mutations. Although we did not observe significant enrichment of driver or passenger mutations in tissue-regulated exons or their flanking constitutive exons, driver mutations were nevertheless detected in these regions. Given the importance of these regions in the regulation of protein-protein interactions and in signaling, it is therefore important to consider that such disease mutations in these regions may result in the rewiring of signaling and protein-protein interaction networks in cancer cells. Conversely the enrichment of driver mutations in regions that are alternatively spliced but not annotated as undergoing tissue regulation could reflect possible selection acting to avoid disruption of regions of proteins that are more often associated with formation of interaction hubs in protein interaction networks. Conversely, it is also possible that many such regions annotated as being “general” AS, are in fact regulated in a tissue-specific or condition-specific manner but were not detected as such using the limited panel of RNA-Seq data employed in this study. Regardless, these results provide a basis for future investigations addressing the mechanisms by which cancer driver mutations contribute to the onset and progression of tumors.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this work we used a comparative proteomics approach to investigate fundamental properties of conserved disorder in higher eukaryotes. Our results suggest that conserved flexible disorder may largely have a structural role associated with tissue-specific alternative splicing, whereas conserved constrained disorder has a regulatory role by providing scaffolding for linear motifs. As it becomes increasingly evident that alternative splicing affects a substantial fraction of the proteome and is an important determinant in controlling protein interactions, future studies will be facilitated by taking these different possible roles of disorder into account. It will be of considerable interest to determine the different functional relationships between AS and the various protein motifs and features that we find are enriched in and proximal to tissue-regulated alternative exons in this study. In particular, it will be important to address the role of specific arrangements of linear motifs in the regulation of protein-protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Ellis1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Davis1">[10]</xref>. The lack of enrichment of interaction motifs in regulated alternative exons may imply that these exons attenuate interactions that are mediated by linear motifs or phosphosites in flanking constitutive exons (where they are enriched). On the other hand, the alternatively spliced exon may represent the main site of the protein-protein interaction and its affinity may be modulated by the modification status of sites within the flanking exon regions, with the interaction dependent on both splicing and phosphosite or the status of other PTMs. Our results thus provide interesting testable hypotheses that can be addressed in future experiments. Finally, we provide new insight into relationships between cancer driver mutations, AS, and protein composition and function, that will facilitate future studies directed at determining mechanisms underlying the growth and spread of cancer cells.</p>

         <title>Alternative splicing</title>
         <p>Using the same RNA-Seq dataset described above in addition to the alternative splicing events previously mined (See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Ellis1">[8]</xref> for details) from the BodyMap dataset. Of the 27,240 distinct human cassette exon alternative splicing (AS) events from RNA-Seq data, 16050 of these events were mapped to the subset of Ensembl protein isoforms (explained above) with high confidence. Of these, we used only the 4328 AS events that had both the inclusion and exclusion isoforms mapped. We refer to this dataset as the ‘general AS’ event set. From this set, we further derived a set of 268 tissue-specific events that we previously called as specific to one or more of the tissues listed above. See Supplementary material in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Ellis1">[8]</xref> for detailed description of categorization of alternative splicing events into constitutive, general and tissue-specific events.</p>

         <title>Cancer mutations</title>
         <p>The mutation data was obtained from the Sanger Institute Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer web site, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic" xlink:type="simple">http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic</ext-link> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003030-Bamford1">[36]</xref>.</p>
         <p>Somatic missense mutations from 98463 amino acid sites were downloaded (version 59). Classification of driver mutation sites and passenger mutation sites were determined by their mutation frequency. Missense mutations were defined as a driver mutation if at least 5 distinct COSMIC samples from at least 3 distinct studies. To prevent bias from low throughput, targeted gene analysis, we also called mutations coming from in at least 3 distinct samples from whole genome screening based studies as driver mutations. We obtained 1502 driver and 97961 passenger mutations. While the frequency thresholds used were arbitrary set due to lack of a golden truth set, we observed that our results remain qualitatively unchanged even when using a range of thresholds for calling driver and passenger mutations, implying robustness of our observations.</p>
