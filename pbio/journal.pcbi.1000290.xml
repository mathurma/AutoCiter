                <p>The transformation of synaptic input into patterns of spike output is a
                    fundamental operation that is determined by the particular complement of ion
                    channels that a neuron expresses. Although it is well established that
                    individual ion channel proteins make stochastic transitions between conducting
                    and non-conducting states, most models of synaptic integration are
                    deterministic, and relatively little is known about the functional consequences
                    of interactions between stochastically gating ion channels. Here, we show that a
                    model of stellate neurons from layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex
                    implemented with either stochastic or deterministically gating ion channels can
                    reproduce the resting membrane properties of stellate neurons, but only the
                    stochastic version of the model can fully account for perithreshold membrane
                    potential fluctuations and clustered patterns of spike output that are recorded
                    from stellate neurons during depolarized states. We demonstrate that the
                    stochastic model implements an example of a general mechanism for patterning of
                    neuronal output through activity-dependent changes in the probability of spike
                    firing. Unlike deterministic mechanisms that generate spike patterns through
                    slow changes in the state of model parameters, this general stochastic mechanism
                    does not require retention of information beyond the duration of a single spike
                    and its associated afterhyperpolarization. Instead, clustered patterns of spikes
                    emerge in the stochastic model of stellate neurons as a result of a transient
                    increase in firing probability driven by activation of HCN channels during
                    recovery from the spike afterhyperpolarization. Using this model, we infer
                    conditions in which stochastic ion channel gating may influence firing patterns
                        <italic>in vivo</italic> and predict consequences of modifications of HCN
                    channel function for <italic>in vivo</italic> firing patterns.</p>

                <p>Neurons use electrical impulses called action potentials to transmit signals from
                    their cell body to their axon terminals, where the impulses trigger release of
                    neurotransmitter. Initiation of an action potential is determined by the balance
                    of currents through ion channels in a neuron's membrane. Although it is
                    well established that membrane ion channels randomly fluctuate between open and
                    closed states, most models of action potentials account for the average current
                    through these channels but not for the current fluctuations caused by this
                    stochastic opening and closing. Here, we examine the consequences of stochastic
                    ion channel gating for stellate neurons found in the entorhinal cortex. The
                    intrinsic properties of these neurons cause characteristic clustered patterns of
                    spiking. We find that in a model of a single stellate neuron that is constrained
                    by previous experimental data clustered action potential patterns are produced
                    only when the model accounts for the random opening and closing of individual
                    ion channels. This stochastic model provides an example of a general mechanism
                    for patterning of neuronal activity and may help to explain the patterns of
                    spikes fired by entorhinal neurons that encode spatial location in behaving
                    animals.</p>

            <p>Thermal fluctuations in the conformation of an ion channel protein can cause it to
                make spontaneous transitions between discrete conducting and non-conducting states
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Neher1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Hille1">[2]</xref>. Nevertheless, computational models of ionic
                conductances in a neuron generally assume the behavior of a population of ion
                channels to be deterministic and stochastic gating of ion channels is usually
                neglected in models of synaptic integration and spike initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Hodgkin1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Migliore1">[4]</xref>. For a
                typical cortical principal neuron, this assumption can be justified by the very
                small amplitude of the conductance change and resulting membrane current caused by
                opening of a single ion channel compared to either the resting membrane conductance
                or the threshold current for firing of an action potential. However, when neurons
                are depolarized to membrane potentials around the threshold for initiation of action
                potentials, the biophysical mechanisms that underlie spike generation dictate that
                the effective membrane conductance becomes very low <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Koch1">[5]</xref>. As a result, even small
                fluctuations in ionic current through relatively few ion channels could
                significantly alter the membrane potential and the initiation of action potentials
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-White1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Waters1">[7]</xref>. Consistent with this possibility stochastic
                gating of membrane ion channels that determine the threshold for action potential
                initiation can influence the dynamic electrical properties of neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Chow1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Jacobson1">[11]</xref>. However, little
                attention has been given to the consequences of stochastic ion channel gating for
                the patterns of spike output produced during active states in which the membrane
                potential is depolarized to near threshold.</p>
            <p>We have focused on understanding the influence of stochastic ion channel gating on
                the integrative properties of stellate neurons from Layer II of the medial
                entorhinal cortex (MEC). These glutamatergic neurons provide cortical input to the
                hippocampal dentate gyrus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Dolorfo1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Witter1">[13]</xref>. Electrophysiological recordings reveal two
                unusual integrative properties of stellate neurons from the MEC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Alonso1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Dickson1">[17]</xref>. First, during
                prolonged periods of excitation stellate neurons fire action potentials in
                stereotypical clustered patterns. The frequency of spikes within a cluster is
                approximately 8–14 Hz and is relatively independent of the average spike
                frequency, while the intervals between spike clusters are typically hundreds of
                milliseconds or longer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Nolan1">[18]</xref>. The organization of clustered spike patterns
                appears to depend on a large and slow spike afterhyperpolarization (AHP) that is
                also independent of the overall average spike frequency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Nolan1">[18]</xref>. A second distinctive
                feature of stellate neurons is the emergence of prominent (∼3–5 mV
                in amplitude) intrinsic membrane potential fluctuations upon membrane depolarization
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Alonso1">[14]</xref>.
                These fluctuations have been proposed to contribute to network rhythmicity due to
                their power in the theta frequency range (4–12 Hz), the prominent
                oscillatory frequency of entorhinal and hippocampal network activity during
                exploratory behavior and REM sleep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Buzski1">[19]</xref>. Previous models and experimental results
                indicate that stochastic gating of persistent Na<sup>+</sup> channels may
                be essential for the sub-threshold oscillations observed in stellate neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Dorval1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-White2">[21]</xref>.
                However, the consequences of stochastic gating of other classes of ion channel
                expressed by stellate neurons have not been explored. Moreover, while sub-threshold
                oscillations have been suggested to drive clustered spike patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Alonso1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Haas1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Haas2">[23]</xref>, the
                mechanisms underlying oscillations and clustered spike firing can be dissociated
                experimentally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Nolan1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Fernandez1">[24]</xref>, and therefore it is
                not clear if stochastic fluctuations in ion channel opening play any role in the
                generation of clustered spike firing.</p>
            <p>Hyperpolarization-activated, cation non-selective (HCN) channels play a central role
                in determining subthreshold integration and the pattern of action potential
                initiation in stellate neurons from the MEC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Nolan1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Dickson2">[25]</xref>. The substantial
                hyperpolarization-activated current (I<sub>h</sub>) in stellate cells is mediated in
                large part by HCN1 channels and is a major determinant of the effective membrane
                conductance of the neuron at rest and at more depolarized potentials close to the
                threshold for initiation of action potentials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Nolan1">[18]</xref>. Experiments using
                pharmacological and genetic manipulations suggest that HCN channels increase the
                probability that clustered patterns of action potentials will be generated and
                increase the frequency of action potentials within each cluster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Nolan1">[18]</xref>.
                However, the mechanisms through which HCN channels influence these patterns of spike
                firing are not clear. Computational models of stellate neurons have suggested either
                that I<sub>h</sub> plays an essential role in perithreshold oscillations and
                clustered patterns of spike firing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Fransn1">[26]</xref> or that I<sub>h</sub> is not required <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-White2">[21]</xref>.
                Moreover, numerous studies suggest that the effects of I<sub>h</sub> on the
                integrative properties of a neuron are highly context dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Nolan1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Nolan2">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Southan1">[36]</xref>. Thus, the role of
                    I<sub>h</sub> is determined by interactions with other ion channels. Depending
                upon the cell type and even the subcellular compartment studied, I<sub>h</sub> can
                lead to varied properties, from prevention of bistability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Williams1">[37]</xref> to regulation of
                dendritic spiking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Tsay1">[38]</xref>. Therefore, understanding the properties of
                stellate neurons and their sensitivity to manipulations of I<sub>h</sub> will likely
                require an account of the interactions between multiples classes of ion channel.</p>
            <p>To better understand the impact of stochastic ion channel gating on the patterns of
                spike output from stellate neurons and to reconcile the contrasting views of the
                role of I<sub>h</sub> in perithreshold oscillations and clustered patterns of spike
                firing, we addressed two questions. How do interactions of HCN channels with other
                membrane ion channels lead to the emergence of membrane potential oscillations and
                spike firing patterns recorded from entorhinal stellate cells? Could stochastic ion
                channel gating at potentials close to spike threshold influence the patterns of
                spike output generated by stellate neurons? We demonstrate that whereas a
                deterministic model of channel gating is sufficient to account for many of the
                properties of entorhinal stellate neurons at hyperpolarized membrane potentials,
                including the consequences of HCN1 deletion, a model with stochastically gating ion
                channels is necessary to reproduce the distinctive properties of stellate neurons
                near threshold. Examination of the model reveals that spike initiation is
                probabilistic and that the tendency to emit clustered spikes can be explained by a
                transient increase in the probability of spike initiation following recovery from
                the action potential AHP. We find that this transient increase in spike probability
                is primarily due to I<sub>h</sub> and explains the role of HCN channels in the
                emergence of clustered patterns of spikes. Finally, we ask whether stochastic ion
                channel gating could contribute to patterns of spike output observed <italic>in
                vivo</italic>. We propose that stochastic gating of ion channels expressed by
                stellate neurons is crucial to their transformation of synaptic input into a
                patterned spiking output and places constraints on the development of models of
                entorhinal cortex function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Hasselmo1">[39]</xref>.</p>

            <p>To study the influence of stochastic gating of ion channels on the integrative
                properties of stellate neurons we implemented a single compartment model neuron
                endowed with ionic conductances derived from experimental data (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and
                    Methods</xref>). In the results sections that follow we first describe the key integrative
                properties of this model and show that they are similar to published experimental
                data. We then explore how clustered patterns of action potentials emerge in the
                model. Finally, to establish whether the model might explain firing patterns
                recorded from superficial entorhinal neurons in behaving animals, we simulate
                responses of the model to dynamic input.</p>
            <p>Initially, we developed kinetic formalisms of the Hodgkin-Huxley type and solved for
                the resultant currents deterministically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Using the deterministic model we
                established that the single compartment model could account for the resting membrane
                properties of stellate neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g001">Figure
                    1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000290-t001">Table 1</xref>). As
                a further constraint we examined whether the model could account for previous
                experimental results in mice with global deletion of the gene encoding the HCN1
                channel. Thus, in addition to a wild-type version of the model, we implemented a
                version in which the fast, large I<sub>h</sub> was replaced by a smaller, slower
                current similar to that recorded in HCN1 knockout mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Nolan1">[18]</xref>. This single
                compartment, deterministic model replicated the basic effects of either HCN1
                deletion or pharmacological blockade of I<sub>h</sub> on the resting membrane

                <title>Perithreshold Membrane Potential Fluctuations in the Stochastic Model</title>
                <p>At membrane potentials just below the threshold for initiation of action
                    potentials, stellate cells generate membrane potential fluctuations with a
                    dominant frequency typically in the 5–10 Hz range <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Alonso1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Alonso2">[16]</xref>. Our previous
                    experimental studies using HCN1 knockout mice indicate that, at any given
                    membrane potential, HCN1 channels are not required for fluctuations in this
                    frequency range, but rather HCN1 channels suppress low-frequency components of
                    membrane potential activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Nolan1">[18]</xref>. However, the amplitude of the theta
                    frequency fluctuations becomes larger with depolarization towards the spike
                    threshold and if the absolute value of the membrane potential is not accounted
                    for, then deletion of HCN1 channels can appear to reduce the amplitude of
                    membrane potential fluctuations by lowering the most depolarized potential at
                    which fluctuations can be maintained without triggering action potentials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Nolan1">[18]</xref>.
                    These results contradict proposed deterministic models for the generation of
                    theta frequency fluctuations by stellate cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Dickson1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Fransn1">[26]</xref> and
                    also suggest how failure to account for differences in membrane potential could
                    lead to the conclusion that block of HCN channels abolishes theta frequency
                    fluctuations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Dickson2">[25]</xref>. Nevertheless, it has yet to be shown whether
                    these experimental observations can be accounted for in a theoretical model.</p>
                <p>We first examined the membrane potential of the stochastic models during
                    injection of constant current of amplitude adjusted to the maximum possible
                    without triggering action potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g002">Figure 2</xref>). For the wild-type and knockout
                    versions of the model this corresponded to respective mean membrane potentials
                    of −51.6 and −53.4 mV. At these membrane potentials, the
                    stochastic stellate neuron models show large fluctuations in membrane potential
                    (∼3–4 mV peak to peak; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g002">Figure 2</xref>), whereas the otherwise identical
                    deterministic models show no fluctuations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). We found that the membrane
                    potential fluctuations recorded over long epochs (20 s) are spectrally complex,
                    but show peak activation between 3–10 Hz consistent with previous
                    observations in stellate neurons <italic>in vitro</italic>

                    studies have analyzed brief epochs in which the membrane potential fluctuations

                    agreement with previous experimental data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Nolan1">[18]</xref>, these effects can
                    be explained by the ability of HCN channels to reduce the membrane impedance at
                    low frequencies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000290.s002">Figure S2</xref>). As predicted by changes in impedance, responses to a
                    white noise current stimulus, with standard deviation matched to the current
                    noise recorded in the stochastic model, were enhanced in the deterministic
                    knockout model compared with the equivalent wild-type model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Phase plots of the

                    to the net membrane current changes that drive fluctuations. Thus, the
                    stochastic model accounts well for the properties of subthreshold fluctuations
                    and their dependence upon HCN1 channels reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Alonso2">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Nolan1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-White2">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Dickson2">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Erchova1">[42]</xref>.
                    This model is consistent with perithreshold fluctuations arising from

                    initiation of an action potential appears to determine the maximal observable
                    amplitude of membrane potential fluctuations and is altered both in the HCN1

                    and in experimental recordings of stellate cells from HCN1 knockout mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Nolan1">[18]</xref>. To
                    further assess the stability of the membrane potential prior to action potential
                    initiation we injected slow, ramp-like currents that crossed spike threshold for
                    both the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g003">Figure
                    3A</xref>) and knockout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g003">Figure
                    3B</xref>) versions of the model. We averaged the membrane potential from
                    several sweeps in a time window 0.1–0.5 s before the initial action
                    potential for each trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g003">Figure
                    3E</xref>). The spike-triggered averages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) revealed that removal of the
                    HCN1-like current from the model causes spikes to initiate from a more
                    hyperpolarized membrane potential (wild-type:
                    −51.15+/−0.12 mV; knockout:
                    −52.72+/−0.12 mV;
                        P = 4×10<sup>−11</sup>;
                    N = 20 total trials; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). This difference between the
                    wild-type and knockout models is independent of stochastic channel gating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), but is to be
                    expected from the increased rate of depolarization resulting from the reduced
                    membrane conductance following removal of HCN1 channels. However, for both of
                    the deterministic models the membrane potential follows a more depolarized
                    trajectory than in the corresponding stochastic models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). This is consistent with
                    spontaneous membrane potential fluctuations in the stochastic models triggering
                    action potentials relatively early during the ramp current. Consistent with the
                    difference in responses to DC current injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g002">Figure 2</xref>), during the time-window preceding
                    the spike, the more depolarized potentials in the wild-type model are associated
                    with an increased standard deviation of the membrane potential due to stochastic
                    channel gating (wild-type: 0.90+/−0.06 mV; knockout:
                    0.69+/−0.04 mV; P = 0.005;
                        <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). The shift in
                    membrane potential stability was accompanied by a small increase in the standard
                    deviation of the time of the first action potential in the stochastic HCN1
                    knockout model (wild-type: 0.119±0.008 s; knockout:

                    potential firing at mean frequencies less than 5 Hz, the pattern of firing is
                    characterized by clusters of action potentials at a relatively high frequency
                    (8–14 Hz) interspersed with silent periods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Alonso1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Nolan1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Fernandez1">[24]</xref>. We determined
                    the conditions for initiation of spikes with mean frequencies less than 5 Hz, at
                    which clustered spike patterns might be expected. In the deterministic model the
                    transition from silence to continuous action potential firing occurs when the
                    amplitude of the injected current is increased above 258.4 pA and 320.5 pA for
                    wild-type and knockout configurations, respectively. For the deterministic
                    models this transition corresponds to a sharp transition from silence to
                    repetitive spiking at ∼6 Hz (wild type) and ∼3 Hz (HCN1
                    knockout) and clustered spike patterns were not observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000290.s005">Figure S5</xref>).
                    By contrast, the current threshold for the transition between silent and spiking
                    states was ∼246 pA and ∼308 pA for the stochastic versions of
                    the wild-type and HCN1 knockout models, respectively. In both stochastic models,
                    arbitrarily low firing frequencies could be obtained when the injected current
                    was just above this threshold. When the mean frequency of action potentials was
                    less than approximately 5 Hz, then both stochastic models generated clustered
                    patterns of spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g004">Figure
                    4</xref>). Thus, stochastic ion channel gating enables clustered patterns of
                    spikes to emerge during firing at low frequencies in response to input currents
                    that are of insufficient amplitude to initiate action potentials in the
                    corresponding deterministic model.</p>

                    firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g004">Figure 4</xref>).

                    interspike interval (ISI) distribution of the stochastic model in response to
                    constant current injection is multimodal, being characterized by both a

                    knock-out model this short latency peak is much broader than in the wild-type
                    model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Closer
                    examination of the model behavior across a range of average firing frequencies
                    revealed the characteristic tendency of stellate neurons to fire clustered
                    action potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g004">Figure 4B and
                    4D</xref>). The knockout version of the model reveals a lesser tendency to fire
                    spikes in clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g004">Figure 4C and
                        4D</xref>), consistent with the broadening of the short latency peak in the
                    ISI histogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).
                    We quantified the probability of clustering (P<sub>c</sub>) with definitions
                    used previously for experimental data (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Nolan1">[18]</xref>).
                    For the wild-type stellate neuron model P<sub>c</sub> depends upon average
                    firing frequency and peaks at intermediate (1–3 Hz) frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Importantly,
                        P<sub>c</sub> is significantly reduced in the knockout model at intermediate

                <p>We previously demonstrated that I<sub>h</sub> accelerates the repolarization from
                    the AHP in stellate neurons, while overall shorter AHPs predict an increased
                    tendency of neurons to fire clustered patterns of action potentials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Nolan1">[18]</xref>.
                    Similarly, the half-width of the AHP in the wild-type stochastic model was
                    independent of the average frequency of spike firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). In contrast, after the simulated
                    removal of HCN1 channels, the AHP half-duration was broader and varied as a
                    function of average spike frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), just as in experimental
                    recordings from stellate neurons in HCN1 knockout mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Nolan1">[18]</xref>. The increase in
                    duration of the AHP following removal of HCN1 channels was found in both
                    stochastic and deterministic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000290.s005">Figure S5</xref>) versions of the model indicating
                    that this role of I<sub>h</sub> does not require stochastic gating of the
                    membrane ion channels. To quantify spike initiation following the AHP we
                    calculated the conditional probability that a spike occurred at a time
                    <italic>t</italic> following a previous spike at time <italic>t0</italic>

                    generated by the knockout model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g005">Figure 5B, right panels</xref>), the latency to the increase in
                        P(s<sub>t</sub>|s<sub>t0</sub>) following a spike was increased and the
                    magnitude of the change in P(s<sub>t</sub>|s<sub>t0</sub>) was reduced from more
                    than 6 fold to less than 3 fold compared with spike trains generated by the
                    wild-type model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g005">Figure 5A, right
                        panel</xref>). These changes are correlated with the reduction in
                    P<sub>c</sub> observed in simulations of the knockout model across a range of
                    firing frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g004">Figure

                <p>Together, these simulations indicate that deterministic or stochastic versions of
                    our model stellate neuron are sufficient to account for the resting membrane
                    properties, subthreshold stability of the membrane potential and the sensitivity
                    of these properties to alteration of I<sub>h</sub>. However, only the version of
                    our model containing stochastically gating ion channels is able to further
                    account for the spontaneous emergence of membrane potential fluctuations at
                    potentials near threshold. Moreover, the stochastic models produce clustered
                    patterns of action potentials similar to spike patterns recorded from stellate
                    neurons from wild-type and HCN1 knockout mice. Since our characterization of the
                    stochastic models suggest that they provide a remarkably good account of
                    experimental observations of both the resting and active properties of
                    entorhinal stellate neurons, we went on to use these models to investigate how
                    stochastic ion channel gating influences spike initiation and the generation of
                    distinctive clustered patterns of action potentials.</p>

                <title>Clustered Firing Patterns Involve Brief Action Potential Dependent Changes in
                    Firing Probability</title>
                <p>How do the clustered patterns of action potentials emerge and why do they require
                    stochastic ion channel gating? In a deterministic neuron, clusters or bursts of
                    action potentials arise through modulation of spiking by slow changes in the
                    state of one or more ion channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-HarrisWarrick1">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Izhikevich1">[47]</xref>. Indeed, such a deterministic mechanism has
                    previously been proposed to account for clustered patterns of action potentials
                    fired by entorhinal stellate neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Fransn1">[26]</xref>. By this account,
                    stochastic ion channel gating may lower the threshold for spike generation, but
                    is not essential for the generation of clustered patterns of activity. However,
                    stochastic ion channel gating may permit mechanisms for control of spike
                    patterns that are not possible in deterministic models. In particular, whereas
                    initiation of an action potential in a deterministic neuron is binary, with a
                    clearly defined threshold, for stochastic neurons fluctuations in ion channel
                    activity can lead to cancellation of a spike even when the deterministic
                    threshold is crossed. At the other extreme spikes can be initiated in conditions
                    that are well below the deterministic spike threshold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Chow1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Schneidman1">[9]</xref>. Therefore, in a
                    stochastic neuron there is no clearly defined boundary between a spiking and a
                    non-spiking state and thus spike initiation should be considered probablistic
                    rather than binary.</p>
                <p>The probabilistic nature of spiking in the stochastic model leads to a simple
                    alternative mechanism for generation of clustered patterns of spikes, whereby
                    the transient elevation in the probability of spiking following a previous
                    action potential is sufficient to produce patterned output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g006">Figure 6</xref>). According to this mechanism,
                    changes in the recovery from a spike would alter the pattern of spikes by
                    modifying the spike probability immediately following the refractory period
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). As a
                    result, the activation of ion channels during each action potential and its
                    associated AHP can be independent of the position of the action potential within
                    or outside a cluster. Several lines of evidence support this probabilistic
                    mechanism.</p>

                        <p>Spiking was modeled as a stochastic point process. (A) According to the
                            point process model the stellate neuron makes stochastic transitions
                            between a silent and spiking state with a probability determined by
                                P(s<sub>t</sub>|s<sub>t0</sub>) and an instantaneous transition from
                            spiking back to silence (see text for explanation). (B) We
                            considered 4 possible P(s<sub>t</sub>|s<sub>t0</sub>) functions (left
                            panels). The “Wild-type” and
                            “Knockout” P(s<sub>t</sub>|s<sub>t0</sub>) curves
                            are taken directly from data obtained with the corresponding stochastic
                            models. In addition, Poisson processes with refractory periods of 80 and
                            125 ms were considered. ISI histograms were generated from long
                            simulations (1000 s) (right panels). For comparison an ISI distribution
                            from the wild-type stochastic stellate model is also plotted (gray

                            the P<sub>c</sub> values in the 1–2 Hz bin of simulations in

                </fig>
                <p>First, conditional probability distributions, P(s<sub>t</sub>|s<sub>t0</sub>)
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g005">Figure 5A and 5B, right
                            panels</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), reveal that the wild-type
                    version of the model produces clustered action potentials by elevating the
                    conditional probability of firing a spike, P(s<sub>t</sub>|s<sub>t0</sub>), over
                    the steady-state probability, P(s<sub>t</sub>), for a brief period of
                    ∼50 ms following a spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g005">Figure 5A, right panels</xref>). Moreover, the reduction in P<sub>c</sub>
                    in the HCN1 knockout model is correlated with a decrease in
                        P(s<sub>t</sub>|s<sub>t0</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g005">Figure 5B, right panels</xref>) as required by a
                    probabilistic mechanism for clustered firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>
                <p>Second, the number of spikes within a cluster is variable for a particular firing
                    rate (<italic>e.g.</italic> 3.11±1.7 spikes per cluster for 1.6 Hz)
                    and depends upon the average firing rate in both our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g004">Figure 4E</xref>) and experimental data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Nolan1">[18]</xref>.
                    This suggests that the number of spikes in a cluster is probabilistic and is
                    consistent with a stochastic model of spike generation, but distinct from
                    previous deterministic models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Fransn1">[26]</xref>.</p>
                <p>Third, in a deterministic mechanism the half-width of the AHP should
                    systematically vary with position in the cluster and should determine the
                    succeeding ISI when terminating a cluster. Thus, on a spike-by-spike basis we
                    would expect the AHP to correlate with the subsequent ISI. However, we find no
                    such correlation in spike trains from either the wild-type or knockout models
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g005">Figure 5D</xref>).
                    Nonetheless, in both population data from experiments and in different versions
                    of the stochastic model the AHP half-width correlates with P<sub>c</sub>. These
                    observations therefore support our conceptual model of spike patterning and
                    suggest that there may be a common ionic basis that regulates the time course of
                    both the AHP and P(s<sub>t</sub>|s<sub>t0</sub>).</p>
                <p>Fourth, to generate activity patterns that take place over relatively long time
                    scales, such as spike clusters, a deterministic model requires relatively slow
                    changes in the state of the model and at least one of the model parameters must
                    vary as a function of a spike's location within a cluster. By contrast,
                    the probabilistic mechanism of spike clustering does not require slow changes in
                    model parameters beyond the recovery period from the AHP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Consistent with this prediction we
                    find that the distribution of currents during AHP recovery is not different
                    between the first spike in a cluster and all other spikes regardless of their
                    position (see below, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g007">Figures

                <p>Fifth, the conditional spike probabilities (P(s<sub>t</sub>|s<sub>t0</sub>)) are
                    sufficient to generate spike trains with interspike interval histograms and
                    clustered patterns of spikes that are indistinguishable from spike trains
                    generated by the biophysical neuronal models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g006">Figure 6B and 6C</xref>). Thus,
                        P(s<sub>t</sub>|s<sub>t0</sub>) can fully characterize the spike train. By
                    contrast, if there were higher-order correlations in the spike probabilities, as
                    would be the case in any deterministic model of clustered spiking, then the
                    conditional probabilities would differ for each spike and no single set of
                    conditional spike probabilities would fully characterize the spike train <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Perkel1">[45]</xref>.</p>

                <title>Transient Increases in Spike Probability Following AHPs Are Associated with
                    an Inward Shift in the Balance of Membrane Currents</title>
                <p>In principle, the transient increase in the probability of action potential
                    firing that occurs following recovery from the AHP could arise though a number
                    of mechanisms: (1) A transient shift in the balance of membrane currents that
                    together determine the overall direction and rate of change of the membrane
                    potential; (2) A change in the stochastic current fluctuations that act as the
                    noise source that enables probabilistic spike firing; or (3) A reduction in the
                    threshold for spike initiation.</p>
                <p>To address the first possibility, we evaluated the membrane current at a narrow
                    range of membrane potentials (−50.5 to −49.5 mV), just below
                    the voltage threshold for spike initiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000290.s008">Figure S8</xref>).
                    In the stochastic model the membrane potential enters this range during silent
                    epochs when spikes are not initiated, immediately before initiation of the first
                    spike in a cluster and in the epoch following recovery from the AHP when a
                    subsequent spike may or may not be triggered. We therefore assigned each
                    membrane potential measurement to one of three different classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g007">Figure 7A</xref>): a 50 ms windows
                    prior to spike initiation from steady state (red); during AHP recovery of all
                    spikes without regard to their position within a cluster (blue); and silent
                    epochs during which no spiking occurred during or in the subsequent 100 ms
                    (black). For each point within these time windows we sampled the membrane
                    current if the membrane voltage was within the range −50.5 mV to
                    −49.5 mV and then generated histograms of the membrane current for
                    each epoch. Comparison of these three cases revealed that spike initiation from
                    steady state is associated with a small but significant inward shift in the net
                    ionic current relative to periods of silence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). The small shift in the mean
                    current is consistent with the low average firing frequency at steady state
                        (<italic>i.e.</italic> low P(s<sub>t</sub>)). By contrast, the recovery from
                    the AHP is associated with a larger shift (∼8 pA) of the net membrane
                    current in the inward direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g007">Figure 7A</xref>), consistent with the increase in
                    P(s<sub>t</sub>|s<sub>t0</sub>) relative to P(s<sub>t</sub>) following AHP
                    recovery and with the shift observed for spikes that initiate clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000290.s008">Figure S8</xref>).
                    Thus, during the period following recovery of the AHP, the membrane experiences
                    on balance a greater net inward current at potentials approaching threshold,
                    driving further depolarization of the membrane potential and spiking.</p>
                <p>We also evaluated whether other mechanisms might contribute to the change in
                    firing probability following recovery from the AHP. Importantly, we found no
                    difference in the standard deviation (σ) of the membrane current prior
                    to initiation of spikes from steady state
                    (σ = 16.6 pA), compared with AHP
                    recovery (σ = 16.6 pA) or silence
                    (σ = 16.5 pA), indicating that
                    stochastic current fluctuations have a similar magnitude in each condition
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Moreover,
                    there was no correlation between the membrane potential at which we detected
                    spike initiation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) and the preceding ISI for either
                    the wild-type or knockout models
                    (R&lt;1×10<sup>−4</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000290.s007">Figure S7</xref>),
                    indicating that the brief elevation in P(s<sub>t</sub>|s<sub>t0</sub>) is not
                    due to an alteration in the voltage threshold following a previous spike. Thus,
                    the shift in average membrane current, as opposed to a change in the stochastic
                    current fluctuations or spike threshold, appears to be the major determinant of
                    increased firing probability following the AHP.</p>

                <title>Slow Activation and Deactivation of I<sub>h</sub> Determines the Time Window
                    for Increased Spike Probability Following an AHP</title>
                <p>Since our experimental and modeling data indicates that HCN channels influence
                    both the AHP and clustered spiking, we asked whether changes in I<sub>h</sub>
                    during the AHP could account for the shift in membrane current that underlies
                    the increase in P(s<sub>t</sub>|s<sub>t0</sub>) relative to P(s<sub>t</sub>).
                    Importantly, the shift can be fully explained by an increase in the amplitude of
                        I<sub>h</sub> during AHP recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). By comparison another current
                    important for spike initiation, the persistent sodium current (I<sub>NaP</sub>),
                    shows no change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g007">Figure 7C</xref>).
                    Consistent with this explanation, phase plots for I<sub>h</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g007">Figure 7E</xref>) and I<sub>NaP</sub>

                    action potential, reveal an increased I<sub>h</sub> density associated with
                    recovery from the AHP.</p>
                <p>Are the kinetics of I<sub>h</sub> important for the relatively brief increase in
                        P(s<sub>t</sub>|s<sub>t0</sub>) that appears to underlie generation of
                    clustered patterns of activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g006">6</xref>)? Simulated voltage-clamp of isolated I<sub>h</sub> using a command
                    potential based upon the action potential waveform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g008">Figure 8</xref>), revealed an increased density of
                        I<sub>h</sub> following recovery from the AHP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). Comparison of the observed
                        I<sub>h</sub> (I<sub>obs</sub>) with the current density predicted from the
                    steady-state I–V relationship for I<sub>h</sub> (I<sub>ss</sub>),
                    revealed that while I<sub>obs</sub> was less than I<sub>ss</sub> at time points
                    corresponding with the peak of the AHP, during the return phase of the AHP
                        I<sub>obs</sub> is larger than I<sub>ss</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g008">Figure 8C amd 8D</xref>). This transient elevation
                    in I<sub>h</sub> relative to steady-state precedes the time course of
                        P(s<sub>t</sub>|s<sub>t0</sub>) with an expected lag for action potential
                    initiation and detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g008">Figure
                    8D</xref>). To determine if this shift in net membrane current could cause the
                    shift in firing probability, we simulated an increase in the injected current by
                    the peak value of I<sub>obs</sub>−I<sub>ss</sub>. The increase in
                        P(s<sub>t</sub>) (dashed red line; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g008">Figure 8D</xref>) during this simulation relative to
                        P(s<sub>t</sub>) under the control simulation (dashed blue line; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g008">Figure 8D</xref>) accurately predicts
                    the peak of P(s<sub>t</sub>|s<sub>t0</sub>). Thus, a brief change in the net
                    inward current due to I<sub>h</sub> during the AHP appears to be sufficient to
                    explain the magnitude and time course of P(s<sub>t</sub>|s<sub>t0</sub>).</p>

                <title>The Slow Gating Kinetics of I<sub>h</sub> Are Important for Clustered Spiking
                    in the Model</title>
                <p>To directly test the influence of the slow gating kinetics of I<sub>h</sub> on
                    action potential clustering we scaled the forward and reverse rates of the
                    closed-open transition of I<sub>h</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000290.s009">Figure S9</xref>). While scaling the kinetics did
                    not alter the magnitude of the steady-state current, it did allow I<sub>h</sub>
                    to equilibrate to the membrane potential during recovery from the AHP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g008">Figures 8E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000290.s009">S9</xref>) and
                    significantly reduced the short-latency (∼100 ms) peak in
                        P(s<sub>t</sub>|s<sub>t0</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g008">Figures 8F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000290.s009">S9</xref>). This
                    reduction in spike probability following a prior spike resulted in a
                    33% reduction in P<sub>c</sub> for a 1–2 Hz average firing
                    rate. However, changing the kinetics of I<sub>h</sub> complicates this analysis
                    and likely leads to an underestimate of the effect. For example, the change in
                    kinetics leads to a 10% reduction in the AHP half-width and increases
                    the stochastic fluctuations in I<sub>h</sub> about its mean, both of which
                    effects could increase P<sub>c</sub>. Stochastic gating of HCN currents is not
                    necessary for clustered spiking (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000290.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Thus, we also ran simulations
                    with fast, deterministic HCN channels to prevent the increase in fluctuations
                    and found that P<sub>c</sub> was reduced 40% to 0.33, close to the
                    theoretical minimum of 0.29 for a refractory Poisson process where
                        P(s<sub>t</sub>|s<sub>t0</sub>) is equal to P(s<sub>t</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p>
                <p>Together, these data suggest that activation of I<sub>h</sub> during the AHP is
                    an important determinant of both the AHP half-width and the clustering of action
                    potentials. Given the relatively slow kinetics of I<sub>h</sub> the closing of
                    HCN channels lags the depolarization of the membrane on the tail of the AHP and
                        I<sub>h</sub> fails to equilibrate to the membrane potential. As a result,
                    the AHP recovery is associated with a transient increase in I<sub>h</sub>
                    relative to steady-state that contributes to an increase in the probability of
                    action potential initiation. Moreover, this effect is robust across a range of
                    channel kinetics tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000290.s009">Figure S9</xref>). However, due to their relatively
                    small single channel conductance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Kole2">[48]</xref>, changes in mean HCN current act primarily as
                    a DC bias current, rather than as a noise source.</p>

                <p>To reduce the uncertainty of comparing the model output with <italic>in
                    vivo</italic> recordings during which the physiologically relevant inputs are
                    unknown, we first examined a wide region of stimulus space by varying the
                    standard deviation and offset of a band-limited, white noise stimulus
                    (F<sub>max</sub> = 50 Hz). In this way, we
                    obtained a description of the relationship between properties of the simulated
                    input to the model and the mean frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g009">Figure 9A</xref>) and coefficient of variation (CV;
                        <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g009">Figure 9B</xref>) of the ISI
                    distributions generated by the spike outputs from the model. Based on comparison
                    of these data with the frequency and CV of spike trains recorded <italic>in
                    vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g009">Figure 9C</xref>),
                    we selected for use in further simulations parameters that generated spike
                    trains with CV and ISI spanning the space covered by the <italic>in

                    9D</xref>). For inputs with a large standard deviation and a small offset there
                    were only small differences between output responses of the stochastic and
                    deterministic versions of the wild-type model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g009">Figure 9F</xref>; χ<sup>2</sup>-test,
                    P = 0.01). In contrast, for inputs with a large
                    offset and small standard deviation, striking differences were apparent between
                    the responses of the stochastic and deterministic models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g009">Figure 9G</xref>; χ<sup>2</sup>-test,
                    P&lt;0.0001). In both cases the stochastic model tends to redistribute the
                    average ISI distribution such that it is enriched for 100–200 ms ISIs,
                    but this effect is greater for the responses to weakly varying inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g009">Figure 9H</xref>).</p>
                <p>Unlike the <italic>in vivo</italic> experimental data, the simulations above did
                    not generate high frequency (&gt;25 Hz) bursts of spikes. However,
                    examination of the stimulus space indicated that high variance stimuli with
                    substantial DC offsets could produce spikes at high frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). Since recordings
                    of the local field potential in the medial temporal lobe <italic>in
                    vivo</italic> indicate that the network is characterized by long periods of
                    relatively uncorrelated activity interspersed with brief epochs of highly
                    correlated activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Buzsaki1">[51]</xref>, we attempted to mimic these stimulus
                    statistics by assuming that the stimulus can be characterized by a relatively
                    low average variance (characteristic of uncorrelated presynaptic activity)
                    interspersed at random (Poisson) delays
                    (λ = 1 s) with random duration
                    (λ = 200 ms) epochs of high average
                    variance (characteristic of correlated presynaptic activity). This pattern of
                    stimulation is illustrated graphically as a transition between two points in
                    stimulus space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g009">Figure 9D</xref>)
                    and resulted in a much broader ISI distribution that more closely matched the
                        <italic>in vivo</italic> data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g009">Figure 9I</xref>). Under these stimulus conditions, simulations of the
                    stochastic model also resulted in an ISI histogram enriched for intervals around
                    100 ms consistent with clustered spiking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g009">Figure 9J</xref>; χ<sup>2</sup>-test,
                    P&lt;0.0001).</p>
                <p>Finally, we sought to determine predictions the model could make for the
                        <italic>in vivo</italic> distribution of ISIs for MEC stellate neurons in
                    HCN1 knockout mice. Assuming the stimulus conditions reflect properties of the
                    inputs to the MEC <italic>in vivo</italic>, the stochastic model predicts that
                    stellate neurons from HCN1 knockout mice should show reduced average firing
                    rates (F<sub>WT</sub> = 3.77 Hz;
                    F<sub>KO</sub> = 1.01 Hz) and less clustered
                    firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g009">Figure 9K and 9L</xref>),
                    but an increase in the fraction of spikes emitted in high frequency bursts
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g009">Figure 9K</xref>). While we
                    have not found evidence for compensatory changes following HCN1 deletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Nolan1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Nolan2">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Nolan3">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Tsay1">[38]</xref>, we nevertheless also
                    considered the possibility that differences in excitability between wild-type
                    and HCN1 knockout mice may be compensated for by homeostatic changes in the
                    average strength of synaptic inputs <italic>in vivo</italic>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Turrigiano1">[52]</xref>. Thus, compensating for the shift in the current
                    threshold for spike firing following HCN1 deletion by altering the average
                    offset amplitude of the simulated <italic>in vivo</italic> synaptic input, the
                    stochastic model predicts that MEC stellate neurons from HCN1 knockout mice
                    should show a slight shift in the peak of their ISI distribution of
                    approximately +100 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g009">Figure 9K and 9L</xref>). In addition, over a range of compensation values
                    all of our simulations (data not shown) suggest that the peak of the ISI
                    distribution in the range of clustered spiking should actually increase in the
                    knockout mice presumably due to the increased impedance of the membrane near
                    threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g002">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g003">3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000290.s002">S2</xref>).</p>

            <p>Stellate neurons from layer II of the MEC have distinctive membrane properties that
                are proposed to be central to their function of integrating cortical inputs to the
                hippocampal dentate gyrus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Alonso1">[14]</xref>. We find that a biophysical model neuron in which
                the ionic currents are represented as a population of discrete, stochastically
                gating individual ion channels provides a unified biophysical account of intrinsic
                oscillations of membrane potential and clustered patterns of action potential firing
                recorded from entorhinal stellate neurons. Whereas passive properties at
                hyperpolarized potentials can be explained when ionic conductances are assumed to be
                deterministic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g001">Figure 1</xref>), the
                dynamic properties of the membrane potential near the threshold for spike initiation
                require that ionic conductances be modeled as populations of individual ion channel
                proteins subject to random fluctuations in conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g003">3</xref>). Patterned action potential firing arises
                spontaneously in the stochastic model, whereas it is absent from the deterministic
                model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Clustered
                spike patterns result from the modification of the probability of action potential
                initiation for a brief epoch following a spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The model of stellate cells that we
                developed implements an example of a general mechanism for controlling patterns of
                action potential firing by activity dependent changes in spike probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g006">Figure 6</xref>) that can be mediated by
                HCN channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g007">Figures 7</xref> and
                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g008">8</xref>). Further simulations with
                this model suggest conditions in which this mechanism could account for patterns of
                action potentials recorded from stellate neurons in behaving animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g009">Figure 9</xref>).</p>

                <title>The Patterns of Spike Output from Neurons with Stochastically Gating Ion
                    Channels Can Be Controlled by Activity Dependent Changes in Spike Probability</title>
                <p>The rules that determine transformation of synaptic input into patterns of spike
                    output are fundamental to computations carried out within the central nervous
                    system. While models of many cortical neurons take advantage of simplifying
                    assumptions that characterize spike output as an invariant function of synaptic
                    input (<italic>e.g.</italic>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Hopfield1">[53]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Shadlen1">[54]</xref>), experimental
                    recordings suggest that stellate neurons from layer II of the MEC generate
                    clustered patterns of spike output through intrinsic mechanisms that may not be
                    reducible in this way. In the biophysical model of a stellate neuron that we
                    develop here, a brief increase in spike probability immediately following
                    recovery from a preceding action potential can substantially modify the pattern
                    of spike output. In the low firing frequency regime, spikes can be initiated by
                    random fluctuations of the net membrane current. As a result of the balance of
                    currents near threshold, the low effective membrane conductance, and the
                    relatively large currents that can be produced by individual ion channels, small
                    bias currents can substantially alter the probability of firing by shifting the
                    mean of the net membrane current. This model is sufficient to explain the
                    clustered patterns of spikes that are recorded from stellate cells during
                    injection of constant current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g006">Figure 6</xref>). This mechanistic account also provides some suggestion
                    that the tendency of neurons in layer II of the MEC in behaving animals to fire
                    spikes at 5–10 Hz may result from the transient, spike-dependent
                    increase in spike probability that can influence spiking even in the presence of
                    a continuously varying barrage of synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g009">Figure 9</xref>).</p>
                <p>The model that we develop here differs from a number of other models proposed to
                    explain the integrative properties of stellate neurons. Two previous,
                    biophysically-detailed deterministic models have proposed that cyclic
                    interactions between I<sub>NaP</sub> and I<sub>h</sub> are necessary and
                    sufficient to produce perithreshold oscillations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Dickson2">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Fransn1">[26]</xref>.
                    However, this conclusion is not supported by experimental observations from
                    stellate neurons following genetic deletion of HCN1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Nolan1">[18]</xref>, or pharmacological
                    block of I<sub>h</sub>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Haas1">[22]</xref>.
                    One of these previous biophysical models also produces patterned spiking,
                    although quantitative comparisons of the patterns produced with experimental
                    data have not been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Fransn1">[26]</xref>. This previous model requires slow
                    deterministic changes in model parameters to produce clustered patterns of
                    spiking, whereas the model we propose here demonstrates that such slow changes
                    are not necessary for the emergence of clustered spike firing. Nevertheless, it
                    is possible that in entorhinal stellate neurons slow changes in ion channel
                    states could further influence spike firing patterns in addition to the
                    activity-dependent changes in spike probability that we describe here.</p>
                <p>A conductance-based stochastic model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-White2">[21]</xref> and a more abstract
                    stochastic resonate-and-fire (SIF) model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Engel1">[44]</xref> have also been
                    developed to account for the properties of stellate neurons. These models
                    successfully account for the complex spectral properties of perithreshold
                    fluctuations of membrane potential that are recorded experimentally and that are
                    also generated by the stochastic model we describe here. It was previously
                    suggested that a simplified, stochastic I<sub>NaP</sub> is sufficient to produce
                    patterened spiking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-White2">[21]</xref> through random threshold crossings and spike
                    omissions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Chow1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Schneidman1">[9]</xref>. However, the
                    spiking patterns produced due to a stochastic I<sub>NaP</sub> alone are nearly
                    identical to a stochastic point process with a refractory period and thus do not
                    provide a good match to the patterning observed experimentally (see Figure 4 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-White2">[21]</xref>). By
                    contrast, the stochastic model we describe here produces more complex spike
                    patterning that is a better match to the characteristics of clustered firing
                    observed experimentally and not well described by a refractory Poisson process
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The
                    mechanism that we suggest for generation of clustered firing patterns also
                    differs markedly from a recently proposed resonate-and-fire model that also
                    reproduces clustered firing patterns of stellate cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Engel1">[44]</xref>. The resonate and
                    fire model explicitly states that sub-threshold resonance mechanisms are
                    required to generate clustered spike patterns, whereas recent experimental
                    studies clearly dissociate sub-threshold resonance from clustered spike firing
                    patterns of stellate cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Nolan1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Fernandez1">[24]</xref>. Consistent with
                    this data, the probabilistic model that we propose does not require
                    sub-threshold resonance for generation of clustered spike firing and can provide
                    a mechanistic explanation for dissociation of these two properties.</p>

                <title>Limitations of the Stochastic Model</title>
                <p>There remain features of the firing patterns recorded experimentally from
                    stellate neurons that are not well captured by any model proposed so far. A
                    striking feature of some stellate neurons is a fairly regular intercluster
                    interval even in the absence of coherent subthreshold oscillations (<italic>e.g.</italic>
                    <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000290.s010">Figure
                    S10</xref>). Our model stellate neuron, however, appears to exhibit more widely
                    distributed intercluster intervals. One likely cause of this discrepancy is the
                    simplification of the AHP current used in the model. Indeed, early results
                    demonstrated that blockade of calcium entry can reduce the tendency of spiking
                    to be clustered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Klink1">[15]</xref>. Since neuronal morphology can influence
                    patterns of spike output <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Mainen1">[55]</xref>, a further important limitation to the model
                    that we propose here is that it is composed of only a single compartment. On the
                    one hand, this could lead to an underestimate of the influence of stochastic
                    gating, as in an extended dendritic structure fewer ion channels would
                    contribute to ionic currents in any single compartment and thus the influence of
                    stochastic channel gating on the membrane potential would be greater, as has
                    been argued to be the case for thin axons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Faisal1">[56]</xref>. On the other hand,
                    comparison between our simulations and experimental data suggest that the
                    magnitude of perithreshold oscillations and extent of spike clustering are
                    comparable or perhaps larger in the model. Assessing the contribution of
                    stochastic ion channel gating to the spatially distributed properties of
                    stellate neurons will require future studies with more detailed computational
                    models developed in parallel with more detailed electrical measurements from
                    spatially distinct regions of the neuron. Nonetheless, the general principles
                    that we establish here are likely to be robust to differences in morphology and
                    although further morphological data may improve the similarity between our model
                    data and the experimental data, simple models of neurons, neural circuits, and
                    behavior can provide important functional insights in the absence of exhaustive

                <title>HCN Channels Support Patterned Spiking</title>
                <p>Analysis of the stochastic model supports a key role for HCN channels in
                    controlling the pattern of spike output from stellate neurons and suggests how
                    the unique biophysical properties of HCN channels enable this role to be
                    achieved. Thus, HCN channels active during the AHP fail to completely deactivate
                    as the membrane potential returns to the steady-state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g007">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g008">8</xref>). As a result, HCN channels briefly
                    introduce a small bias current that substantially increases the probability of
                    initiating a subsequent action potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g008">Figure 8</xref>). To the best of our knowledge this
                    is a unique function of HCN channels that depends critically upon both their
                    activation by membrane hyperpolarization and their deactivation kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g007">Figures 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g008">8</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000290.s009">S9</xref>). Such
                    an interaction, between a bias current introduced by a slowly gating ionic
                    current with a small single channel conductance such as I<sub>h</sub> and
                    rapidly varying currents composed of ion channels with larger single channel
                    conductances, may be a general mechanism by which neurons produce changes in
                    firing properties that pattern action potential output. Importantly, under
                    naturalistic stimulus conditions, patterned spiking in the stochastic model can
                    still provide significant modifications to the response properties of stellate
                    neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Several
                    neuronal subtypes have been reported to display perithreshold oscillations of
                    membrane potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Zhu1">[58]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Strata1">[59]</xref>. If intrinsic
                    oscillations in other neurons also arise from stochastic channel gating, then
                    patterned action potential firing driven by the interaction between multiple
                    stochastic currents may also be a more general feature of neuronal spiking.</p>

                <p>The entorhinal cortex is the last stage at which cortical information is
                    processed prior to entering the hippocampal formation. Stellate cells in layer
                    II constitute a major excitatory projection to the dentate gyrus and may

                    While unreliable synaptic transmission is often considered as a noise source in
                    neural circuits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-White1">[6]</xref>, less attention is usually given to the
                    possible impact of stochastic ion channel fluctuations. Using stimulus
                    parameters selected to obtain output firing properties similar to those recorded
                        <italic>in vivo</italic>, we found that the presence of stochastically
                    gating ion channels reliably increased the number of action potentials emitted
                    with an ISI characteristic of intra-cluster intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g009">Figure 9</xref>). This tendency depended on the
                    stimulus statistics used, but is consistent with the peak in the <italic>in
                    vivo</italic> ISI histograms around 100 ms and with our explanation for
                    clustering as a transient increase in spike probability during the
                    ∼70–150 ms following an action potential. Since the trains of
                    synaptic stimuli used for these simulations have random statistics, these data
                    support the idea that the effects of stochastic ion channel gating may in some
                    conditions be superimposed on, rather than overwhelmed by, synaptic noise
                    sources. Thus, stochastic ion channel gating may have to be accounted for in
                    order to explain the firing of grid cells in behaving animals. However, further
                    evaluation of this hypothesis will require much more information about the
                    actual synaptic inputs received by grid cells. In addition, to better compare

                <p>We also attempted to predict the responses of wild-type and HCN1 knockout neurons
                    to naturalistic stimuli. These simulations suggested that in the absence of
                    changes to the input stimulus, stellate neurons lacking HCN1 will have an
                    approximately 65% reduction in average firing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g009">Figure 9</xref>). This reduced firing
                    rate is characterized by an increase in the fraction of spikes emitted in high
                    frequency bursts, or a sparsening of the response properties. There have been

                <title>Conclusion</title>
                <p>Whereas initiation of action potentials in deterministic model neurons is a
                    binary process with a clearly definable threshold, in more realistic neuronal
                    models containing stochastically gating ion channels spike initiation is
                    probablistic. Here we show that one general consequence of stochastic ion
                    channel gating is that firing of an action potential can transiently modify the
                    spike probability leading to the emergence of intrinsically generated patterns
                    of spike output. In the case of the model we develop here, activation of HCN
                    channels, during recovery from the action potential afterhyperpolarization,
                    drives a brief increase in spike probability that leads to the emergence of
                    clustered patterns of spike firing. As well as providing an account of both the
                    resting and active integrative properties of stellate neurons in the medial
                    entorhinal cortex, analysis of responses of this model to simulated <italic>in
                        vivo</italic> synaptic inputs, suggests conditions in which stochastic ion
                    channel gating might impact firing patterns of behaving animals. Thus, our
                    results suggest a mechanism by which random changes in the conformation of small
                    numbers of individual ion channel proteins could impact neural computations that
                    underlie cognitive processes such as spatial navigation and memory.</p>

                <title>Model Implementation</title>
                <p>Modeling experiments were implemented in Matlab 7 (Natick, MA) using kinetic
                    formalisms described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000290.s011">Text S1</xref>. The model has also been completely
                    replicated in NEURON 5.9, but Matlab simulations were used for the data
                    reported. The model cell was a sphere with a diameter of 50 µm and a
                    specific capacitance of 1.67 µF/cm<sup>2</sup> (to account for the
                    lack of a dendritic arbor). The model included implementations of a fast,
                    transient sodium current (NaT), a persistent sodium current (NaP), a delayed
                    rectifier-type postssium current (Kdr), a fast inactivating A-type potassium
                    current (KaF) and a slowly inactivating potassium current (KaS), a
                    “calcium-activated” potassium current (KCa), a linear
                    potassium leak (Kl) and a fast or slow hyperpolarization-activated current (Hf
                    or Hs). Hf, Hs and KCa are implemented as two-state channels, which is
                    sufficient to capture their dominant kinetics, although additional states would
                    be required to more fully capture details of their gating. NaP, KaF, and KaS,
                    were modeled with a cyclical four state inactivation model. NaT and Kdr currents
                    were modeled according to the original Hodgkin-Huxley formalism with 5 and 8
                    states, respectively. The total current density of each channel was closely
                    matched to existing data.</p>
                <p>In order to model stochastic channels, it was assumed that the states obeyed a
                    first order Markov-type probabilistic description <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Hille1">[2]</xref>. To track channel
                    populations in each state a random number was generated for each channel in a
                    given state (a “particle”) at each time step (Δt).
                    Assuming that the time step is sufficiently small the probability of a
                    transition is equal to rate×Δt, with a transition occurring in
                    the event that a random number, evenly distributed between 0 and 1 is less than
                    rate×Δt. For particles with multiple possible transitions
                        (<italic>i.e.</italic> multistate channels that have multiple transitions
                    into and out of a given state), a unique transition was chosen using
                    non-overlapping distributions of transition probabilities. Briefly, a uniformly
                    distributed collection of random numbers between zero and one, thresholded by
                    the value P (transition) will give <italic>N</italic>, the number of transitions
                    that occur. In the case where multiple transitions are possible, we observe that
                    a given “particle” can only undergo a single transition. We
                    know from probability theory that:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000290.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>However, if there can only be a single transition then:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000290.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>and thus,<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000290.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
                <p>The probability that a given transition occurs is then the sum of the elementary
                    probabilities. Dividing the probability space between 0 and 1 into bins of size
                    P(A), P(B) and 1- P(A∪B), and placing random variables uniformly
                    distributed between 0 and 1, gives the desired values for the number of
                    transitions. This brute force method is similar to the simple Monte Carlo method
                    described elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Press1">[65]</xref> and to the method used elsewhere to model
                    stochastic channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Schneidman1">[9]</xref>.</p>
                <p>The time step used was 10 µs (corresponding to the approximate minimum
                    dwell time of NaT) and numerical integration was accomplished using a 4th order
                    Runge-Kutta method (most results were confirmed using the Backward Euler
                    integration method). Simulations were run in Matlab and all analysis was
                    completed using Igor Pro (Wavemetrics; Eugene, OR). A complete description of
                    parameters used for the model currents and justification of parameters can be

                    S1</xref>. Further, each channel was implemented as either stochastic or
                    deterministic and it was ensured that in all cases the two solutions converged.
                    For some simulations a partially stochastic model was used to speed simulation
                    times and provide a good estimate of the fully stochastic model (data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g009">9</xref>). This was justified by

                <p>Throughout the text we have made reference to a number of descriptions of the
                    biophysical properties of the neuron that are elaborated upon here for clarity.
                    The passive membrane properties we characterize are the resting membrane
                    conductance and resting membrane potential. Typically these values are obtained
                    by analyzing the response of the membrane potential to small current steps. By
                    convention we assume that the state of the voltage-dependent currents is
                    unaltered. The values are then obtained by application of Ohm's Law.
                    However, during active states, when the neuron or model is depolarized away from
                    its resting potential, the assumption that the underlying conductances are
                    unaltered by small changes in injected current are generally less safe. At
                    depolarized potentials we use a modified definition of the membrane conductance
                    and consider the “effective” membrane conductance. Here we

                    <p>To analyze the spectral properties of perithreshold fluctuations in membrane
                        potential the built-in sonogram function of IGRO Pro was used to estimate
                        the short-time fourier transform (STFT) of the membrane potential response
                        to 20 s epochs of DC current injection to the model. We further used the
                        fast Fourier transform (FFT) function to determine the spectral properties
                        for the entire epoch and selected 1 s sub-epochs of the response. For the
                        full 20 s analysis the FFT result was smoothed using a Savitzky-Golay
                        algorithm (35 point) for improved display. Representative epochs were chosen
                        from the central 10 s of data based upon the appearance of coherent
                        oscillatory behavior and consistent with the changes in the power spectrum
                        observed by analyzing all such brief epochs. To compare the amplitude of
                        oscillations the mean of the integrated power spectra between 5–10
                        Hz was calculated for all epochs.</p>

                    <p>To quantify the tendency for neurons to generate clustered patterns of
                        spikes, we used previous ‘relaxed’ and

                        Subsequently, we used a single intermediate definition (400 ms intercluster

                        cluster of spikes was defined as two or more consecutive spikes with
                        interspike (intracluster) interval &lt;250 ms, preceded and followed by

                <title>Synaptic Stimulation</title>
                <p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g009">Figure 9</xref> we attempted to
                    provide a general, readily parameterized model of synaptic drive that might
                    occur <italic>in vivo</italic>. Because we used a single compartment model,
                    appropriately scaled current stimulation can be equivalent to conductance-based
                    stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Destexhe1">[66]</xref>. Further, in order to provide a readily
                    parameterized stimulus to explore the space of possible responses we chose to
                    use colored white noise. Again, over the range of frequencies where the
                    impedance of the cell membrane is maximal, random barrages of synaptic input
                    show approximately white stimulus statistics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000290-Destexhe1">[66]</xref>. For our stimulus
                    we thus create a broadband, white noise stimulus that was bandlimited to 50 Hz.
                    The standard deviation and DC offset of the current stimulus were scaled
                    according to the parameters in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g009">Figure 9A and 9B</xref> and applied directly to the model.</p>
                <p>The ISI histogram of responses to the broadband stimulus was not as broad as for
                    the <italic>in vivo</italic> experimental data. Examining the experimental data
                    revealed that this was primarily due to a lack of high-frequency (&gt;50 Hz)
                    bursting in the model. We made the assumption that occasional changes in
                    stimulus statistics could give rise to this high frequency bursting. By
                    examining the approximate length of such periods we determined that ∼200
                    ms long changes in stimulus statistics were consistent with the experimental
                    data. We assumed a Poisson distribution for the duration of these epochs of high
                    frequency activity. We chose an interval between the high frequency epochs that
                    gave an approximately correct balance in the ISI distribution
                    (mean = 1 s; Poisson distributed). Finally, the
                    amplitude of the changes in the DC component and standard deviation were taken
                    from the survey of parameter space to match the central peak of the bursting
                    ISIs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000290-g009">Figure 9</xref>).</p>
