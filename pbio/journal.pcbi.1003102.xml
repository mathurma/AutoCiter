<abstract>
<p>Conventional and regulatory T cells develop in the thymus where they are exposed to samples of self-peptide MHC (pMHC) ligands. This probabilistic process selects for cells within a range of responsiveness that allows the detection of foreign antigen without excessive responses to self. Regulatory T cells are thought to lie at the higher end of the spectrum of acceptable self-reactivity and play a crucial role in the control of autoimmunity and tolerance to innocuous antigens. While many studies have elucidated key elements influencing lineage commitment, we still lack a full understanding of how thymocytes integrate signals obtained by sampling self-peptides to make fate decisions. To address this problem, we apply stochastic models of signal integration by T cells to data from a study quantifying the development of the two lineages using controllable levels of agonist peptide in the thymus. We find two models are able to explain the observations; one in which T cells continually re-assess fate decisions on the basis of multiple summed proximal signals from TCR-pMHC interactions; and another in which TCR sensitivity is modulated over time, such that contact with the same pMHC ligand may lead to divergent outcomes at different stages of development. Neither model requires that T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are differentially susceptible to deletion or that the two lineages need qualitatively different signals for development, as have been proposed. We find additional support for the variable-sensitivity model, which is able to explain apparently paradoxical observations regarding the effect of partial and strong agonists on T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> development.</p>

<p>T cells develop in the thymus, where they are vetted – they must respond weakly to self-antigens, but not so strongly as to risk causing autoimmunity. This selection process involves developing T cells being exposed to a large sample of self-peptides presented on specialised cells in the thymus, and deciding to die or to differentiate into mature T cells of either conventional or regulatory lineages. The rules by which T cells assimilate information from these interactions to make these decisions are not known. In this study we use previously published data to assess and discriminate between different models of thymic selection and find the most support for a model in which T cells vary their sensitivity to self-peptides during their development. This allows fate decisions to be made on the basis of as few as one peptide at a time, which allows for fine specificity in the selection process.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Conventional <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> T cells (T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> T regulatory cells (T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) are essential components of the adaptive immune system. Conventional T cells develop effector function in response to foreign antigens, while natural T regulatory cells produced in the thymus play a key role in the maintenance of tolerance to self-antigens and prevent autoimmune diseases (reviewed in, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Wing1">[1]</xref>). Both populations are derived from precursors in the thymus that develop, undergo selection and differentiate into different T cell lineages. The differentiation of a thymocyte into the mature <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> T cell repertoire is dependent on the engagement of its T cell receptor (TCR) with endogenous peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on thymic antigen presenting cells. Continued very weak or null interactions between the TCR and peptide-MHC ligands (pMHC) lead to failure to positively select (‘death by neglect’) while excessively strong TCR-pMHC interactions lead to negative selection, removing highly autoreactive cells from the T cell repertoire. However, the precise rules underlying T cell precursor fate are not well understood; based on its exposure to a sample of pMHC, how and when does a thymocyte decide to become a T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, a T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, or be deleted?</p>
<p>Studies using fetal thymic organ cultures have shown that there exists a sharp avidity threshold between positive and negatively selecting ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Williams1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Daniels1">[3]</xref>. There is substantial evidence indicating that T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are induced by TCR signals that lie below this negative selection threshold, but above that required for selection into the conventional T cell pool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Maloy1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Wong1">[8]</xref>. However, many uncertainties remain. It has been shown that expression of cognate antigen (which we loosely refer to ‘agonist peptide’) in the thymic epithelium is required for the generation of T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Jordan1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Larkin1">[13]</xref>, but a recent study showed that T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> commitment occurs over a wide range of TCR affinities for a ubiquitously expressed self antigen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Lee1">[14]</xref>. Further, the partitioning of fates with increasing strength of recognition for self (deletion<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>deletion) appears to be questioned by a study in which both expression of an agonist and a weaker partial-agonist could enhance deletion, but only the agonist was able to induce the formation of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> regulatory T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-CozzoPicca1">[15]</xref>, suggesting that either the mapping of avidity to fate is more complex or that qualitatively different signals are required for T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> selection.</p>
<p>Many experimental models using TCR transgenic cells (clonal populations of T cells with identical TCR) have shown that these cells can develop into both the regulatory and conventional lineages together in the same environment. This observation implies that there is stochasticity in fate determination. This stochasticity can be partitioned conceptually into two sources that are not mutually exclusive. First, there may be heterogeneity at the early double positive <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> stage of development, even within a clonal population, that pre-disposes cells to different fates. This heterogeneity might derive, for example, from differences in expression of factors determining the baseline levels or dynamic range of TCR signalling, or other signalling proteins related to lineage commitment. Second, stochasticity may be present later in the selection process, arising at least in part because each thymocyte encounters an independent sample of self-peptide ligands. Evidence for the latter comes from observations that probabilities of deletion and T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> generation have been shown to vary with levels of agonist-peptide expression; <italic>in-vivo</italic> studies in TCR transgenic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-vanSanten1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Atibalentja1">[18]</xref> and <italic>in-vitro</italic> fetal thymic organ culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Sebzda1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Feuerer1">[21]</xref> have shown that the efficiency of T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> selection increases with modest increases in agonist-peptide expression, but drops when expression is high. (We use the term <italic>efficiency</italic> here interchangeably with the probability of experiencing a given fate.) The efficiency of selection into the T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> lineage also decreases in the presence of increasing numbers of cells of the same specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Lee1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-CozzoPicca1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Bautista1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Moran1">[24]</xref>. Thus the availability of relevant ligands, either in absolute terms or through competition, can influence fate decisions.</p>
<p>The timing of an interaction with a ligand may also influence fate. There is evidence that the sensitivity of thymocytes to TCR stimulation is increased during maturation through the subcellular localisation of signalling molecules such as tyrosine kinase Lck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Eck1">[25]</xref>; the inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation and increased expression of inhibitory tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Stephen1">[26]</xref>; the upregulation of the negative regulator CD5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Azzam1">[27]</xref>; and the increased expression of ZAP-70, a downstream target of TCR signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Saini1">[28]</xref>. However, the expression of miR-181a, a microRNA that enhances sensitivity to TCR stimulation, is reduced during thymic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Neilson1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Li1">[30]</xref>, and TCR signalling in response to low-affinity pMHC ligands is strongest in immature thymocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Davey1">[31]</xref>. The net effect of changes in TCR signal activating and inhibiting factors is not clear, but it is possible that stimulation with the same ligand will lead to different levels of activation in the same thymocyte at different stages of development.</p>
<p>The challenge of synthesising these observations and describing quantitatively how the affinity, number and timing of pMHC contacts shape the developing T cell repertoire invites a mathematical modelling approach. Models of thymic selection have been successful in providing insight into the relationship between diversity of self peptides sampled in the thymus and the cross-reactivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Chao1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Kosmrlj1">[33]</xref>, alloreactivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Detours1">[34]</xref>, size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Detours2">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Faro1">[36]</xref> and CD4SP/CD8SP ratio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-SouzaeSilva1">[37]</xref> of the selected repertoire. Models have also helped us understand the relation of HLA phenotype to viral epitope recognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Kosmrlj2">[38]</xref> and the trade-off between MHC and T cell receptor diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Borghans1">[39]</xref>. In this study we use stochastic (probabilistic) models to describe previously published <italic>in vivo</italic> data describing T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> commitment of a transgenic cell population in the presence of varying densities of agonist peptide in the thymus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-vanSanten1">[16]</xref>. These data allow us to test and discriminate between models of how developing thymocytes might integrate signals received from pMHC ligands to make lineage decisions.</p>
<p>Models of thymic selection must relate the physical interaction between a TCR and a pMHC ligand to the signal interpreted or integrated by the thymocyte. There is evidence to support competing models of TCR-pMHC interactions in which the level of T cell activation is determined by TCR-pMHC dwell times, through the kinetic proofreading model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-McKeithan1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Germain1">[41]</xref>, TCR occupancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Valitutti1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Labrecque1">[44]</xref> and overall pMHC ligand affinity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Stone1">[45]</xref>. Previous approaches to quantitative modelling of TCR-pMHC interactions can be divided into three broad categories: (i) detailed modelling of signal transduction immediately downstream of TCR-pMHC engagement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Prasad1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-AltanBonnet1">[47]</xref>; (ii) kinetic models of binding events using measured rates of TCR-pMHC association and disassociation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Currie1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Govern1">[49]</xref>; and (iii) the use of a ‘string model’ framework in which the strength of an interaction is determined by pairwise interaction energies between peptides and the aligned residues of amino acids on the variable CDR3 loop of randomly generated TCRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Chao1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Kosmrlj1">[33]</xref>. However, binding kinetic parameters are not available for the full range of endogenous peptides that are encountered during thymic development, and uncertainty remains in the relation between avidity and the signalling thresholds determining fate decisions. Here, we abstract from the mechanistic model of signal strength derived from molecular interactions. Instead we assume a distribution of signal strengths that a given TCR derives from pMHC ligands, in which low-strength signalling events occur with the greatest likelihood and, in line with our knowledge of the specificity of T cell recognition, stronger signalling events occur with decreasing probability. We show that our conclusions are insensitive to the precise form of this distribution.</p>
<p>We explore candidate mechanisms of T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> selection using the canonical hypothesis that signals associated with T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> commitment are stronger than those required for T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> commitment but are below the threshold for negative selection. We use the data of van Santen <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-vanSanten1">[16]</xref> to reject a simple model of the selection process in which thymocyte fate is based on testing sequential single TCR-pMHC interactions. Instead, we find the data can be explained with two generalisations of this model in which perceived TCR signal strength correlates to a strict hierarchy of cell fates (neglect<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> negative selection). In both models, thymocytes are continuously initiating fate decisions based on measuring the strength of binding to self peptide-MHC ligands in a series of encounters with antigen-presenting cells. In one class of model, the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> model, cells measure the avidity of each encounter, each of which comprises binding to a sample of multiple self-peptide-MHC ligands simultaneously. The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> model is motivated by studies implicating the integration of signals from multiple pMHC interactions in the priming of mature T cells by antigen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Underhill1">[50]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Mempel1">[53]</xref>. In the second class of model, the two-phase model, we examine the consequences of TCR sensitivity of thymocytes varying during development. In this model a cell's interpretation of the signal derived from a given ligand depends on whether it occurs early or late in selection. We show that both models are able to describe the data, and also make predictions that are consistent with studies quantifying the efficiency of T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> selection with avidity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Lee1">[14]</xref>. However, we argue that variable TCR sensitivity is required to explain the effect of partial and full agonist peptide expression in the thymus on T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> generation and negative selection reported by Cozzo Picca and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-CozzoPicca1">[15]</xref>.</p>

In one, the distribution of signal strengths resulting from encounters is constant throughout the selection period - the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> model.

<p>The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> interactions constituting an encounter may occur simultaneously, or sequentially within a time interval that is short compared to the decay time for TCR signals transduced by binding to pMHC. We consider an encounter to be the unit of information that can influence fate decisions. When one TCR binds to one randomly chosen pMHC, the contact results in a signal of strength drawn from an unknown probability distribution. One correlate of ‘strength’ might be the affinity of binding. Indeed affinity of binding to selecting pMHC ligands has been demonstrated to be linearly proportional to selection efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Lee1">[14]</xref>. Similarly, when signals from multiple, proximal TCR-pMHC binding events are integrated in each encounter (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), the resulting signal strength might be related to the avidity of the interaction. However we allow freedom in the interpretation of the term <italic>strength</italic> to allow for non-linear relationships between the off-rate of a TCR-pMHC complex and the signal transduced by the TCR. It is simply the quantity resulting from each encounter that the T cell uses in its fate-determination machinery. We assume a log-normal distribution of signal strengths, for reasons we discuss below.</p>
<p>To illustrate the calculation of selection efficiencies in this model, consider the case <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003102-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

As <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e140" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> increases, the distribution becomes smoother and shifts rightwards with increasing <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e141" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003102-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003102.s005">Text S1</xref> contains the calculation of the selection probabilities for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e142" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>Given the complexities of TCR signalling, individual TCR binding events may not contribute linearly to an encounter's strength, however ‘strength’ is defined. However for our arguments all we require is (i) that endogeneous pMHC provide a smooth distribution of signal strengths arising from encounters, (ii) when agonist is present at frequency <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e143" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, this distribution shifts rightwards, and (iii) the more pMHC involved in an encounter, the smoother this perturbed distribution is. The additive model is a minimal model that gives this biologically reasonable behaviour.</p>

<title>The choice of the distribution of signal strengths</title>
<p>In both models, a thymocyte's fate is determined by the maximum signal strength experienced over a large number of encounters. We assume the strength of a single TCR-pMHC binding is log-normally distributed. The strength of an encounter (the sum of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e165" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> proximal TCR-pMHC interactions) is then also approximately log-normally distributed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Nadarajah1">[55]</xref>. We choose the log-normal distribution because it is ubiquitous in cell biology, and arises naturally when a random variable is derived from multiplying random variables from arbitrary distributions – such as concentrations of different signalling molecules in signal transduction pathways. However the maximum value of a large sample drawn from any heavy-tailed distribution converges to the same (Fréchet) distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Fisher1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Gnedenko1">[57]</xref>. Each thymocyte is indeed expected to participate in a large number of encounters, and so our results hold for any heavy-tailed distribution of TCR-pMHC interaction strengths. Further, relative, not absolute, values of these signal strengths are key to the modelling of fate decisions and so we can set the mean of this distribution to be 1. The variance of the distribution is a free parameter which also does not influence our conclusions, but we discuss its influence on some parameter estimates in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref>.</p>

Other parameters were estimated simultaneously, but several quantities were taken as inputs to the models because the data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-vanSanten1">[16]</xref> did not allow us to parameterise them directly. These were (i) the parameters specifying the relation between relative RNA expression and absolute peptide abundance; (ii) the distribution of signal strengths obtained by the AND TCR from randomly sampled self pMHC ligands; and (iii) the relation between selection probabilities and absolute cell numbers. First, we explored ranges of parameters defining the mapping function (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003102.e170">equation 6</xref>); <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e184" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We chose to use this generic sigmoid dose-response curve given our ignorance of the mechanistic relation between RNA expression and peptide-MHC abundance on thymic epithelial cells. However, we were able to partially validate this choice of function, and the region of parameter space that we explored, using data from the study by Obst <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Obst1">[58]</xref>. They characterised the relation between the degree of activation of adoptively transferred AND <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e185" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> T cells and the relative TIM RNA expression on MHC class II-expressing cells, using a similar tetracycline-inducible expression system to that used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-vanSanten1">[16]</xref>. Their readout of immune activation was the fraction of AND cells that had divided 60 h following induction of TIM expression. Assuming this fraction is linearly related to peptide availability we used the data from Obst <italic>et al.</italic> to estimate the parameters of the mapping function (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003102.e170">equation 6</xref>). We found that both the recruited fraction and an alternative measure of immune activation, the estimated <italic>per capita</italic> rate of recruitment into division, yielded mappings within the envelope of functions generated with our parameter ranges. These mappings also lay well within the 95% uncertainty envelope generated by the best-fitting parameters from our analysis of the data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-vanSanten1">[16]</xref>. For details, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003102.s007">Text S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003102.s001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003102.s004">Table S1</xref>.

<p>The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e189" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> model is characterised by a further six parameters (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e190" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) but three could be eliminated or constrained. First, because the AND TCR is strongly selecting we assumed that the probability of any one encounter falling below the positive selection threshold, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e191" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, is small.

Thymocytes move through the medulla and cortex at similar speeds (15 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e193" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>m/min and 10 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e194" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>m/min, respectively) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-LeBorgne1">[59]</xref>. In the medulla, these speeds were shown to be associated with DC contacts at a rate of between 4 and 7 per hour, respectively. If we assume that additional contacts with TECs will contribute up to 50 contacts per hour, and that the time-spent in the thymus is between 5–10 days, then 10000 is a plausible upper bound on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e195" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We used a conservative lower bound of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e196" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

Assuming there is a positive relationship between TIM peptide presentation (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e221" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and relative TIM RNA expression, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003102.e125">equation 4</xref> shows that a model in which fate decisions are re-evaluated after single TCR-pMHC contacts (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e222" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) can describe the T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e223" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> data, which falls progressively with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e224" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>However, we can see using a graphical argument (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003102-g006">Figure 6</xref>, upper panel) that the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e225" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> model with constant TCR sensitivity will only be able to capture the trend in T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e226" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> numbers if encounters comprise TCR signals integrated over multiple pMHC bindings (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e227" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). If the strength of an interaction between a single AND-TCR and agonist TIM (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e228" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) lies within the T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e229" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-selecting range <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e230" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we would expect to see a monotonic increase in T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e231" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> numbers with increasing agonist peptide expression; as agonist becomes more abundant, progressively more probability mass is contained within this area, boosting the probability of T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e232" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003102-g005">Figure 5</xref>, upper panel; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003102-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, dotted-blue curve). Here, the one-hit model predicts that the absolute increase in T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e233" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> numbers is greater than or equal to the absolute decline in T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e234" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> numbers. Conversely, if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e235" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is above the threshold for negative selection, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e236" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, then we would predict a continuous decrease in T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e237" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as agonist peptide becomes more abundant and increases the probability of deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003102-g005">Figure 5</xref>, upper panel; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003102-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, dashed red curve). Neither of these trends are what is observed and so we rule out these scenarios. Finally, we can exclude the possibility that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e238" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> lies within the T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e239" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> -selecting range; if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e240" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, increasing TIM expression would then increase the probability of selection into T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e241" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which we do not observe. Thus we can reject the simple one-hit model for selection of AND thymocytes.</p>

The trend in T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e252" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> numbers arises from the balance between an increasing probability of receiving a T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e253" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> -selecting signal with agonist expression in the low-sensitivity phase, and a decreasing probability in the higher-sensitivity phase.</p>

<title>The data are consistent with a model in which fate decisions derive from integrating multiple TCR-pMHC encounters</title>
<p>Extending the argument above, to explain the rise and fall of T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e260" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> numbers with agonist peptide expression (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e261" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) requires the probability mass within the T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e262" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-selecting region to increase then decrease with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e263" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This becomes possible when thymocytes read multiple TCR-pMHC bindings simultaneously (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e264" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Qualitatively, this is because when <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e265" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, replacing an increasing fraction of endogenous peptides with TIM (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e266" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) right-shifts the distribution of encounter strengths and, in contrast to the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e267" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> case, increases the probability of an encounter within both the T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e268" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and negative-selection regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003102-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The probability contained below the T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e269" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> selection threshold falls with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e270" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, consistent with T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e271" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> numbers falling; the probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e272" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of an encounter occurring within the T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e273" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> zone first increases then decreases with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e274" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, as required to explain the data; and the probability of negative selection continually increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003102-g006">Figure 6</xref>, middle panel).</p>
<p>We explored this quantitatively and sought to identify the parameters of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e275" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> model from the data. They cannot all be identified uniquely. As described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref> we took the approach of exploring a range of plausible parameters governing the function mapping RNA expression to endogenous peptide replacement by TIM, and a range of values of the maximum number of encounters, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e276" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>Remarkably, all values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e277" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> yielded equivalent descriptions of the data, and the encounter size <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e278" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was highly insensitive to other parameters; it lay between 2 and 5 for all models, with best fitting value <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e279" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, independent of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e280" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We also found that a range of mapping functions were able to describe the data equally well (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003102.s004">Table S1</xref>). In particular, we predict that at maximum RNA expression, TIM replaces beween 0.1% and 12% of endogenous peptides. Representative fits to the data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003102-g007">Figure 7</xref>. Panel A illustrates the failure of the one-hit model, with the best fit obtained by forcing <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e281" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Panel B shows the fit achieved with the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e282" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> model with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e283" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> a free parameter.</p>
<p>The estimate of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e284" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is also independent of the variance of the TCR-pMHC signal strength distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e285" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This also derives from the fact that the key quantities are just the probabilities <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e286" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of interactions lying between the different thresholds <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e287" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. However these thresholds become increasingly spaced with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e288" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (that is, as the log-normal distribution becomes increasingly fat-tailed). The less heavy-tailed the distribution of signal strengths, the smaller is the window of affinity/avidity for triggering T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e289" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> development with respect to the mean signal strength. Small increases in affinity can shift TCR signals from positively to negatively selecting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Williams1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Daniels1">[3]</xref>, and so if signal strength relates linearly to affinity or avidity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Lee1">[14]</xref>, our model predicts that the distribution of encounter strengths with self may not be strongly heavy-tailed.</p>

<title>The estimated encounter size <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e290" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> increases in the presence of null peptides</title>
<p>Anything between ten and a few hundred pMHC have been shown to be required for T cell activation (see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Irvine1">[60]</xref>) and as few as 3–5 for pMHC recognition by cytotoxic T cell effector function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Brower1">[61]</xref>, although with the extent of TCR binding influencing the degree of activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Valitutti1">[42]</xref>. However, data interpreted using the kinetic proofreading model suggest that multiple interactions with very weak ligands may not lead to activation at the whole cell level (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-McKeithan1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Germain1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Naeher1">[62]</xref>). Therefore we wanted to test whether the low estimates of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e291" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are an artefact of the assumption that every TCR-pMHC interaction generates a signal and so an encounter comprising <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e292" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> weak TCR-pMHC bindings might still lead to strong signalling.</p>
<p>To do this, we extended the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e293" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> model such that only a fraction (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e294" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) of self-peptides are capable of inducing a signal through the AND TCR, and the remaining fraction <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e295" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are classifed as null. This introduces a stochastic element to the number of TCR contributing to the signal from each encounter. We found that increasing the abundance of null ligands increases the estimated TCR engagements per encounter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003102.s004">Table S1</xref>). For example, we estimate the number of proximal TCR-pMHC engagements per encounter (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e296" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) to be between 20–190 if 99% of peptides fail to trigger the TCR, and between 350–1000 when 99.9% of peptides are null. Intuitively, the increase in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e297" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> derives from the dilution of the information content of each encounter by the presence of null peptides. For each encounter to be a unit of sufficient information with which fate decisions can be triggered, the sample size <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e298" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> must increase in the presence of null interactions. As for the simpler model (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e299" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) the estimate of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e300" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is also independent of the number of encounters, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e301" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>Therefore, this extended model predicts that in the AND TCR system the expected number of productive TCR-peptide MHC interaction per encounter remains remarkably small (of the order 1). This is perhaps unsurprising, as low values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e302" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> will allow thymocytes to discriminate between ligands with small differences in affinity.</p>

<title>The two-phase model also explains the dependence of T<sub>reg</sub> and T<sub>conv</sub> on agonist expression</title>
<p>Next we explored the implications of a time-varying sensitivity of thymocytes to TCR stimulation during maturation. The two phase model, as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref>, extends the one-hit model to include time-varying TCR sensitivity. Its predictions are independent of the direction of variation, but to illustrate we assume an interaction with agonist leads to T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e303" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> commitment during phase A early in development, but causes deletion in phase B when the same peptide is capable of inducing a stronger downstream TCR signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003102-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Selection into the T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e304" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> lineage is still possible in both phases; what changes between phase A and phase B is a right-shift in the distribution of signal strengths with respect to the selection thresholds. This shift in probabilities within the different fate-determining affinity ranges yields the required trends in T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e305" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e306" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> production with TIM expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003102-g006">Figure 6</xref>, lower panel).</p>

<title>Model discrimination: The two-phase model is required to explain the effect of partial and full agonists on T<sub>reg</sub> selection</title>
<p>We have used data in which there is a profound loss of conventional T cells in the presence of relatively low frequency of agonist peptide, while T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e318" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> numbers are maintained and even initially increase with moderate increases in agonist frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003102-g001">Figure 1</xref>). These observations suggested the hypothesis that regulatory T cells are intrinsically more resilient to deletion by agonist peptides than conventional T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-vanSanten1">[16]</xref>. Further, the study by Cozzo Picca <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-CozzoPicca1">[15]</xref> showed that a partial agonist can induce deletion of conventional T cells but only an agonist could boost regulatory T cell generation. This led to a hypothesis that agonist peptide may deliver a qualitatively different signal that induces regulatory T cells.</p>
<p>We argue that neither of these hypotheses need be invoked. We have shown that both models can explain the first set of observations within a single affinity/avidity framework with different thresholds, without the need to assume differential susceptibilities of T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e319" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e320" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to deletion. Further, we can see immediately that the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e321" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> model will not explain the partial/full agonist observations in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-CozzoPicca1">[15]</xref>. Their observation that partial agonist increases the probability of deletion with no increase in T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e322" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> suggests that the presence of the partial agonist shifts the distribution of the sum of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e323" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> interactions far to the right of the wild-type distribution, such that the bulk of the distribution is contained above the negative selection threshold. It follows that strong agonist must push this distribution even further rightwards, and so the probability of signals lying within the T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e324" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-inducing zone must fall.

<p>In contrast, the simple two-phase model can explain the effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003102-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Assume that the partial agonist is not strong enough to induce T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e326" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> commitment in phase A when the TCR is relatively insensitive, but in the more sensitive phase B delivers a signal that lies above the negative selection threshold. Then the net effect of introducing a weak agonist is to increase deletion and have little effect on T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e327" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> numbers, as is observed. In contrast, suppose the strong agonist triggers T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e328" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> commitment when the TCR in phase A, but is negatively selecting in phase B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003102-g009">Figure 9</xref>, right hand columns). Then (i) expression of the strong agonist will always lead to a fall in conventional T cell numbers, and (ii) moderate levels of strong agonist, while increasing the overall probability of negative selection, can drive a net increase in T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e329" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> production by boosting the probability of receiving a T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e330" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-inducing signal in phase A.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>How does a thymocyte decide to become a conventional or regulatory T cell, or die, and when are these decisions most likely to take place? To address these questions, we have used experimental data to test models of how thymocytes interpret TCR interactions with self-peptide MHC to make fate decisions. We showed that the data cannot be explained with a model in which (from a given TCR's perspective) individual self-peptide MHC ligands are classed as positively selecting, negatively selecting or promoting T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e339" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> development, and in which a single engagement with a strong agonist pMHC is sufficient to influence cell fate. Instead we found stronger and roughly equivalent support for two alternative models, in which (i) a thymocyte bases decisions on TCR signals summed from multiple engagements with pMHC ligands, and/or (ii) a two-phase model in which TCR sensitivity alters during development, and so an engagement with the same pMHC ligand may lead to divergent outcomes at different stages of development. A robust prediction of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e340" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> model is that the number of non-null TCR-self-peptide interactions per encounter that contribute to fate decisions is remarkably small. The two-phase model predicts that the initiation of differentiation into the T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e341" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> lineage is most efficient during a relatively short temporal window during which the TCR is less sensitive to stimulation. Importantly, the models express the probabilistic aspect of thymic selection that likely underlies the heterogeneity in lineage decisions within a clonotypic population.</p>

<title>Explaining selection efficiency as a function of TCR affinity</title>
<p>We focused here on a system in which agonist availability could be manipulated. We can also use the models to make predictions regarding selection efficiency as a function of TCR affinity. Lee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Lee1">[14]</xref> quantified the efficiency of T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e342" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> selection in the rat insulin promoter (RIP)-mOVA system for a range of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e343" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> TCR clones with varying affinity for OVA. They found T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e344" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> were generated across a broad range of reactivities and found an increase in T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e345" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> selection efficiency with increasing affinity for a self peptide. Both the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e346" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and variable-sensitivity models are able to explain these observations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003102.s008">Text S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003102.s003">Figure S3</xref>), but they make distinct predictions. The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e347" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> model predicts that the probability of the summed-proximal signals at each encounter exceeding the T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e348" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> threshold is lower for weaker clones; but this probability remains constant throughout development. A variable-sensitivity model predicts that T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e349" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> selection efficiency is determined by the duration of the window in which agonist contact triggers T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e350" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> commitment. In an increasing-sensitivity scenario, clones that recognise OVA more weakly will take longer to reach a level of TCR sensitivity that can induce T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e351" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and so a prediction of the model is that lower-affinity TCR clones will commit to the T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e352" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> lineage later in development.</p>
<p>These models might be distinguished by manipulating thymocytes' TCR sensitivity, for example through altered expression of signalling proteins, at different stages of thymocyte development. The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e353" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> model predicts that the efficiency of T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e354" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> selection would be altered equally for all clones, whereas a model of increasing TCR sensitivity predicts that damping of TCR signalling later in development would most strongly reduce T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e355" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> selection efficiency for clones with low affinity for self peptide.</p>

<title>Robustness of results despite parameter uncertainties</title>
<p>We deliberately did not use model selection criteria to discriminate between models, in part because it is not possible to identify all parameters uniquely. Instead we identified regions of parameter space for each model that provided reasonable descriptions of the data. Importantly, the predicted values of the encounter size <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e356" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for different abundances of null peptides (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e357" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) are insensitive to the remaining parameters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003102.s004">Table S1</xref>). We consider the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e358" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and two-phase models capable of describing the data equally well because they are able to capture the decline in T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e359" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and increase then decrease in T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e360" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with TIM abundance. Both models capture this behaviour provided TIM abundance increases monotonically with RNA expression, which we expect to be the case. Further, model selection criteria are not required to reject the simplest one-hit model, nor to compare the abilities of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e361" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and two-phase models to describe the partial agonist observations.</p>

<title>The effect of integrating many intermediate affinity binding events</title>
<p>One prediction of an avidity-based model is that thymocytes may be deleted if they interact simultaneously with several pMHC at moderate affinities.

</sec><sec id="s4d">
<title>Generalisations of the two models</title>
<p>The two mechanisms we explore here are not mutually exclusive. We illustrated the two-phase model assuming that decisions are made based on single, rather than summed interactions with pMHC. However it can be generalised to an extended version of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e362" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> model in which encounters are interpreted differently as TCR sensitivity increases. This model will be able to explain the observations a least as well as the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e363" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or two phase models, at the cost of extra parameters. Also, we illustrated the impact of increasing TCR sensitivity with a simple model that divided development into two discrete phases, while increases in TCR sensitivity are likely to be continuous. Modelling smooth changes in TCR sensitivity will introduce additional parameters but we expect such a model to yield qualitatively similar results. Importantly, our analysis does not exclude the possibility that T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e364" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are more resistant to deletion and/or that qualitatively different signals are involved in T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e365" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e366" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> commitment; we simply show that these mechanisms need not be invoked to explain the observations.</p>

We assumed this threshold is very low for the AND thymocytes, which are strongly selecting under normal conditions. These cells will presumably receive essentially continuous positively selecting signals. In the general case, and particularly for weakly signalling TCRs that are near the threshold for death by neglect, the threshold <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e368" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> would need to be included in the parameter search and the model would be extended to include a memory of recent interactions; one possibility is a model in which levels of survival or fate-determining proteins are increased by TCR signalling but decay in its absence.</p>

<title>The role of precursor frequency in limiting T<sub>reg</sub> development</title>
<p>There is substantial evidence that increasing the frequency of a given clonal (single TCR specificity) population reduces its efficiency of selection and in particular the probability of being directed into the T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e369" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Lee1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Bautista1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Moran1">[24]</xref>. Our models treat cells as independent entities and do not explicitly incorporate the possibility that competition between thymocytes of similar TCR specificities might influence the availability of selecting ligands. However one mechanism of competition can be represented quite straightforwardly in the models. If the strength of an encounter correlates with its duration, or perhaps increases the probability of internalisation of the pMHC ligand by the thymocyte, the TCR-specific cells will compete for and possibly sequester agonist and other high-avidity pMHC ligands. This will shift the apparent distribution of signal strengths leftwards towards lower avidity (and more available) interactions, reducing the probability of acquiring T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e370" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-selecting signals. This model of competition for higher-avidity pMHC ligands may also explain the observation that the efficiency of T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e371" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> selection can increase with precursor frequency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Bautista1">[22]</xref>.

Whatever the precise role for IL-2, it must operate downstream of fate-determining signals if selection is governed by a hierarchy of TCR avidity thresholds.

T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e376" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> numbers increase with TIM at low expression levels, indicating that IL-2 cannot be limiting in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003102-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e386" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> model suggests that diversion into the regulatory T cell lineage occurs with constant probability per encounter throughout selection. In contrast, the key prediction of the two-phase model is that the development of AND TCR T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e387" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is triggered most efficiently within a relative short window during which thymocytes are relatively insensitive to TCR signalling. This window is estimated to span roughly 2% of the total pMHC ligands sampled, with the caveat that the two-phase model is an abstraction of what is more likely to be a temporally graded shift in sensitivity.</p>
<p>The two-phase model's predictions are identical whether the shorter, less sensitive phase occurs early or late in development. However, expression of the downstream TCR-signalling protein Zap70 increases progressively between the double positive (DP) and single positive stages of thymocyte development, and is associated with increasing sensitivity to TCR stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Saini1">[28]</xref>; immature DP thymocytes display lower surface expression of TCRs, as compared to mature single positive (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e388" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e389" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) thymocytes, and TCR signalling may be actively inhibited in immature DPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Nakayama1">[74]</xref>. Thymocytes' signalling environment may also change as they develop. Selection begins in the thymic cortex, where pMHC are encountered on cortical thymic epithelial cells, before cells migrate to the medulla where they encounter pMHC on medullary thymic epithelial cells and dendritic cells. It is thought that levels of co-stimulation and antigen presentation are generally lower in the cortex than in the medulla <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Lorenz1">[75]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003102-Gray1">[77]</xref>, suggesting that there may be an effective increase in TCR signalling during development. Using these observations, the two-phase model predicts that T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e390" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> development begins predominantly, but not exclusively, during a short window at the earliest double positive stage of selection. Clearly, definitive experimental identification of when T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e391" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> development is initiated will substantially increase our understanding of how thymocytes process information.</p>

<title>Ligand discrimination — a role for time-varying TCR sensitivity in the thymus?</title>
<p>Reliable recognition and discrimination of self and nonself ligands requires both TCR sensitivity and specificity. Specificity will decrease as the number of pMHC integrated per encounter (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e392" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) increases — when <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e393" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is large, many pMHC engagements are integrated at each encounter, and so the thymocyte is then just sampling the mean of the distribution of pMHC affinities, and information is lost. This may explain why the optimum values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e394" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e395" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> model are at the lower end of the reported numbers of pMHC engagements required for T cell activation; T cell activation may invole a relatively small number of informative TCR recognition events, together with many brief engagements with null or very low affinity peptide ligands. Our analysis of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e396" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> model places small lower bounds on the number of non-null TCR engagements per encounter; but the two-phase model explains the data by allowing even a single non-null pMHC recognition event to influence fate. We speculate that varying TCR sensitivity with time in the thymus may allow for increased specificity in self-nonself discrimination.</p>

This model can be extended to include multiple pMHC per encounter and with it a similar schematic can be used to explain the observations. As before, the temporal order of the low and high TCR sensitivity phases has no effect on our results; here we illustrate the argument for an increasing-sensitivity model. The presence of partial agonist may make T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e400" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> commitment far more likely than T<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003102.e401" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> commitment in phase of lower TCR sensitivity (upper left panel).
