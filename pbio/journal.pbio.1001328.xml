        <p>A large-scale comparative gene expression study reveals the different ways in which the chromosome-wide gene dosage reductions resulting from sex chromosome differentiation events were compensated during mammalian and avian evolution.</p>
      </abstract><abstract>
        <p>As a result of sex chromosome differentiation from ancestral autosomes, male mammalian cells only contain one X chromosome. It has long been hypothesized that X-linked gene expression levels have become doubled in males to restore the original transcriptional output, and that the resulting X overexpression in females then drove the evolution of X inactivation (XCI). However, this model has never been directly tested and patterns and mechanisms of dosage compensation across different mammals and birds generally remain little understood. Here we trace the evolution of dosage compensation using extensive transcriptome data from males and females representing all major mammalian lineages and birds. Our analyses suggest that the X has become globally upregulated in marsupials, whereas we do not detect a global upregulation of this chromosome in placental mammals. However, we find that a subset of autosomal genes interacting with X-linked genes have become downregulated in placentals upon the emergence of sex chromosomes. Thus, different driving forces may underlie the evolution of XCI and the highly efficient equilibration of X expression levels between the sexes observed for both of these lineages. In the egg-laying monotremes and birds, which have partially homologous sex chromosome systems, partial upregulation of the X (Z in birds) evolved but is largely restricted to the heterogametic sex, which provides an explanation for the partially sex-biased X (Z) expression and lack of global inactivation mechanisms in these lineages. Our findings suggest that dosage reductions imposed by sex chromosome differentiation events in amniotes were resolved in strikingly different ways.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Mammalian sex chromosomes (the X and Y) evolved from an ordinary pair of ancestral somatic chromosomes (the proto-sex chromosomes). The process that led to emergence of distinct sex chromosomes involved the degeneration of the Y chromosome, leaving males with only one copy of most proto-sex chromosomal genes on their single X chromosome. It has remained unclear whether mechanisms evolved that compensate for this dosage reduction. Here we trace the evolution of sex chromosomal expression levels in all major mammalian lineages and in birds. We find that the X has become globally upregulated in response to the dosage reduction in marsupials, whereas in placental mammals, genes resident on autosomal (non-sex) chromosomes that interact with X-linked genes have instead become downregulated. These mechanisms restore ancestral gene expression balances and also presumably drove the evolution of secondary compensation mechanisms (i.e., female X-inactivation) in these mammalian lineages. In egg-laying mammals and birds, sex chromosomes have become partially upregulated specifically in the heterogametic sex, i.e., in male monotremes (which are XY) and female birds (which are WZ). This probably explains why the evolution of inactivation mechanisms in the homogametic sexes in these lineages (XX and ZZ, respectively) was not necessary. Our findings suggest that gene dosage alterations associated with the emergence of sex chromosome systems can be compensated in various different ways.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In mammals and birds, sex is determined by pairs of heteromorphic sex chromosomes that differentiated from ancestral autosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Ohno1">[1]</xref>. All mammals evolved sex chromosomes with male heterogamety (XY system), but different sets of ancestral autosomes evolved into sex chromosomes in therian (placental/marsupial) and monotreme mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, placental mammals (eutherians) and marsupials share the same X and Y, whereas the multiple X and Y chromosomes of the egg-laying monotremes are distinct and partially homologous to the sex chromosomes of birds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Potrzebowski1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Grutzner1">[4]</xref>, where females are heterogametic (ZW system).</p>

          <title>Median male versus female expression levels of mammalian X-linked and avian Z-linked genes in five somatic tissues.</title>
          <p>Top: Median male to female (M∶F) gene expression level ratios and 95% confidence intervals for five somatic tissues derived from nine mammals and one bird. M∶F ratio calculations are based on genes expressed in both sexes (RPKM&gt;0). Values are plotted on a log<sub>2</sub> scale to allow for linear and symmetrical patterns (e.g., same distances for two-fold higher expression levels in males or females, respectively). Statistically significant deviations of M∶F ratios from key reference values (orange/blue boxes): 0.5 (log<sub>2</sub> ratio of −1); 1 (log<sub>2</sub> ratio of 0); and 2 (log<sub>2</sub> ratio of 1), as assessed by one-sample Wilcoxon signed rank tests (Bonferroni corrected <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). Numbers of X (X<sub>5</sub>, Z) genes considered in the analysis are: 664 (human), 520 (chimp), 657 (gorilla), 606 (orang), 731 (macaque), 750 (mouse), 442 (opossum), 137 (platypus), 733 (chicken). Bottom: Schematic tree illustrating the phylogenetic relationships and sex chromosomes (homologous therian XY chromosomes in red; [partially] homologous platypus and bird sex chromosomes in blue) of the amniote lineages for which male and female expression was compared. Specifically, male and female expression values were compared for the therian X, platypus X<sub>5</sub> (highlighted in pink), and chicken Z chromosome. Approximate divergence time estimates (million years ago [Mya]) are based on previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Janecka1">[52]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Kumar1">[55]</xref>. Note that the expression ratios shown for eutherians are based on protein-coding genes from the entire X chromosome, that is, the ancestral part of the eutherian X (the so-called XCR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Ross1">[31]</xref>, as well as the region that became X-linked during early eutherian evolution (termed XAR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Ross1">[31]</xref>. Expression ratios for the XCR only are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s001">Figure S1</xref>.</p>

      <p>The process of sex chromosome differentiation in mammals and birds involved the degeneration of the sex-specific chromosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Charlesworth1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Charlesworth2">[7]</xref>. The prevailing theory, originally put forward by Susumu Ohno in 1967 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Ohno1">[1]</xref>, posits that this dosage reduction in the heterogametic sex led to the evolution of dosage compensation mechanisms in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Payer1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Charlesworth3">[10]</xref>. Specifically, to compensate for the two-fold reduction of the transcriptional output from the remaining single X in males, X-linked genes are thought to have evolved two-fold higher expression levels, which restored ancestral transcript levels of the X in males and thus also maintained the balance between X-linked and autosomal gene expression in this sex. The resulting overabundance of X transcripts resulting from the combined activity of the two upregulated X chromosomes in females was then compensated by the inactivation of one of the X chromosomes (XCI).</p>
      <p>Several previous studies sought to assess the extent of X upregulation in eutherians on the basis of comparisons of current expression levels between present-day X-linked and autosomal genes. Initial analyses of human and mouse microarray data suggested an approximately two-fold upregulation of the single active X in eutherians, on the basis of the observation that the extant X and autosomes have overall similar transcriptional outputs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Nguyen1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Lin1">[12]</xref>. However, a subsequent study by Xiong et al., based on RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data, found the X to only have approximately half of the transcriptional output of autosomes, thus questioning the occurrence of X upregulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Xiong1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Recently, however, three other RNA-seq–based studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Deng1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Yildirim1">[16]</xref> and a reanalysis of microarray data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Lin2">[17]</xref> restored the original claim of X upregulation, suggesting that the low expression levels of the X inferred in the Xiong et al. study were due to the inclusion of genes with little or no expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Deng1">[14]</xref>. Previous studies have thus reached inconsistent conclusions regarding the occurrence of X upregulation. However, it is important to point out that the analyses in all of these previous studies were indirect. They implicitly assumed that genes on the ancestral proto-X chromosomes (i.e., the autosomal progenitors of the X) were expressed at the same level as genes on ancestral autosomes before sex chromosome differentiation and that, therefore, similar expression levels between the single active present-day X and autosomes are indicative of X upregulation. Furthermore, the assessment of X upregulation patterns (i.e., the extent of restoration of ancestral expression levels on the X after Y decay) is only relevant for genes already present on the proto-X, but only Xiong et al. included analyses specifically for such ancestral X-linked genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Xiong1">[13]</xref>. Thus, to more directly assess the occurrence of X upregulation as a response to sex chromosome differentiation (and hence to test Ohno's original hypothesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Ohno1">[1]</xref>), current X expression levels need to be compared to ancestral X expression levels (relative to the respective autosomal backgrounds), for genes that were already present on the proto-X <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-He1">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It is currently unclear whether marsupials evolved efficient and global dosage compensation mechanisms in response to Y chromosome decay, because of the limited number of genes for which expression patterns have been assessed. However, previous studies showed that the X stemming from the father is, at least to some extent, inactivated in the soma of female marsupials through specific epigenetic chromatin modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Deakin1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Rens1">[20]</xref>. Transcriptional silencing of the paternal X in marsupials was reported to be quite leaky and unstable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Graves1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Koina1">[23]</xref>, although a recent study revealed efficient XCI for at least some genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Mahadevaiah1">[24]</xref>. Notably, the apparently paternally imprinted XCI observed in extant marsupials was hypothesized to reflect properties of an ancestral therian mechanism, which was then replaced by the random and potentially more efficient XCI mechanism in eutherians that is dependent on the <italic>Xist</italic> gene, which is absent in marsupials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Duret1">[25]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Even less is known about potential patterns of dosage compensation in the egg-laying monotremes, the third major mammalian lineage. An initial study of individual genes in platypus fibroblast cell lines indicated that only some X-linked genes might be dosage compensated and only to a certain degree because of variable patterns of XCI among cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Deakin2">[26]</xref>. Also, a recent immunofluorescence analysis of epigenetic modifications of the platypus X chromosomes provided no evidence for chromosome-wide XCI in monotremes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Rens1">[20]</xref>. Notably, it was suggested that the evolution of global dosage compensation mechanisms may not necessarily accompany the differentiation of sex chromosomes in amniotes (i.e., mammals, birds, reptiles), because birds were reported to lack chromosome-wide (Z) dosage compensation, on the basis of the observation of significantly elevated Z expression levels in males, the homogametic sex in birds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Itoh1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Wolf1">[29]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Overall, previous observations point to fundamental differences between lineages with respect to patterns of dosage compensation and the associated selective forces. To assess in detail the patterns, mechanisms, and evolutionary driving forces of dosage compensation in mammals and birds, we exploited an extensive set of transcriptome data that we recently generated using high-throughput RNA-seq for a collection of six major organs (cerebellum, cortex, heart, kidney, liver, testis) derived from males and females from ten species that represent all major mammalian lineages and birds (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Brawand1">[30]</xref>. In addition, we produced complementary RNA-seq data (fibroblasts, ovary) for specific analyses of platypus dosage compensation patterns (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref>).</p>
      <sec id="s1a">
        <title>Male Versus Female Expression Levels in Eutherians</title>
        <p>To assess patterns of dosage compensation in eutherians, we first contrasted male and female expression levels by computing global male to female (M∶F) gene expression ratios for expressed genes in a given tissue in both sexes (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref>). Our analyses of the data for the five somatic tissues from the seven eutherian species (humans and the other four great apes, macaque, and mouse) show that median expression levels of X-linked genes are generally very similar and statistically indistinguishable between males and females in 22 out of 33 comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g002">2</xref>, for chromosome-wide pattern of specific human and mouse examples). Notably, in nine of the 11 sex-biased cases, expression was significantly higher in females (i.e., M∶F ratios&lt;1; Bonferroni corrected <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, one-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test), which may be indicative of leaky expression of some genes from an incompletely inactivated female X <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Payer1">[8]</xref>. In agreement with this notion, the number of female-biased cases is reduced to three when the analysis is restricted to the original part of the X that is shared with marsupials (the so-called X-conserved region [XCR]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Ross1">[31]</xref>; that is, when the eutherian-specific region of the X (the so-called X-added region [XAR]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Ross1">[31]</xref>, known to contain the majority of genes escaping inactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Payer1">[8]</xref>, is excluded from the analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s001">Figure S1</xref>). In addition, general inter-individual expression differences of X-linked genes (e.g., due to environmental effects during sampling) may account for the slightly sex-biased patterns observed, in particular with respect to the two bonobo tissues that display male-biased expression. Overall, our observations are consistent with previous studies in humans and mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Payer1">[8]</xref>. They thus support the notion that all eutherians evolved X dosage compensation mechanisms that result in very similar expression levels between the two sexes.</p>

        <title>Current X to Autosome Expression Comparisons in Eutherians</title>
        <p>However, the original driving force for the evolution of dosage compensation mechanisms ought to have been the selective pressure to upregulate the single X in males upon Y chromosome decay (see above) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Ohno1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Vicoso1">[9]</xref>. Thus, to understand the mechanisms and driving forces of dosage compensation, one needs to assess whether, or to what extent, ancestral expression levels have been restored through upregulation of the X.</p>
        <p>Previous studies sought to assess the extent of X upregulation on the basis of comparisons of current expression levels between genes on the extant X chromosome and autosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Nguyen1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Xiong1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Deng1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Yildirim1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Pessia1">[32]</xref>. To place our study in the context of these studies, we first assessed current X-to-autosome (X∶AA) expression ratios for somatic tissues in the seven eutherian species on the basis of median expression levels of expressed genes on the two types of chromosomes. X∶AA ratios are always significantly smaller than 1 but often significantly larger than 0.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The median X∶AA value is 0.71 in primates and 0.5 in mouse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s019">Table S1</xref>). These values are very similar to the values reported by Deng et al. (human, 0.72; mouse, 0.57) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Deng1">[14]</xref>. However, they are overall higher than what was reported in another RNA-seq–based study by Xiong et al. (human, 0.47; mouse, 0.2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Xiong1">[13]</xref>, probably due to the inclusion of non-expressed genes in that study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Deng1">[14]</xref>. Generally, it was suggested that it is important to assess entire distributions of expression levels, given that median estimates might be influenced by lowly expressed genes, or by genes lacking expression in a given tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Deng1">[14]</xref>. Our analyses reveal significant (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05; Benjamini-Hochberg corrected Komolgorov-Smirnov test) shifts of X expression level distributions towards lower values compared to autosomal distributions for most but not all tissues (e.g., human brain) in the different species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s003">Figure S3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s019">Table S1</xref>), in good agreement with previous results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Deng1">[14]</xref>.

        <title>The Evolution of Dosage Compensation in Eutherians</title>
        <p>However, as pointed out above (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref>), a more direct assessment of X dosage compensation (i.e., the extent of restoration of ancestral expression levels on the X after Y decay) requires comparisons of current X expression levels with ancestral expression levels (relative to the respective autosomal expression levels), for genes that were already present on the proto-X. In this context, it is noteworthy that we observe significant variability in global transcriptional output of chromosomes in the different tissues in all eutherians (Benjamini-Hochberg corrected <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test), except for one sample (female orang-utan heart). This indicates that chromosomes should not be expected to necessarily have similar overall expression levels.</p>
        <p>To be able to more directly assess the extent of upregulation of genes on the eutherian X chromosomes after sex chromosome differentiation, we exploited the fact that the current eutherian X is derived from ancestral autosomes. It therefore has autosomal counterparts in species with non-homologous sex chromosomes, which are informative with respect to proto-sex chromosome expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Thus, the ancestral portion of the eutherian X chromosome largely corresponds to Chromosome 6 in platypus and to part of Chromosome 4 in chicken (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The expression levels of these platypus and chicken autosomes, unaffected by sex chromosome-related selective forces, can therefore be used to gauge ancestral therian X expression levels. Specifically, we compared transcript abundance of genes on the eutherian X in males and females to the transcriptional output of 1∶1 orthologous genes on the corresponding autosomes from platypus and chicken, relative to the respective autosomal background expression (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref>). As controls, we performed similar comparisons for corresponding numbers of 1∶1 orthologous genes that are located on autosomes in these species, which shows that expression levels of autosomal genes have overall been highly conserved between species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s004">Figure S4</xref>) and validates our approach to infer ancestral expression patterns using outgroup species.</p>
        <p>Our comparisons of distributions of current expression levels for genes on the X and autosomes with 1∶1 orthologs in the outgroup species reveal significant shifts of X-linked genes towards lower expression values for the vast majority of tissues (71 of 74, 96%) in the different eutherians (Benjamini-Hochberg corrected <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, Komolgorov-Smirnov test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g004">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s019">Table S1</xref>). By contrast, expression level distributions for the “same” (orthologous) genes are similar between the inferred eutherian proto-X chromosomes (pXX) and ancestral autosomes, which suggests that the therian proto-X chromosomes had a relatively similar transcriptional output as ancestral autosomes (corrected <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05, Komolgorov-Smirnov test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g004">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s019">Table S1</xref>). Consequently, expression values of the current X are significantly lower than those of the proto-X relative to the respective autosomal backgrounds in nearly all (70 of 74, 95%) comparisons of expression level distributions (corrected <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, Komolgorov-Smirnov test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g004">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s019">Table S1</xref>). Overall, the global expression output from the current single active X relative to autosomes in eutherians is approximately two-fold lower than that inferred for the two proto-X chromosome copies in somatic tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g003">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s005">S5</xref>), yielding a median current X to proto-X (X∶pXX) expression ratio across somatic tissues of 0.53 for the seven eutherian species (X∶pXX ratio not significantly different from 0.5, corrected <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05, except for female macaque liver; one-sample Wilcoxon signed rank tests). Notably, analyses restricted to the XCR result in very similar patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s006">Figure S6</xref>). It is also noteworthy that we obtain very similar results when using more stringent criteria to identify expressed genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s007">Figure S7</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s020">Table S2</xref>), or when restricting the X∶pXX calculations to genes with higher expression values for both the X and proto-X (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s008">Figure S8</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s022">Text S1</xref> for a discussion of expression cutoffs). Our observations thus indicate that X-linked genes have, generally, not become upregulated in males upon Y decay in eutherians but are expressed at overall similar levels per active allele as their ancestral genes on the proto-X. Notably, X∶pXX ratios are particularly low for the testis (X∶pXX ratios between 0.19 and 0.37; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g003">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s005">S5</xref>).

        <title>Accumulation of Testis-Specific Genes on the X</title>
        <p>However, the unusual gene content of the X should be taken into account when assessing X upregulation patterns for somatic tissues, as also previously noted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Deng1">[14]</xref>. In particular, genes with predominant expression (and functions) in testis seem to be overrepresented on the X <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Deng1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Ross1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Wang1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Mueller1">[35]</xref>.

To address this issue, we first assessed patterns of tissue specificity on the current X and autosomes (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref>). We find that by far most tissue-specific genes are testis-specific genes, both for the X chromosome and autosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). However, the proportion of genes specifically expressed in testis is significantly larger for the X than for autosomes (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, Fisher exact test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), supporting previous notions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Deng1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Ross1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Wang1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Mueller1">[35]</xref>. To assess this pattern in more detail, we divided the dataset into genes with 1∶1 orthologs across species (i.e., genes clearly present on the proto-X and autosomes; termed “old” genes in the following) and the remaining genes. The latter set (termed “recent,” for simplification) is thus enriched for new genes or new gene copies that originated through gene duplication or other mechanisms after sex chromosome differentiation (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref>).</p>

        <p>Notably, we identify similar proportions of testis-specific genes among the set of old genes for the X and autosomes, whereas there are significantly larger proportions of testis-specific genes for the X than for autosomes among the recent set of X-linked genes (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, Fisher exact test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). In addition, we find that the extent of testis-specificity on the current X is similar or lower compared to that of the proto-X for the old set of genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s009">Figure S9</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that the excess of testis specificity observed for the X is driven by new genes that accumulated on this chromosome after sex chromosome differentiation, potentially due to the emerging sex-related selective forces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Brawand1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Rice2">[36]</xref>.

        <p>Thus, when removing testis-specific genes from the comparisons of current expression levels on the X and autosomes, X expression levels increase relative to autosomes only for the recent set of genes but not for that of old genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s010">Figure S10</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s020">Table S2</xref>). Consequently, the relevant expression level comparisons between (proto) X and autosomes based on 1∶1 orthologous genes presented above are not confounded by the distinct patterns of testis specificity between the two types of chromosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s007">Figure S7</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s020">Table S2</xref>). Notably, recent X-linked genes have overall substantially higher X∶AA ratios than old genes, in particular when testis-specific genes are removed from the analysis (median X∶AA is 0.55 for old genes and 0.80 for recent genes in somatic tissues) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s010">Figure S10</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s020">Table S2</xref>). Thus, X∶AA ratios that are calculated for all (expressed) X-linked genes (i.e., regardless of the age of genes), as done in most previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Nguyen1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Deng1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Yildirim1">[16]</xref>, reflect more the patterns of recent genes than those of old genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s010">Figure S10</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s020">Table S2</xref>), which are the ones relevant for the assessment of dosage compensation. Finally, it is noteworthy that, generally, spatial expression patterns for somatic tissues have been well preserved for the 1∶1 orthologous gene set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s009">Figure S9</xref>), which suggests that our X∶pXX ratio estimates are not confounded by major changes in gene functions in somatic tissues since sex chromosome origination.</p>
        <p>In summary, our detailed analyses reveal no obvious signal of a global upregulation of X-linked genes after sex chromosome differentiation in eutherians. However, we emphasize that it is well possible that subsets of genes on the X were upregulated, and/or that they were globally upregulated in a subtle manner that does not result in statistically significant signals of upregulation in our analyses.</p>

        <p>We then turned to the analysis of dosage compensation patterns in marsupials. Interestingly, median expression levels are very similar between males and females in the organs of the gray short-tailed opossum (<italic>Monodelphis domestica</italic>), a representative of the marsupial lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Only in the heart, expression levels are slightly but significantly higher in females (Bonferroni corrected <italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>, one-sample Wilcoxon test). Thus, similarly to placental mammals, marsupials evolved efficient dosage compensation mechanisms that led to very similar expression levels between males and females. This observation is surprising in view of previous work that suggested that the <italic>Xist</italic>-independent XCI system in this lineage is incomplete and unstable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Graves1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Koina1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Duret1">[25]</xref>, but it is consistent with a recent study that revealed efficient XCI for several X-linked genes in <italic>Monodelphis</italic> using fluorescent in situ hybridization analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Mahadevaiah1">[24]</xref>.</p>

        <title>The Evolution of Dosage Compensation in Marsupials</title>
        <p>Remarkably, contrary to the situation in eutherians, we find that the overall expression level distributions of the current marsupial X and therian proto-X are similar in all somatic tissues (Benjamini-Hochberg corrected <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05, Komolgorov-Smirnov test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g006">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s019">Table S1</xref>).

        <p>Overall, our analyses thus suggest that in contrast to placental mammals, which have the same sex chromosome system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), marsupials appear to have evolved mechanisms that led to partial or full global upregulation of X-linked genes in both sexes. The global difference in XCR expression levels between eutherians and marsupials relative to their autosomal counterparts in platypus and chicken is confirmed and further illustrated by direct comparisons of XCR expression levels that are based on an alternative normalization of our data (i.e., expression values of all orthologous genes were jointly normalized across all species and tissues using a scaling procedure) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g007">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s011">S11</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Brawand1">[30]</xref>.

        <title>Male Versus Female Expression Levels in Monotremes</title>
        <p>Next, we explored patterns of male versus female expression levels in the egg-laying monotremes, the most basal mammalian lineage. The platypus has five distinct X chromosomes (X<sub>1</sub>–X<sub>5</sub>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Veyrunes1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Grutzner1">[4]</xref>. Given that the assembled X<sub>1</sub> chromosome is largely pseudoautosomal (i.e., it pairs with the Y<sub>1</sub> chromosome) and that few or no genes have been assigned to chromosomes X<sub>2</sub> to X<sub>4</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Veyrunes1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Grutzner1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Warren1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Rens2">[41]</xref>, we initially focused our analyses on the X<sub>5</sub> chromosome, which contains 153 genes in the assembly we utilized and is largely homologous to the Z chromosome of birds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Veyrunes1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Grutzner1">[4]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Our analyses show that X<sub>5</sub>-linked genes are expressed at significantly higher levels in females than in males in all five tissues (median M∶F ratio = 0.59, Bonferroni corrected <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, one-sample Wilcoxon test). Notably, we also generated platypus RNA-seq data for fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref>), a cell line previously used to study platypus dosage compensation of individual genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Deakin2">[26]</xref>. The fibroblast M∶F ratio (0.68) was not significantly different from those of the other tissues (<italic>p</italic>&gt;0.10, Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test). Consistent with the pseudoautosomal nature of most of the assembled X<sub>1</sub> chromosome, the majority of X<sub>1</sub> genes have M∶F ratios close to 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g002">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s021">Table S3</xref>). However, as expected from our observations for the X<sub>5</sub> chromosome, M∶F ratios for the non-pseudoautosomal region on the long arm of X<sub>1</sub> (median M∶F ratio = 0.61) are similar to those for the X<sub>5</sub> chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g002">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s021">Table S3</xref>). Thus, contrary to therian mammals, monotremes apparently did not evolve efficient mechanisms that equalize expression levels between males and females, which is consistent with the recently reported absence of epigenetic inactivation marks on the platypus X chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Rens1">[20]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Finally, to explore whether the female-biased expression of non-pseudoautosomal genes on the X<sub>1</sub> and X<sub>5</sub> chromosomes reflects that genes on these chromosomes generally have functions that are more important for females, we generated and analyzed RNA-seq data for platypus ovaries. Our analysis of these data show that the extent of ovary-specific expression is very similar and overall low for the two platypus X chromosomes and autosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s012">Figure S12</xref>). It therefore provides no evidence for an enrichment of female functions on the platypus X chromosomes. For comparison, we performed a similar analysis for the testis, which reveals that only the non-pseudoautosomal part of the X<sub>1</sub> chromosome is enriched for testis-specific genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s012">Figure S12</xref>). Thus, while genes in this part of the X<sub>1</sub> are expressed at overall much lower levels in male somatic tissues, it may be slightly enriched for genes with testis functions.</p>

        <title>The Evolution of Dosage Compensation in Monotremes</title>
        <p>Expression level distributions of the present-day X<sub>5</sub> and proto-X<sub>5</sub> in male platypus are overall very similar (Benjamini-Hochberg corrected <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05, Komolgorov-Smirnov test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g008">Figure 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s019">Table S1</xref>) and the median X<sub>5</sub>∶pX<sub>5</sub>X<sub>5</sub> value across somatic tissues is 0.67. In two tissues (liver and kidney), X<sub>5</sub>∶pX<sub>5</sub>X<sub>5</sub> ratios are significantly larger than 0.5 (Benjamini-Hochberg corrected <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, one-sample Wilcoxon test). Thus, our analyses of X<sub>5</sub> expression evolution in platypus suggest that this chromosome has become partially upregulated in males (the heterogametic sex) at least in several tissues after sex chromosome differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Our analyses of females (the homogametic sex) suggest that the X<sub>5</sub> expression output was essentially preserved during evolution (median X<sub>5</sub>X<sub>5</sub>∶pX<sub>5</sub>X<sub>5</sub> = 1.07) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Together, our observations may thus indicate that not only has the X<sub>5</sub> dosage reduction upon monotreme sex chromosome formation been partially compensated by an upregulation of genes on this chromosome, but that this upregulation is specific to males. Alternatively, the X<sub>5</sub> upregulation mechanism is not specific to males, but the partial overexpression of genes on these chromosomes in the homogametic sex is avoided by some form of X<sub>5</sub> inactivation that restores the ancestral X<sub>5</sub> to autosome balance in this sex. The latter scenario may be less likely, given that chromosome-wide epigenomic marks indicative of global inactivation mechanisms could so far not be detected for the X chromosomes in platypus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Rens1">[20]</xref>. We finally note that the preservation of ancestral X<sub>5</sub> expression levels in females is consistent with the notion (see above) that the higher expression levels of X<sub>5</sub> genes in this sex relative to males are not reflecting the evolution of new female functions after sex chromosome differentiation but are only due to the X<sub>5</sub> dosage reduction in males.</p>

        <title>The Evolution of Dosage Compensation in Birds</title>
        <p>Our RNA-seq data analyses from non-domesticated chicken (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>, red jungle fowl) reveal significantly higher expression levels in males (ZZ) than females (ZW) in the five tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g001">Figure 1</xref>), consistent with the view that birds lack global dosage compensation mechanisms that would lead to similar expression levels between the sexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Itoh1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Ellegren1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Itoh2">[42]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, our analyses of expression evolution in chicken suggest that the chromosomes ancestral to the Z chromosome already had relatively low expression levels (median pZZ∶pAA = 0.74), which are significantly lower in nearly all tissue comparisons than those inferred for ancestral autosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). This observation is interesting in light of the theory that these ancestral sex chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Veyrunes1">[3]</xref>, which thus apparently had particular properties in terms of gene expression, represent the ancestral sex chromosome system of amniotes. Notably, similarly to the X<sub>5</sub> chromosome in platypus, the Z chromosome has become significantly upregulated in all tissues of female chicken (the heterogametic sex) after sex chromosome differentiation (median Z∶pZZ = 0.74; ratios significantly larger than 0.5, one-sample Wilcoxon test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). However, the expression output of the current Z remains significantly lower than that of the proto-Z chromosomes (Z∶pZZ&lt;1, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, one-sample Wilcoxon test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), leading to significant differences in overall expression level distributions for four out of five tissues (i.e., brain, cerebellum, heart, liver; corrected <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, Komolgorov-Smirnov test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g008">Figure 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s019">Table S1</xref>). By contrast, the Z expression output in male chicken (the homogametic sex) was essentially preserved during evolution (median ZZ∶pZZ = 1.03 for chicken male) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g008">Figure 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s019">Table S1</xref>). Thus, similarly to the situation in monotremes, these observations might indicate that the Z dosage reduction has been compensated by partial upregulation of genes on this chromosome specifically in the heterogametic sex (i.e., female chicken). Alternatively, they might indicate that the Z upregulation mechanisms are not specific to females, but that the overexpression of genes on these chromosomes in the males is avoided by some form of Z inactivation that restores the ancestral Z to autosome balance in this sex. However, similarly to platypus, chromosome-wide epigenomic marks indicative of global inactivation mechanisms could so far not be detected for these chromosomes in chicken <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Itoh1">[27]</xref>, which may render the latter scenario less likely.</p>
        <p>Notably, a refined analysis revealed that a subset of genes with Z∶pZZ expression levels close to 1 in female chicken (i.e., genes that apparently have been two-fold upregulated relative to ancestral levels) show median ZZ∶pZZ expression ratios of 1.13 to 1.56 in male somatic organs, which suggests that the upregulation of these genes is not completely specific to the heterogametic sex but affected the homogametic sex to some extent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s013">Figure S13</xref>). A similar pattern is observed in platypus, although these results are less clear due to the relatively low number of X<sub>5</sub>-linked genes that could be analyzed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s013">Figure S13</xref>). The fact that upregulation was not complete in the homogametic sex for this subset of genes suggests that either the transcriptional upregulation mechanism is more efficient in the heterogametic sex (i.e., it is largely sex specific), or that some form of secondary regulatory buffering/inactivation mechanisms (e.g., regulatory feedback loops, local epigenetic modifications) partially reduce expression levels of these X<sub>5</sub>/Z-linked genes in the homogametic sex of these species.</p>
        <p>Overall, our observations that the dosage compensation mechanism in birds and platypus only mildly affected the homogametic sex in these species provide a compelling potential explanation for why evolution of X<sub>5</sub> and Z inactivation mechanisms was not required in these lineages. The partial and largely sex-specific compensation for the X<sub>5</sub> and Z dosage reduction in the heterogametic sex also provides an explanation for the only partially sex-biased expression in platypus and birds (i.e., M∶F expression ratios&gt;0.5 and &lt;2, respectively; see above) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Dosage Compensation through Downregulation of Functionally Cooperating Autosomal Genes</title>
        <p>The analyses described above suggest that, at least in some amniote lineages, dosage reductions resulting from sex chromosome differentiation processes have been compensated by transcriptional upregulations of, at least, subsets of genes. One could argue that X and Z chromosomal genes that have not become upregulated simply represent haplosufficient genes that are insensitive to dosage alterations (e.g., because they lack functional interactions with autosomal genes). Haploinsufficient genes were indeed recently inferred to be underrepresented on the therian X chromosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-deClare1">[43]</xref>, which may explain why dosage compensation has not been necessary for a number of X-linked genes. However, collectively, dosage insensitivity is unlikely to explain the pattern observed for therian mammals, given that marsupial X-linked genes show strong signatures of upregulation, whereas their eutherian orthologs—derived from the same ancestral genes—do not. Thus, we hypothesize that expression level reductions of dosage sensitive (haploinsufficient) sex chromosomal genes may also have been compensated in other ways.</p>
        <p>Given that a main driving force behind the evolution of dosage compensation is likely the maintenance of the balance between X-linked and autosomal gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Vicoso1">[9]</xref>, we hypothesized that instead of upregulation of X-linked genes, autosomal genes that functionally interact with X-linked genes could have been downregulated. This mechanism might be more likely for many genes, given that transcriptional upregulation of ancestral genes with already high expression levels may be mechanistically constrained <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Vicoso2">[44]</xref>, while regulatory mutations leading to transcriptional downregulation may have been fixed more easily during evolution.</p>
        <p>Remarkably, in the framework of analyses that are fully presented in a previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Brawand1">[30]</xref>, we identified drastic and concerted expression level reductions of X-linked and autosomal genes in several organs (brain and cerebellum) that apparently occurred shortly after the differentiation of sex chromosomes in the common therian and eutherian ancestors (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g009">Figure 9</xref>). To explore whether these concerted expression shifts indeed reflect downregulations of autosomal genes in response to dosage reductions of functionally cooperating X-linked partners, we performed protein–protein interaction network analyses in human and mouse, given that protein interaction represents one major way in which genes can functionally cooperate and because this type of cooperation can be assessed with available data for these species.</p>

        <p>This analysis therefore supports our hypothesis that the dosage balance of X-linked and autosomal genes after the attrition of the Y has at least partially been restored by downregulations of autosomal genes that functionally cooperate with genes on the X in one way or another (e.g., through protein–protein interactions but also through other mechanisms, such as functions in the same metabolic pathway, which remain to be assessed). Importantly, the fact that autosomal downregulations have also affected females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g009">Figure 9</xref>) may explain why XCI evolved in eutherians in spite of the apparent overall lack of upregulation of X-linked genes after Y decay. In this scenario, the reduced expression of autosomal genes drove the evolution of XCI to restore the X-autosomal dosage balance in eutherian females.</p>

        <title>Other Potential Compensation Mechanisms</title>
        <p>In addition to upregulations of individual dosage sensitive genes, dosage insensitivity of certain genes, and/or autosomal downregulations of subsets of X/Z-linked genes, there are at least three other possible explanations for why (complete) global X or Z upregulation was not required after sex chromosome differentiation in amniotes. First, sex-related selective forces may have reshaped functions of certain X-linked genes after sex chromosome differentiation, which could have rendered maintenance of ancestral dosage balances between the X and autosomes unnecessary for these genes. Our analyses described above suggest that spatial expression patterns and hence gene functions may have remained overall conserved on amniote sex chromosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s009">Figure S9</xref>). However, gene expression evolution was accelerated during the early evolution of the therian X chromosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Brawand1">[30]</xref>, which potentially reflects functional changes of a subset of genes, but could also indicate upregulations of individual genes in males upon Y decay. Second, we hypothesized that duplication of X-linked genes might constitute a rather straightforward means to reconstitute their ancestral gene dosage in males after the attrition of the Y. Consistent with previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Zhang1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Potrzebowski2">[45]</xref>, we indeed detect an accelerated gain of X-linked gene duplicates after therian sex chromosome birth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s014">Figure S14</xref>). However, given that these X-linked duplicates tend to be expressed in sex-specific tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Zhang1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Potrzebowski2">[45]</xref> and show substantial divergence at the protein sequence level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s014">Figure S14</xref>), these duplicates are unlikely to be linked to the evolution of dosage compensation but probably arose in the framework of a burst of functional adaptation during early X evolution (see above) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Zhang1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Potrzebowski2">[45]</xref>. Finally, we note that it is possible that some X-linked genes regained their original dosage by relocating to autosomes, a scenario that remains to be investigated.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our evolutionary analyses of tissue transcriptomes from species representing all major mammalian lineages and birds provide an unprecedented overview of the evolution of dosage compensation in amniotes and fundamental novel insights into the underlying driving forces (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001328-t002">Table 2</xref>). Our comparisons of current and inferred ancestral expression levels, suggest that the dosage reduction of the therian X upon the attrition of the Y has not been compensated by a measurable global upregulation of genes on the eutherian X. However, our results do not rule out a partial or full upregulation of individual X-linked genes, which was recently suggested to occur for genes encoding components of large protein complexes on the basis of current human X to autosome expression level comparisons (without consideration of the age of the analyzed genes) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Pessia1">[32]</xref>. Our findings also do not exclude a subtle global upregulation of the X. In any event, they do not provide evidence for a global two-fold upregulation of the X, as originally proposed by Ohno <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Ohno1">[1]</xref>. Thus, our evolutionary analyses resolve recent contradictory studies that were based on analyses of expression levels of genes on the present-day X and autosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Xiong1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Deng1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Yildirim1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Lin2">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Pessia1">[32]</xref>. Furthermore, our analyses suggest that the dosage balance between the X and autosomes, at least for a subset of genes, was instead restored by downregulation of functionally associated autosomal genes after sex chromosome differentiation. X-linked genes that were not compensated by individual upregulations or downregulations of autosomal partners were probably either haplosufficient, obtained new (potentially sex-specific) functions, or were relocated to autosomes. Notably, XCI in eutherian females may have in part evolved as a response to the autosomal downregulation, which also affected females. Thus, our findings revise long-held hypotheses regarding the driving forces underlying eutherian XCI and the associated equilibration of expression levels between males and females. It will be interesting to follow up on various aspects of our eutherian findings in the future. For example, it will be interesting to assess whether the previously reported enrichment of chromatin markers associated with transcriptional activity on the X relative to autosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Deng1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Yildirim1">[16]</xref> is relevant for genes that were already present on the proto-X and would thus explain any potential upregulation of such genes compared to ancestral states.</p>

      <p>Surprisingly, in marsupials, whose sex chromosomes are homologous to those of eutherians, significant upregulation of X-linked genes has occurred. Thus, contrary to eutherians, the evolution of female XCI in marsupials was probably largely driven by global X upregulation, which affected both sexes. Notably, contrary to previous inferences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Graves1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Koina1">[23]</xref> but consistent with a recent study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Mahadevaiah1">[24]</xref>, we find X expression levels to be as similar between marsupial males and females as between the two eutherian sexes. This result suggests that the paternally imprinted XCI mechanism in marsupials, which is thought to represent the ancestral system also in eutherians, is very efficient, probably as efficient as the random XCI that evolved in eutherians. Generally, we note that the fact that eutherians and marsupials show very different and apparently independent responses to the X dosage reduction supports the notion that therian sex chromosomes emerged just prior to the split of these two lineages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Potrzebowski1">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In the two other amniote lineages studied here, monotremes and birds, which also have homologous sex chromosomes, the dosage reduction of the X and Z chromosome that arose after sex chromosome differentiation in these lineages, respectively, was compensated in yet another way: the sex chromosomes seem to have become rather specifically upregulated in the heterogametic sex in these lineages. This largely sex-specific upregulation provides a plausible explanation for why the evolution of global inactivation mechanisms of these chromosomes in the homogametic sex was not required in these lineages.</p>
      <p>Altogether, our data also shed new light on the long-standing hypothesis that male-heterogametic (XY) systems are more prone to evolve efficient dosage compensation mechanisms than female-heterogametic (ZW) systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Vicoso1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Mank1">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Graves2">[47]</xref>. Although the precise extent of the different dosage compensation mechanisms still remains to be established, our data overall suggest that the original sex chromosome dosage reductions have been compensated at least as much in the female-heterogametic birds as in the male-heterogametic mammals. However, as the bird dosage compensation mechanism is nevertheless only partial and has been largely restricted to the heterogametic sex (females), female birds have overall lower transcriptional output from the Z chromosome than males, which was previously interpreted as an overall lack of global dosage compensation in birds, in particular when compared to mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Itoh1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Ellegren1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Itoh2">[42]</xref>. Thus, in spite of a strong original dosage reduction response, birds have evolved overall different dosage balances between the Z and autosomes in the two sexes.</p>
      <p>In the context of contrasting XY and ZW systems, it is also important to note that the monotreme platypus, whose X<sub>5</sub> chromosome is largely homologous to the bird Z chromosome, shows similar dosage compensation patterns as birds. Overall, our work therefore suggests that patterns of sex chromosome dosage compensation might mainly depend on the properties of different proto-sex chromosomes and/or potentially fortuitous events and mechanisms that arose soon after sex chromosome differentiation (e.g., sex chromosome up- or autosomal downregulations, specific to the heterogametic sex or not), which determine the evolution of subsequent mechanisms such as sex chromosome inactivation in the homogametic sex. Our results are thus in agreement with a recent hypothesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Livernois1">[48]</xref>. Our findings highlight that the evolutionary pressures imposed by sex chromosome dosage reductions in amniotes were resolved in strikingly different ways in the different lineages, even for the same ancestral sex chromosomes.</p>

        <p>First, we assessed current X(Z) to autosome expression ratios for all expressed genes in a given tissue on the basis of the medians of expression levels of all X(Z)-linked expressed genes and of all autosomal expressed genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s002">Figure S2</xref>). For all further analyses, current X(Z) to autosome expression ratios were based on the medians of expression levels of expressed X(Z)-linked genes with 1∶1 orthologs across all ten species and of expressed autosomal genes whose 1∶1 orthologs are located on autosomes in all ten species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g003">Figures 3B</xref>, left, and S3).</p>

        <p>The proto-X(Z) to proto-autosomes expression ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g003">Figures 3B</xref>, middle, and S5) were based on ancestral X(Z) and autosomal expression levels inferred through 1∶1 orthologous genes in outgroup species (i.e., species with non-homologous sex chromosomes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Specifically, ancestral expression levels of X(Z)-linked genes (i.e., expression levels of proto-X(Z) chromosomes) for a given species were estimated on the basis of the median expression levels of expressed autosomal 1∶1 orthologs in outgroup species with non-homologous sex chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

        <p>Current X(Z) to proto-X(Z) expression ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g003">Figures 3B</xref>, right, and S5) were calculated in the following way. First, we normalized the current expression level value of all expressed X(Z)-linked genes by the median current expression level of a set of 1∶1 orthologous genes that are autosomal in all ten species. We then normalized the ancestral expression level value of each expressed proto-X(Z–linked genes (computed as described above) by the median ancestral expression level of a set of 1∶1 orthologous genes that are autosomal in all ten species. Finally, we then computed the ratio of these two values for each gene and assessed the median of these X(Z) to proto-X(Z) ratios. Statistically significant deviations of these medians from key reference values (e.g., 0.5 [log<sub>2</sub> ratio of −1]; 1 [log<sub>2</sub> ratio of 0]; and 2 [log<sub>2</sub> ratio of 1]) were assessed using one-sample Wilcoxon signed rank tests. <italic>p</italic>-Values were Benjamini-Hochberg corrected for the total number of tests performed across tissues for a given species per reference value.</p>

        <title>Tissue-Specific Expression</title>
        <p>To define patterns of tissue specificities in nine species (all species except orang-utan, where no testis sample is available), we proceeded in the following way. First, we calculated consensus expression levels for each gene in a given species' tissue on the basis of the median expression levels of this gene across samples available for this tissue. Notably, for the specific spatial expression analysis of platypus, we generated an additional gene expression set that also included ovary (i.e., seven instead of six tissues were included in this analysis). We then performed two analyses of tissue specificity.</p>
        <p>In the first analysis, we defined sets of genes specifically expressed in a given tissue in the following way. A gene was considered to be specifically expressed in a given tissue if its consensus expression level (see above) was at least two-fold higher in that tissue than in the other tissues (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g005">Figure 5A</xref> for the pattern in humans).</p>
        <p>In the second analysis, we defined indices of tissue specificities for each gene by dividing their consensus expression value in a given tissue by the sum of their consensus expression values in all tissues. This index value can thus range from 0 (no expression in that tissue and expression in at least one other tissue) to 1 (only expressed in that tissue). See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001328-g005">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s009">S9</xref> for results obtained using this index.</p>

        <title>Transcription Modules and X-Autosome Protein Interaction Analyses</title>
        <p>In a previous analysis of the data used here <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Brawand1">[30]</xref>, we identified groups of genes that show concerted shifts of gene expression levels in subsets of samples (so-called transcription modules). We then selected transcription modules that showed significant enrichments for X-linked genes and a decreased expression in eutherians (identifiers 421, 618, and 634) or therians (identifiers 507, 521, and 563). In these modules, we could thus identify 40 X-linked and 413 autosomal genes whose expression levels decreased at the same time in the common ancestor of therians or eutherians (i.e., soon after sex chromosome origination). We then retrieved protein–protein interaction data for human and mouse from the version 8.3 of the STRING database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Szklarczyk1">[51]</xref> and identified protein interaction partners for all genes in our set of 5,997 1∶1 orthologs for which protein interaction data were available (3,758 in humans and 3,498 in mouse) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001328-t001">Table 1</xref>). Together, these data allowed us to extract two sets of protein–protein interaction gene sets. The type 1 set contained all X-linked genes whose expression levels dropped in the common therian/eutherian ancestor and all autosomal genes that functionally interact with them at the protein level (24 X-linked genes and 79 autosomal interactors in humans; 19 X-linked genes and 61 autosomal interactors in mouse). The type 2 set contained all X-linked genes whose expression levels <italic>did not</italic> drop in the common therian/eutherian ancestor and all autosomal genes that functionally interact with them at the protein level (72 X-linked genes and 391 autosomal interactors in humans; 76 X-linked genes and 315 autosomal interactors in mouse). We then assessed the proportions of autosomal interaction partners that became downregulated in the therian/eutherian ancestor in the two types of gene sets, which revealed a significant excess of autosomal downregulation in the type 1 gene set (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001328-t001">Table 1</xref> and main text for details).</p>

        <title>Patterns of Intrachromosomal Duplications after Sex Chromosome Origination</title>
        <p>Mammalian gene duplication data were retrieved from the Ensembl database (release 57). Using a modification of a previous bioinformatics pipeline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Potrzebowski1">[2]</xref>, we identified intronless retroposed gene copies. We removed these retrocopies from the Ensembl gene duplication data, because we considered them unlikely to have contributed to X dosage compensation (e.g., many retrogenes are not functional, do not preserve ancestral expression patterns, and/or do not originate from the chromosome on which their ancestral precursor genes are located). Using Ensembl phylogenetic dating information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Vilella1">[49]</xref>, we then identified, for each branch leading to humans, all distinct paralogy groups with at least one duplication event on that branch. Next, we extracted those paralogy groups for which most of the branch-specific duplication events were intrachromosomal (i.e., &gt;50% of the genes currently being located on the same human chromosome) and then computed, for each branch, the ratios of the number of predominantly X-linked and autosomal paralogy groups, normalized by the number of genes on the current human X chromosome and autosomes, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s014">Figure S14</xref>). The ratios of the median protein sequence identity for gene duplicates (based on pairwise identity values extracted from the Ensembl database) on the X or autosomes in the respective paralogy groups were also calculated for each branch (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s014">Figure S14</xref>).</p>

        <title>Old Versus Recent Genes</title>
        <p>For all evolutionary analyses, we used the set of 5,997 1∶1 orthologous genes described above. These genes represent “old” genes that were already present in the common amniote ancestor and therefore were already present on the proto-sex chromosomes and proto-autosomes. We also performed separate analyses for the remaining genes (termed “recent” in the main text for simplification), which are thus expected to be enriched for genes that emerged more recently in amniotes through gene duplication or other origination mechanisms, although this set potentially also contains ancient paralogous gene copies for which 1∶1 orthologous relationships cannot be unambiguously determined. To specifically assess the amount of genes that originated by gene duplication since the therian sex chromosome origination on the lineage leading to humans, we extracted from the gene duplication data described in the previous <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref> section genes that are part of gene families that experienced at least one duplication event since the separation of the monotreme and therian lineages (sex chromosomes are thought to have originated at some point in the common ancestor of therian mammals, i.e., after the monotreme/therian split) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Potrzebowski1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001328-Veyrunes1">[3]</xref>. This analysis shows that 40% of genes in the “recent” set of genes on the human X chromosome are part of families that experienced a duplication event at some point since the divergence of therians and monotremes.</p>

        <title>Assessment of Technical Noise</title>
        <p>Due to stochastic variation in the RNA-seq procedure, the observed read coverage for a gene may not directly correspond to the read coverage this gene should theoretically have based on its actual expression level in the sample. The extent of the effect of this stochastic variation in read coverage is expected to be negatively correlated with the actual read coverage of a gene (i.e., genes with lower read coverage are more affected by the stochastic variation inherent in the RNA-seq procedure).</p>
        <p>To assess the technical (stochastic) variation in our data, we first performed simulation-based analyses. Specifically, we generated a set of 600 hypothetical genes with an expected actual read coverage ranging from 1 to 600 (this range corresponds to the observed range of median number of reads in our biological samples), resulting in a universe of 180,300 reads. We then performed resampling analyses where 180,300 reads were assigned to each of the 600 genes with probabilities proportional to the expected actual read coverage of each gene. For each resampling set, we computed the variation between the simulated value and the theoretical one using the following formula: (|<italic>t</italic>−<italic>s</italic>|/<italic>t</italic>)*100, where <italic>t</italic> and <italic>s</italic> represent the theoretical and simulated numbers of reads, respectively. For each gene, we computed the median variation value from the 1,000 simulated values and plotted this variation as a function of the theoretical actual number of reads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s016">Figure S16</xref>, left). Consistent with the expectation, this plot shows that low read coverage leads to a high impact of technical variation, whereas increasing read coverage gradually reduces this impact.</p>
        <p>Our different biological samples have median read coverage that ranges from 28 reads to 512 reads for X/Z-linked genes and from 47 to 536 reads for autosomal genes. Our simulated data suggest that the variation expected for these medians ranges from approximately 3%–12% for X(Z)-linked genes (median of this variation: 7%) and from approximately 3%–9% for autosomal genes (median variation: 5.6%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s016">Figure S16</xref>, right). Notably, the specific ranges of the variation for the eutherian data are very similar (X: 7.1%; autosome: 5.8%). Overall, these results suggest that technical variation is overall relatively low in our assessments of median gene expression levels.</p>
        <p>In addition to these simulation-based analyses, we also assessed the extent of technical variation by assessing differences in X(Z)∶AA ratios among technical RNA-seq data replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001328.s017">Figure S17</xref>). This analysis shows that median X(Z)∶AA ratios are very similar and statistically indistinguishable between replicates; thus, consistent with the simulation-based analysis, this analysis further supports the notion that the technical variance in our data and its impact on the various expression level estimates is overall low.</p>

          <p><bold>Effect of increasing expression level thresholds for the calculation of X∶AA ratios.</bold> (A) Effect of increasing expression level thresholds on observed X∶AA ratios for human brain. Separate curves are shown for all expressed genes, recent genes (i.e., all genes except 1∶1 orthologs present on both the current chromosomes and ancestral/proto chromosomes), and old genes (i.e., 1∶1 orthologs present on both the current chromosomes and ancestral/proto chromosomes), respectively. (B) Black curve: random simulation of expression level distribution for autosomal genes, which is based on observed median, standard deviation, and number of expressed autosomal genes in human brain (<italic>AA</italic> set). Green curve: random simulation of expression level distribution for X-linked genes based on observed median and standard deviation of expressed autosomal genes in human brain, and the number of expressed X-linked genes in human brain (<italic>X1</italic> set). This distribution thus reflects a set of X-linked genes whose overall distribution is not different from autosomal genes. Orange curve: same distribution as the one represented by the green curve, but with a two-fold reduction of expression levels for each gene (<italic>X2</italic> set). (C) Effect of increasing expression level thresholds on simulated X∶AA ratios based on simulated expression level distributions such as the ones described in (B). Green curve: the curve represents the median <italic>X1</italic>∶<italic>AA</italic> ratio for 1,000 generated random distributions of <italic>X1</italic> and <italic>AA</italic> expression levels. Orange curve: The curve represents the median <italic>X2</italic>∶<italic>AA</italic> ratio for 1,000 generated random distributions of <italic>X2</italic> and <italic>AA</italic> expression levels. The range covering 90% of the computed ratios is shown by the respective shadings. Together, these results show that gradually increasing expression level thresholds will gradually increase X∶AA ratios and eventually lead to X∶AA ratios around 1 (log<sub>2</sub> ratio of 0), in spite of actual two-fold lower expression levels of X-linked genes.</p>
