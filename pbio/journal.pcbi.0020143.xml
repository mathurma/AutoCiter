To understand how these systems adapt to allow organisms to detect niche-specific signals, we analyzed the phylogenetic distribution of nearly 5,000 histidine protein kinases from 207 sequenced prokaryotic genomes. We found that many genomes carry a large repertoire of recently evolved signaling genes, which may reflect selective pressure to adapt to new environmental conditions. Both lineage-specific gene family expansion and horizontal gene transfer play major roles in the introduction of new histidine kinases into genomes; however, there are differences in how these two evolutionary forces act. Genes imported via horizontal transfer are more likely to retain their original functionality as inferred from a similar complement of signaling domains, while gene family expansion accompanied by domain shuffling appears to be a major source of novel genetic diversity. Family expansion is the dominant source of new histidine kinase genes in the genomes most enriched in signaling proteins, and detailed analysis reveals that divergence in domain structure and changes in expression patterns are hallmarks of recent expansions. Finally, while these two modes of gene acquisition are widespread across bacterial taxa, there are clear species-specific preferences for which mode is used.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Pathways containing histidine protein kinases (HPKs) represent a key mechanism for signal transduction, especially in bacteria. These systems help cells to sense and respond to their environment by detecting external cues and effecting internal responses such as changes in gene expression. As such, they are believed to play a key role in niche adaptation, yet their evolution is difficult to study due to the large number of paralogous subfamilies. This work extends previous large-scale gene evolution studies by considering complex paralogy relationships, and uncovers an abundance of horizontal transfers, gene duplications, and domain shuffling that have marked the evolutionary history of HPKs. An important finding of this study is qualitative differences between the main strategies for acquiring new HPKs (horizontal gene transfer and gene duplication). Hallmarks of the latter process include domain shuffling and the generation of “orphan” HPKs not co-transcribed with a cognate response regulator.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was part of the Virtual Institute for Microbial Stress and Survival (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://VIMSS.lbl.gov" xlink:type="simple">http://VIMSS.lbl.gov</ext-link>) supported by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Genomics Program:GTL through contract DE-AC02-05CH11231 between Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the US Department of Energy.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Alm E, Huang K, Arkin A (2006) The evolution of two-component systems in bacteria reveals different strategies for niche adaptation.

Typically, these changes are reflected in the alteration of gene expression patterns. These changes can be the result of action by a number of different types of signaling proteins, including histidine protein kinases (HPKs) and their cognate response regulators (RRs), methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins, di-guanylate and adenylate cyclases, and serine/threonine/tyrosine protein kinases, as well as individual transcription factors or “one-component” signal transduction proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b002">2</xref>]. Of these various protein families, HPKs are among the most abundant, and historically have been regarded as the primary mechanism for signal transduction in bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b003">3</xref>].</p><p>HPKs, and more generally signal transduction proteins, are thought to play a major role in the adaptation of bacteria to new or changing environments. Consistent with this hypothesis, those bacteria that have the largest complements of signaling proteins generally tend to be bacteria with complex lifestyles such as <italic>Myxococcus xanthus,</italic> those that are found ubiquitously in varied environments such as <italic>Pseudomonas,</italic> or bacteria with numerous alternative metabolic strategies such as various δ- and ɛ-proteobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b004">4</xref>]. By contrast, few HPKs have been identified in the reduced genomes of parasitic bacteria, which likely have a relatively constant external environment.</p><p>While these signal transduction systems are thought to be a key part of the adaptive evolution of bacteria, few details are known about this process. In this study, we investigated the distribution of HPKs in sequenced bacterial genomes to address some fundamental questions: (1) What fraction of HPKs in a given genome represents newly acquired/ancient genes? (2) What are the evolutionary processes that give rise to new HPKs? (3) Do newly acquired HPKs sense similar signals or do they evolve new functionality?</p><p>We looked specifically at genes that entered into each lineage recently, making the logical assumption that recent additions are more likely to provide insight into the evolutionary basis of niche adaptation. Identifying recent acquisitions in a background of multiple paralogs is a difficult task. We describe a BLAST-based procedure for classifying and establishing the age of HPK domains. This procedure is derived from previous gene presence/absence studies by our group and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b007">7</xref>]. We based our phylogenetic analysis on the histidine kinase domain of each HPK only, allowing us to follow changes in the structure of the signaling domains (domain shuffling) that generally lie upstream (N-terminal) from the kinase domain. The phylogenetic inference procedure described requires an accurate species phylogeny, which we inferred from a concatenated gene profile including 15 ubiquitous bacterial genes without obvious paralogs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020143-st001">Table S1</xref>).</p><p>We used the gene histories inferred by this procedure to estimate the relative contribution of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and gene duplication events to the evolution of new HPKs in each genome. We observed that some genomes acquired new HPKs primarily via HGT, while others relied mainly on lineage-specific expansion (LSE) of existing gene families. A closer look at genes acquired via these two mechanisms revealed differences in the extent to which upstream signaling domains and cognate RRs were conserved as a result of each process, with HGT being more likely to preserve pre-existing relationships than gene duplication. We investigated one such HPK expansion in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Desulfovibrio vulgaris</named-content> in greater detail, and describe specific examples of LSE-associated domain shuffling. We further looked to functional genomic data and confirmed that these new HPKs have distinct gene expression profiles, suggesting novel functional roles.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Inferring Gene Histories</title><p>In this study, we identified nearly 5,000 HPKs from 207 genomes. We parsed each of these HPKs into domains (signaling domains of various types, HPK domains, and RR domains in some cases), and analyzed the evolution of the HPK domain from each gene using an approach based on pairwise BLASTp scores. In this way, we identified domains that were more similar to genes in the same genome than to genes in other genomes as the likely result of LSE. For domains that were more closely related to genes in distant genomes than those in more closely related genomes, we inferred HGT as a likely explanation. Finally, we identified a small number of subfamily “Birth” events when a particular group of genes was found in a narrow range of species. These genes are sometimes referred to as “ORFans” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b006">6</xref>].</p><p>An overview of our approach is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020143-g001">Figure 1</xref>. A complete outline of our algorithm for inferring domain histories is given in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section, but a few key details are worth noting here. First, our approach relies on a species tree, which we constructed using a set of ubiquitous single-copy genes. This species tree is then condensed into a set of “outgroups” at increasing evolutionary distances from the species of interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b008">8</xref>]. If the best hit of a HPK domain to a distant outgroup is closer than its best hit to a more closely related outgroup, then it is considered to be “absent” from the closer outgroup. When a gene is absent from two or more consecutive outgroups, implying multiple deletion events that could be alternatively explained by a single HGT event, the HGT event is inferred as more parsimonious, but <italic>only if</italic> the oldest outgroup branching after the presumed HGT diverged more recently than the phylogenetic cutoff distance for “recent” events (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). As noted later in the text, we reproduced the main findings described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> with a more conservative definition of HGT (absence from three consecutive outgroups) with nearly identical results. When the distance to a HPK domain within the same genome was closer than to the best hit from an outgroup, then a duplication (LSE) event was inferred, but <italic>only if</italic> the outgroup diverged more recently than the phylogenetic cutoff.</p><fig id="pcbi-0020143-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020143.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Overview of Approach</title><p>An overview of our phylogenetic inference procedure is given. We look only at histidine kinase domains from HPKs, and compare the distribution of these to the species tree. When homologs in distant outgroups are more distantly related, we infer simple vertical descent. Paralogs and distances that contradict species phylogeny result in our inference of gene duplication or horizontal transfer. Only events (such as duplication or transfer) that occurred more recently than the cutoff as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> are considered. Four hypothetical cases are shown, and each is labeled as present/absent (“1” or “0”) from each outgroup according to the procedure described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020143.g001" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>Further information can be inferred about the time of each HGT or LSE event based on the set of genomes containing the HPK domain (e.g., was the HPK domain duplicated before or after the divergence of its host species with some other species?). We have been careful throughout this discussion to refer to the HPK domain rather than to the HPK itself—this is to emphasize the fact that we are inferring histories for only the HPK domain of signaling proteins, which (as shown in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>) can be very different from the evolutionary histories of associated signaling domains that are usually found within the same gene.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Key Assumptions</title><p>Our approach makes several key assumptions. First, we rely on an accurate species tree. Our species tree compares quite favorably with other published phylogenies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b010">10</xref>], and is available as part of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020143-sd003">Dataset S3</xref>. Further, we restrict our analysis to nodes with high bootstrap support. In addition, there is no real consensus among researchers as to the topology of the deepest branches, so even well-supported branching patterns according to concatenated gene trees may disagree with trees produced using other methods. We restrict our analysis to relatively recent evolutionary events, in part to avoid complications that result from uncertainty in these deepest branches. We also make the key assumption that under a model of vertical inheritance, the best BLASTp hit of each domain should be to its most closely related ortholog. This plausible assumption can be violated for a number of reasons, including unequal evolutionary rates among different lineages. To minimize problems of this type, we impose a stronger cutoff to conclude “absence” of a gene from an outgroup based on a more similar homolog in a distant outgroup: the BLASTp score to the more distant outgroup must be 20 greater (in raw bit score) than the score to the closer outgroup. All of the raw scores used in this analysis are available for browsing online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://microbesonline.org/hpk" xlink:type="simple">http://microbesonline.org/hpk</ext-link>. Because we require domains to be “absent” from two or three consecutive well-supported outgroups, and focus only on recent evolutionary events, we feel that it is very unlikely that this assumption is violated in a significant enough number of cases to affect clear trends reported in this study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>An Overview of HPKs across Bacteria</title><p>The fraction of HPKs coded by a given genome is known to scale roughly with the size of the genome, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020143-g002">Figure 2</xref> (an even better correlation is seen if all signaling proteins in a genome are considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b002">2</xref>]). We wanted to identify and investigate genomes that had particularly high numbers of HPKs to see if we could identify their origin. Did these genomes duplicate existing HPKs, acquire large amounts through HGT, or did they simply lose fewer “old” HPKs than other genomes? Several different types of genomes were chosen as examples for more in-depth study throughout this manuscript (and details for all are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020143-sd001">Dataset S1</xref>). First, we chose organisms in which more than 1.5% of the genome codes for HPKs (red squares in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020143-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

In these results, we considered genes derived from an HGT event followed by a duplication event in the totals for duplicates, but not when computing the totals for HGT, as it is not possible using our method to determine which of the resulting paralogs is more likely to have retained the ancestral state of signaling domains.</p><p>A notable outlier in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020143-g007">Figure 7</xref> is worth mentioning: <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. coelicolor</named-content> contains the largest fraction of new genes acquired by LSE of all the genomes we studied, yet a large fraction of these genes contain an identical set of upstream signaling domains.

These consumers of preexisting genetic diversity are less likely to contain completely novel domain structure, and are more likely to include HPKs in proximity to their cognate RR. Individual genomes appear to have very different preferences for HGT or LSE. LSE is the dominant force in species that are the most highly regulated (those with the highest proportion of genes coding for HPKs), whereas HGT appears to be dominant, for example, in the well-studied model systems <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> and <italic>B. subtilis.</italic></p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Anatomy of an LSE</title><p>To better understand the structure of an LSE, we investigated a single expansion in the two sequenced <italic>Desulfovibrio</italic> species. Several striking features are present in the expansion depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020143-g008">Figure 8</xref>. First, the diversity in the upstream signaling domains is obvious in the nonorthologous pairs of HPKs (some likely orthologs between <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. vulgaris</named-content> and <italic>D. alaskensis</italic> are shown, and have a similar set of upstream domains).

This domain structure is identical between the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species and one of the members of the <italic>Desulfovibrio</italic> expansion, which we postulate served as the donor or acceptor. Third, many of the upstream signaling regions contain repeated domains, but only some of these are noticeably more similar in sequence than other pairs. Thus, rearrangements involve domains that are acquired from distant sources or domains that have been subject to more rapid evolution than HPK domains. Finally, there appears to be a mixture of proteins with and without predicted transmembrane domains, implying that the same basic architecture can support both kinds of signaling mechanisms. Further domain shuffling may also be happening at the level of the extracellular sensory regions not detected by our sequence profiles.</p><fig id="pcbi-0020143-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020143.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Domain Shuffling in a <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Desulfovibrio</named-content> spp. Expansion</title><p>The domain structure of genes in a large LSE in the <italic>Desulfovibrio</italic> genus is shown.

This implies that domain architecture is not completely plastic. Instead, there appear to be “rules” for constructing new functional paralogs, and certain domains may be necessary to preserve optimal activity. Similarly, several expansions in <italic>Nostoc</italic> consist of a conserved set of core domains preceded by a variable upstream (N-terminal) region.

In some sense, signaling genes that are expressed under different sets of conditions could be considered to have different functions even if they regulated overlapping sets of genes.

A key finding of the survey of gene acquisition/loss by Lerat and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b019">19</xref>] is that gene family expansion is not a major mechanism of gene acquisition, at least in γ-proteobacteria. The current work focuses on a notable exception to this general rule, the HPKs. It is worth noting that in the set of genomes examined by Lerat and coworkers, HPKs did follow the general trend observed for other genes: new acquisitions generally represented an influx of new gene families rather than duplication of existing families. Therefore, it may be premature to conclude that it is this family of genes rather than the genomes themselves that are exceptional in this regard. Very large expansions of cytochrome genes have been reported for some of the δ-proteobacteria that we follow in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b022">22</xref>], lending some support to the idea of genome-specific in addition to gene-specific differences in the propensity for expansion.</p><p>Whether or not some genomes have greater propensities for gene duplication overall, there are genome-specific differences in the likelihood of duplications in the HPK gene family.

Few would argue with the assertion that a gene present in multiple highly similar copies in a single clade, but only one (or zero) more distantly related copies in earlier-branching outgroups, reflects an LSE. Identification of HGT, on the other hand, relies on a less clear-cut argument: that a single HGT event is a more parsimonious (and therefore more likely) explanation for the absence of a gene in two or more consecutive outgroups (excluding reduced genomes) than is two or more consecutive deletion events. Therefore, some additional consideration of the evidence for HGT and alternative explanations for the observed patterns of gene distributions is called for.</p><p>One of the key lines of evidence supporting our approach for identifying HGT events is that we are able to identify donor–acceptor pairs with identical upstream signaling domains using only sequence data from the HPK domain. While this lends support to our domain-based BLASTp approach, it does not directly address the challenge of identifying a HGT scenario from multiple deletions, since vertically transmitted orthologs would also be likely to retain a similar set of upstream signaling domains. To test this hypothesis, we used a more conservative cutoff, absence from three consecutive outgroups, for identifying HGT events. This stricter cutoff produced nearly identical results (47.3% versus 47.4% of upstream domains were conserved using the two definitions), as reported in the earlier section on domain shuffling, lending support to a true difference between HGT and LSE genes. In addition, we found that horizontally transferred HPKs were <italic>more</italic> likely than vertically transmitted genes to occur in the same operon as a response regulator, supporting a distinction between these HGT genes and vertically transmitted genes.</p><p>We also examined the distribution of donor–acceptor genome pairs for the genomes with large amounts of inferred HGT events. While there was a general trend for HGT events within major bacterial groups (e.g., between <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. subtilis</named-content> and other firmicutes, or between <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> and other proteobacteria), there was not a clear excess of transfer to and from a single pair of species, which might be expected if there were significant false positives resulting from an inaccurate species tree.</p><p>Finally, we observe that our results are in general agreement with a recently published study that estimated HGT rates across all gene families among sequenced bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b020">20</xref>]. <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. japonicum</named-content> has one of the highest rates of HGT among all bacteria in both studies, and most of the genomes indicated as having high rates of HGT in the previous study indeed are indicated to have significant levels of new HPKs arising through HGT in the present work. It should be noted that we did not describe results for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Pirellula</named-content> sp. in the current study because we could not resolve its phylogeny well enough to make confident assertions about its evolutionary history. Another difference between our study and the work by Ouzounis and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b020">20</xref>] is our finding that the sequenced <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species are outliers containing a large number of HPKs possibly acquired via HGT. <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> was also identified by Lerat et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b019">19</xref>] as having recently acquired a large number of “ORFan” genes without obvious sequence homologs, but we did not see evidence for large numbers of novel HPK “birth” events. Whether <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> genomes confine their horizontal transfer to genes involved in signal transduction is an interesting question for further study.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Mechanisms of HPK Evolution</title><p>The mechanisms that can lead to HGT of genes are well-studied. Phage, plasmids, and competence can all help facilitate the transfer of foreign DNA. In a dramatic example, most of the HPK genes (10 of 17) on the megaplasmid of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">R. solanacearum</named-content> are predicted to be horizontally transferred into that lineage, and nine of ten of these are inferred to have transferred very recently (i.e., they are absent in the closest two outgroups). This suggests the megaplasmid may have served as a vessel for the import of these genes (see plasmid genes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020143-g010">Figure 10</xref>). In contrast, only 11 of 27 genes on the main chromosome are inferred to be the result of horizontal transfer, and of these, only five are absent in the closest outgroups.</p><p>Despite the fact that LSE is a major driving force in the genesis of new HPKs (by our estimates, a larger factor than HGT), the mechanism(s) behind these expansions are unclear. In some cases, transposons can be implicated in recent gene expansions, in particular when the transposase genes occur next to the gene copies undergoing expansion. Yet, for most of the large expansions we observed, there was no evidence of nearby transposons, and duplications of HPKs were accompanied by domain shuffling of their upstream regions. Transposons are unsatisfying as an explanation in this case because new combinations of upstream signaling domains are not created directly from single transposition events (an insertion event would interrupt the reading frame between the HPK domain and the new signaling domain). Thus, genomes involving large LSEs may contain additional mechanisms that allow for the rearrangement of individual domains, and the presence of these mechanisms may account for the predisposition of those genomes to LSE rather than to HGT.</p><p>A recent genomic survey of recombination machinery across bacteria did not identify specific components unique to this set of genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b023">23</xref>]. Instead, many of the species we identified as rich in gene expansions were highlighted as genomes known to undergo recombination, but lacking a full complement of presynaptic recombination proteins. Perhaps some of these genomes contain alternative, yet-to-be-identified presynaptic genes with properties that facilitate LSE and/or domain shuffling. Gene duplication is known to happen at high frequency near the ends of the linear <italic>Streptomyces</italic> chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b024">24</xref>], but probably through a different mechanism than other LSE-rich genomes because the domain structure and cognate response regulators are more highly conserved in this species compared with the other species prone to duplication events.</p><p>An alternative to the theory of genome-specific recombinational machinery is a role for phage or other extrachromosomal elements in the duplication and rearrangement of domains in these signaling proteins. A recent study by Aravind and coworkers found massive domain shuffling and LSE of a family of fungal transcription factors occurring inside viral genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b025">25</xref>]. A phage origin for LSEs would also explain the discrepancy between the relatively common tandem duplication and shuffling of signaling domains within HPKs (which could occur in the phage genome), and the apparent random positioning of paralogous HPKs across the genome (which would be the result of random phage insertions). To test the phage origin hypothesis, we examined large LSEs across a number of genomes, but did not find a statistically significant excess of phage genes near paralogs. Moreover, a BLASTp search of phage databases yielded only a few very weak hits to HPKs.</p><p>Whether genome-specific recombinational machinery, extrachromosomal elements, or other factors (such as environments that select for large numbers of HPKs) are responsible for generating genetic diversity among HPKs, it is clear that there are genome-specific differences. Genomes such as <italic>Streptomyces</italic> represent still a different paradigm (i.e., capability for large-scale expansion but little new diversity, at least at the level of domain structure). Why this creative ability appears to be limited to a subset of genomes, and whether these differences among taxa extend to other gene families, emerge as key directions for future research.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Inferring evolutionary histories of HPKs.</title><p>To describe the origin of HPK domains, we examined the phylogenetic distribution of those domains across other taxa. Similar to previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b026">26</xref>], we inferred “birth” events when a domain was found only in a single clade and horizontal transfer events in cases where multiple gene losses were needed to explain the phylogenetic distribution, assuming vertical descent. Unlike the previous studies mentioned, we were interested in cataloging and determining the relative age of gene duplication events. Because different HPK families can be considered ancient paralogs, we were not able to use a simple presence/absence criterion to describe the distribution of genes in taxa. Instead, we used a BLASTp score cutoff on sequence similarities to infer the phylogenetic distributions of particular subfamilies as described in the following section. Importantly, our analysis was based only on the histidine kinase domains (on average, 224 residues), excluding sensory and other domains, so that we could discriminate the independent processes of domain evolution and shuffling of upstream signaling domains.</p><p>The inference process is briefly outlined below (details follow in later sections). (1) Construct phylogeny for all species using concatenated ubiquitous genes. (2) Identify HPKs from coding regions of all genomes. (3) Parse HPKs into domains (PAS, HAMP, TM, HPK, etc.). (4) Find best hits of each “query” HPK (domain) to outgroups: move up one node in the species tree (starting from the genome containing the “query” HPK). Next, add the leaves of the new branch to the current “outgroup” (if the current node has a bootstrap value of less than 80%, then move up one node in the species tree again), and record the best hit of the “query” HPK to the current “outgroup” species. Next, record the number of “paralog” HPKs (in the same genome as the query) that have higher BLASTp scores than the best hit to the current outgroup. The gene count at this node [see step 6] is equal to [1/number of paralogs]. The duplicate count at this node [see step 6] is equal to [1 – (the gene count)]. Repeat with a new “outgroup” until the root node is reached. (5) Build presence/absence profile from best hits: if the best hit to any outgroup is less than 25% of the BLASTp score of the query HPK to itself, then set that outgroup to zero (for absent); otherwise, starting from the most ancient outgroup <italic>(Aquifex aeolicus),</italic> set the score of each outgroup equal to one (for present) unless the best hit to that outgroup is less than the best hit to an older outgroup by a bitscore value of 20 (in which case set the score to zero for absent). If any outgroup with score zero contains only reduced genomes with fewer than ten HPKs, change its score to two [for unknown]. (6) Infer evolutionary history from presence/absence profile—if there are two or more consecutive zeroes (ignoring twos) in the presence/absence profile for a given HPK, then it is considered HGT. The oldest outgroup containing a one before the run of zeroes is considered the age of the HGT event; if this age is past the phylogenetic cutoff, then the HGT is not counted. The gene count at these nodes is added to the number of HGT events for the query genome—otherwise, if there are no ones in outgroups older than the phylogenetic cutoff distance, then it is considered a HPK subfamily “birth,” and the gene event score at the oldest “one” is added to the estimated number of “birth” events. The number of gene duplications is estimated by adding the duplicate count at the oldest outgroup containing a “one” that is within the phylogenetic cutoff age to the total LSE counts.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Step 1: Construction of bacterial species tree.</title><p>Each gene that was present in every bacterial genome studied, without obvious paralogs (no other genes in the same cluster of orthologous groups), was used to construct a species tree. The tree was built based on the multiple sequence alignment using the concatenated sequences of these 15 genes, which are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020143-st001">Table S1</xref>. Muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b027">27</xref>] was used for the multiple sequence alignment; gaps were trimmed using MEGA3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b028">28</xref>]. A neighbor-joining tree with 100 bootstrap replicates was built using the Phylip [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b029">29</xref>] software package with the PMB (probability matrix from blocks) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b030">30</xref>] amino acid substitution model. Gamma-distributed rates were used with a shape parameter of 0.72, which was estimated using TREE-PUZZLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b031">31</xref>]. Branch lengths were then constructed using the bootstrap consensus tree topology and the PROTDIST program included in the PHYLIP package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b029">29</xref>], enforcing equal distances of each species to the tree root. Unequal rates for different taxa were not taken into consideration, and therefore distances should not be interpreted as accurate estimates of evolutionary time. The tree is included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020143-sd003">Dataset S3</xref> for review.</p><p>Our species tree is based on concatenated protein (mostly ribosomal) genes.

We also experimented with 16S rDNA sequence trees and genome content trees, but found that the concatenated gene trees produced better-resolved trees that seemed to avoid some unexpected groupings that probably arise from differences in GC content and reduced genomes. We include our species tree in Newick format as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020143-sd003">Dataset S3</xref> for review. We chose the root of our tree at the last common ancestor of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. aeolicus</named-content> and other bacteria. We do not claim strong evidence for the early branching of this lineage; instead, we limit our analysis to more recent evolutionary events that do not depend strongly on the topology of the deepest-branching nodes.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Step 2: Identification of HPKs.</title><p>We identified 4,959 HPKs in 20 archaeal and 187 bacterial genomes based on sequence and profile similarities. A protein was considered a putative HPK if the protein contained a histidine kinase domain, (IPR005467 as measured using the InterPro software suite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b032">32</xref>]), or was assigned to the signal transduction histidine kinase COG4582 using a profile-based RPS-BLAST search [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b034">34</xref>]. In addition, we considered all proteins that were not picked up by either method, but that contained an ATPase domain according to SuperFamily motif SSF55874 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b035">35</xref>]. If a protein contained an ATPase domain and was a transmembrane protein or had one or more known signaling domains (e.g., PAS, HAMP), then it was also considered an HPK.</p><p>For 123 of 130 genomes, our approach compared favorably with that of Galperin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b002">2</xref>], who used manually curated PSI-BLAST searches to identify likely HPKs, in that we identified nearly the same number of HPKs. For seven genomes, the total counts differed by more than four, with <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. coelicolor</named-content> being the largest deviation (the study by Galperin identified 95, while our method found only 81). Overall, we argue that our main findings are not substantially affected by the differences in the numbers of HPKs, as our overall numbers are consistent with the manually curated study by Galperin. A detailed comparison on a genome-by-genome basis is provided as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020143-sd001">Dataset S1</xref>.

Bacterial genomes with small genome size (i.e., &lt;1,000 protein-coding genes) tended to have few or no HPKs, and the proportion of HPKs was correlated with the genome size. Approximately half (11 of 20) of the archaeal genomes with a large range of genome sizes (553–3,106 protein-coding genes) had no HPKs. HPKs from archaeal genomes were not considered in this analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Step 3: Identification of structural and signaling domains in histidine kinases.</title><p>We used the profile-based methods included in the InterPro software suite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b032">32</xref>] to identify common signaling domains, and TmHMM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b036">36</xref>] to predict transmembrane regions of HPKs. The key protein families used were: CheY-like response regulator receiver: PF00072, SSF52172; CheB methylesterase: PS50122; CheR-type MCP methyltransferase: PS50123; PAS: SM00091, SSF55785, or TIGR00229; HAMP: PF00672, PS50885; GAF: SSF55781, SM00065; Hpt: SSF47226, PF01627; CACHE: PF02743; Phytochrome, light-sensing: PF00360, PS50046 (PF, Pfam; SM, SMART; SSF, SuperFamily; TIGR, TIGRFAM; PS, PROSITE PROFILE).</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Step 4: Build best BLASTp hit profile.</title><p>The first step in this procedure was to identify a set of unambiguous “outgroups” for each species. We considered each ancestor node on the tree built in step 1 that contained the target species, starting with the most recent. If the bootstrap support at that node was at least 80%, then all the species present in the leaves of the new branch were considered to constitute an “outgroup.” If the bootstrap support was less than 80%, then those species were put aside until an internal node with at least 80% support was reached, and all of the leaves of those new branches were combined into a single “outgroup.” The best BLASTp hit to any of the HPK domains contained within each outgroup was recorded.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Step 5: Build presence/absence profile from best hits.</title><p>Each best-hit profile was converted to a string of integers (0, 1, or 2), indicating whether the particular gene subfamily was likely to be present or absent from each outgroup. First, a lower boundary was placed on BLASTp hits: scores less than 25% of the maximal BLASTp score (of the query gene to itself) were not considered, as these are essentially different subfamilies of HPKs. These low scores were set to zero.</p><p>Outgroups that had BLASTp hits greater than the best hit to any more distant outgroups (minus a threshold bitscore of 20 from the distant outgroup hit) were assigned a one. A string of ones, therefore, indicates a set of BLASTp distances consistent with vertical inheritance of the query HPK. The threshold of 20 makes our method more conservative in calling gene absences, and was intended to lessen the effects of evolutionary rate differences among lineages and possible errors in our species tree topology.</p><p>Outgroups without a hit greater than that seen in older groups were assigned zero, unless every genome in the outgroup had less than ten HPKs. In that case, it is likely that those species had undergone a genome-wide reduction in the number of HPKs, and multiple absences from such outgroups does not provide strong support for the alternative hypothesis of HGT. These outgroups were assigned a value of two. The cutoff of ten HPKs is essentially an ad hoc rule that works well at identifying reduced genomes in the set of genomes studied. A list of excluded genomes is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020143-sd002">Dataset S2</xref>.

We considered four possible origins for extant HPKs: (1) duplication of pre-existing HPKs; (2) horizontal transfer from distantly related genomes; (3) “birth” of novel HPK subfamilies; and (4) “old” HPKs that were present in the genome early in its evolutionary history.</p><p><italic>Phylogenetic cutoff.</italic> To classify evolutionary events as “recent,” we defined a phylogenetic cutoff distance before which we did not report events. This had the additional benefit of making our analysis robust to the topology of the deepest and most-difficult-to-resolve branches. The cutoff distance used is roughly equivalent to the divergence time of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> from the most distantly related γ-proteobacteria.

Because different taxa have different evolutionary rates for the same set of genes, we used a cutoff based on a species tree in which the distance of each leaf to the root is assumed to be equal. We used this “linearized” tree distance not to compute accurate divergence times, but to enforce our phylogenetic cutoff distance across different lineages more evenly.</p><p><italic>“Event” counting.</italic> The basic algorithm for counting HGT, LSE, and birth events is discussed above, but some explanation is necessary for the “gene count” and “duplicate count” calculations. Because we consider each HPK independently, we need to adjust the counts such that a gene that is horizontally transferred once, and subsequently duplicated, is not counted as two HGT events. For this reason, we count only (1/number of paralogs) HGT events for each duplicate copy. By similar reasoning, a gene duplicated four times should not be counted as five duplication events, because one copy represents the original gene. To avoid overcounting of duplication events, we count only [1 – (1/number of paralogs)] LSE events for each paralog.</p><p><italic>Gene expression data.</italic> Gene expression microarray data was downloaded from the MicrobesOnline database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020143-b037">37</xref>].
