<p>During DNA double-strand break repair, two structure-specific DNA nucleases are controlled by the same regulator Pxd1, but in opposite manners.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Structure-specific nucleases play crucial roles in many DNA repair pathways. They must be precisely controlled to ensure optimal repair outcomes; however, mechanisms of their regulation are not fully understood. Here, we report a fission yeast protein, Pxd1, that binds to and regulates two structure-specific nucleases: Rad16<sup>XPF</sup>-Swi10<sup>ERCC1</sup> and Dna2-Cdc24. Strikingly, Pxd1 influences the activities of these two nucleases in opposite ways: It activates the 3′ endonuclease activity of Rad16-Swi10 but inhibits the RPA-mediated activation of the 5′ endonuclease activity of Dna2. Pxd1 is required for Rad16-Swi10 to function in single-strand annealing, mating-type switching, and the removal of Top1-DNA adducts. Meanwhile, Pxd1 attenuates DNA end resection mediated by the Rqh1-Dna2 pathway. Disabling the Dna2-inhibitory activity of Pxd1 results in enhanced use of a break-distal repeat sequence in single-strand annealing and a greater loss of genetic information. We propose that Pxd1 promotes proper DNA repair by differentially regulating two structure-specific nucleases.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Genome stability maintenance relies on DNA repair enzymes, among which are structure-specific nucleases that cleave DNA in a sequence-independent but structure-dependent manner. It is important to understand how the activities of such nucleases are controlled, because either insufficient or excessive cleavage of DNA could jeopardize genome integrity. In this study, we discovered a new regulator of two different structure-specific nucleases in the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>. The identified protein, which we named Pxd1, promotes the activity of the 3′ endonuclease Rad16, but restrains the activity of the 5′ endonuclease Dna2. In the absence of Pxd1, several Rad16-dependent DNA repair processes become defective. One of these processes is a DNA-repeat–mediated double-strand break repair pathway called single-strand annealing, which causes genomic deletions. When the Dna2-inhibitory activity of Pxd1 is impaired, Dna2-dependent end processing of double-strand breaks is enhanced and a more extensive deletion occurs during single-strand annealing. Thus, Pxd1 facilitates a potentially dangerous DNA repair process, but in the meantime minimizes its deleterious consequences. We propose that a dual-target regulator like Pxd1 is ideally suited for coordinating multiple enzymatic activities during DNA repair.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Structure-specific DNA nucleases contribute to the maintenance of genome stability by processing DNA secondary structures during DNA replication and repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001946-Zheng1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001946-Marti1">[2]</xref>. The activities of these nucleases must be tightly controlled to prevent unintended cleavage; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of these nucleases have not been fully elucidated.</p>
<p>The roles of several structure-specific nucleases in DNA repair are best understood in the single-strand annealing (SSA) pathway of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. SSA is a repair pathway for DSBs occurring between repeat sequences and has been most thoroughly studied in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001946-Paques1">[3]</xref>. SSA relies on the DNA resection process to generate 3′-ended single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) extending from the break to the repeat sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001946-FishmanLobell1">[4]</xref>. Such long-range resection is mediated by two structure-specific nucleases, Exo1 and Dna2, which act in parallel to each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001946-Zhu1">[5]</xref>. Upon annealing of the ssDNA of the repeat sequences, the intervening sequence between the repeats, which now becomes 3′ nonhomologous ssDNA tails, is removed by a nuclease complex Rad1-Rad10 in budding yeast (XPF-ERCC1 in mammals and Rad16-Swi10 in the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001946-FishmanLobell2">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>The function of Rad1-Rad10 in SSA requires two positive regulators, Saw1 and Slx4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001946-Flott1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001946-Toh1">[10]</xref>. Saw1 recruits Rad1-Rad10 to the DNA substrate during SSA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001946-Li1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001946-Li2">[11]</xref>; however, the exact role of Slx4 in SSA is not clear. Furthermore, it is not known whether the activities of the resection nucleases are regulated during SSA.</p>
<p>Here we show that a novel factor Pxd1 is a key regulator of SSA in fission yeast. It interacts with both the nonhomologous ssDNA cleavage nuclease Rad16<sup>XPF</sup> and the resection nuclease Dna2, thus influencing different aspects of SSA. Interestingly, Pxd1 regulates these two structure-specific nucleases in opposite ways: it promotes the completion of SSA by activating the nuclease activity of Rad16, while it minimizes genetic information loss by inhibiting RPA-mediated Dna2 activation.</p>

<title>Identification of Pxd1 as a Rad16- and Dna2-Interacting Protein</title>
<p>A previously uncharacterized fission yeast protein, SPBC409.16c, has been predicted by PomBase as the ortholog of budding yeast Saw1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001946-Wood1">[12]</xref>.

<p>Intriguingly, Dna2, Cdc24, and an uncharacterized protein SPCC1322.02 also co-purified with Saw1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Dna2 and the fission-yeast-unique protein Cdc24 are known to form a heterodimer and are both required for Okazaki fragment maturation in fission yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001946-Tanaka1">[15]</xref>. When SPCC1322.02 was used as bait for AP-MS analysis, the same six proteins were again isolated together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting that Rad16-Swi10-Saw1, Dna2-Cdc24, and SPCC1322.02 co-exist in a protein complex, which we named the PXD (<italic>pombe</italic> XPF and Dna2) complex. Accordingly, we named SPCC1322.02 Pxd1.</p>

<title>Pxd1 Mediates the Association between Rad16-Swi10-Saw1 and Dna2-Cdc24</title>
<p>Pxd1 is annotated by PomBase as a “sequence orphan” with no apparent orthologs outside of the fission yeast clade, and it does not contain any known domains. To identify the regions of Pxd1 that participate in its interactions with Rad16-Swi10 and Dna2-Cdc24, we performed truncation analysis and found that its interaction with Rad16-Swi10 is mediated by the middle region of Pxd1 (residues 101–233), whereas its interaction with Dna2-Cdc24 is mediated by the C-terminal region of Pxd1 (residues 227–351) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>Because distinct regions of Pxd1 mediate its interactions with Rad16-Swi10 and Dna2-Cdc24, we hypothesized that Pxd1 may act as a scaffold to bring these two nucleases together. We tested this idea by examining the association of the two nucleases in wild-type and <italic>pxd1Δ</italic> backgrounds. Cdc24 co-immunoprecipitated with Rad16 in the wild type, but this interaction was abolished in <italic>pxd1Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Similarly, the interaction between Saw1 and Cdc24 was abolished in <italic>pxd1Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). These results suggest that, within the PXD complex, Pxd1 acts as a physical link between the Rad16-Swi10-Saw1 and Dna2-Cdc24 subcomplexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g001">Figure 1F</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine where Pxd1 binds on its binding partners, we performed yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay, immunoprecipitation using truncated proteins, and cross-linking mass spectrometry (CXMS) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001946.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Rad16, Dna2 and Cdc24, but not Swi10, exhibited positive Y2H interactions with Pxd1. An N-terminal fragment of Rad16 (residues 1–451), which contains a helicase-like domain, was sufficient to co-immunoprecipitate Pxd1 in the absence of Swi10. CXMS analysis of a Dna2-Cdc24-Pxd1(227–351) complex detected cross-links between the K148 residue of Cdc24 and two different residues of Pxd1 (K276 and K351). Consistently, Cdc24(80–245), which contains the K148 residue, is the smallest fragment of Cdc24 that could robustly co-immunoprecipitate Pxd1.</p>

<title>Pxd1 Acts with Rad16-Swi10 in the IR Response</title>
<p>To understand the function of Pxd1, we generated a <italic>pxd1</italic> deletion mutant, which exhibited no growth defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Thus, Pxd1 is unlikely to be important for the replication function of Dna2-Cdc24, which is essential for viability. We then examined the DNA damage sensitivity of deletion mutants of <italic>pxd1</italic> and related nonessential genes. <italic>pxd1Δ</italic> showed mild sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR) but displayed no obvious sensitivity to UV, methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), camptothecin (CPT), or hydroxyurea (HU) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Consistent with the known role of Rad16-Swi10 in nucleotide excision repair (NER), <italic>rad16Δ</italic> and <italic>swi10Δ</italic> showed severe sensitivity to UV that was at a level similar to the mutant lacking another NER factor, Rhp14<sup>XPA</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). These three mutants also showed similar sensitivity to MMS and HU. However, <italic>rad16Δ</italic> and <italic>swi10Δ</italic> were more sensitive to IR than <italic>rhp14Δ</italic>, which most likely reflected the non-NER functions of Rad16-Swi10, such as the removal of the 3′ nonhomologous ssDNA tails during homologous recombination (HR) repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001946-Farah1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001946-Prudden1">[17]</xref>. Surprisingly, <italic>saw1Δ</italic> displayed no sensitivity to any treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In addition, deletion of <italic>saw1</italic> did not enhance the DNA damage sensitivity of <italic>pxd1Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) The DNA damage sensitivity of the indicated strains was examined using a spot assay. <italic>pxd1Δ</italic>, but not <italic>saw1Δ</italic>, cells exhibited mild IR sensitivity. The IR sensitivity of <italic>rad16Δ</italic> and <italic>swi10Δ</italic> cells was stronger than that of NER-defective <italic>rhp14Δ</italic> cells, suggesting a role of Rad16-Swi10 in non-NER repair. (B) Deletion of <italic>saw1</italic> did not alter the DNA damage sensitivity of <italic>pxd1Δ</italic>, <italic>rad16Δ</italic>, or their double mutant. (C) For the IR sensitivity phenotype, <italic>rad16Δ</italic> is epistatic to <italic>rhp14Δ</italic> and <italic>pxd1Δ</italic>. The double mutant <italic>rhp14Δ pxd1Δ</italic> was more sensitive than <italic>rhp14Δ</italic> or <italic>pxd1Δ</italic> and phenocopied <italic>rad16Δ</italic>, suggesting that Pxd1 acts with Rad16 in the non-NER repair process.</p>
</caption><graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001946.g002" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>To test the epistatic relationship between <italic>pxd1Δ</italic>, <italic>rhp14Δ</italic>, and <italic>rad16Δ</italic>, we examined the sensitivity of their single, double, and triple mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Deletion of <italic>pxd1</italic>, <italic>rhp14</italic>, or both in <italic>rad16Δ</italic> did not enhance the IR sensitivity. In contrast, the <italic>pxd1Δ rhp14Δ</italic> double mutant showed greater IR sensitivity than either single mutant, reaching a level similar to that of <italic>rad16Δ</italic>. These results suggest that Pxd1 acts with Rad16-Swi10 in the non-NER repair of IR-induced DNA damage.</p>

<title>Pxd1 Acts with Rad16-Swi10 in SSA</title>
<p>To further delineate the role of Pxd1 in non-NER repair, we examined whether Pxd1 functions with Rad16-Swi10 in SSA. We constructed a strain in which an HO endonuclease-induced DSB is flanked by two direct repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). In such a system, homologous recombination between the two repeats may proceed through either the SSA or BIR mechanisms, but because the two repeats are only about 6 kb apart, SSA is expected to be the predominant pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001946-Jain1">[18]</xref>. Regardless of which mechanism is used, two 3′ nonhomologous ssDNA tails, one 6,328 nt long and the other 29 nt long, must be removed by a nuclease such as Rad16-Swi10, resulting in the loss of the HO cleavage site and a <italic>leu1<sup>+</sup></italic> marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). For simplicity, we will hereafter refer to this repair process as SSA.</p>

<p>(A) Schematic of the SSA system. An HO site is flanked by two 1.2-kb-long direct repeats, shown as green rectangles. HO is controlled by the thiamine-repressible <italic>nmt1</italic> promoter. Upon DSB formation at the HO site, SSA proceeds through resection, annealing between the repeat DNA, cleavage of the 3′ nonhomologous ssDNA tails, gap filling, and ligation. To visually distinguish the two strands of the duplex DNA, they are shown as lines of different thickness. (B) The growth of <italic>rad16Δ</italic>, <italic>swi10Δ</italic>, and <italic>pxd1Δ</italic>, but not <italic>saw1Δ</italic>, cells was delayed by the induction of an SSA-repairable DSB. Serial dilutions of strains harboring the SSA system, shown in (A), were spotted on plates with or without thiamine after incubation in thiamine-free liquid medium for 8 h. (C) <italic>swi10Δ</italic> and <italic>pxd1Δ</italic>, but not <italic>saw1Δ</italic>, cells are defective in the elimination of the intervening sequence between the repeats. The top panel depicts the primers used for qPCR. It takes more than 10 h for HO to be induced after thiamine removal. Data shown are the mean and standard error of assays run in triplicate and are representative of three independent experiments. For most of the data points, error bars are shorter than the size of symbols. (D) The middle region of Pxd1 is required for its SSA function. SSA assay was performed as in (B). (E) Schematic of the assay monitoring the removal of a 3′ nonhomologous ssDNA tail. Prior to qPCR, the genomic DNA was treated with BstUI, which cuts duplex DNA but not ssDNA.

<p>When wild-type cells harboring the SSA system were shifted from an HO repression (+ thiamine) to an HO induction condition (−thiamine) in liquid media, no obvious growth arrest was observed, but the cells became Leu<sup>−</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001946.s002">Figure S2A and B</xref>), indicating that SSA repair was highly efficient. In contrast, when HO was induced in <italic>rad16Δ</italic> and <italic>swi10Δ</italic> cells, their proliferation was retarded for approximately 20 h, suggesting a delay of the repair process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001946.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). Eventually most of the <italic>rad16Δ</italic> and <italic>swi10Δ</italic> cells survived and became Leu<sup>−</sup>, most likely due to backup nuclease activities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001946.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). On thiamine-free solid media, the repair defect of <italic>rad16Δ</italic> and <italic>swi10Δ</italic> also manifested as a growth delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). <italic>pxd1Δ</italic> cells showed the same growth delay as <italic>rad16Δ</italic> and <italic>swi10Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In addition, the double mutants <italic>rad16Δ pxd1Δ</italic> and <italic>swi10Δ pxd1Δ</italic> exhibited the same phenotype as the three single mutants, indicating that Rad16-Swi10 and Pxd1 function in the same process. In this assay, <italic>saw1Δ</italic> again behaved like the wild type. Moreover, deleting <italic>saw1</italic> in <italic>pxd1Δ</italic> did not exacerbate the phenotype. Thus, unlike its budding yeast ortholog, fission yeast Saw1 does not appear to be important for SSA.</p>
<p>To more directly monitor SSA, we examined the elimination of the intervening DNA sequence between the repeats using qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). The rate of DNA elimination in the <italic>pxd1Δ</italic> and <italic>swi10Δ</italic> mutants was significantly slower than in the wild type and the <italic>saw1Δ</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). In addition, we visualized Rad52 nuclear foci, which is an indication of ongoing DNA repair activity. In the wild-type and <italic>saw1Δ</italic> cells, the level of Rad52 foci transiently increased after HO induction but returned to the pre-induction level within 8 h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001946.s002">Figure S2C and D</xref>). In contrast, in <italic>pxd1Δ</italic>, <italic>rad16Δ</italic>, and <italic>swi10Δ</italic> cells, HO-induced Rad52 foci remained at a high level for more than 10 h. Thus, DNA repair in these three mutants failed to efficiently proceed to completion.</p>
<p>To test whether the interaction between Pxd1 and Rad16-Swi10 is required for SSA, we examined cells expressing truncated versions of Pxd1. Pxd1 missing either its N-terminal region or C-terminal region could rescue the defect of <italic>pxd1Δ</italic>, whereas Pxd1 without the middle region failed to rescue the phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Thus, the region of Pxd1 involved in Rad16-Swi10 binding is required for SSA.</p>

<title>Pxd1 Is Required for 3′ Nonhomologous ssDNA Removal in SSA</title>
<p>During SSA, the role of Rad16-Swi10 is to remove the 3′ nonhomologous ssDNA tails. Given that the interaction between Pxd1 and Rad16-Swi10 is required for SSA, we hypothesized that Pxd1 is involved in the same step. To test this idea, we monitored the level of 3′ ssDNA using a qPCR assay. In this assay, the PCR template was genomic DNA pre-digested with a restriction enzyme, BstUI, that cuts double-stranded but not single-stranded DNA. Thus, the level of the PCR product reflects the amount of ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). In wild-type and <italic>saw1Δ</italic> cells, only a transient and small increase (approximately 10%) of ssDNA occurred after HO induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g003">Figure 3F</xref>).

<title>Pxd1 Acts with Rad16-Swi10 in Mating-Type Switching and the Removal of Top1 Cleavage Complexes (Top1cc)</title>
<p>Rad16 (also known as Swi9) and Swi10 are required for mating-type switching, presumably due to their involvement in resolving recombination intermediates of the HR process triggered by the programmed DSB at the mating type locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001946.s003">Figure S3A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001946-Schmidt1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001946-Egel1">[20]</xref>.

<title>Pxd1 Activates the 3′ Endonuclease Activity of Rad16-Swi10</title>
<p>To understand how Pxd1 acts with Rad16-Swi10, we tested whether its absence affects the nuclease activity of Rad16-Swi10 purified from fission yeast cells. For a positive control, we used a strain expressing C-terminally truncated Pxd1 as the only form of Pxd1, so that Dna2-Cdc24, which also has nuclease activities, does not co-purify with Rad16-Swi10. As described earlier, this truncated form of Pxd1 is sufficient for SSA, mating-type switching, and Top1cc removal. Consistent with the known substrate specificity of XPF family nucleases, Rad16 immunoprecipitated from such a strain showed robust nuclease activity toward 3′ overhang DNA and Y fork DNA but not 5′ overhang DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001946.s005">Figure S5A</xref>).

<p>The middle region of Pxd1 is required for its interaction with Rad16-Swi10 and is needed for SSA, mating-type switching, and the removal of Top1cc.

<title>Pxd1 Blocks the RPA-Mediated Activation of the Nuclease Activity of Dna2</title>
<p>To understand how Pxd1(227–351) down-regulates the functions of Dna2-Cdc24 when overexpressed, we investigated whether in vitro it influences the nuclease activity of Dna2-Cdc24.

Recombinant Pxd1(227–351) purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> did not affect the basal activity of Dna2; however, it significantly weakened the activation effect of RPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Pxd1(227–351)-5A failed to inhibit the RPA-mediated activation of Dna2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Thus, the interaction between Pxd1 and Dna2 impedes the activation of Dna2 by RPA.</p>
<p>RPA can enhance the nuclease activity of Dna2 by promoting the binding of Dna2 on ssDNA in budding yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001946-Bae1">[24]</xref>; therefore, we hypothesized that Pxd1(227–351) may block RPA-mediated Dna2 binding to DNA substrates. To test this idea, we first investigated the ability of Pxd1 and Dna2-Cdc24 to bind a 5′ overhang DNA using a gel mobility shift assay. In this assay, DNA cleavage was prevented by using a buffer containing 1 mM EDTA and no divalent cations. Dna2-Cdc24 shifted the mobility of the DNA, whereas Pxd1(227–351) had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g006">Figure 6E</xref>, lanes 2–5). The addition of Pxd1(227–351) with Dna2-Cdc24 led to the formation of a complex that migrated faster than the Dna2-Cdc24-DNA complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g006">Figure 6E</xref>, lanes 6–8 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g006">Figure 6F</xref>, lanes 3–5), most likely due to a higher negative charge of the Pxd1-Dna2-Cdc24-DNA complex because the recombinant Pxd1(227–351) has a low PI of 5.09. As a control, the addition of Pxd1(227–351)-5A, which cannot efficiently interact with Dna2-Cdc24, had much weaker ability to shift the Dna2-Cdc24-DNA complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g006">Figure 6F</xref>, lanes 6–8). These results show that, consistent with the lack of effect of Pxd1 on the basal nuclease activity of Dna2, Pxd1 does not appear to affect the ability of Dna2-Cdc24 to bind naked DNA.</p>
<p>When RPA was added to the DNA binding reaction with Dna2-Cdc24, a Dna2-Cdc24-RPA-DNA complex that migrated slower than the Dna2-Cdc24-DNA complex and the RPA-DNA complex was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g006">Figure 6E</xref>, lanes 10–12). Addition of Pxd1(227–351) interfered with the formation of this higher-order complex and resulted in a form of DNA that appeared to be bound by only RPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g006">Figure 6E</xref>, lanes 14–16 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g006">Figure 6F</xref>, lanes 11–13), suggesting that Dna2-Cdc24 was dissociated from the RPA-DNA complex in the presence of Pxd1. In comparison, Pxd1(227–351)-5A was weaker in its ability to disrupt the higher-order complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g006">Figure 6F</xref>, lanes 14–16).

Because Pxd1 is down-regulated during the S phase of the cell cycle (our unpublished observation), we hypothesized that it may mainly regulate the resection function of Dna2. During resection, Dna2 is expected to act with Rqh1, a RecQ family helicase, in a pathway parallel to Exo1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001946-Zhu1">[5]</xref>; therefore, in an <italic>exo1Δ</italic> background, the residual resection activity should be Rqh1- and Dna2-dependent. Using a qPCR-based assay to monitor resection from an irreparable HO-induced DSB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g007">Figure 7A</xref>), we found that, as reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001946-Langerak1">[26]</xref>, the deletion of <italic>exo1</italic>, but not <italic>rqh1</italic>, strongly reduced long-range resection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). No obvious difference was found between <italic>pxd1Δ</italic> and the wild type. However, deletion of <italic>pxd1</italic> in <italic>exo1Δ</italic> partially rescued the resection defect. Thus, consistent with the results of Pxd1(227–351) overexpression and the in vitro nuclease assay, Pxd1 appears to attenuate the Dna2- and Rqh1-mediated resection activity, at least in the <italic>exo1Δ</italic> background. Supporting this idea, the deletion of <italic>pxd1</italic> did not rescue the DNA resection defect of <italic>rqh1Δ exo1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g007">Figure 7C</xref>).

<p>To determine which region of Pxd1 is involved in resection inhibition, we examined the effect of introducing truncated versions of Pxd1 into an <italic>exo1Δ pxd1Δ</italic> double mutant. The N-terminal–truncated and middle-region–deleted versions curtailed long-range DNA resection as strongly as the full-length Pxd1. In contrast, a C-terminally truncated version, Pxd1-<italic>Δ</italic> (302–348), which is defective in binding Dna2, failed to impede resection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). These results suggest that the interaction between Pxd1 and Dna2 is required for the inhibitory effect of Pxd1 on DNA resection. In addition, the C-terminal region of Pxd1 alone can inhibit DNA resection in the <italic>exo1Δ pxd1Δ</italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g007">Figure 7D</xref>).</p>

<title>Pxd1 Promotes the Use of a DSB-Proximal Homologous Sequence in SSA Repair</title>
<p>During the SSA repair process, DNA resection is required for rendering the homologous repeats single-stranded <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001946-FishmanLobell1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001946-Jain1">[18]</xref>. We hypothesized that the C-terminal region of Pxd1 may regulate the homologous partner choice during SSA repair when there are multiple homologous sequences on the same side of the DSB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001946-FishmanLobell1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001946-Sugawara1">[27]</xref>. To test this idea, we constructed an SSA competition system. In this system, one additional homologous sequence was inserted between the two repeats in the original SSA strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g007">Figure 7E</xref>). During SSA repair, the repeat sequence on the left side of the HO site can anneal with either potential homologous partner on the right side of the HO site. If partner1 is used, the postrepair cells will remain Leu<sup>+</sup>; however, if partner2 is used, cells will become Leu<sup>−</sup> and suffer a greater loss of genetic information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g007">Figure 7E</xref>). We found that the DSB-proximal homologous sequence, partner1, was more frequently used in <italic>exo1Δ</italic> than in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g007">Figure 7F</xref>), presumably because slower resection in <italic>exo1Δ</italic> cells reduces the chance of partner2 becoming single-stranded before a productive repair using partner1 has occurred. Removing the Dna2-inhibitory region of Pxd1 reversed the effect caused by <italic>exo1</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g007">Figure 7F</xref>), consistent with the rescue of the resection defect observed using the irreparable HO system. Interestingly, in an <italic>exo1<sup>+</sup></italic> background, the same Pxd1 truncation enhanced the use of the distal homologous sequence, partner2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g007">Figure 7F</xref>). These results suggest that Pxd1 restricts the use of break-distal homologous sequences during SSA repair to prevent excessive loss of genetic information.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we identified a novel fission yeast protein, Pxd1, which interacts with two structure-specific nucleases, Rad16-Swi10 and Dna2-Cdc24. Our data indicate that Pxd1 can activate the 3′ nuclease activity of Rad16-Swi10, but inhibit the RPA-mediated activation of the 5′ nuclease activity of Dna2-Cdc24. These two capacities of Pxd1 allow it to promote SSA and, at the same time, reduce the negative impact of SSA on genome integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g007">Figure 7G</xref>).</p>
<p>Unlike the situations in budding yeast, in fission yeast, neither <italic>saw1Δ</italic> nor <italic>slx4Δ</italic> has an observable SSA defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001946-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001946.s005">Figure S5D</xref>). Among the two functionally important features of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Saw1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001946-Li2">[11]</xref>, the R19 residue required for Rad1 binding is conserved in <italic>S. pombe</italic> Saw1, whereas the C-terminal positive amino acid stretch required for DNA binding is missing in <italic>S. pombe</italic> Saw1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001946.s007">Figure S7</xref>). We suspect that <italic>S. pombe</italic> Saw1 may have lost its SSA-related function or become redundant.</p>
<p>Compared with Slx4 proteins in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and metazoans, <italic>S. pombe</italic> Slx4 is much shorter and appears to have lost the region required for the interaction with XPF-ERCC1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001946-Fekairi1">[28]</xref>. On the other hand, the middle region of Pxd1 (residues 101–233), which mediates Rad16 binding, seems to possess sequence similarity to the XPF-binding region of metazoan Slx4 proteins, which has been referred to as the MLR (MEI9<sup>XPF</sup>-interaction-Like Region) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001946.s005">Figure S5E</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001946-Fekairi1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001946-Kim1">[30]</xref>. Thus, we speculate that during evolution, in the lineage leading to the fission yeast, the ancestor Slx4 protein may have split into two proteins, one becoming Pxd1 and the other evolving into the current-day <italic>S. pombe</italic> Slx4, which is solely involved in the regulation of the Slx1 nuclease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001946-Coulon1">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>In budding yeast, CDK1-mediated phosphorylation promotes the resection function of Dna2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001946-Chen1">[32]</xref>. Here we show that the resection activity of fission yeast Dna2 is subject to a negative regulation by Pxd1. Thus, Dna2 appears to be a regulatory target used in diverse organisms for controlling the resection process. Intriguingly, <italic>pxd1</italic> C-terminal truncation caused an overt phenotype in the SSA competition assay, but <italic>pxd1</italic> deletion did not alter resection in the irreparable HO system, suggesting the possibility that the resection process may be regulated differently depending on whether strand annealing with a homologous partner has occurred.</p>
<p>Highly repetitive DNA elements, such as retrotransposons in yeasts and Alu elements in humans, mediate chromosome rearrangements through homologous recombination pathways including SSA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001946-Elliott1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001946-Chan1">[35]</xref>. The results of our SSA competition assay suggest that fine-tuning the resection activities may be a strategy that evolution has exploited to ameliorate the deleterious consequences of repeat-mediated recombination.</p>
<p>Are there evolutionary advantages of using one protein to exert opposite controls on two nucleases? One possibility is that Pxd1 may serve as a hub to integrate regulatory signals so that the up-regulation of one nuclease and the down-regulation of the other can be more precisely coordinated. The expression level of Pxd1 appears to decrease in S phase (our unpublished observation), suggesting that cell cycle control of these two nucleases is imposed through Pxd1. Thus, the activity of Dna2 is relieved from inhibition during S phase when it is needed for DNA replication. On the other hand, given that the activation of Rad16 by Pxd1 is important for removing the 3′ nonhomologous ssDNA, the decrease of Pxd1 during S phase may curtail HR repair events involving nonhomologous ssDNA. Further analysis will be needed to assess to what extent such a regulation affects DNA repair pathway choices.</p>
