The scale and complexity of these networks, however, render their analysis using experimental biology approaches alone very challenging. As a result, computational methods have been developed and combined with experimental biology approaches, producing powerful tools for the analysis of these networks. These computational methods mostly fall on either end of a spectrum of model parameterization. On one end is a class of structural network analysis methods; these typically use the network connectivity alone to generate hypotheses about global properties. On the other end is a class of dynamic network analysis methods; these use, in addition to the connectivity, kinetic parameters of the biochemical reactions to predict the network's dynamic behavior. These predictions provide detailed insights into the properties that determine aspects of the network's structure and behavior. However, the difficulty of obtaining numerical values of kinetic parameters is widely recognized to limit the applicability of this latter class of methods.</p><p>Several researchers have observed that the connectivity of a network alone can provide significant insights into its dynamics. Motivated by this fundamental observation, we present the signaling Petri net, a non-parametric model of cellular signaling networks, and the signaling Petri net-based simulator, a Petri net execution strategy for characterizing the dynamics of signal flow through a signaling network using token distribution and sampling. The result is a very fast method, which can analyze large-scale networks, and provide insights into the trends of molecules' activity-levels in response to an external stimulus, based solely on the network's connectivity.</p><p>We have implemented the signaling Petri net-based simulator in the PathwayOracle toolkit, which is publicly available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinfo.cs.rice.edu/pathwayoracle" xlink:type="simple">http://bioinfo.cs.rice.edu/pathwayoracle</ext-link>. Using this method, we studied a MAPK1,2 and AKT signaling network downstream from EGFR in two breast tumor cell lines. We analyzed, both experimentally and computationally, the activity level of several molecules in response to a targeted manipulation of TSC2 and mTOR-Raptor. The results from our method agreed with experimental results in greater than 90% of the cases considered, and in those where they did not agree, our approach provided valuable insights into discrepancies between known network connectivities and experimental observations.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Many cellular behaviors including growth, differentiation, and movement are influenced by external stimuli. Such external stimuli are obtained, processed, and carried to the nucleus by the signaling network—a dense network of cellular biochemical reactions. Beyond being interesting for their role in directing cellular behavior, deleterious changes in a cell's signaling network can alter a cell's responses to external stimuli, giving rise to devastating diseases such as cancer. As a result, building accurate mathematical and computational models of cellular signaling networks is a major endeavor in biology. The scale and complexity of these networks render them difficult to analyze by experimental techniques alone, which has led to the development of computational analysis methods. In this paper, we present a novel computational simulation technique that can provide qualitatively accurate predictions of the behavior of a cellular signaling network without requiring detailed knowledge of the signaling network's parameters. Our approach makes use of recent discoveries that network structure alone can determine many aspects of a network's dynamics. When compared against experimental results, our method correctly predicted 90% of the cases considered. In those where it did not agree, our approach provided valuable insights into discrepancies between known network structure and experimental observations.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>DR and LN were supported in part by a Seed Grant awarded to LN from the Gulf Coast Center for Computational Cancer Research, funded by John and Ann Doerr Fund for Computational Biomedicine.

These signaling networks underlie how cells communicate with one another, and how they make decisions about their phenotypic changes, such as division, differentiation, and death. Further, malfunction of these networks may alter phenotypic changes that cells are supposed to undergo under normal conditions, and potentially lead to devastating consequences on the organism.

However, unlike the “pathway view” of signaling as linear cascades, signaling networks are highly interconnected, involve cross-talk among several pathways, and contain feedback and feed-forward loops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Maayan1">[5]</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000005-g001">Figure 1</xref> illustrates this issue in a network of signaling cascades, which is stimulated by EGF and contains several players in cancer pathways. For example, multiple paths lead from EGFR to mTOR-Raptor, resulting in feed-forward loops. Some of these paths activate mTOR-Raptor, while others inhibit it. Further, the network contains two feedback loops, one from p70S6K to EGFR and another from MAPK1,2 to EGFR.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000005-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000005.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The Model Signaling Network.</title><p>A MAPK1,2 and AKT network downstream from EGFR, which we assembled from various sources, and used for the case study analysis in this work.

As a result, computational methods have been developed and combined with experimental biology approaches, producing powerful tools for the analysis of these networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Papin1">[6]</xref>. These computational methods produce hypotheses that guide the experimental design, leading to more informative experiments, while experimental results help refine the computational models, resulting in more accurate predictive tools.</p><p>In a recent survey, Papin et al. classified existing computational methods into two categories: <italic>structural</italic> and <italic>dynamic</italic> network analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Papin1">[6]</xref>. Structural network analysis is mainly based on the network's connectivity, which is typically readily available from numerous public signaling network databases (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-The1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Thomas1">[9]</xref>), and makes inferences about global network properties as well as individual protein functions. This category can be further refined into two sub-categories, both of which are solely based on connectivity information, yet differ in the type of answers they provide. For example, the methods described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Dasika1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Schaub1">[13]</xref> infer “static” properties of the network, such as numbers of paths, reachability results, etc. In a series of papers, Palsson and co-workers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Papin1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Papin2">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Schilling1">[16]</xref> introduced extreme pathway analysis techniques, which are more appropriate for metabolic networks, yet have been applied to signaling networks to characterize various properties of networks, such as redundancy and cross-talk. Similar analyses have also been formalized and conducted using the principles of S- and T-invariants in Petri Nets (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Chaouiya1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Steggles1">[20]</xref>).</p><p>Methods for dynamic network analysis use, in addition to the network connectivity, the kinetic parameters of the biochemical reactions. The goal of these methods is to model the actual kinetics of the network and obtain through simulation the actual quantities of proteins involved in signal transduction. One of the most widely used techniques in this category is systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Bhalla1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Ferrell1">[25]</xref>). Within such a system, each reaction is modeled by a series of equations connecting reactant concentrations to product concentrations through differential relationships involving reaction rate constants. Given the difficulty of obtaining the numerical values of kinetic parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Sackmann1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Bailey1">[26]</xref> and standardization of the parameters and models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Novere1">[27]</xref>, the applicability of these methods is limited in practice to small-scale networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Papin1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Arisi1">[28]</xref>.</p><p>Petri Nets have also been used for simulating the dynamics of signaling networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Doi1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Matsuno1">[31]</xref>. While such approaches somewhat relax the necessity for biologically exact kinetic parameters, current Petri Net-based approaches still require the selection of weights and/or probability distributions for individual interactions in the model. As a result, selecting the values for Petri Net parameters presents challenges similar to those encountered in ODE modeling.</p><p>Structural network analysis assumes mainly connectivity information about the model, and provides insights into global, static properties of the network. Dynamic analysis in general assumes numerical values of the kinetic parameters, and provides predictions of network dynamics by quantifying the change in concentration and activity-level (the concentration of the active form of a given protein) of the individual proteins and complexes in the network. To obtain a more detailed analysis one must either solve parameter optimization problems for a large number of molecules and interactions or conversely experimentally derive these values.</p><p>Given the difficulty of obtaining numerical values of kinetic parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Sackmann1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Bailey1">[26]</xref> and the implications this has on the applicability of dynamic analysis methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Papin1">[6]</xref>, it is imperative to develop innovative approaches that combine the attractive low requirements of structural network analysis techniques with the detailed answers provided by dynamic analysis techniques—specifically the response of individual proteins to signals which travel through the network.</p><p>Several recent efforts in this direction have produced encouraging results. An approach using a boolean network simulation method, based on work in the area of gene regulatory networks, successfully used only signaling network connectivity information to predict the speed of signal transduction through a stomata signaling network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Li2">[32]</xref>. The use of piecewise linear systems of ODEs have also had success in analyzing some of the dynamics of gene regulatory and signaling networks without using exact kinetic parameters (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Glass1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Muller1">[35]</xref>). The obstacle to extending the method in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Li2">[32]</xref> to model individual protein responses to signal transduction is the boolean model used to discretize the signal as it propagates. In a boolean model, the signal is either present or absent at each node in the network. Such two-state models of signal transduction simplify the underlying biochemistry to the point where it is difficult to model changes in protein concentration more precisely than present or absent. Modeling such gradients of concentration changes and the effects of those changes may be important to predicting individual protein responses, motivating our effort to devise more fine-grained ways to model and simulate the dynamics of signaling networks. The challenges to using linear-piecewise ODEs to model a signaling network center around the issue of identifying all the ODEs required to model the underlying network as well as scalability issues involved in simulating large systems of ODEs.</p><p>In this paper, we extend the synchronized Petri net model and firing policy such that the resulting framework models cellular signaling processes. We call this extension the signaling Petri net (SPN). By coupling this with a novel strategy for Petri net execution and sampling, we obtain a method capable of characterizing some dynamics of signaling networks while using only connectivity information about these networks.</p><p>To validate our method, we studied the MAPK1,2 and AKT network shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000005-g001">Figure 1</xref> in two breast cancer cell lines. This network was chosen because the EGFR receptor and its downstream signaling network play a very important role in development, differentiation, and oncogenic transformation. Two very important signaling molecules within the cell are MAPK and AKT, both of which can be activated by EGFR, and contains several potential regulatory paths between them. We constructed a model network of EGF regulation of MAPK and AKT which includes several feedback and feed-forward loops all of which were constructed based on experimental findings from different laboratories around the world <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Avruch1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-OReilly1">[43]</xref>. We analyzed, both experimentally and computationally, the change in activity-level of several proteins in response to targeted manipulation of TSC2 and mTOR-Raptor. Using the model network, the predictions from our method agreed with experimental results in over 90% of the cases, and in those where they did not agree, our method correctly identified discrepancies that could be traced back to incompleteness in the network connectivity model.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Our approach combines elements of the boolean network simulator in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Li1">[18]</xref> with a synchronized Petri net model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-David1">[44]</xref>. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Li1">[18]</xref>, Li et al. present a non-parametric approach that accurately predicts the speed of signal propagation through a network. However, as their method assumes a binary model of activation—every protein is either active (<italic>true</italic>) or inactive (<italic>false</italic>)—modeling a range of activity-levels is difficult. Petri nets, while able to model concentrations using tokens, require parameters describing the kinetic characteristics of the network, which are typically difficult to obtain.</p><p>Our method models signal flow as the pattern of token accumulation and dissipation within places (proteins) over time in the Petri net. Transitions in the network represent directed protein interactions; each transition models the effect of a source protein on a target protein. Through transition firings, the source can influence the number of tokens assigned to the target, called the <italic>token-count</italic>, modeling the way that signals propagate through protein interactions in cellular signaling networks.</p><p>In order to overcome the issue of modeling reaction rates in the network, signaling dynamics are simulated by executing the signaling Petri net (SPN) for a set number of steps (called a <italic>run</italic>) multiple times, each time beginning at the same initial marking. For each run, the individual signaling rates are simulated via generation of random orders of transition firings (interaction occurrences). When the results of a large enough number of runs are averaged together, we find that the series of token-counts correlate with experimentally measured changes in the activity-levels of individual proteins in the underlying signaling network. In essence, the tokenized activity-levels computed by our method should be taken as abstract quantities whose changes over time correlate to changes that occur in the amounts of active proteins present in the cell. It is worth noting that some of the most widely used experimental techniques for protein quantification—western blots and microarrays—also yield results that are treated as indications, but not exact measurements, of protein activity-levels within the cell. Thus in some respects, the predictions returned by our SPN-based simulator can be interpreted like the results of a western blot or microarray experiment looking at changes relative to “control”.</p><p>The key insight behind our approach is the assumption that, while all network parameters determine the actual signal propagation to some extent, the network connectivity is the most significant single determinant. While this is clearly a gross simplification, several researchers have observed that the connectivity of a biological network dictates, to a great extent, the network's dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Li1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Aldana1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Klemm1">[47]</xref>. Some have conjectured that biological network connectivities have evolved to have a stabilizing effect on the overall network behavior, making the network more resilient to local fluctuations in other network parameters such as reaction rates and protein binding affinities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Aldana1">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Klemm1">[47]</xref>. Here we present the <italic>signaling Petri net</italic> (SPN) model and the signaling Petri net-based simulator whose designs collectively utilize this assumption and couple it with a Petri net tokenization scheme that quantifies the changes in protein activity-levels that occur as signals propagate through the network.

However, connectivity-level knowledge of the network does not provide this information for each interaction. In the absence of these details, we use one token-passing policy for all interactions in the network. We implemented and tested both the consuming and conserving policies and found that token conservation provides significantly more accurate results when compared to experimentally derived data.

In synchronized Petri nets, the environment controls the generation of events. Thus, the signaling network event generator is responsible for controlling the timing and ordering of signaling events. However, as our objective is a non-parametric simulation method, our approach must either estimate these parameters or operate without explicit knowledge of them.</p><p>Estimating reaction rates using only connectivity is currently beyond the predictive or inferential capabilities of computers. While there has been some work in the area of predicting reaction rates, all results of which we are aware require knowledge about the mechanism of signaling (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Blinov1">[56]</xref>). As a result, without enriching the SPN model, it is doubtful that rate parameters can be accurately estimated.</p><p>For this reason, the signaling network event generator operates without explicit knowledge of the rate parameters. To compensate for this “missing” knowledge, we make use of an observation of signaling networks discussed earlier: a network's connectivity determines its dynamics. Several studies have found that the connectivity of biochemical networks desensitizes them to small fluctuations in the kinetic biochemical parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Aldana1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Klemm1">[47]</xref>. Understood within the context of evolution – a stochastic process that tweaks signaling network parameters across generations – this is a highly desirable property as it ensures that an offspring remains viable despite fluctuations in the exact tuning of its cellular machinery. If this property holds, then small fluctuations in the rate parameters should have a marginal effect on the overall propagation of signal through the network. We can consider these small effects to be noise obscuring the underlying dynamics of the network connectivity. By taking many samples of the network dynamics under a variety of reaction rate assignments and then averaging these dynamics, we simultaneously reduce the noise introduced by any one rate assignment and strengthen the underlying dynamic characteristics of the network's connectivity.</p><p>However, since reaction rate constants can vary by several orders of magnitude—from 10<sup>−10</sup> to 10<sup>3</sup>, the task of correctly selecting parameters <italic>close</italic> to the true parameters is non-trivial. In fact, without having some estimate of the actual rate parameters, it is unclear as to how to measure closeness at all. Clearly, these are among the issues that make parameter estimation so difficult for ODE and Petri net approaches. Since our comparisons will be relative and not absolute, we take a relative approach to modeling rate parameters. The space of possible rate values is <italic>the space of possible signaling event orderings</italic>.</p><p>This idea is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000005-g003">Figure 3A</xref>. Protein A affects the activity of protein D through two separate pathways. Assuming that A is active to begin with, the relative speed of these two pathways determines the final activity of D. If the pathway through C is faster than the pathway BΠD, then D will be active. However, if the pathway speeds are reversed, then D will remain inactive. The overall outcome of this network can be represented without any use of numeric reaction rates by representing the reaction rates as an ordering over all the edges in the network. We can extend this idea to the SPN by observing that there exists a unique event for each signaling edge in the signaling network.</p><p>This sampling strategy is the motivation for the dual-time framework depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000005-g003">Figure 3B</xref> and implemented by the signaling network event generator shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000005-g006">Figure 6</xref>. <italic>Time blocks</italic> are the larger time intervals during which every signaling event occurs exactly once.

While this strict sequentiality of firing models relative reaction rates, it also discretizes the effect of signaling events. Though this is consistent with the definition of transition firing in discrete time Petri nets (only one transition is evaluated at a given point in time) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-David1">[44]</xref>, in biological signaling networks there is no such serial evaluation constraint.

As the SPN provides no explicit information on how this marking should be built, we propose three ways to construct the initial state: zero, basal, or experimentally derived. In a zero initial state, the simulator initializes all proteins to have zero tokens. The basal initial state is a random distribution of activation levels intended to model the cell when no impulses due directly to external stimuli are propagating through the signaling network. Though a basal network is considered at rest, in general it will not have a zero marking since signal flows are known to occur even in unstimulated signaling networks through autocrine and paracrine secretions by the cells. The experimentally derived initial state is based on knowledge about the activity levels of various proteins just prior to the addition of the external stimuli.</p><p>When accurate experimental data is available such as results from microarrays or western blots, the experimentally derived initial state may be the most accurate. A challenge in using experimental data, however, is determining how best to assign numbers of tokens based on the experimentally observed activity levels.</p><p>In the absence of reliable experimental data, the basal initial state seems more accurate than the zero initial state. However, it presents the challenge of properly selecting the basal activity-levels to assign to each protein in the model network. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Li1">[18]</xref>, a basal initial state was constructed by activating a small number of randomly selected proteins in the signaling network. However, the work in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Li1">[18]</xref> was done using a boolean model. Translating this approach into a tokenized model creates the additional complexity of determining how many tokens each basally active protein should receive. The correct values are likely to depend on the specific signaling network and experimental conditions.</p><p>We performed preliminary tests to compare the effect of using different basal versus zero markings on the outcome of the simulator. We found that the basal and zero states produced indistinguishable predictions so long as less than 30% of the proteins were activated and a small number of tokens (&lt;5) were used when constructing the basal marking. This is not as surprising as it may seem at first. Inhibitory edges will quickly consume a small number of tokens scattered throughout the network, effectively returning much of the network to the zero state before a stimulation event can propagate through.</p><p>Furthermore, while validating our method, we also compared the predictions produced by SPNs based on a zero initial state and experimentally derived initial state. These, too, did not produce noticeably different final results for similar reasons as discussed above. Details of these comparisons will be discussed further in the Results and Discussion sections.</p><p>However, since all three initial state construction strategies yield qualitatively identical predictions, using zero initial states has the advantage of invoking the fewest unnecessary assumptions about the network (as in the case of the basal initial state) and requiring the least experimental data (as in the case of the experimentally derived state). Nonetheless, in our implementation of the tool, we allow for using any one of these three initial state construction strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Modeling Cell-Specific Signaling Networks</title><p>Whereas consensus signaling networks typically represent the connectivity in normal cells, many experiments are conducted on abnormal cells in which oncogenic mutations, gene knockouts, and pharmacological inhibitors have altered the behavior of various signaling nodes in the network. In an SPN, these alterations to the signaling network can be modeled by adding/removing transitions (and associated input/output arcs) and explicitly setting the token count for various proteins in the initial state.</p><p>The two network alterations which are commonly induced by oncogenic mutations, gene knockouts, or pharmacological inhibitors are constitutively high or low protein activity-levels, meaning that a protein is either unable to be inhibited or unable to be activated. The simulator allows for proteins to be specified as either fixed <italic>High</italic> or <italic>Low</italic>. Here we explain how these are modeled by changes to the SPN.</p><p>If protein u is fixed high, then this protein cannot be inhibited. Thus, all transitions that remove tokens from p<sub>u</sub> are removed from the SPN. The fact that u is high, however, also suggests that it maintains a higher activity level in general. Therefore, in the initial state, <bold>m</bold><sub>0</sub>(<italic>p<sub>u</sub></italic>) = <italic>H</italic>, where H is a non-zero number of tokens. Since all inhibiting transitions have been removed from the SPN, throughout any execution, place p<sub>u</sub> will always have at least H tokens.</p><p>In experiments, we have observed that the choice of the value of H does not change the relative outcome of the simulations. While H will affect the actual number of tokens present in a given place as well as the number of time blocks required to observe certain activity-level changes, the relative changes in activity-level (number of tokens) among different proteins (places) does not change. As a result, one is free to select any reasonable value of H (for our experiments, we used H = 10) as long as this H is held constant across all simulations whose results will be compared.</p><p>If protein u is fixed low, then this protein cannot be activated.

As a result, a common practice is to only consider those substantial changes that are well beyond the background noise level. Our interpretation of the small predicted change in MAPK as <italic>no change</italic> reflects the fact that such small changes would not be detectable in microarray or western blot results.

It is true that our simulation method produces precisely quantified increases or decreases which can be taken to indicate degrees of change in response to perturbations.

Most of the information sources <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-Avruch1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000005-OReilly1">[43]</xref> established the <italic>existence</italic> of various pathways and provided few or no biochemical or kinetic details. As a result, the literature we used would have provided little assistance is building a parameterized Petri net or ODE model. Due to the proliferation of curated signaling network repositories and searchable literature archives, connectivity information is relatively abundant which makes the ad hoc assembly of networks a relatively straightforward endeavor. This further underscores the advantage of using our method over ODEs or parameterized Petri nets to quickly model and characterize some of the dynamics of a signaling network.</p><p>For simulations that will be compared to experimental results, the time parameter must be selected carefully. The time parameter, B, indicates how many time blocks our method will simulate. The time block is an abstract unit of time. Therefore, before comparing experimental results and predictions, it is necessary to determine how many seconds, minutes, or hours correspond to a time block. This can be done by comparing a prediction of the simulator with the experimentally measured activity-level of one or two proteins at several time points in order to determine what time blocks correspond to the different sampled time points. In the present study, we calibrated our time blocks only once for two cell lines and six experimental conditions (two cell lines, with/without TSC2, with/without mTOR-Raptor). To select the time parameter we used the experimentally measured activity changes in two proteins at two time points. In contrast to other predictive dynamic analysis tools which require multiple time points and multiple protein samples in order to calibrate simulation and model parameters, our method has relatively low time and resource investment.</p><p>Besides the time parameter, the other component of our simulations which involved experimentally obtained knowledge was the initial states. The experimentally derived initial states require that some experimental data be available providing information on the initial concentrations of individual signaling proteins in the network prior to stimulation. However, in the network that we considered here, the overall behavior of the network and of individual signaling proteins was resilient to changes in the initial states used. Zero and experimentally derived both produced the same overall change predictions. Thus, while experimentally derived initial states may be important for the simulation of some networks, it may well be the case that many networks (such as the one we considered in this paper) can be simulated without this knowledge—further reducing the experimental work that must be done prior to simulation.</p><p>The fact that our simulator produced accurate predictions for a variety of experimental conditions using the one core network model and set of simulation parameters also distinguishes our method from other predictive approaches. The only aspects of the model that were modified during the simulations were activity-levels reflecting the immediate effects of either the underlying tumor mutations (Ras and PTEN) or the perturbations (mTOR-Raptor and TSC2 targeted manipulation). In contrast, the accuracy of ODEs and Petri nets predictions are known to be sensitive to small changes to the model. For comparative studies such as the one conducted in this paper, an ODE or parameterized Petri net model might need to be re-constructed with different parameters for each experimental condition of interest. As a result, while it is possible to obtain our simulation results using these models, it remains beyond the capabilities of any existing ODE or parameterized Petri net system to provide insights into the effects of experimental conditions on the dynamic behavior of a signaling network with so little initial time and resource investment.</p><p>Though our method's predictions will not be as accurate as the results returned by a correctly parameterized ODE, biologists using our method can derive information about a network's dynamic behavior without having to conduct extensive experimentation and computationally expensive parameter estimation. This novel capability offers scientists the exciting prospect of being able to test hypotheses regarding signal propagation in silico. As a result, by using our method researchers can evaluate a wide array of network responses in order to determine the most promising experiments before even entering the laboratory.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We gratefully acknowledge the three anonymous reviewers, whose comments and feedback improved the manuscript
